0,"Great hotel, great location.",40,April 2023,"Spent a week here after 4 days in the country. Great hotel, check in was really quick. Very very spacious reception and a nice cool drink on arrival. We were given a room on the ground floor but I asked if we could have one on the first floor and they sorted this out immediately. The room was lovely, very clean and the bathroom was great, nice size and quite modern. Only thing is don’t rely on the hairdryer that they provide, not powerful at all. I had bad hair for the whole week but wasn’t bothered in the slightest.
The outside corridor going to our room was in need of a kick of paint. Breakfast was ok, choice of Balinese and English. Bacon was probably the worst we have ever had on holiday. Rooms were cleaned regularly.
The pool area was kept clean and staff tidied up constantly. There was quite a lot of adults drinking at the pool bar, but the pool is quite big so it wasn’t a problem.
The bar area is very poor, we didn’t see it open in the whole week we were there. It was very small with a few tables and chairs but not open.
We had a treatment in the spa which was average and overpriced, you can get a better deal in the many spas in the local area. You can however use the spa on your last day to have a shower etc..
The hotel is perfectly located and backs onto (almost) the beach. The beach is perfect during the day and the night is brilliant, great beach bars with plenty of multicoloured bean bags to relax in.
Would definitely recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1,"Pelangi Hotel Bali, Seminyak",40,March 2023,"We stayed in Pelangi Bali, Seminyak for a week and the stay was really comfortable. The staff were really friendly and service was really good. The place was clean and breakfast options were good too! In room dining options could have been better with more options. The room was comfy enough and maintained well. Overall, a good place to stay either as an individual or for a family for a short vacation as it's just very close to the beach and not pricy!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
2,fantastis,50,January 2023,"Awesome - right on the beach, great pool great food and close to all the restuarants
Within walking distance of the Bintang supermarket and walkable to Legian .The rooms are great and the staff super friendly . We will be back :):)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
3,Nice stay,40,March 2023,"The hotel looks very good and well-kept, very well located at just 1 minute from the beach. The rooms are spacious and clean, and the staff is very nice and kind. Varied breakfast and tasty food.
Overall, the quality-price ratio is very good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
4,Amazing hotel,50,March 2023,"Great family friendly hotel with amazing staff. 2 good pools. Kids pool was shallow enough for 2 yr old to stand which was good. Both pools connect to swim up bar also.

Breakfast was good. Good selection of Indonesian, western and continental. No limit to how much you can eat.

Right on the beach and located to a vast amount of bars and restaurants.

Only negative is the room would fill with mosquitos daily. The hotel do provide some deterrent but reccomend buying some spray to kill them on site. Otherwise you will be chasing them round the name like I was.

5,"Nice, comfortable experience.",40,January 2023,"Comfortable, clean, prompt. Conveniently placed for Seminyak top class eating joints, or shopping - 3.5 km by free hotel bus (@3pm everyday - pls pre book) to Seminyak Central or Kuta Market. Close to Agung Bali and Krisna Mall too for reasonable shopping.
Some friends enjoyed the clean and hygienic, very good spa and massage services.
Just outside the rear premises of hotel is a lovely beach, lots of shacks selling all kinds of cuisine. Wonderful place to relax, get a foot massage, or just chill! A little noisy tho. Some shacks have live music too!
Food not that great at this hotel. But, with so many eating joints walking distance from the hotel……food is not an issue. Breakfast was average.
Overall, happy with the hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
6,Decent stay in a great location,40,December 2022,"Decent hotel in a fantastic location. Rooms are spotless, bed incredibly comfortable and the best shower I've ever had in my life. Great pool, sunbathing areas with an awesome sea and sunset view. Not so great breakfast buffet but adequate for the price, spa not really functional at time of stay (currently only offering massages, no sauna or jacuzzi).

Special thanks to Wiwik (front desk), Krishna (restaurant) and Andy (room attendant).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
7,DEPRESSING AND THE RECEPTION VERY HARD RULES VERY HARD. LOST KEY THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU CAN IMAGINE.,20,December 2022,Too old hotel. Walking to the room the passage is terrible and the room are very depressing THE HOTEL RULES VERY HARD. DAUGHTER NOT WELL AND THEY ONLY GIVE ONE HOUR EXTENSION . We book ten room Better hotel like courtyard marriots just in the right place Harris hotel beautiful make you feel fresh. This hotel make you feel very depressing. Very quiet no people around the lobby,Pelangi Bali Hotel
8,We love Pelangi,40,November 2022,We love the position of the Pelangi hotel. It's right in the middle of everything and only steps to the beach. The breakfast is always good and plentiful. Staff are all friendly and the pool is beautiful. Very good shower since renovation. We would prefer bedside lamps to very bright spotlights in the ceiling. The downstairs room smelled of mould.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
9,Bali Family Fun,50,October 2022,"Would recommend this hotel. Spent 7 nights with adult children and grandchildren. Total group of 9. Staff were helpful and friendly, room was cleaned spotlessy every day. Loved it's location with beach outside plus restaurants and shops nearby. It's not a new hotel in fact it celebrated 21 years anniversary while we were there but it was lovely and we all had a wonderful time. Thank you Pelangi Hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
10,Returned after a long absence. Still an amazing resort.,50,October 2022,"First time back to Bali in ages and several years since staying at the Pelangi.
Not disapointed again. Friendly staff, nice rooms and an easy going feeling.
It is a great central location as border of semyniak and Legian so shops, food, bars, beaches are all in easy reach.
Used the Hotel money changer as rate was same or slightly better than in the main street.

Booked a package and got a v ery nice romantic dinner along with a terrific massage on site.

Due to an error by me in AU, I booked an extra night in the big suite and WOW, it is huge! It is there most expensive option but wanted more than the one night there (as also had a very early plane out) However, our first few nights in the standard accomodation was also great.

Pool bar is always good to meet fellow travelers and breakfast was also relly nice.

It ticks so many boxes for ease, location and food/drink.

WIll be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
11,"Holiday in Paradise with everything you want, with shopping and eateries within walking distance. Lovely experience",50,October 2022,"Very nice rooms, the staff were great, easy to get along with and very friendly and helpful. The location was fabulous, with a lovely pool and right across the road to the beach. Plenty of variety for breakfast and a good menu for lunch and dinner. Would recommend. 👌😎",Pelangi Bali Hotel
12,Great hospitality,50,October 2022,"One word to sum up my experience in Pelangi Bali hotel-Seminyak: hospitable.

This four-star hotel has its own beach that simply satisfies one’s eyes with sunset view stretching along Seminyak beach.

Also this hotel is nicely located in Seminyak with adjacent various restaurants, cafes and stores.

The superior room is quite comfy with 2 large twin-sized beds
The swimming pool is near Rama restaurant and that gives advantage if one wants to directly dive into the pool after breakfast. 😃

I really enjoyed my stay @ Pelangi hotel, Seminyak Bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
13,Terrible - They Don’t listen to Guests at all,10,September 2022,"I have travelled to 32 countries in my life and out of all of the places I have stayed, this has to be one of the worst handled hotels. I would highly recommend not staying at the Pelangi Bali Hotel In Seminyak.

Check in was smooth and lovely, room was quant and nice, however that was not the issue.

The issue is that I am currently on Holiday, and also working whilst on my trip. For the past two days, I have been staying at the Hotel by the pool, trying to get work and other issues that need my attention, done.

The Government has roadworks 20 Metres outside the pool area being constructed. The sound of steel and works is terrible, and I cannot focus at all or conduct any work or in other times, relaxation. I approached the manger, and she said that it was ‘not their fault’ and that they could not compensate me at all; free refreshments, upgraded room - nothing. I spoke with her for a great deal of time, and she sort no attempt to provide me with any help for my situation - instead, she insinuated that it was my fault and the ‘luck of the draw’.

Whilst I would happily conduct my work and relaxation from my room, the wifi is poor and unable to connect - with the only connection that is stable near the pool where construction is, or the hotel lobby. Neither these places are appropriate, as my employment is in regards to confidential information. In addition, I can also hear the noise of the construction from my room.

I would not recommend this hotel to anybody looking to relax, as the hotel goes against its word of providing a relaxing environment that comforts its guests.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
14,Need to Stay Here for Longer Next Time,50,August 2022,"I stayed here for 1 night (Friday) as a solo traveler before I left for the airport the next day (Saturday), and I wish I could have spent more time here. The entrance is so grand, it looks like a palace. In true fashion, the Bali hospitality was exceptional, and check-in was informative and fast. The hotel is really long, it’s quite funny. Everything leads into the courtyard which leads to the pool & restaurant at the end of the long hotel that’s right near the beach. Food was great - I ordered room service & also thought the breakfast buffet was varied. You can eat at the pool bar too, and the pool is oddly shaped but nice & large, and gets a bit deeper towards the end. The restaurant has plenty of space, there’s lots of places to lounge around the poo. I wish I could have tried the spa! Next time. They have half day & day rates available if your flight leaves @ night, like mine did. To extend my checkout to 6pm from the night prior would have cost around 900k IDR (~$61 USD). This is great for travelers with late flights, though! The neighborhood is quiet & clean which was a nice surprise, but lots of shopping, and lots of beach access. I will be back for a longer stay when I don’t want to stay in Canggu! ;)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
15,Nice hotel in good location,30,August 2022,"I did like Pelangi Hotel, as we got it for a very good price, but there are some things to be aware of. The staff are amazing, very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very basic but fairly clean and comfy. Felt a little dark and dreary with little natural light. The rooms and hotel are a little dated and could use some maintenance. Could hear noise from adjoining rooms. Breakfast was fairly standard fare, but was tasty and filled us up. Pool was lovely and was nice having a swim up bar. There were plenty of chairs and lounges, but a little further away from the pool overlooking the beach. Location was very good, nice and close to all the beach beanbag/umbrella restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
16,"A great, welcoming hotel",50,August 2022,"This is a great hotel. I was made to feel very comfortable here. The staff are friendly, the room was large and clean, and the pool is stunning - with a great poolbar and long cocktail list. It backs directly into Seminyak beach.

Would definitely recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
17,Great Stay!,50,July 2022,I loved my stay at Pelangi. I would recommend it to others and stay again. The rooms are great and the pool/beachside area is excellent. The only two things to keep in mind - you’re at least a 20 min walk from the main town (we had to get taxis back and forth) AND the breakfast does not have many options for vegetarians (it’s quite a basic hotel breakfast).,Pelangi Bali Hotel
18,Beach Location,40,June 2022,"Older style hotel but very clean, great friendly staff, great beach location with plenty of bars and Restaurants on the beach, mini mart out the front and money exchange right on beach entrance. Rooms are great with walk in showers no bath, beds are very comfortable and A/c works well, unfortunately no verandahs for ground floor rooms. Breakfast needs more options there is a egg station but other choices are generally last nights left overs, bacon, cereal, fruit and toast. Plenty of restaurants and shopping close by, if you can get this Hotel for around $70pn its good value. All in all a great stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
19,Great spot,50,June 2022,"We stayed with 4 couples and our toddler end of May for 9 nights. We’ve stayed before so knew what to expect. The rooms were clean, bathrooms seemed to be renovated and the A/C was lovely. We picked this place because of the location - it’s on the beach, close to all the afternoon/evening entertainment on the beach and walking distance to anything although we did get the hotel to call us cabs if we went too far with the toddler/pram.
The breakfast was fine but we did go out to the beach bars to try something different and the swim up bar got a work out.
The value for money here is just perfect for a family holiday and we loved our stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
20,"Basic all round, average cleanliness, average service, read more below",30,May 2022,"I stayed here with 4 other friends, all with seperate rooms, for 4 nights. The hotel is in a pretty good location, right on the beach and easy walking distance to the beach bars, and up into Kuta if you want a decent walk.

The hotel itself is pretty basic and average all round. Breakfast was included in our room rate, but its nothing special, but fills the stomach. Don't expect over the top, but there is an eggs station which can get busy, some beans, toast, water, juice. Not bad if its included within your room, but i wouldn't pay extra for it.

The pool is alright, the layout of the pool is a little weird, but the pool bar is open daily, so thats a plus. There aren't too many sun beds kicking around the actual pool, but there are some facing the beach, although the water and sand down at the beach is dirty and needs a good clean.

The rooms are OK! Comfortable, and the aircon worked in my room. My friends had issues with their aircon and safes and the staff didn't fix the issue for them even asking several times to assist. One of my friends went without aircon and safe for his entire stay as staff just couldn't seem to work the issues out or were not interested in sorting it out, language barrier maybe?!

The shower was hit and miss, sometimes you'd get hot water, othertimes you'd have to wait for about 10mins with the water running for it to get slightly warm. During peak shower times, maybe around 8am when people are waking and showering the pressure can be low, rather annoying.

Every morning around 7:30/8ish you would hear the houes keeping trolley roaming around the hallways with its noisy wheels, so dont expect a sleep in! when moving furniture in nearby rooms this would also wake you up, or curtains which dont block out the sunshing in the mornings.

Overall if you can get this for under $50 AUD per night, maybe closer to 30/40 then its a bargain, but don't expect top notch service or food.

Thanks for the stay, my aircon worked, safe worked, and the room was fine for me.

2.5 stars for me, but 3 stars will do. Not sure i would stay here again unless it was $20/30 AUD a night, plenty of other places in bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
21,Theft of property by staff,10,February 2022,"I stayed for 4 nights and then moved close by to a villa. Once we arrived in the villa it was apparent that we had left behind an electronic equipment. I used it in my room at Pelangi and we don't have it in the villa.

I went back to the hotel two days after checking out and inspected my room (not occupied since we left), they checked lost property and with housekeeping. But did not have it

100% one of the housekeeping staff have kept this for themselves.

I sent an email asking for the General Managers contact details, but was not given any response.

I know times are tough in Bali at the moment - but theft is what it is, and the management culture that allowed it is wrong.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
22,Hotel closed for 1 month,10,June 2021,"Having 2 bookings for June..l was informed of closure for 1 month..l was then asked to pay much higher price to rebook on reopening.It would seem it is the best way to get extra payment from guests
Agoda not helping..nor is hotel
Ive asked for bookings to be honored at same price upon reopening...lm still waiting for replies from Hotel and Agoda
Not how Guests should be treated",Pelangi Bali Hotel
23,Lovely Hotel right on Double Six Beach,40,August 2019,"Clean, Friendly hotel right on the beach! Great location for lots of bar and restaurant options. Great selection of alcohol at the pool bar.

I can not fault the room, they are so clean and tidy and the staff are extremely friendly. Breakfast is incredible.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
24,loved our stay,50,October 2019,"had a lovely stay here at the Pelangi. We had 2 rooms that were joined, and the bedrooms were lovely. every thing that we needed for our stay was available. Breakfast was great, in fact probably the best we had in our 2 weeks holiday. Had room service a few times and ate dinner at the restraunt. Kids had a great time in the pool and we loved the swim up bar. Beach access was easy and the sunset is amazing.

My 2 girls loved there Pelangi bear that was left on the bed for them and still keep it on there beds at home now.

Also enjoyed a lovely spa treatment, and would love to come back again in our next visit",Pelangi Bali Hotel
25,Perfect!,40,October 2019,"Great location. Felt very safe in the area and it was easy to navigate being on the beach front. Lovely staff, restaurant and the spa were both great too! Room was clean affordable and perfect for our stay. Would visit again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
26,Amazing Stay,50,March 2020,"This hotel is in the best location.
In between Seminyak and Legian, right on the beach.
Funky Bars on the beach right out the front for sunset and great restaurants close by.
The resort itself a little dated but has a great pool area with a swim up bar.
Rooms are very clean.
Breakfast was included which was a good choice of foods. We also ate in the restaurant and at the pool side which was reasonably price and food was nice.
Great for couples or families.
The staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly.
We would definitely come back to this place.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
27,Excellent,40,February 2020,"What a lovely hotel this is, the staff couldn't do enough to accommodate each guest. The hotel itself is very peaceful & relaxing, the rooms were extremely clean & the beds were very comfortable. The room had air conditioning, hair dryer, tea & coffee.

I tried some of the spa treatments which were definitely worth the cost & the staff at the spa were very professional & polite.

I also used the gym area with just one critism, the gym itself is quite a big space & it would be worth it for the hotel to invest in a rowing machine, pull up bar & some heavier dumbbells. The gym has air conditioning & music channel so it is a good place to work out.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
28,Hotel was OK - Older Style for Seminyak,40,February 2020,"Rooms were clean and tidy and staff were polite.
I wouldn’t rave over the place but it was OK. Food in the Restaurant was average. Breakfast was the standard Bali Smorgasbord.
Unfortunately forced to use local Transport - Bluebird can bring you to hotel but. Or get back in to pick you up

Location near the beach is great",Pelangi Bali Hotel
29,Great hotel,40,February 2020,"Stayed at the Pelangi recently and was pleasantly surprised after reading some earlier reviews. I found all the staff very friendly. The room was spotless and huge bed very comfortable. I would agree the bathroom could do with an update but this is minor. Location was fantastic, walk to La Plancha for drinks and bar food and to Gado Gado for amazing food and drinks. Spa treatments were wonderful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
30,The Pelangi,50,February 2020,This is the 7th visit to Pelangi and once again thoroughly enjoyed it. Pelangi is so well located to the Seminyak area..Great Bars and Restaurants in walking distance also..Pelangi has a Fanastic Pool..Great Buffet breakfast..we usually dine out at Restaurants for dinner and enjoy a Club Sandwich at the Hotel Pool..Great Staff and Very Clean Rooms ...Look forward to coming back next year..,Pelangi Bali Hotel
31,Sharon weir,50,February 2020,This hotel is absolutely spotless the staff were so polite & friendly the room we had was a deluxe room with balcony which looked right onto the beach .The food in the restaurant was great & well presented 5⭐️ Service in this hotel will definitely be back thank you for a great holiday .,Pelangi Bali Hotel
32,Dirty and Dated,10,February 2020,"4*. Not a chance!
At best (and pushing it) it’s a 3*.
Staff were attentive on arrival. And that’s where it stopped..... room had an adjoining door which is not an issue, but I could hear everything from the next room.
Bathroom - my god...... 1970s.
Communal corridors were more youth hostel than 4*.
Pool was great and the location is good.
Checked in for 4 nights and checked out after the first. Prefer to lose money than stay there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
33,Very average,20,January 2020,"Think again before staying here. Much better value for money can be found elsewhere! Hotel is tired and run down. Service is very average along with very average breakfasts. Rooms are way past their due by dates . We swapped to the suite overlooking the pool which made it a little better but still not great and the only reason I’ve given it two stars. The rooms are clean however this does not extend to the whole complex. Everywhere else you go staff are falling over themselves to serve you, at the Pelangi they are standing around staring into nowhere. I think they’ve even given up on the place.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
34,Not for the elderly or immobile,30,January 2020,"The photos are generally better than reality. This was a case in point. Lots of stairs to get to reception and then stairs down to our room. The foyer stairs had been fitted with a ramp, but not the stairs down to the ground floor rooms. Not a lift in sight! Theroom itself was spacious with a roomy bathroom. Water was perhaps the hardest I have experienced in Bali and the soap would not lather. That meant showering using shower gel, but with no faceclothes provided you quickly ran out of shower gel. Breakfast as included but was fairly nondescript. Bacon was provided, a possible bonus in Indonesia, but was perhaps the worst bacon I have tasted. There were plenty of bars, restaurants and massage places within walking distance but they appeared to be more pricey than my previous stay in Sanur. On the last evening we had dinner on the rooftop terrace to view the sunset. Dinner was a disappointment; a Balinese chicken curry that lacked in flavour and clearly has not had the chicken cooked in it, and a grilled chicken, which was exactly that, but dry and tasteless. Fortunately the pricing was not over the top. We did enjoy the sunset. Needless to say Circle K convenience store across the street provided the dessert. The hotel is clean and comfortable, but certainly not for the elderly or immobile.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
35,We loved this hotel!,50,January 2020,"The hotel is a traditional balinese style hotel. It has a beautiful spa and pool . You just walk from the hotel directly onto to the beach ( 30 m) and are also within easy walk of the local shops.
The food is varied for all tastes and we found that if you had a specific request they would go out of their way to provide . The staff are all very welcoming and helpful, Whenever we asked for anything it was sorted quickly and efficiently.
We went to the spa and found the staff to be very professional and provide a good service in a beautiful environment , and although a little more expensive then out in the many massage parlours available in the shopping area, the whole experience with music and surroundings was lovely.
There is a shuttle bus which can take guests for free to local towns and areas. Also a very helpful travel /tour section in reception.
We have a large room with air con , tea/coffee, fridge , safe and enough space for clothing as well as aTV . Nice big bed too. Housekeeping staff lovely and every day made up the room beautifully and always smiling.
Every night we have watched the sunset from the beach and tonight from the roof terrace at the hotel which was magical.
We have loved staying here and would recommend to anyone .

36,The MOST DISGUSTING HOTEL IN SEMINYAK!!,10,January 2020,"The hotel is terrible, terrible and even more terrible!!! Hotel facilities very poor; the food at the restuarant very poor, the hotel staff ok however there was a rude lady at reception which was totally unnecessary! A total RIP OFF, VERY SEEDY and NOT THAT SAFE!!! Never again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
37,"Great location, average hotel",30,December 2019,"We stayed in this hotel over the NY break and probably paid well over the odds given it was NYE. The hotel is very run down, it needs a lot of work.... the bathrooms looked quite dirty in some areas and the light is terrible, the bathrooms also still have the old shower curtains you pull along over the bath that need renewing badly.

The room itself wasn't too bad, we had a ground floor room and you don't get a balcony or anything outside, so if you enjoy sitting on the balcony during your stay with a drink don't stay in the rooms in the hundreds.

The pool is nice and large and the staff are lovely. The pool bar is quite grubby and also a few broken tiles around, they also allow glass at the pool and in the pool which is pretty bad especially when you have kids swimming about with glass bottles of coke in their hand.

The breakfast, there is a lot to choose from and their is a egg station which is good.

There is a massage place and a shop right outside the front door, and the beach is right outside the back entrance with double six a 2 minute walk.

Overall, I would not stay here again, its very old and run down and needs a lot of attention!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
38,Not a bad hotel,30,January 2020,My wife and i spent 6nights here.the hotel is a little bit dated.but the rooms are ok and quiet bathroom ok tea and coffee in the room.bed very good.staff helpfull and friendly.free shuttle bus a few times a day.spa very good and not expensive.breakfast very good and have a lot of choice.pool nice with swim up bar.lots of beach bars just outside for food and drink.if came back to bali would stop here again,Pelangi Bali Hotel
39,"No bad, not great",40,January 2020,"Staff helpful and friendly. Breakfast didn't have a big range and was average at best. Toilet clogged a few times. Location is good and pool was nice.
If you are looking for the wow factor maybe this is not your hotel. If you after something that works then yes",Pelangi Bali Hotel
40,"Well located, pool and eats",30,December 2019,"Did not stay here but visited with 20 people for swimming and a meal. Kids of all ages from our group enjoyed the pool and adults could swim and have drinks in the pool or at the table. Eats catered for everyone, children enjoyed good portions and adults had western or Indonesian food to order. Overall, a pleasant few hours spent, and enjoyed the sunset and some body surfing by the more adventurous of the group. Enjoy",Pelangi Bali Hotel
41,Perfect pool and location,50,December 2019,This hotel may seem a bit dated and aging gracefully but we throughly enjoyed our stay here. The rooms are ideal and perfect especially if you're only relaxing in them for a few hours. The pool is massive and amazing. It overlooks Seminyak beach and it you can chop and change from the beach to the pool at your leisure. Breakfast was a continental delight and there was more than enough food varieties to choose from each day. The staff are friendly and made sure that we were taken care off. I absolutely recommend this place for your stay. The price is reasonable and value for money.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
42,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,50,November 2019,"My partner and I have recently returned from a 11 day trip to Seminyak where we stayed at the Pelangi Hotel for the duration (with odd nights away but Pelangi was our base). We were welcomed after our 20 hour flight with the warmest reception you can imagine, the staff were so friendly, explained everything to us (they all speak really good english) and even gave us a complimentary welcome drink. We were very tired so the staff helped us with our bags to our room which was lovely.
We had a Superior double room which was very spacious, the bed was huge and the room felt comfortable. We had plenty of storage space to unpack, and one thing I found very helpful was that they have British and European plug sockets in the room as we only brought one adapter! Our room was on the ground floor so the back doors backed on to a lovely pathway that goes down the middle of the two buildings, and they provide you with garden furniture to sit out there and enjoy the peace.
The housekeeping staff are lovely and the room gets attended to everyday when you are at breakfast normally, or late morning. Being in such a hot climate, although there is a mini bar in the room, they also provide you with 2 complimentary bottles of water everyday.
The restaurant - we had breakfast included in our booking which was a good variety of hot cooked foods, pastries, cereals, juices, fruit etc. The hot foods, cereals, pastries and juices are different each day so no two consecutive days have the exact same offerings which is nice. There is also an egg station where they cook you fresh eggs for your breakfast including omelettes, poached, fried, scrambled etc. This can get busy between 9.15-9.45 and can sometimes be slow, but they are limited to how many they can cook at once so is to be expected! We also ate lunch at the restaurant a few times on days we spent by the pool, and the lunch menu has a great variety of offerings and the food is lovely (strongly recommend the schnitzel sandwich!)
When we booked the hotel we did not intend on spending much time there as we thought we would be out exploring the local area and beaches most days - this did not end up being the case as the pool area is huge, but the beds are spaced out nicely so it doesn't feel too busy even when all the beds are taken. There are some lovely little sun trap spots as well as plenty of shaded areas, and a swim up bar which is very handy in the high temperatures.
We used the spa during our visit and had a treatment each - they are very reasonably priced and the treatments were lovely. We both fully enjoyed them and found them so relaxing!
The hotel itself is located around 25 min drive from the airport, and backs onto the beach. Although it's in the heart of Seminyak, it is tucked away enough that it's a peaceful environment and you don't feel like you're in the middle of the hustle and bustle. We walked down the beach most evenings as there are some lovely restaurants and bars along there. There is also a convenience store at the front of the hotel which is handy to grab cold drinks on your way out for the day.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pelangi Hotel, we were so pleasantly surprised and the staff at the hotel are a real asset, each person made us feel so comfortable and welcome there we are so grateful to all of them. Thank you Pelangi Hotel!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
43,Great location -- and even better staff!,40,November 2019,"We stayed at Pelangi for four days in Bali -- we were supposed to move rooms mid-visit but the staff was able to keep us in our room for only a small surcharge. The hotel is massive -- very long walk from lobby to pool/restaurant, so if you have difficulty walking, this may take some time!!! -- but the rooms are large and very clean, good air conditioning, huge bathrooms and good wifi throughout property. The spa was delightful as well. The thing that makes this hotel is its staff though. Warm, friendly, accommodating and thoughtful. Only steps to the beach and bars and restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
44,What you need!,40,November 2019,"Our flight to Bali was delayed and we arrived after midnight but Pelangi were really helpful and good with communication regarding the shuttle bus no matter the time.
Hotel was nice, staff were very attentive. Room was standard, tidy and clean with good shower, all you need if you just plan to sleep in there, had tiny balcony with a view of just the other rooms.
Breakfast was good, options for indonesian, eggs/baked beans/bacon/potatoe/tomatoes, pancakes/croissants, toast, fruit, salad, cereal and juices.
Pool was very good, with swim up drink area and background music. Need to be early if you want a shaded chair as not much shade otherwise.
Hotel offers free shuttle to Seminyak, Kuta and Bintang at specified times but you have to get a taxi back.
Location was good, quiet kind of area, only about 5, 10 mins to Seminyak centre, and walking distance to other busy places.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
45,Nice authentic hotel,40,November 2019,"Good spacious hotel, authentic style and clean and tidy. Rooms very nice and big,excellent air con and all you need for a comfortable stay. Pool lovely but struggled for shade and beds if not there early. Ideal position for beach and town,so plenty of options, throughly recommend this hotel. Breakfast excellent and plenty of choice of quality foods. Sets you up for the day. Evenings struggles a bit as most guests go elsewhere, but a good fall back if you need it. Great for the beach sunset.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
46,Undecided,30,October 2019,"My opinion of the Penang is very undecided as it’s a hotel that gives no warmth.
After walking from reception the rooms are accessible by external concrete walkways, there are no carpeted area so it’s not like being in a hotel.
The brickwork and tiles are dull so again that concrete jungle feeling.
Once your in the pool area the pool is great size with a poolside bar, there are plenty of loungers and umbrellas and the open plan restaurant serves breakfast and open menus all day.
The prices are more reasonable than the beach bars that are 30 seconds away.
You sit on the loungers watching the beach surfers which is great and the massage ladies are all available in same place.
My wife really enjoyed the massages on the beach
The hotel is about 7 minutes walk along 1 street to the hub of shops, but if it’s only drinking then use the beach bars just steps away.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
47,Great location,40,October 2019,"Stayed here for 10 nights and was suprised that rooms only have 6 coat hangers in them, asked for more and got 4.

Location is great, small road if you can call it that at the back, then it's the super beach. Beach bars, lovely.
Hotel rooms are a good size.
Breakfast is good and there's a roof terrace to go on to see the sunset.
There is a free shuttle bus from hotel to seminyak and Kuta square.
Pool area is lovely with swim up bar.

Lots of local bars/ restaurants close by, if you are a fun person, visit frankensteins.

If I visited here again, I'd likely stay in this hotel again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
48,Pelangi resort,50,December 2018,Awesome staff breakfast buffet amazing and definitely a must as we found it hard to find food early in the morning and tucked just a little away from all the street stalls will be going back for sure.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
49,I want to go back,50,October 2019,"I stayed here for just one night, after a week in Lovina, before a morning flight.
I absolutely loved this hotel.
Very clean, comfortable, friendly staff, good breakfast, fantastic location.
Went for a swim in the pool and the beach, ate a nice pizza in their restaurant with a sea view, watched the sunset, and enjoyed live music in the beach bars nearby.
I was wishing my flight would be cancelled, but sadly I had to leave. I hope to return in my next trip to Bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
50,Amazing experience,50,October 2019,"Just got back from a 10 day break in Bali staying at the pelangi spa hotel with my mum. Absolutely out of this world. Nothing we could fault about our stay. The hotel was lovely, accomodating and the staff so friendly. Beach front location, buffet style breakfast with egg station. Staff can't do enough for you. A shuttle is provided several times a day for Seminyak square or Kuta market. The rooms were large and clean, towels provided for the pool. Swim up bar where you can order food or drinks throughout the day and night. Only small niggle was other people from neighbouring hotels used the pool and the sun loungers so sometimes not enough beds round the pool but there are other sunloungers facing the sea. Used the spa facilities twice and the massage package was so relaxing especially before heading home to a 21 hour journey. Would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
51,Again a great great time at Pelangi,50,May 2019,"I WAS back to Pelangi 4 years after...had a very good welcome , a very nice room, renewed,very comfortable....
Extremely good quality rate versus money paid...above all seen the location , straight on doublesix beach...
location and swimming pool very clean and pleasant
You just cross the path in front of the swimming pool and you are at the beach !!
This year , I also tasted 2 times the poolside restaurant , at night, very good service and tasty king prawns...

This hotel is one of my best souvenir of Seminyak and, of course, I 'll be back again, whenever I ll be able to...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
52,Fab place to stay in Bali,50,September 2019,"Stayed again here for 2 weeks and had a wonderful trip , its like an old friend returning we came about 2 years ago. Its still the same lovely staff, clean rooms, swim up bar and plenty of sunbeds. One of the great features its opposite a lovely clean beach which the sunbeds are 200k for 2 and the bed staff serve Bintang which is really cold - straight to your bed, I love this party of Bali - Seminyak have plenty of lovely restaurants and so reasonable in fact we couldnt spend all our money.
Weather was fantastic would recommend this hotel to anyone give it a try, you wont be disappointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
53,Great location and friendly staff,40,October 2019,"Hotel was located right by the beach and has a fantastic pool.

Staff were helpful and friendly and they run free shuttles to the markets.

The hotel had 24 hrs reception and offers currency exchange.

Rooms are large and clean.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
54,Beachfront across the road,40,October 2019,"We recommend this hotel for beach on a budget. Pool was relaxing and ideslly located at the beachfront of the hotel. Was nice to eat breakfast and beable to see the waves on the beach. Hotel is very worn and needs a good external paint job, bed was super comfy, bathroom was good. Breaky was really good. Locals at the beach stalls across the road were excellent. We woukd recommend for value of money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
55,"Beautiful Hotel, right on the beach!",40,September 2019,"The Pelanghi is a lovely clean hotel that has everything you need in a hotel when travelling with kids. The pool is delightful to swim in and sun beds are available that overlook the beach. Step down from the hotel and you will be at the beach where there is a vast array of beach bars and beanbags to relax and see the sunset. The shopping in Seminyak is great and walk to Legian about 30 minutes along the beach or catch a bluebird for a very small price. The staff were lovely, my daughter was treated to a beautiful birthday cake in her room which was a lovely surprise. Buffet breakfast is an absolute must and great way to start the day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
56,Hotel dated but honest and helpful staff,40,September 2019,"We stayed at Pelangi for 2 nights

Pros - close to beach and good shopping, has a lovely pool. Also, we left our go pro at the pool bar one night, the staff found it and placed it in lost and found. We had already left to Ubud when we realised the Go Pro was hone and they actually sent a driver to deliver it to me (at my cost of course). I was very impressed with this and this is the reason for the 4 stars.

Cons - wifi works intermittently, rooms are dark and decorated with dark fabrics which is quite depressing. The curtains open facing out to others rooms so you either live in the dark or have everyone looking into your room. The towels are really old and grungy. The bathroom just felt grubby and there is a bath with a shower head over it.

This hotel needs a good overhaul. It's very dated.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
57,Great location,50,August 2019,I spent a few nights staying solo in this hotel and found it very safe. The property is just off the Seminyak beach. The pool and restaurant face the beach. The not so nice part was that the rooms don’t offer much of a view but that’s compensated by its location so close to the beach. In the evening both the beach and the city side have plenty of options in close walking distance which offer good music and food and drinks. Staff here were very helpful and courteous.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
58,"Great Location, Great Staff, Beautiful sunset",40,August 2019,"I stayed at Pelangi for 5 nights. The location of the hotel is amazing It opens up to Double six beach which is beautiful. Pool Bar, Staff are welcoming and extremely helpful. The hotel itself is a little dated but rooms are comfortable. Breakfast buffet is good, free shuttle available to Kuta,Seminyak square & bintang supermarket. Overall a lovely experience. Highly Recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
59,Nice hotel,30,August 2019,"This is a nice hotel, the staff are polite and friendly and rooms are average. Everything is clean and works but nothing amazing. Pool is nice and clean and the major benefit is being on the beach with all the lovely beach bars around. Breakfast is okay, have had worse and have had better - does the job and fills you up!
All in all I have no specific complaints but for nearly £100 a night you can do much better in Bali. A forgettable experience.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
60,"Great location, staff lovely but overall the place is very tired looking.",30,August 2019,"We booked this hotel on our last night in Bali, so we were disappointed to see how dated and tired it was for the price we paid. Our room, while it had everything we needed and was clean, was very dark and made us feel like getting out of it and into the light of day as quickly as we could. We didn't want to open curtains as it looked straight out onto other rooms. On a brighter note, the swimming pool was great.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
61,"Good Location, great staff",40,August 2019,"I stayed at Pelangi for a couple of nights. The location of the hotel is amazing. It ooens up to Seminyak. Staff is welcoming and extremely helpful. The hotel itself is dated and in needs of renovation. Rooms are comfortable, but old. We found lizards in the first room and got the room changed. They do not provide an iron in the room, you can have it fromthe room service for free of charge. Breakfast buffet is decent - nothing too extravagant. Overall a good experience. Recommended for a short stay at the Seminyak beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
62,Brilliant,50,August 2019,"Love this place!!!

Stayed here 3 times now and it never fails to disappoint.

Convenient to everything
Beachfront access
Food is very good
Staff friendly and attentive
Quintessential Balinese style

Ticks all the boxes 👍",Pelangi Bali Hotel
63,GREAT LOCATION - BUT DATED,20,August 2019,"Comfy beds, great breakfast, great location on beach in Southern Seminyak. But Bathroom was very dated, Toilet didnt flush, Shower was over a bathtub, I just expected more for the money we paid. We had a room on the ground floor, so we couldn't open our blinds, because it faced a walkway. The wifi didn't work . When I asked them about it they advised that it was working fine.

It is a great location, and every evening we walked down to the beach and had drinks on the beach with ten thousand other people. Loved Seminyak, but I would stay somewhere else next time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
64,Centrally located,40,August 2019,"We have just returned home after a holiday to Bali where we stayed at the Pelangi for 4 nights, the resort is quite dated but clean and the staff were very friendly and willing to assist us, it is very central to all facilities, be very careful of the beach out the front as there was strong rip most days we were there and people were swimming without being within the flags and many got into trouble,the pool is quite small and wouldn't like to be in it when the resort is full, overall would recommend as reasonably priced.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
65,Not recommended,20,August 2019,"We stayed at this property due to location, which is good if you like to stay near the beach. The place itself is pretty run down though. Room was dark and worn. Bathroom was not that clean with old fixtures and worn towels. Shower curtain looked pretty grubby. Beds just ok. Staff was not great and one asked us a lot of intrusive questions. The lobby area is pretty sad-looking and the restaurant for breakfast was just ok. Pool area was pretty, but lack of seating and shade. As for nearby amenities, restaurant offerings aren’t great in immediate vicinity. Beach bars are fun. Gado Gado is good too. But the offerings on the nearby main street aren’t great. Good area if you’re looking to get a tatoo. We wouldn’t stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
66,Hotel on the beach,30,July 2019,"The Pelangi is a little dated and could do with a spruce up. The location on the beach is excellent but I did feel it was situated rather on the fringe of Seminyak.
Rooms and bathroom are a good size and cleanliness was fine.
Breakfast had good choices plus the all important egg station 👍",Pelangi Bali Hotel
67,All you need is at the Pelangi on Double Six beach,50,July 2019,"Location, location gets no better than here, at the Pelangi Seminyak, only the associates outstanding service exceeds this prime spot on Double Six beach. The people here are professionals at what they do, making your visit as wonderful as possible. This hotel is probably 20 years old, but more than adequate, as I am doudle that age. The buffet breakfast works just fine, as the pool, spacious rooms and beach access are perfect. There is even a place across the street that will do your laundry for a couple bucks ! Thanx.....great job !",Pelangi Bali Hotel
68,Nice hotel by the beach,40,July 2019,"Overall, Pelangi Bali Hotel reminds me of one of the large tourists hotel that you find everywhere. Lots of rooms with a quite nice pool. It is located right by the beach in Seminyak so you had great options for food as there were restaurants all along the beach. The room was quite decent for the price and the breakfast buffet was quite extensive with a mix of eastern (Noodles, rice, etc.) and western (eggs, bacon) fare. The only drawbacks I noticed was poor wifi in the rooms and the water from the tap tasted awful (for brushing teeth and not drinking). Also, there were not a ton of seats around the pool. Overall it is a good decent choice if you just want to sit by the beach or the pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
69,Holiday,40,July 2019,"Stayed here in July 2019. I loved the hotel. Fantastic staff. The room was clean and roomy A king size bed was very comfy. The pool is fantastic, shallow one end and about 8ft deep the other end. Pool bar was great as well. The hotel is right next to the beach with easy access. The restaurant / room service had delicious food. A convenience store, laundry and massage stores right across the road. Other stores and restaurants are with in an easy walk. The hotel may be a little outdated but I have no hesitation in recommending it and will definitely stay here again. 4.5/5",Pelangi Bali Hotel
70,Value for money,50,July 2019,"This is the first time at the Pelangi Bali Hotel and I've found it good . Its and old building but clean the people that work here are quiet friendly and very professional. The rooms are great with the beds being massive and comfortable . The pillows supplied I dare say arnt the normal cheap ones that are nomally supplied.The breakfast buffet has a good variety for everybody the only down fall no soy milk but I was happy enough to buy some and bring it down with me every morning , they have a separate egg station where you can nominate how you want your eggs cooked and that includes omelettes. Gardens ,swimming pool, chairs, tables etc are in great condition and right on the beach, location is central to everything you would need . I would highly recommend this as a place to stay as i said great location and its value for the money .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
71,Enjoyable stay,50,July 2019,First time I have been to Bali and I will definitely be back. Stayed 5 nights as a short break and discovered it was not long enough. Great location being right on the beach and close to bars and great food but far enough away to be quiet at the same time. The staff were more than friendly with anything that we wanted. Nice to come into your room after being out and discovering “little fairies” had been in the room and made the bed.....would highly recommend this place to family and friends. I’m coming back later in the year to Bali and I will be more than happy to stay here.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
72,Very Good,40,July 2019,"We stayed for 8 days in this hotel. Service, super good, friendliness. Installations a little old but the rooms good and adequate size, we were the couple and 15 year old daughter. Breakfast good, but after a few days it would have been better if the menu changed, always the same at the end my daughter no longer had breakfast. Location is the best possible.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
73,Our first visit to Bali,50,June 2019,"On our first visit to Bali, we were lucky enough to find ourselves spending three nights at The Pelangi. From our friendly driver, who met us at the airport, to our arrival at reception and, the following days we were happily surprised at the welcoming nature of the staff and the level of service provided. Every time we left the hotel, and again when we returned, there was always a cheerful greeting. Our room was clean and beautifully presented. The food in the restaurant was delicious and moderately priced. The spa and pool facilities were fantastic and provided a relaxing experience each day. We would recommend The Pelangi to anybody looking for courteous, friendly service and a relaxing holiday.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
74,Wonderful!,40,July 2019,"Stayed here for a group holiday - the pool area and swim up bar are lovely, can walk straight out on to the beach and great access to lots of places to eat. The breakfast buffet has lovely food, the rooms were comfortable with great air con, affordable and a lovely view from the rooftop restaurant. Highly recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
75,Good value for money Hotel in a great location.,40,June 2019,"The Pelangi is very well located, well appointed, and offers great value for money. It is also ""well photographed"" and it is not as big as it is portrayed in the marketing imagery. It was banana lounge roulette around the pool when the hotel was full, but the beach is right there, so that is always a great option to be forced to enjoy.
The area around the hotel is superb for restaurants, bars, shopping and entertainment. I loved my break here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
76,AMAZING!,50,October 2018,"What a wonderful experience we had staying at the pelangi! Staff were amazing, rooms were fantastic! Location was perfect! And everything about the pelangi made our first stay in Bali something we will never forget!!
If you want somewhere great to stay , I can not recommend this place enough! :)
Going back to bali in 2019 and will be staying there again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
77,Love it! Direct access to the beach!,40,June 2019,"We love staying at Pelangi Bali for two main reasons. One is the room rates - reasonable rates for a beachfront property. Second, the access to beach. The beach is just behind this property and you can directly access it.

Other than these two reasons, the friendly staff, accommodating guests' request (e.g. late check-out) are other reasons we keep choosing this hotel.

We are also very appreciative of the complimentary dinner given to us as 'repeat' guests. We got a starter, main course and dessert. Guess, the dinner would have cost about S$70 for both of us. Also, thank you for our wedding anniversary amenities. Pleasant stay. Will come back again next year 😀",Pelangi Bali Hotel
78,Love!!!,50,February 2019,"Wow perfect location opposite beach with an array of restaurants and cafes close by, rooms clean and well serviced resort restaurant was ok nothing special,breakfast was pretty nice, really enjoyed table service with the coffee topups. The highlight was the swimming pool we could have hang out in there all day long!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
79,Perfectly located.Very good hotel,40,May 2019,"We stayed for 5 nights here. Staff were extremely friendly and the hotel is perfectly situated on the beach. The room was very good, pool area nice and quiet which we enjoyed as a couple.

Around 30 minutes walk from a lot of the more popular restaurants etc but if you don't mind walking you'll be fine. Better than being stuck in the centre of Seminyak",Pelangi Bali Hotel
80,School Reunion,40,May 2019,"Older style property in the heart of Seminyak with lovely appointed rooms. We were a party of 7 couples so had our rooms together on the ground floor and they opened onto the garden. The pool area needs a few more lounges so you need to 'bag' your lounge early, as in on your way to breakfast! The bike traffic outside in the laneway across from the beach is crazy and you have to be VERY aware as you cross. If you want to be amongst all the shops and restaurants this is ideal, I personally prefer the quietness of Ubud or Uluwata.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
81,Great week.,40,May 2019,"We had a lovely week at Pelangi. Lovely spot on the beach. Great pool, swim up bar, restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed our week here. Will definately stay here again. Amazing staff. Had a scare losing my handbag and staff kept it in restaurant thanks to another Aussie couples suggestion. Soooo relieved to get it back and with everything still in it. Couldn’t recommend this place enough and such good value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
82,Great hotel to be near beach and relax from hustle and bustle of Seminyak,40,May 2019,"We spent 5 nights at Pelangi Hotel (apparently pelangi means rainbow!) and we very much enjoyed it!

Our room was always clean and the bed was very comfy; the breakfast was great; the pool is lovely and we enjoyed the swim up bar; the hotel is practically on the beach - you walk down past the pool and restaurant, and cross a small back road (scooters only) and you’re there. There was an abundance of loungers and the proximity to the beach meant that there we always had a pick of loungers. yes the hotel isn’t brand new and shiny but it’s well maintained and clean, and comfortable.

We ate out most nights but we did eat dinner one night on the sunset terrace (which opens twice a week) which was a nice experience. Plenty of room service options too. There is a Circle K just over the road at the front which is perfect for picking up some cheaper drinks and snacks for your room, or for an ATM.

The staff were friendly and helpful, and the guy on the travel desk was very good at giving advice and helping to find us a local driver who was great 👍 (Nyoman Suparma - we would recommend)

Overall we had a great stay here, using it as a base to do some trips around Bali. Hotel was about 15/20 minutes walk from Seminyak square and you can do a nice walk along the beach. Hotel was very close to La Plancha which, although very busy and vibrant at night, was a lovely place to enjoy a late lunch and relax in the afternoon!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
83,Amazing Hotel,50,May 2019,"Our 3rd stay at this hotel. On arrival we received a free dinner as we its was out 3rd time this is a very nice gesture. Located in Symenyak beach and a great pool bar. The food at this hotel is amazing best food we had in Seminyak. Great location walking distance from many bars, restaurants and shopping. Great value for money. Thank you for your hospitality Pelangi",Pelangi Bali Hotel
84,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,May 2019,"Such an amazing place to stay! The hotel was faultless from arrival. We were presented with lovely welcome drinks and were well informed by the reception staff about all the need-to-knows. The hotel is slightly dated but unless your exceptionally picky then this hotel is heavenly! Our room was super clean and cleaned everyday. The food and drinks were both delicious and cheap. All the staff were so friendly and warm and couldn’t be more helpful. They allowed us to shower before departure and provided us with soaps and shampoos. They arrange a taxi back to the airport which was cheap. The location is right in the middle of Seminyak and right in the middle of all the food bars and restaurants. I’ve read in some post that the hotel is not “literally on the beach”, I can assure you that it is. You couldn’t get any closer unless your bed was there 😂 This hotel is value for money and I would 100% return. The only niggly bits for me was that we couldn’t have a bath as the plug whole was too small and there was some music coming from somewhere every night which you could hear in the background which was slightly annoying. Other than that, this is the ideal place to stay during your visit to Seminyak. 9.5/10 😍",Pelangi Bali Hotel
85,Excellent staff! Thank you for my Dad's birthday cake!,50,May 2019,"We stayed here for our first 2 nights in Bali and it was wonderful. Perfect location on the beach (Double six beach), next to La Plancha restaurant. Excellent breakfast buffet (complete with omelets and bacon!) Lots of variety too. The room was spacious and clean. Nice decor. I appreciated the free welcome drink upon check-in. Front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating esp the man working at the tour/activity desk. Although we didn't book directly with him (too expensive), he gave us great advice and recommendations on our trip to Nusa Penida. The concierge was also very helpful when booking a taxi last minute to the port. Best part was the staff! On my Dad's birthday, they delivered a free cake to our room with the sweetest birthday note! It was very thoughtful! The cake was delicious too! Thank you for helping make my Dad's birthday so special. Highly recommend this hotel. The swimming pool was gorgeous too, along with views of the ocean. The swim up bar was a nice touch. Hopefully will return one day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
86,Chakri Jewelry at Pelangi Hotel,50,May 2019,"At the Pelangi Bali Hotel there is Jewelry Shop owned by Dat. Through Trip Advisor I was able to contact her before our trip to Bali as I wanted to have my 50 year old Wedding Ring remade as it had broken and all the pattern was worn away and was extremely thin . After viewing photos of my Ring and other old Jewelry I had she was able to quote me to remake my Ring . We agreed a price and on our first Morning in Bali we travelled to the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak where we met Dat . She was fantastic . She weighed all of our gold jewelry and tested the Diamond in my Old Ring. I gave her a sketch of the Pattern from the Old Ring she told us when the Ring would be finished , she even offered to deliver it in person to our Villa . I paid for the, ring in Australian Dollars , she had quoted in Australian Dollars .
On the following Tuesday her and her Husband arrived at our Villa and she produced my New Wedding Ring. The Ring far exceeded my expectations , I have included the Photo's which she took at the time. I was so Happy.
Full marks to the Pelangi Hotel for having a Jewelry store of such calibre in their Hotel .
We recommend anyone needing Jewellry made or repaired to go to the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak and Talk to Dat.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
87,Quiet and right on the beach,40,May 2019,"The swimming pool is lovely with glimpses of the ocean from the bar and restaurant
The bed was comfortable and the shower had super hot water
The room and bathroom was a little dated and not finished to the finest detail but overall we found the hotel really easy to stay at.
Great for families as well as couple young and old.
Location is really great if the beach is your fancy and only about 10 minutes to the beach.
Walking distance to Home Base Spa (we thought they were great in particular for head and shoulders, arms and foot massage)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
88,Excellent service & location,40,May 2019,"We stayed only for 3 nights, but would’ve stayed longer. Great location & couldn’t fault the service provided. Clean hotel with open, airy feel. Breakfast buffet & egg station was above average. We always had a selection of lounge chairs by the pool & near the beach viewing area when we wanted them. Beautiful pool area & easy access to the beach, directly behind bean bag chairs. One night there must’ve been a party with fireworks near the hotel (beach?) very loud bangs & people running through hallways. Noise woke us up but didn’t last too long. Circle K on the street behind & Star Mart around the corner for foreign exchange and data SIM cards. Would definitely return. Very enjoyable!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
89,A VERY PLEASANT STAY AGAIN AT PELANGI,50,May 2019,"i spent for the second time a very good stay at Pelangi where i could remark again the kindness of the personnel , the renewed rooms ( I had a Superior - basic room) , close to the swimming pool , the yummy breakfast buffet and ,above all , the location of restaurant and swimming pool facing the sea in Seminyak ; this time i could also appreciate the restaurant for dinner ,a great experience dining in front of the sea, with the noise of the sea waves at the background..i can recommand the grilled King's prawns and the seafood skewers...I'll definetely be back again!!

j'ai passé pour la 2e fois un très bon séjour au Pelangi ,où , en plus de la position excellente en face de la mer ( ce que je recherchait ), de la chambre Superior ( de base ) qui a été rénové ,de l'excellent et superbe buffet du petit déjeuner j'ai retrouvé l' aimabilité du personnel que j'avais déjà rémarqué lors de mon premier passage...j'y réviendrais surement",Pelangi Bali Hotel
90,Amazing hotel,50,May 2019,"When entering the front gates of the hotel you are greeted by a massive water features and Balinese status

The staff here are so friendly and helpful. Because I'm a solo traveller they made me feel so welcomed. They even gave me a free mocktail on arrival

The room I stayed in was 204. Very spacious, clean, stocked mini bar and King size bed. Aslo has a small balcony to just relax

Food and menu is very good. Menu prices are very reasonable for this kind of hotel. Also food presentation was done well and tasty. (full room service available)

Other bonuses, they have is a gym, big swimming pool and swim up bar, swimming pool is also open 8am to 8pm. Close to airport, right on the beach, second away from shopping, restaurants, cafes and also the have a shuttle service to major shopping centres.

Overall this hotel and the made staff made me feeling welcomed and relaxed. Worth coming back

PS they aslo have an in-house tour booking station",Pelangi Bali Hotel
91,"Location, location",30,June 2018,"I stayed here for the location, right on the Beach with cafes out the front.
The rooms are traditional Bali style.
Breakfast- basic menu - but overlooking the pool and beach is lovely
Swim up bar- small pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
92,"Unpretentious, Clean, Perfect Location",40,April 2019,"Loved our few nights stay at this hotel. No, it doesn't dazzle with sparkle but it is spotlessly clean, lovely staff, all the services and amenities you would receive at much more expensive hotels and a location that would be hard to beat. Virtual beach front, quick and easy walk to shops and restaurants either just outside the property or on Eat Street or Legian. Great pool with swim up bar and sunbeds. Stayed in a basic double room on the ground floor. Bed was huge and comfortable. Room was adequate, bathroom fixtures a little dated but clean. There are many steps throughout the property if mobility is a problem. Only complaint is that a little TLC and brighter paintwork throughout the property would help elevate it back to its original standards. Would stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
93,Not the best,30,April 2019,"Location wise this hotel is great. It’s not far from plenty restaurants and bars and a fifteen minute walk from la favela. It’s right on the beach so you’re near to loads of beach bars and restaurants with amazing views of the sunset. However, the hotel itself needs some TLC.

The bathroom in our room was never cleaned properly. There were stains on the side of the sink from the day we got there until the day we left. The taps for both the shower/bath and sink looked like they’d never been cleaned. The plug didn’t fit the plug hole in the bath so you couldn’t actually get a bath.

The pool area is nice enough, however, the hotel is huge and there is a very limited amount of sun loungers. The food at the hotels restaurant is subpar and I would not recommend dining there.

The staff though were all so, so lovely.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
94,The worst night of my traveling life,10,April 2019,"It is now 01:02 in the morning.

I am laying in the lobby of the Palangi Hotel waiting for them to set up some beds in the luggage room.

This hotel borders on some sort of nightclub from Hell. The music literally infiltrates the walls and the bass shakes your body.

We have been promised since 21:00 that it would stop, but it keeps getting louder.

Luckily we are leaving tomorrow at 06:00 in the morning, but that means little sleep tonight which means lost time on our precious holiday. The one thing we cannot get back.

Do your homework well before spending your time or cash at this hotel. Simply not worth it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
95,"Quaint and OK,",30,April 2019,"Cute tidy hotel, clean rooms and ok facilities, spa and gym weren’t overly appealing at all, pool was fantastic- big, deep and had a swim up bar... close to the beach so suited our purposes for a two night stay!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
96,Accident waiting to happen,10,April 2019,"Very run down with no health & safety awareness. At one time I counted 30 people in the pool with cocktail glasses, the pool plant room was open (high voltage, roaring machinery and toxic chemicals) for any adventurous child to enter, none of the steps had handrails and there is 240 v sockets next to the bathroom sink",Pelangi Bali Hotel
97,Wonderful,50,April 2019,I have stayed at this hotel 7 times my last stay was only 2 weeks ago and it was the best. The hotel was very clean the staff wonderful and the meals were great. Won’t to go back very soon if possible.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
98,Beautiful and amazing,50,April 2019,"So peaceful and tranquil this hotel was what we all asked for ... food always fresh, scenery is just amazing and the staff were always aimed to please..... location is close walking distance to main shopping district thank you for your hospitality",Pelangi Bali Hotel
99,Loved it,40,March 2019,"hotel lovely .rooms were nice lovely big bed . kettle with tea and coffee and water every day. aircon brill as it was so hot out Staff are so helpful. Breakfast plenty to choose from the hotel is right on the beach with a lovely lady called Ruty who does great massages and cheap ! beach nice the sea is warm ,the beach gets full for the sunset but it’s a must see 😀 great location shop bars all just a short walk away
pool is nice with a nice bar that we sat at many a day drinking cocktails overall i thought this was a really good hotel . towels provided for the pool area . we would go again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
100,nothing special,30,March 2019,"no privacy, rooms too small .toilets stink when it rains. no were to hang wet clothes. rooms too small .pool area needs an upgrade. cannot call for taxi in the area not allowed. nothing special.breakfast is good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
101,Seminyak hotel,30,March 2019,"Beachfront position is very good, suggest to request a room close to the pool and restaurant at front of building otherwise you will have 100metre ++ walk from your room to pool and restaurant. Our room was on ground floor without balcony or outdoor area to sit, it also smelt musty . The hotel has no lift so would not be suitable for anyone with walking disability.Shops and massage areas were away from beach area necessitating a 1km walk. Lovely pool and restaurant area overlooking beach was a positive, I prefer to have a hotel surrounded by shops,restaurants and other amenities, consequently I would not stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
102,Nice but needs some TLC,30,March 2019,"Pelangi Hotel is in a great location, right on the beach, close to restaurants and shops. The staff a very friendly and welcoming. The down side is that the Hotel needs some attention. Gardens are over grown in some areas and building's need attention.The rooms are a good size, big range of tv stations.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
103,Okay stay,10,February 2019,"Staff were very helpful , room was clean however our air con leaked everywhere so couldn’t switch it on . Our room smelt very bad of damp. Beds were comfy , location is great if you want to be next to the beach, breakfast is also reasonable, price is reasonable however wouldn’t come back again due to our room.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
104,Bit dissapointed,30,February 2019,"Well I have to say i was spoilt staying in Ulawatu. Everything was cheaper, quieter and cleaner. If you frequent Bali you will be happy with this hotel. It's rooms are average small balcony clean, staff are friendly and it's right on the beach. If you haven't ever gone anywhere else other than the hussle bussle of Bali it is a good place very central.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
105,Beautiful hotel. Great location.,50,January 2019,"We wanted a hotel located in Seminyak and it had to have a swim up bar .. Not only did the Pelangi offer both but you also get:
Quality, clean, air-conditioned rooms.
Friendly and accommodating staff.
Located right on the beach with only a short walk to shops/bars and restaurants.
Great for everybody!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
106,Pelangi Hotel,50,September 2018,"We stayed in Pelangi Hotel for 1 week and it was a great experience. The staff in the hotel are really friendly, the location is great, only few steps from hotel and you can enjoy the sunset with a bottle of beer.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
107,Look no further....,50,January 2019,"trying to find a hotel is hard, you put in your options and literally 100’s of choices pop up. Well we can tell you that Pelangi Hotel and Spa is a great place to stay. Walking distance to the beach, 25 mins walk to Seminyak Square. The hotel has a choice of rooms we stayed in 2 types as the second week I’d arranged an upgrade. Room service, Spa facilities, restaurants and ALL staff were fabulous. The pool was beautiful crystal clear and clean. Mini mart across the road for those extras we all seem to have left behind, we’ll worth giving this hotel a try.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
108,Great stay,40,December 2018,"Well maintained rooms, staff are friendly, and great location near the beach, with many restaurants on the beach only a few minutes' walk away. We were really happy with the hotel room (2x double beds) as it was comfortable and clean and secure with swipe access.

The hotel has a couple of shuttle services to Seminyak square, however the times weren't convenient, so it's easier to walk up a little and catch a taxi if needed. There is a minimart just outside the hotel, as well as a laundry service and an authorised money exchanger.

Breakfast buffet is average, and the pool is nice with a swim-up bar.

The hotel could benefit from additional shuttle services to seminyak square and maybe a better variety for breakfast.

Overall, I definitely recommend the hotel, especially if you want to be near the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
109,Convenient but noisy and needs refurbishment,20,January 2019,"Convenient to beach and cheap eats on Seminyak beach. Staff are friendly. Buffet breakfast has egg station (omelettes, scrambled eggs, poached eggs etc), hot food selection (fried rice, noodles, bacon, potatoes, baked beans), fresh loaves of bread and pastries. Wi-fi in our room was poor. There is construction next door with workers making noise with hammers and nail guns past midnight. We complained at front desk twice but staff only promised to refer the matter to their manager. Our room was also on the main walkway to/from the pool so other guests talking/shouting woke us up at night. So we did not get a good night sleep during our 5 night stay. So strongly recommend you stay elsewhere until construction is finished. The rooms are in need of refurbishment. Beds are comfortable and aircon is good. Water pressure and temperature is fine in the shower. But bathroom could do with an upgrade. Pool water quality and temperature is good...it was nice to have a swim after returning from beach or day trip. Outdoor shower and tap to rinse off after beach swim. Sun lounges around pool are positioned close together due to limited space. A positive: the on-call doctor service is very good. Friendly, compassionate, English-speaking doctor. Some of us suffered from “Bali belly”, doctor arrived within 2 hrs of request for assistance and relevant medications prescribed. Doctors fee is charged to room. Medical certificates provided to assist with travel insurance claims.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
110,Good location,40,July 2018,"Good price for what you get. The breakfast had a good selection, but the restaurant for the rest of the day is so so. But it is so close to a lot of great restaurants so you have options. The staff was pleasant and efficient.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
111,Great stay,40,December 2018,"Friends pick this place for us to stay since we mainly stay in Sanur . We are very happy with there choise .
From brilliant internet . Views . Pool . Bed and breakfast you couldn't go wrong .
Great selection for breakfast and a swim up bar if you need it .
Sitting out the front looks over the beach .
And just on the beach are the areas with bean bags for sunset drinks .
Staff very friendly and remember your name .
Being close to good restaurants and music but nice and quite in your room .
Will definitely be back when over this side .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
112,Very nice stay,40,December 2018,"We were two couples staying at the Pelangi. We had the deluxe room that overlooked the pool and had a Seaview. It was very nice and comfortable.
Our check in process was seamless, our bed was comfortable, the air conditioner worked beautifully.

The breakfast was very nice and varied daily. The coffee and tea really needs to be improved upon. The tea tastes like washed out swill and the coffee looks like treacle and tastes terrible.

These are the only complaints I had. Very minor but worth mentioning.

Tip: bring your own tea bags.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
113,"3 star property, not 4 !",30,November 2018,"Deserve only 3 stars. Employees not very good in english or any other western language, and they have difficulties understanding.

NOTE: To get a balcony; book a superior Deluxe. Their standard rooms are their superior and these rooms only have a small french balcony without chairs or a table. 

Reception have a separate taxi and tour desk.

Bar close to reception is very dark, with a huge tv screen. Room service is possible at restricted times/hours.

Bathroom with thub needs upgrade. Superior rooms only have bathtub; no separate shower.

Room itself ok.Beds were good to sleep in. Looong hallways to walk. 

Employees not good enough coached/trained by their management ! 

Pluss for located on/close to the beach. Spa ok and they do offer good massages. 

Beachtowels can be brought with you to the beach for free. Hotel has no own area for their guests on the beach, and you must rent beds and umbrealla for IDR 100 000 pr day/ IDR 50 000 pr half day.

If you can spend a little bit more money, choose another place to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
114,Great big Hotel,40,November 2018,"Stayed for 5 days in a superior room,very nice and clean, grate air condition and the lighting is lovely, simply everything is just beautiful.
Staff is friendly And helpful, they are great but the need to smile more
Asked for a ride to the airport, it’s too expensive, The cost they gave me was more than twice the price, so I just took a cab.
One thing I didn’t like is that, there was no bathrobes.
Their breakfast is amazing, the best I ever had in Bali (stayed at three different hotels)
Overall, great hotel, loved it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
115,Expect decent location but not comfort,20,November 2018,"If you plan to spend all of your time at the beach or in the pool this hotel is very conveniently located. However, for the price you pay there are a lot of let downs. For example, the hotel and the room are very old. Our bed was very loud and not so comfortable. We had no hot water in our room so couldn't use the shower or tub.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
116,"Good, but I won't be back",30,November 2018,"The resort itself was nice. The rooms were nice and spacious and the staff were friendly. Having the ability to change money on site was also handy. The proximity to the beach and the beach bars weren't bad.

However the location on the street was not good. It was in a quiet street which had some shady characters, one of the guys staying was robbed there. The pool was ok, but the pool bar was in direct view of the sun without any shade and limited seats, having a social session there was not on the cards. The area surrounding the pool was all concrete, so not much to see and also hot on the feet.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
117,Super!,40,November 2018,"Nothing to complain about! Great hotel, great location, great everything...room, bed, personal, cleaning, pool, food..they don’t have balcony’s though! Ok..really small ones...but who needs it? Take your drink and go to the beach to look at the beautiful sunset!!🔝🔝🔝",Pelangi Bali Hotel
118,Nice beach location,40,November 2018,"First off, the location was quite good, only a couple minute walk from the main strip, right across the road from the beach. When you walk out towards the beach there are a heap of really cool beach bars and restaurants. From the beach if you go right and keep walking you will be near Potato Head. We found it much easier to hire scooters to get around as it was quite hot during the day.

In terms of the rooms, they were clean and comfortable, the bathroom was very standard with a shower curtain and a towel rack that broke while we were there. You also get your two bottles of water replenished in the room each day, plus there was also a mini fridge to keep things cool.

Breakfast was also good, there is an egg station where you can order your own omelette or scrambled eggs, there was also fresh fruit and juices...plus the normal 'western' breakfast (bread, bacon, sausages). The instant coffee was very strong, so we would drink at the buffet then later that morning order a coffee whilst out.

There is a Circle K (Convenience store) right across from the car park that you can also buy cheap alcohol from plus snacks for the day. The pool was also really nice, was quite warm for a pool, plus you have the swim up bar.

Overall was a good option for us.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
119,On the beach with a swim up pool bar!,50,October 2018,"If this is not booked out, go here to stay. The rooms are clean but a little dated and the TV reception is average but you are literally right on the beach. There is a place out the front of the hotel to do your laundry too for $5 aussie for 4kg. Also the pool has plenty of deck chairs and did I mention a swim up bar.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
120,Good choice,40,October 2018,"We wanted somewhere in a great location and on the beach for our first few days of holiday in Bali. This was a great location, great beach front area, amazing pool and pool bar. Breakfasts were average and limited though. We stayed in a superior room and it was a good size for the 2 of us. Very small balcony though. And we didn’t have a view. We looked onto other balconies but we were rarely in the rooms so it didn’t bother us much. Service was great from the reception and bar areas. Would recommend they provided more complimentary waters for the rooms. Can’t catch local taxi’s from the hotel have to walk up the road.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
121,What a disappointment!,10,October 2018,"What a shocker! After reading the reviews and seeing the photos on the website we were surprised to arrive and find a tired old hotel that looked nothing like the photos (the magic of photo editing). We stayed at the Pelangi for four nights and from arrival the customer service was poor (with the exception of staff in the Sports Bar). The hotel is almost 20 years old and is in need of an update. The restaurant was the worst food we had eaten during our two week stay in Bali and we definitely wouldn't stay here again. With so many fantastic accommodation options in Bali, for the price, give this one a miss.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
122,"Amazing, amazing, amazing",50,October 2018,"We chose to stay at the Pelangi for our first ever trip to Bali because of the price and location... even though we had absolutely NO idea what to expect - we were so happy with our decision! We could not have booked better value anywhere else. The location is unbelievable, the hotel is fantastic (including the staff) and pool was amazing. We honestly had the BEST time! There is some construction going on during the day which only got annoying if you wanted a day nap, otherwise it didn’t bother us. Every part of our stay was just so amazing, even down to the drive back to the airport, I can’t remember the mans name (bell boy) but he was just so lovely and happy to chat, it really was a good end to our fantastic holiday. We will definitely be coming back to the Pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
123,"Drop in, Pop in or stay",30,September 2018,"As Bali promotes warm weather almost every single day of the year, I suggest when its time to stop, revive and relax, look no further than the Pelangi. Nicely tucked away, quiet and central. Order a drink or snack on some food or just swim up to the bar and network.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
124,"Excellent service, great facilities",50,October 2018,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and the service was excellent. It was my 30th birthday and after a day of swimming and coming back to our room, we found a birthday cake! The pool is beautiful and the atmosphere is really nice and relaxed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
125,Right on the beach loved every minute of our stay.,50,October 2018,"Hotel was separated from the beach by a path, the terraces all had lovely views of the ocean and all the beach bars, great for sunsets. The breakfast was great, something for every taste. All the staff were very friendly and the hotel was very clean with beautifully manicured gardens, however it could do with an update in some areas. A nice touch was the gift of soft toy on arrival. We would definitely stay there next time in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
126,Good location needs updating,30,October 2018,"Well located right by the beach and easy walk into the town or with a bit more of a walk you can walk to Kutu, room was well set but the bathroom smelled bad. Booking in they won't let you book in early and they won't let you keep your room after 12.00 always claiming fully booked. Checked on booking.com and they had several rooms available. Not much choice for breakfast.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
127,Lovely Hotel good location,40,September 2018,Nice location. Rooms were sufficient. Helpful staff. Good breakfast - worth having. The pool was a bonus and nice to use. 2 minute walk to a lovely beach. Easy walking distance to main street for shops if required - including handy supermarket.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
128,Good location on Double 6 beach,30,October 2018,"The hotel is conveniently located on the beach. The room was good and the bathroom average. Breakfast was adequate, but I wouldn't eat from their restaurant - we had some very disappointing food here. There are plenty of restaurants on along the beach and along neighbouring streets. The staff are really friendly and helpful, and when our air conditioning was leaking water, they fixed it straight away and mopped the water from the floor which was very nice of them. We had a late flight, so after check out we were able to store our luggage in a storage area, and the staff allowed us to use a shower in an unoccupied room for 30mins at the end of the day before leaving for our flight.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
129,Amazing stay!,50,October 2018,Absolutely loved our stay at Pelangi. The staff were incredibly kind and helpful and the food was phenomenal. Highly recommend the tuna steak! The rooms are very clean and well equipped with a comfortable king size bed and balcony. The pool overlooks the beach and offers delicious cocktails at the pool side bar. We loved the Saturday night live music and cultural dancers as we ate at the restaurant. Could not fault this place. Would absolutely recommend Pelangi and would love to stay again!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
130,Disappointing,20,October 2018,"We booked last minute and this was all that was available however for $220 aud a night we where disappointed. The rooms where dated with a very strong smell of damp, in general the hotel is run down. Location wasn’t great for us either, we planned to visit some of the poplar restaurants/bars and they where all too far too walk (45mins to Motel mexicola, Sarong, Potatoe head, sister fields cafe etc). We got a taxi but it was 25mins each way with manic traffic, a scooter would be quicker. I would not recommend this place, you can find nicer for similar price point. Only positive the staff where friendly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
131,"Nice clean room, great staff",40,March 2018,"The Pool was beautiful, loved having the pool bar and loved how close it was to the beach. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The Breakfast was amazing as was the room service. I like that it is down a side street but still close to everything. Shops and restaurants are with in walking distance. The back of it is right on the beach and was great to watch the sunset",Pelangi Bali Hotel
132,Lovely boutique hotel,50,September 2018,"Have stayed in numerous areas and accommodations in Bali and this is one of my favs. If you like resort style accommodation but not the masses then the Pelangi is great. Staff are very friendly, location is great as you can sit by the pool and also see the beach (it’s a pity that a building now blocks half of the beach view area). 20 second walk to sit in bean bags and under umbrellas to watch beautiful sunsets and drink cocktails. Rooms very clean and air con works great.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
133,Not really a 4 star hotel,30,August 2018,"Stayed in a queen/superior room for 8 nights from 28/08/18. Paid about $160 AUD per night which included a buffet breakfast each morning. The hotel was ok but it was outdated and I think the 4 star description was a bit generous so there may be better hotels for the money we paid. When we checked in we had to pay the additional for a pull out bed for a child which we expected but they charged $75 AUD per night for a pull out bed and buffet breakfast which again I thought was a little expensive for what it was.
The staff were friendly, the buffet breakfast was edible but average and again 4 star is stretching the friendship. The rooms look out onto a centre courtyard / walkway so there is no view at all and you will need to keep your curtains closed at night for privacy. The only view is a beach view from the pool and restaurant. There was also a rooftop bar above the restaurant which would have had outstanding beach views however it was closed for renovations while we were there. The room was a reasonable size, the bed was huge and comfortable with good pillows, air conditioning, our bathroom was ok. The only problem with sleeping was that the property next door was very close to our room and on two nights they partied late and we could not sleep. Also on that property they are doing major construction work at the moment, so i guess it was these workers who were partying hard. Therefore i recommend you get a room in the Northern wing of the hotel and avoid the Southern wing for the time being. Nice pool with a swim up bar, right near the beach and an easy walk to the restaurants on either the beach or the main road, but you could probably find something a little closer to Kuta if you want to go to Kuta on a regular basis because the traffic can be a nightmare, so we power walked 40 min to get to the centre of Kuta as the traffic can be horrid and we didnt ride scooters. Also the fact that there isnt really any view or pretty vista from the rooms means that we could of stayed in a cheaper hotel within a five minute walk to the beach as there is no benefit in paying to stay in a hotel on the beach when you cant see or hear it from your room. I had to use the office for work and it was a tiny run down room with one computer, again it did the job but def not 4 star.
Back in the day yes it would have been a 4 star hotel, but as it is outdated it is 3.5 at best, and so consider this versus the price when comparing to other hotels in the area",Pelangi Bali Hotel
134,Lovely hotel great location,40,August 2018,"Only stayed here for 2 nights. When we arrived they gave us cold face towels which was much needed, fresh drink and welcoming speech which was lovely. Arrived around 1:30 couldn’t get into room till about 2:30 although check in is at 2. However due to check out being at 12 we were happy to wait the little extra time and they were very sorry about the delay. Room was a perfect size, tiny balcony but never went out on it due to the heat anyway! The decorated the room so perfect and wrote a letter to us for our anniversary which was very sweet. Although hotel looks a little dated, it was still very clean and had great facilities! And was super cheap also!! The pool was amazing, had a swim up bar and could see the beach! Had a towel service also. The breakfast was pretty standard but still good! Staff were brilliant and very friendly! Had free wifi also! Would highly recommend this place to anyone ! Will stay here again next time we are back :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
135,Nice Old Hotel with friendly staff,40,October 2017,"We stayed a bigger hotel the day before so we were of course a bit disappointed with this one. However, the warmth of the staff (specially the front desk staff) made up for it. We booked for 2 days using 2 different travel sites and so we have 2 different rooms. It was nice that on our 2nd day, they automatically checked us into the 2nd room (which was nicer and doesn't smell) while we're out doing some water activities at Nusa Dua. We got back to the hotel all exhausted and our new room was all set. The pool is also a welcome treat after swimming in the beach. Breakfast is just a small selection, but egg and toast is fine with me. Be careful as there is a small street between the hotel and the beach. There are nice small restos by the beach near the hotel as well where you can get yummier but cheaper food. Overall it was a nice stay. The beach wasn't too crowded and we enjoyed body boarding. We'll probably be back next year.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
136,Quiet Location,40,September 2018,"My sister and I spent 4 days at this hotel 2 weeks ago. We had a room each which ended up being more than we expected to pay for Bali accommodation (better to book directly with the hotel, not thru Booking.com), but it was worth it. The entrance is on a quiet side street, with a general store opposite, where we bought extra bottles of water. The rear of the building faces the ocean with a narrow, quiet lane between the property and the sand. The staff were friendly, helpful and respectful. Our rooms were beautifully decorated and clean, with plenty of room to move. The a/c was efficient and quiet and the shower had good pressure and hot water. The balcony (we were on the 2nd floor) was small but in character with the building’s design and had a peaceful outlook. The shower is over a narrow bath, which could be a bit tricky for a bigger person. The breakfast was varied, and had a variety of sliced and unsliced fresh bread which I really liked. The ocean could be seen and heard from the dining area, which was lovely. The pool was better than its photos and long enough to have a good swim. Three nights each week the upstairs restaurant opens, so we had our last dinner there. The food was lovely, but, as I found everywhere we went, there was very limited choice for vegetarians. But we both enjoyed our meals, and with the beautiful lighting and sound of the waves it was a lovely evening. This is not a brand new sparkly chrome hotel with “identikit” rooms, that have no personality or sense of connection to its location. It’s design is interesting and has character, and makes you feel like you are in a different country, which I liked. Yes, there are signs of ageing which will, no doubt, be addressed one day, but if you are after somewhere different and in a quiet location, then this hotel is worth considering. I will mention though there are no lifts, and every level has steps, inside and out, to the pool, the dining room etc. The ramps at the front of the hotel are very steep, and although there is always someone to help, this could make things frustrating if a wheelchair or walking aid are required.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
137,Great place to stay at Double Six Beach,50,September 2018,"Well very Balanese style building well maintained and original. Rooms were modern and very clean. Pool was just great, walk up bar and close to the beach.
We were very impressed with the staff and their dress was authentic Balanese.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
138,"Great location & price, value for money",40,July 2018,"Good price for beach front location, breakfast was decept for S.E.A, Good sized pool & friendly staff. Rooms clean & fair size, shame the balcony is a let down, small size with no chairs.. Great staff, nothing was to much trouble..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
139,Close to all you need,40,August 2018,"The Pelangi has a great pool with a swim up bar ,the staff are very efficient and friendly .They made us feel very welcome . They do a great buffet style breakfast everyday with an egg station . It’s located right by the beach so you can just pop out to a bar on the beach for dinner or just to watch the spectacular sunset . On the entrance side there is a Circle K right opposite for any water or snack needs you may have and a five minute walk to more restaurants and lots of shopping. The Pelangi has its own Spa which we found great for a massage after a busy day. You also get a 15 minute massage free on arrival . The rooms aren’t the flashiest but they are clean and tidy with everything you need , aircon, tv ,hair dryer ,very comfortable beds. The bathrooms could do with a update but great water pressure ! . We enjoyed our stay here .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
140,Great Value Seminyak Beach Hotel!,50,May 2018,"This hotel is great value for a beach side hotel so close to Seminyak!! After reading the reviews we were worried that we had booked this hotel.. however we were pleasantly surprised and we were very happy with our stay.
The hotel is an old traditional Balinese style hotel, we did not have an issue with it being old as the room was sufficient, comfortable and clean.
The pool is lovely and we spent a lot of time lounging around and using the swim up bar. Breakfast had a good selection and great egg station where they would cook whatever eggs you wanted. One night we ate at the hotel rooftop restaurant however as a vegetarian there were no options for me but they accommodated me by making a vegetarian version of a dish.
The location is right on the beach and easy to get around. Leaving the hotel from the back there is a taxi rank and exclusion shops just a 2 min walk away.
Overall a good stay, I would visit again and recommend this hotel based on value.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
141,Very Disappointed,20,August 2018,"We were aware that it was an older hotel but we were disappointed to see just how in need of a face lift this hotel required. Our room was large, beds were rock hard with old blankets. Bathroom was large but tiles were stained and floor looked dirty. All furniture in need of replacement. But it was tidy and staff were lovely. Pool area was nice overlooking the beach and breakfast area and meals ok. Location great and i would have to say it was the staff that made our stay ok. Oh and it doesn't look anything like the online photos.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
142,Last refurbished in the 1950s....and with no adult supervision,30,August 2018,"Firstly I have to admit, this hotel is in a great location. It's right on the beach, it's near a few great beach bars, enjoys a great view of the sunset and is very convenient. But that's where it ends.

I have stayed at 5 different hotels in Seminyak and this was the most expensive. It was also the absolute worst.

Yes the staff are friendly, but tiny puppies are friendly too. When something goes wrong or a request is a little out of the ordinary, they are not equipped to deal with it.

It is also very very past it's best and dark.
The position of the hotel on the block means it needs to be long and thin to jam as many rooms as possible on the space whilst joining the road to the beach path. Trying to get a central courtyard means the two blocks are close together giving very little natural light, virtually no sun and ensuring the rooms always look gloomy. There are tiny balcony areas (downstairs) that dont even have enough space to walk past the table without turning side on and undertaking a crab impersonation! Some of the room dont even have a balcony and there is one chair by the pathway just outside the door.

The pool is okay inside but the whole stone facade that was the original build is now old, dirty, dated and ugly looking. Combined with a gravel type of base around the beds that had many folks going ""goodness that hurts, I wish I'd worn shoes!""

The spa... oh, yuk. Last hotel I stayed in was Amadeus Villas. Beautiful spa, amazing. Balinese theme, obviously. Soothing. Clean. Just divine. This one, a 1950s prison. I've attached some pictures.

We were allowed to use the spa to shower on our last night. I was terrified to put anything down anywhere, it was so mucky looking. Truly horrid.

Then we asked for a hairdryer. ""Yes, on request "" we were told.
""Okay, we are requesting a hairdryer!""
""No, in rooms only. Perhaps towel dry"" I AM NOT KIDDING!

Eventually one from the 1960s was found and we breathed a sigh of relief until we discovered - no plug in that prison shower area...

The rooms were clean, but for $200+ per night I expected a little more than a clean room.
The bathroom was as old as everything else and we had to take slow showers as the drain was blocked and the water wouldn't run away. We told them a few times, but the solution was to give us more towels to mop up the overflow.

Not the worst in the world, just the worst and most expensive I've come across in Seminyak. You are paying to be 10m from the beach.

Consider wisely before booking.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
143,"Nice accommodation, great staff and location",40,August 2018,"We stayed for 5 night during our Bali trip and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a great location, right on the beach, and has a great pool. We did not eat in the restaurant, as there are so many places to eat in Seminyak, however the breakfast was good, although quite basic.
The staff were fantastic, always polite, courteous and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
144,Lovely staff,40,August 2018,"I have recently returned from a long stay (19 days) and i thoroughly enjoyed my time here. The location is great, right on the beach and right by la plancha and easy walking or taxi distance to resturants and bars. The room was great as it had everything you needed and a strong shower. The breakfast was nice and basic and varied slightly day to day. The main asset of the hotel was the staff though everyone from the pool attendent, the room makers, the people on the front desk and the resturant workers were all super polite and professional and wanted to try and help all the time. The only downsides was the air conditioning was really loud and that the hotel could do with a little TLC but it blends in well with the balinese setting. Overall i would definatly reccomend this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
145,Second honeymoon,40,August 2018,"We spent a week at this hotel and could have stayed another week we enjoyed it so much.The location is perfect both for easy access to shopping and the beach. The rooms were lovey,the pool and breakfast were awesome, and the food and drinks were very affordable. Definitely worth a visit if you are headed to Seminyak!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
146,Superb Location,40,August 2018,"The day before we started our holiday these reviews terrified me our couples trip was going to be a disaster. I was thrilled when we got there! The building looked older than we thought but inside was great, huge, tidy! Our room was the cheap superior but could not fault! Yes the balcony was small but you have the beach and loungers 30seconds from your room, the room was clean, comfy and the staff I cannot thank enough! The pool was fantastic, the spa was our first time trying a couples massage and was excellent and the breakfast was right up our alley :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
147,Awesome Location,40,August 2018,We really enjoyed our stay there. Right on the beach. Pool bar is great to hang out at. Friendly and helpful staff. My wife left her phone outside on a chair and the gardener handed it to reception. Thought it was gone forever. Fantastic meals at dinner in the restaurant. Breakfast was good with lots to choose from. Rooms are a little dated but pretty good for Bali. Close to bars and shops. Would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended,Pelangi Bali Hotel
148,Good stay,40,August 2018,"Lovely hotel, great location as it is right on the beach. The food was good and staff were very friendly. Lots of choice for breakfast and we loved the egg station! Pool area was great too. The rooms are a little dark and dated and the bathroom needs a bit of a revamp. Also, we don't think the sheets or towels were changed at all as they still had marks on them after the room had been cleaned. There was a note saying if you want them changed, leave them on the floor which we did, but they were not changed. I know I could have asked for clean sheets and towels but you would expect them to be changed as we stayed for 2 weeks.
Apart from this this, we had a good stay here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
149,Dark and dreary.,30,July 2018,"We stayed here for 9 days, the rooms were dark and dated, no shelf space for toiletries in the bathroom, no non slip mats for in the bath as shower is over the bath. There is no real patio if on the ground floor, just a few steps to the very small area between the two buildings. If you are on an upper floor the balcony is tiny, only room for one person, because of the small area with a walkway between buildings there is no privacy. Be prepared for plenty of stairs. We were also not impressed by the way clients were able to have drinks on the pool edge near the entry steps, as well as food, and some of the language was inexcusable, especially as children were around. Would we stay here again- NO.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
150,Dark and dated,10,July 2018,"We stayed one night only thank goodness.
Terribly disappointing.
The hotel is very very dated and in need of renovation.
Not only cosmetic/decor changes need but fundamentals as well. The bathroom we had was very poor indeed. Fittings and fixtures worn/corroded.
Room we had was very dark even with the lights on- quite unlike the official photos.
Room service was inedible.
Breakfast was ok.
Pool sparkling.
Pool toilets dirty.
Check in efficient.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
151,Good stay,40,July 2018,We stayed here for 3 nights. The staff are good and very helpful. The pool is awesome and has a swim up bar. It is in a great location of Seminyak walking distance from markets and they offer a shuttle bus to close locations such as Seminyak square etc. Across the road from the beach and close to restaurants. The only thing I found disappointing was that some of the rooms don’t look like the photos the room was nice but the bathroom was old and had a shower/ bath combination with shower curtain which was small and not very nice. Other than that we had a great stay !,Pelangi Bali Hotel
152,Relaxing holiday,50,July 2018,"Very Friendly, Clean, happy people who work there, restaurant was great, had breaky every morning, what more do you want. Room was lovely, great location, pool was nice, and it was right on the beach. This will be our new Bali stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
153,Loud and old - 3 star,10,July 2018,"For party people its good. Its so loud, a party is happening and they dont even provide with ear plugs. Very disappointed. Not relaxing at all. Also definitely not a 4 Star - its a 3 star. If you are a teenager on party holiday - go for it. For couples of family its a nightmare.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
154,GREAT LOCATION! GREAT STAFF!,50,July 2018,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The beach is close, the food and service was excellent, and the staff was exceptional. It's located at the end of a street so it's not very busy. The rooms and beds were comfortable and clean. I would stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
155,Such a great place,50,June 2018,"This place never fails.
we love it here our second home and family.
Some rooms have been upgraded and they are lovely and staff are always great and friendly.
Its so close to everything and a circle k out front, also La Plancha out back on the beach just about in front of hotel.
Food is great and breakfast is everything you need.
See you next year for our 6th stay
Karen and Steve.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
156,Good hotel by the beach,40,June 2018,"We stayed here for about 2 nights. It is probably a 3.5 to 4 star hotel. Our stay was okie. Staff were polite and willing to help you. The walls lining outside the room were high and you don't get much view as the rooms are facing each other. What I liked about this hotel is that it has direct access to the beach. So, whether it is to watch the morning sunrise or evening sunset, this hotel is very conveniently located. Breakfast quality is okie.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
157,Ticked all the boxes,50,June 2018,"This is a great option if you want to be close to the beach, have access to a large swimming pool and cafe/cocktail bar. Few minutes walk to the main road with shops/cafes, but also plenty of dining options along the beach which is right outside the back of the hotel. Some comments here say the hotel is dated. This isn’t fully untrue, however it is quite architecturally authentic and charming, and we felt it was being maintained, albeit for some aged bathroom fittings etc. Shower pressure however was excellent! It just ain’t a ‘modern’ building, so got to accept it for what it is. We didn’t notice any cleanliness/damp issues, and it poured one of the nights we were there. We’d definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
158,A pleasant stay.,30,June 2018,"We stayed for 7 nights as a family group of up to 12 people at times. Check in was efficient and staff allocated us five rooms in a row. Check in staff were pretty helpful as were the porters and guys at the tourist info / taxi counter. Unfortunately though, despite being told we could exchange money at the front counter (like most hotels), on most occasions we tried we were told they had run out of money. However, there is a reputable money ex-changer “Central Kuta Money exchange” a short walk up the road opposite the Courtyard Marriot.
Rooms are dated and very basic but they are comfortable and clean. The air-conditioning worked well and was not noisy or annoying. The mini bar fridge was another story though, we did have to unplug it as it was unbearably noisy.
The bathroom was average with not enough bench space and the provided amenities were not great (shampoo & body wash). In fairness, you do pay for what you get and we were not expecting the same sort of experience you would get at a place like Double Six Luxury Hotel. The rooms were cleaned really quickly each day. They were usually done by the time we returned from breakfast at around 9 – 9.30 a.m. We found the beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean.
The pool was good but this location seems to attract the sort of clientele that have no shame to sit in the pool (nowhere near the swim up bar) and smoke, even around kids. I don’t mind people smoking at the swim up bar because that’s expected but smoking in the pool at the opposite end on the steps where everyone enters the pool is disgusting and unfair on other patrons.
The breakfast options were average but the quantities were sufficient. My only complaint is that the only available scrambled or fried eggs have to be ordered from the egg station. There are none already prepared and therefore, the wait can be lengthy if there are a few people in line in front of you.
By far the best part of the hotel is the location. It is directly opposite the beach and a short walk from some great beach bars (particularly Bali Juice Park) and entertainment. Directly outside the front gates are a Circle K and a laundry which are both really convenient. We found the laundry provided fast turn around and good service.
The only view from each room is out to the centre courtyard and/or into your neighbour’s room directly opposite. Leaving the curtains closed when changing is recommended.
There are not much grounds and the centre courtyard between rooms is pretty dreary and in need of a bit of TLC. However, the buildings are pretty traditional and pleasant enough to look at. I guess this is no real issue if you don’t spend much time here and only return at the end of each day before going to bed.
I would return with a group or family as we found it a pleasant place to return to at the end of each day to socialise around the pool area before going out to dinner and then bed. I would not return as just a couple if I was looking for something a bit more luxurious and with a view.
In summary I would describe the Pelangi as cheap and cheerful with its main selling point being location. If the rating system allowed it, I would give this place a rating of 3 1/2 stars rather than just 3. It's better than ""average"" but not quite ""very good.""",Pelangi Bali Hotel
159,NOT a 4* hotel! Tired and dated. Worst bathroom in Bali?,20,June 2018,"I was so disappointed in this hotel. I came to Bali expecting to stay in a 4 star hotel of international standard, and what I got was more like a 2 star. The room itself (supposed to be a ""superior"" room!!) is fine but nothing special. No bathrobes provided. Toiletries minimal. Minibar fridge is so noisy I had to unplug it.
The bathroom is AWFUL. There are no towel rails on the walls. The hot water mixer in the basin sink doesn't work properly so you can't get hot water (only barely luke warm). The bathroom has a shower-over-bath with a horrid shower curtain and mould around the edges of the bath and up the walls. The shower head probably hasn't been changed since the 1980s and sprays water all over the place. It is so depressing and just nasty.
The only good thing about the hotel is the location - right opposite the beach and close to lots of bars and restaurants. It's great sitting out on the beach at night having a drink.
I really wish I had stayed somewhere else, as the quality of this hotel has put a bit of a downer on my Bali holiday experience, especially considering the price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
160,Beautiful accomodation with attentive staff,40,June 2018,"First thing...if you have mobility issues, this isn't the place for you. There is no lift and access to restaurant and some rooms requires stairs and long corridors. The hotel itself is very attractive. The rooms are spacious and have access to open air court yard/balcony depending on the level of your room. Wi-Fi is excellent and I could not fault the service of the staff. Hotel is around the corner of many eateries, bars and shops. Lots of money exchange shops and well served by taxis. Caution. Use My Blue Bird as other taxis will try to rip you off. Breakfast at the hotel has many options. We tried dinner one evening and wasn't impressed. Overall though, an extremely pleasurable experience. I would stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
161,Enjoyable stay,40,May 2018,"Pleasantly surprised with the hotel after being worried about some reviews before we travelled. For the price you pay for the hotel you really can't complain with the facilities.

Pool was amazing and the swim up bar was great for a few cocktails. Breakfast was good as well with an egg station where you can get omelettes etc.

Location of hotel is a real plus as it is right next to the beach and there are a stretch of beach bars nearby. If you ever need to get around or do day trips there are taxi offices and excursion places nearby. There is a garage over the road as well if you ever need snacks or water.

Overall good value for money with friendly helpful staff and good location. Would be happy to stay again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
162,Very satisfied,40,May 2018,"The best thing about the hotel is its amazing location! The beach in front of it is very nice to watch the sunset, has a lot of cafeterias/bars/restaurants. The main road of Seminyak is walking distance (10-15mins) with a lot of shops, bars, restaurants, massage places etc. we stayed 5 nights and we were extremely satisfied with our choice! The pool is also big and great to swim. The rooms are good and clean. The staff is really helpful and polite always. I would definitely recommend it and visit it again and again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
163,Disappointing.,10,May 2018,"This is a very tired and outdated hotel. Isolated, unless you want beachside.
Not good value. Staff ok. Breakfast/restaurant very poor. Outdoor upper bar/restaurant has lovely view but is hardly ever open (reason I booked!). The one dinner I had there was probably the worst meal I’ve ever had in SE Asia. Disgusting.
The pool area is uninviting. Beachside u have to pay to lie on lounger. Overall, disappointing experience.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
164,Good hotel in excellent position,40,May 2018,"This is a good hotel, very well positioned right on the beach and within walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants. We stayed 10 days, initially we were disappointed with the look of the hotel as it's a bit run down but after a few days we changed our minds. The room was pretty big, a large and comfortable bed, an ok bathroom with the shower over the bath (the water pressure was superb), a balcony that we didn't use as it was only just big enough for two chairs, and pretty good storage. The breakfasts were good with quite a variety of food so all tastes. The pluses of the hotel were: right on the beach, good views of surfers, pool was nice, close to Seminyak for shopping and restaurants, very pleasant and helpful staff. The tour desk operator was very helpful and arranged 3 trips for us: a full day with our own driver (well worth doing), snorkel trip (very disappointing) and a cycle tour (a real highlight). Overall this hotel is good for the money they charge.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
165,Stunning location,40,June 2017,"Slightly off the beaten track. Located on the beach, between Semiyak and Legian, with direct access. No roads in front, accommodation to the rear make for perfect beach access. Two storey apartment style accommodation exists but very pleasant. Large rooms are in very clean well kept condition. Balcony style accommodation exists with the upstairs the pick due to privacy and views. The on beach restaurant and the double pool are to die for. Fantastic hotel and we would recommend this hotel anytime.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
166,Good location and value. Great facilities and friendly service,40,May 2018,"Great for families and solo travellers. Room was clean, strong shower pressure, air con room, comfortable and big bed. Directly across the road from the beach. Wonderful pool. Delicious buffet breakfast. Hotel provides baggage service and use of shower after checkout to allow time to refresh before late flight departures. Hotel facilities are also still available to use the day of checkout. Will stay again. Very close to all restaurants along the beach. Dairy and laundry services across the road from the hotel lobby.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
167,Great Location,40,May 2018,"The street appearance of this hotel isn't the best, it needs some attention as its getting a little run down. However can't fault anything. The rooms are cleaned well, nice selection for breakfast, pool area kept beautiful, nothing was too much trouble.
Its right on the beach with some lovely spots to go at night. Double six street is a short walk with lots of shops for shopping. Would definately stay again!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
168,Not what we expected,40,May 2018,When we arrived I admit I thought the hotel was rather outdated and the photos rather different to reality. However Pelangi was exactly what we needed. We didn't want to be near the hustle and bustle of Kura but could walk to Seminyak streets if needed. We were right opposite the beach and the gorgeous umbrellas at La Plancha. The breakfast was limited but enough to keep us going through the day. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on and loved coming home to it each night. Will definitely be returning!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
169,short family stay,30,March 2018,convenient location for beach goers but just too far to wak in heat/humidity with young kids. Nice bedroom with large king bed - big room and very clean good aircon. friendly staff. Breakfasts a bit basic as they are in Bali generally.Nice pool with child friendly areas. Nice beach sunset bars just a few metres outside hotel..Major fail was the lobby bar - lobby is an open air area with no aircon and seabreeze blocked by building - so lobby bar is stifling hot and uncomfortable..The hotel is a little outdated but still nice..,Pelangi Bali Hotel
170,"Great location, very run down",20,April 2018,"Highlights:
Located just across from the beach with a view of the waves rolling in
Steps away from La Plancha

Lowlights:
Price
Dilapidated and facilities not well cared for
Only allowed to use the hotel taxi service or go out to the street to get one
On arrival to our room the electrical guy was sitting in there chilling out. Let's just say there wasn't a huge rush to depart and he made a point of checking the toilet prior to leaving as he had used it. Odd...
Water slow to heat
Very slow check in process

It's a shame as this hotel has the potential to be great!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
171,Stayed one night and left !,20,March 2018,"Rooms furnished OK but no view whatsoever. No outside space at all - no balcony or terrace, just a view of another guests room.
The website photos are a complete misrepresentation and bear little resemblance to what you see when you get there.
Would not recommend this at all if you like the open air and to sit outside.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
172,We would return,30,March 2018,"Yes it’s a little outdated, it is also inexpensive and right on the beach front. We had a nice ground floor superior room, king bed and rollaway. Clean. Comfortable. Cold air conditioning. Small fridge. Hotel supplies free pool/beach towels by the pool and room had Hair dryer, kettle and tea/coffee etc, tv with several free movie channels. Free wifi works well most of the time. Great swimming pool, good size. Great breakfast in the restaurant though the music got annoying. I like the decor, the building, the grounds, very Balinese. Staff are fantastic. Free shuttle buses daily. Little shop across the road to buy super cheap bottled water and snacks. Money changer in hotel or short walk away. Great location, clean beach. Less than $5 taxi to Legian (and we also walked to Legian). Lots of restaurants big and small close by. Negatives for us are paper thin wall, neighbours using cutlery at 6 am was annoying (and their tv) lucky for us we are early risers; And our air conditioner is like a loud wind sound.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
173,Could not fault it,50,March 2018,"Location is unbeatable, the superior room was wonderful with great king bed, clean and suited our needs. The breakfast was wonderful, the restaurant prices were reasonable and the pool is awesome. Right in the beach door andndirectly opposite the bean bag beach bars.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
174,No Way !,10,March 2018,"The good points
1 the localization, closed to some bars and restaurant, shops
2 the staff at the reception

The bad points
The building, just awful !
The hotel is a long corridor
The rooms
So glumly so smelly
The bathroom...beurk
There is no view except on your neighbor room

There is many hotels around , enjoy the other hotel",Pelangi Bali Hotel
175,Amazing,50,February 2018,"Perfect location, friendly staff, lovely balinese style rooms that were always clean and fantastic price! The atmosphere of this hotel was exactly what i was looking for. I have no hesitation of staying here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
176,"Great accomodation, pool and bar",50,March 2018,"I booked this hotel through a 3d party and was not disappointed, It is incredibly affordable and just luxurious enough, its right on the beach and the pool is huge, including a swim up bar. The complementary breakfast is the most extensive breakfast Ive ever seen a hotel provide, and it includes Indonesian fare along side usual western breakfast items. The location was convenient right on the beach in Seminyak and the staff were just absolutely pleasant.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
177,Pleasant Stay,40,February 2018,"This was our first time in Bali and i must say that if i go back i would stay in this hotel again. We stayed on the second floor with a balcony. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, it also has air conditioning . The breakfast is included and has a different variety everyday.The resort is a little outdated but it is still pleasant to stay there. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. The pool was lovely and the beach is at your back door. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. the prices are not too expensive but the meals are not very big. there are taxis everywhere but make sure you get the bluebird taxis as you can bargain with them.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
178,Pleasant stay in Seminyak,40,February 2018,"This hotel has a good location right by the beach with a great pool. The restaurant area overlooks the pool and has the beach in the background. If you are looking for ultra-modern accommodation, this hotel is not for you. That said, we found the rooms to be clean and comfortable and a reasonable size. All accommodation rooms had very good air conditioning. The rooms do not seem to block noise from people talking loudly or yelling in the hallways. Friends staying on the ground floor had rooms that smelt a little bit 'musty' or damp, but we did not have this in our first floor room. We found hotel staff to be very friendly and obliging.

The hotel does not call standard taxis to the premises, but can arrange a fixed price private transfer vehicle and will provide you with a receipt. While more expensive than a taxi, it can be worth it when returning to the airport, rather than dragging your luggage down the street. There are always plenty of taxis passing at the end of the street, which are easy to hail for your other trips.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
179,The regular,40,February 2018,We stay every year very friendly staff reasonably price convenient location it’s not the ritzs but it’s a bed and it’s clean it has a good pool and swim up bar . The breakfast is included and has a good variety of food but we eat out every second day just because the local restaurant are excellent.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
180,Underwhelmed & overpriced,20,February 2018,"First time to Bali and this is we’re my travel agent recommended- never going book with her again.
My family stayed here for 5 nights in Feb.
The hotel is in serious need of renovations for sure, it’s pretty run down and not luxurious at all. Beds are hard as bricks and didn’t get a cot which we did request through our travel agent.
I wouldn’t stay here again, I brought my 11 and 1 year old daughters with me, the only recreational thing to do on the hotel grounds was swim in the pool, hardly family friendly.

On a positive note, staff were really friendly, breakfast was good, so was the shower pressure, even though it was run down it was a clean and tidy hotel despite house keeping never replacing our used cutlery.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
181,Stay by the Sea,50,December 2017,"The room was clean and still had a touch of old school (but not old) Balinese furniture. The staff were accommodating and the hotel backs onto Double 6 Beach which is sprinkled with beach bars that offer live music, food and great bean bags to relax on - the perfect place for sunset.
This hotel obviously has a good reputation as it was quite busy",Pelangi Bali Hotel
182,"Quiet location, nice and relaxing",40,October 2017,"Hotel very nice, with friendly/helpful staff. Room nice, had all we needed. Pool area really nice, with good swim up bar. Breakfast excellent, lovely juices. Very short walk onto beach, which was nice, but dirty.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
183,Incredible,40,August 2017,"I would give full stars but the mattress was very hard, if you like a very firm mattress this place can’t be faulted. Breakfast buffet was delicious, staff super friendly, and everything very clean. I will be staying here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
184,Dated concrete labyrinth. Not “luxury” by any means. Poor by Bali standards,20,January 2018,"Photos misrepresent the hotel. Dated, concrete, very large impersonal hotel. Staff mostly nice if you happen to bump into them. Breakfast staff attentive but breakfast poor and more to fill a hole rather than enjoy. Stayed in many places in Bali and there are far better for the price. Hotel won’t/can’t call you a taxi to the door. Asked for a transfer to Canggu and they wanted to charge almost double what the cars in the street charge. Apart from this front of house staff were generally good. Really didn’t enjoy it here. Pool is very concrete style with their photos misrepresenting. Near to beach and decent location. Try elsewhere.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
185,Good location on the beach,30,January 2018,Pelangi is located on the beach in Legian - between Kuta and Seminyak and not actually in Seminyak. It’s about 20 minuets walk and just as long drive to Seminyak square considering the absurd traffic situation in Seminyak center. The hotel is nice but a bit worn down. Rooms are okey but one of our rooms were extremely damp and humid. The pool area is also nice but small considering the amount of rooms. Breakfast is ordinary without the little extra.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
186,"Old hotel, great service!",40,January 2018,"Food and service is excellent! Loved the breakfast! Egg station is worst I have ever seen mind, slow and staff need better supervision! However food was excellent and staff Around hotel, so happy!

Rooms are small and dated and the hotel is not posh! However fits budget and seemed fair considering beach is on door step!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
187,Wierd vibe - invasive and way over priced for what it is,10,January 2018,"The price is the first factor and if it wasn't for how much I paid I wouldn't be so disappointed, there are much better hotels you could stay at for the same price or similar. Service was invasive and hotel is dated and feels dirty.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
188,Nice hotel but getting a bit old.,30,December 2017,We had good service at the hotel. Some areas need a bit of maintenance but all over good stay. Nice pool and pool bar. Good views from the pool to beach. We only had breakfast at the hotel and that was great. Other guests said the dinners were also very good. Not to badly located but its a bit of a walk to get to main areas of Seminyak.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
189,A rip off & bad vibes,10,January 2018,"The place is completely overpriced. And breakfast isn’t ‘free’, you’re paying for it in the total amount.

From the moment we arrived we felt uncomfortable. The staff were not perceptive to our needs (exhausted from travel and wanted to get to our room) - they insisted on a long drawn out shpeel about everything.

We sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for the room. The bartender got our order wrong, which happens no big deal.. but when we asked to have it changed he retorted “you pay more then,” which we did not like at all. Not appropriate treatment for how expensive it is.

My husband got sick while we were at the hotel. I can’t say for sure it was their food, but we had to visit the sos clinic while there. And had to stay another night and pay for it so he could recover. The doctor said bacterial which means food or other people.

The breakfast was a joke. Fried noodles, rice and French toast has got to be the oddest combination I’ve ever seen. I could get on board with it had it not tasted so awful. Flies in the fruit and nothing special.

Our stay came to about £80/ night. I think £20 would have been appropriate for what we got. Would not stay here again even if it was free.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
190,Hmmmm...,20,January 2018,"I decided to go away for Christmas on my own and after a little research I decided on Pelangi. The pics looked great and the reviews were quite good so I paid the beachside premium to stay at Pelangi.

The overall hotel is dated. The rooms were small and faced each other rather than the beach. The rooms also had no direct sunlight which made that the smell of damp, was at times, overbearing.

I found the rooms also lacked insulation and the noises from people coming and going at all hours were completely audible and disturbing.

Breakfast was ok although having the only pool in front of the restaurant I found awkward for me. I don’t like the idea of people seeing me in my swimmers while eating their breakfast.

It is not the sort of place that you can hang out at for a day. The common areas are not comfortable but the location is fantastically close the the beach and the main strip.

Finally, the bell boys clearly had some sort of side business going and I felt a little pestered each time I left the hotel to allow them to hire a car for me which they would drive and I would pay for. It was off putting.

I would return only if it was extremely cheap.

Happy travels!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
191,Pre-NYE,20,December 2017,"So I have to admit I am a little biased because of the last-minute price paid at this hotel the day before NYE ($111.00 USD) which may not reflect how much it usually should go for, By my estimation...about $60 USD per night is about right. If you go in expecting a $60/night hotel then I think you will be pleased.

One word...”cheesy.” This hotel is weird in that there are basement floors which although are on the pool level, are oddly designed, depressing, and poorly lit compared to so many of the other nearby hotels that are at least modern, very nice for the same price and are designed beautifully.

Also did not like the unusual rules, for example there is a charge for losing the plastic card room key which makes no sense since as it costs the hotel nothing to decativate and replace. Also, guests must leave their ID at the front desk which seems invasive. The poolside bar is unusually expensive for the menu...pretty much garbage bar food, poor selection with prices that are not typical of Bali.

Aside from that the sevice is “attentive” and invasive. I suspect there are other things going n at this hotel which have caused the staff to “pay more attention.”

Overall, as a frequent business and leisure traveler in 4-5 star ranked hotels around the world I was surprised at the price charged for the experience. Final thoughts...I would not stay here again and would not recommend it to others. This place seriously needs a remodel or at minimum should lower its prices or offer somethng really special to make up for its several shortcomings.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
192,"Great access to the most beautiful beach at Seminyak, Bali",40,December 2017,"The beach was literally at the doorstep of the hotel. It was very convenient to swim at the beach and then cleaned up at the hotel’s shower. The staffs were very friendly and chatty. We got best value, as they did not charge our extra bed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
193,A very affordable hotel and good location,40,November 2017,"This hotel has lots of character in traditional Balinese style, the hotel is quite old but is well kept and maintained, with beautiful gardens and a really nice pool. The rooms are really clean and spacious with comfortable beds.
We were stuck in Bali late November 2017 due the volcano activity and this hotel gave us a free night stay and free breakfast which helped us out until the airport reopened. Thanks Pelangi Hotel",Pelangi Bali Hotel
194,Good hotel with great location,30,November 2017,"There are many good things with this hotel. The location is good if you need to be in Seminyak, the staff is friendly, pool is nice and the hotel restaurant is really good. The rate is decent.
Time has taken it's toll on the venue, it would need some upgrading. The rooms are ok, not as big as advertised, we upgraded for a fee to de luxe because wee needed more space. The normal (superior) is ok but when you carry stuff for many weeks things simply did not fit into the closets. Hence only 3 stars, even if the staff and location would deserve a 4th.
If I would come to Seminyak (doubt it) I could stay again. But the double six beach is not swim friendly and fills with debris after every high tide. So I preferred the pool area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
195,Mrs,50,November 2017,"Lovely place room was very comfortable, friendly staff and we the restaurant was also very good with reasonable prices. I loved that we could walk out the back to the beach and close to the little shops. Also there’s a great yoga studio within walking distance.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
196,Pictures are deceiving,20,November 2017,"We booked 4 hotel rooms for 4 couples. We chose the hotel because of good reviews, amazing photos and proximity to the beach. However we were quite disappointed with the hotel overall. The best thing about the hotel is it’s location. Another positive thing was they organised complimentary cake for birthday however there were several flaws. The hotel looks quite old. The rooms are average (small) but the toilet/shower is substandard - quite old and needs renovation. There is no view from the room - in fact all rooms face towards each other so there is no privacy if you keep the curtains open. The clocks in the lobby were showing wrong time and it wasn’t changed even when we informed the hotel staff about it. Breakfast was ok -nothing special. They don’t even serve coconut water at the hotel. Who doesn’t serve coconut water at a beach hotel! Overall it’s more like a budget hotel, not worth the money, pictures on the internet are quite deceiving - the hotel looks very different in reality. I will only recommend for location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
197,DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,10,November 2017,"In January 2017 my family and I booked 3 x Units here for 6 nights. We arrived 2 nights ago. We checked OUT, TODAY.
Our unit was creeping with mould in the bathroom. The bed linen had not been changed for weeks and stunk. Renovations were happening in 10 of the units on a 12 hour a day basis within 20 feet our our unit. We were NEVER informed of any restoration work being done in the Resort, not even at check in........
The buffet breakfast (although included in the nightly rate) was inedible to most of us.
The Sunset Bar, a brochure feature of the Resort, was closed without explanation.
The pool umbrellas were closed up by staff & taken away at any hint of rain (which considering it is wet season was daily at 2pm).
The whole Resort, incl the rooms, is in desperate need of a massive Spring Clean and the pathways around the Resort and Entry Driveway need pressure washing to get rid of mould and years of dirt and grime.

My wife and I own and manage a Holiday Resort in Queensland, Australia and provide above and beyond accommodations to the guests at our Resort. This is our job. We thrive on the positive reviews our guests are constantly posting on this site.
Considering we were being charged the equivalent of what it would cost to holiday at a waterfront establishment on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, without the cost of the airfares, you can imagine how disappointed we are having to find an alternative accommodation after just 2 nights in this disappointment of a Resort.

SEMINYAK Beach: Again, such a disappointing experience given what we have told by so many over the last few months.
The Beach is the Island's dumping ground. Every item of trash ends up on the beach & in the ocean. We walked a 100 metres along the beach & vowed never to return to it.
Disgusting and horrendous are the only 2 words I can offer.

PLEASE READERS, Reconsider your holiday choices and travel to a location where you will bring home good memories, happy experiences and no health threatening issues or lasting infections.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
198,Very old hotel in need of updating,20,November 2017,"Staff here are nice and polite, but rooms are terribly in need of updating. We actually stayed in what they called their updated superior room - the bathroom was dated, falling apart
- bedding was smelly and itchy despite being replaced at our request
- one of our beds was 2 singles of different heights pushed together
- heaps of other cleanliness issues too numerous to list
- included buffet breakfast was terrible, all the food seemed stale or cheaply cooked
- their rooftop sunset lounge is only open 3 days a week
- half the units are being renovated (to our units standard so don’t get your hopes up) so constant construction noise

Being on the beach isn’t really that great here, go back 100m and stay at Breezes it’s amazing compared to this place!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
199,Not 4 star as advertised smells of sewerage,10,November 2017,"Ok hotel more like 2 star hotel than the advertised 4 star. Staff brilliant other than when we checked in he was rude.
Breakfast poor, saved by the egg station otherwise would go hungry. Pool filthy hair and rubbish in pool and same rubbish around the pool edge for 9 days. Had dinner once food was poor, abusive and aggressive chef when complained.
The room smelt of sewerage and covered in mosquitoes, buy some bug spray.
Hotel services rip you off was offered airport transfer for 200k said yes eventually asked for pre payment so the dodgy porter got 50k the guy in the capri shirt who organised it got 100k and the poor driver using his own car and petro got 50k.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
200,7days first Bali trip,40,November 2017,"After much research I picked this hotel, and I'm glad I did. The pool area, entry foyer and rooms are beautiful. The breakfast is great. And the resturant at night has a long list of different types of food. It's right on the beach. Staff are more than willing to help where ever they can. Only down fall is it is a far walk to other areas such as Kuta and Legian. But if ur up for some fitness, it's not a problem",Pelangi Bali Hotel
201,Great location and staff,40,November 2017,"Really enjoyed my time at Pelangi this week. The pool is great and affordable drinks at the swim up bar. Across the road from the beach so you can’t beat location.
Staff are very, very friendly and made our trip. Rooms very clean and spacious, the only downfall is the dated bathrooms with yucky shower curtains.
The hotel only gives one key which is annoying if a couple (like us) stays as the power turns off and nothing charges whilst you are out of room.
Beds very comfortable. Breakfast included and pretty good variety. Nothing flash.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
202,Perfect Location and Lovely Staff!,50,November 2017,"I stayed at Pelangi with my mother for 6 nights. We could not have asked for anything more! The location was perfect - on the beach and only a short walk from the local shops, restaurants and cafes. We also felt very safe in the area.

The staff were lovely and the room was kept fresh and clean - perfect when returning from a hot day of activities!

The pool was relaxing, and sun lounges were often available.

Thankyou Pelangi - we will be back!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
203,Beautiful and relaxing,50,August 2017,"This is an older style hotel but right on the beach. The swimming pool and swim up bar is gorgeous. The staff are just amazing, friendly and do helpful, cannot recommend this hotel enough. Will definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
204,"Great location, fantastic view and very good service",50,November 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the Pelangi hotel for 7 nights and had a very good experience.

The staff are really professional and go the extra mile to help out. They will happily book restaurants and taxi drivers if you go to the reception.
The amenities are good and free shuttle to Seminyak square very convenient.

Our room was big and always cleaned to a high standard. The breakfast was varied enough and the food was good.

The big swimming pool and view/quick access to the beach is the main attraction and although the hotel could do with some fresh paint and quick touch ups, it was very pleasant to stay there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
205,Returning again and again,50,August 2017,"I've now lost count of the amount of times I've stayed at this hotel, I just love it. Great rooms, spotlessly clean, with comfortable king size beds. This time I did not have a room with an adjoining door (which I mentioned last review), I find these rooms a little noisier from guests next door. Super friendly staff and a please to stay in the hotel. Only one negative, dinner at the restaurant needs serious attention.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
206,Great Ubud Hotel,50,October 2017,"The hotel was a wonderful place to visit. The room was clean and well kept. The staff were friendly, polite and very helpful.
The location is great for restaurants and the hotel shuttle will drop and pick you up from town.
Also the monkey sanctuary is a 2 min walk from there.
The rooftop terrace has great views of the rice fields to the back, and is a place I would love to visit again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
207,great hotel and pool,40,October 2017,"my fiancee and i stayed here for 5 nights,lovely older style hotel ,right on the beach with a lovely swim up pool and bar,great staff and nice room,clean and modern,best breakfasts as the food was always HOT.which i find most of the other,even more expensive places fail to do",Pelangi Bali Hotel

The hotel rooms are well appointed we were in 206 cleaned everyday and fresh towels - air con which was a must it is left on all day by the hotel - The pool bar is great runs from 11am serves drinks and food lovely on a hot day - The beach is just as short walk from the hotel the one we used with the purple beds - lovely and comfy the guy that runs it was accomodating brings you ice cold beers to your bed - we stayed for the sunsets quite a few nights which was unreal so beautiful and popular.

Would I recommed this hotel -= Yes for location, staff and accomodation
Yes - we will be back at some time",Pelangi Bali Hotel
210,very old hotel that need lots of upgrading. Very crowded beach in front of the hotel with may eateries,20,January 2017,"The room that I stay in is pretty old looking with very basic stuff, nothing to mention about,Room service is very basic too. Its more like a do-in-yourself hotel with very few staff helping around. The pool is ok but unfortunate that during my visit, it was raining almost every other day. Food in the restaurant is ok. Breakfast is very basic, nothing to talk about, nothing impressive ( bread, probably 2 to 3 varieties , egg, jam,butter. Fruits Juices are not real fruit juices. I can't even remember what's it like for breakfast !!! Shops are quite a distance away from the hotel . Photos shown are not what you gonna see in real so you better lower your expectation by at least 70%. Its rather a very basic hotel to stay, sleep, keep your things and stay out of the hotel whole day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
211,Holiday,50,October 2017,"Fantastic location to everything close to all the great hotels 66,moonlight bar ,Gatto Gatto etc and right on the beach, great beach bars etc good shopping on the beach,walking distance to lots of places and sit on the beach for sunset and Bintang and peanuts, either in bean bags or chairs",Pelangi Bali Hotel
212,Mum & daughter holiday,40,September 2017,"Great location,
You will pay alot more for a place right on the beach like this.
The rooms were clean and I found the bed was perfect.
The pool was lovely and had enough areas around it to feel you weren't sitting on top of other guest. There were plenty of daybeds so no need for those annoying people putting their towels reserving them 1st thing in the morning lol.
We only ate breakfast in the restaurant which was plentiful and had all the favorites including an egg station.
Staff were very friendly and always helpful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
213,"good hotel, great place",50,September 2017,"very nice hotel, small but good pool, large breakfast buffet. great location just meters by the beach. nice evening bar ambient at the beach (not in the hotel, go to the beach). walking distance to restaurants and shops.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
214,Jerwy Irwan,50,September 2017,Having a short escape with family and stay at Pelangi Bali Hotel. The Suite Room was awesome. The Room price is the best amongs all other hotel. Direct access to beach. Easy access to everywhere. Staffs was very friendly and helpfull. The Restaurant view directly to the beach so having a breakfast with beach view makes my kids stay calm. The pool was awesome. Will surely stay at this hotel again for next visit.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
215,Best value,40,September 2017,Hotel is nice location next to beach so you can walk from the pool 10s to ocean. Breakfast is really good with lot of options. Room is comfortable and maybe basic but not so bad. Definetly could come back.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
216,"Great location, staff and service, but hotel getting a bit tired",40,September 2017,"Good location on the beach, the rooms are quite big and well presented. Breakfast was ok though choice was a bit limited. Couldn't fault the staff who are friendly and accommodating. Easy walk to restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
217,Fabulous Beach Resort.,50,September 2017,"We travelled in September and had perfect weather. Our room was neat and tidy with a beautiful romantic Balinese decor. The room was a good size, the bathroom was a little dated but came with a full bath which would be great if you have small children. I also loved how the Airconditioner was always running so our room was always cool. The resort itself is also amazing, the infinity pool with swim up Bar overlooking the beach brilliant. Our check-in was smooth and the staff were always friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant and breakfast was included and well set out with a nice variety and everything always looked fresh and tasty. They also provided poolside service all day long for lunch and snacks. The Beach is literally on their back door only having to walk a few steps. There was also so many restaurants to pick from and sunset on the beach every night with a festive atmosphere and live music - brilliant. There is a 7/11, laundrette and really cheap massage shop across the road from the hotel and a short walk to the end of the street brought you to the main road with more restaurants, shops, and market stalls. A $5.00 cab ride gets you to Legian or Kuta and the Hotel also offers a free shuttle to Kuta, Seminkya Square or Bintang supermarket. Beautiful stay, Amazing Value Hotel......",Pelangi Bali Hotel
218,We will go back there,40,September 2017,"Pelangi was the perfect place for our honeymoon. The staff were very friendly, the superior room was large enough and nice inside. We couldn't complain about the location. It's within walking distance to a heap of shops and restaurants either in Seminyak or along the beachfront toward Legian. It was lovely having breakfast watching the ocean and the squirrels every morning, then relaxing around the pool or going for a swim in the ocean straight outside the hotel.
Thank you to all the staff. You made our holiday really enjoyable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
219,Great beachfront location but safety concern,30,September 2017,Great beachfront location with lots of beach bars but far from seminyak square and Potatohead beach bar so you need to get taxi. Swimming pool was good and Room was pleasant. However anyone can walk into complex from the beach as no security... Someone attempted to break into our room at 2am while we were sleeping. Latch was on door so they couldn't get into room but when we contacted reception they did nothing to help. Said they would check security cameras in morning but when we went to check out they made excuses and said security guard didn't show up. We were very Concerned for our safety all night so we didn't get any sleep.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
220,Perfect position,50,July 2017,"Hotel pelangi , fantastic position right on the beach in Seminyak , great pool , we had the super deluxe room which was great , heaps of room comfortable bed.Breakfast is good and plenty
The hotel is close to great restaurants and local shopping
I would recommend it as a family friendly hotel or a couples , great value for money .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
221,Paradise!!,50,June 2017,"Fantastic location, directly opposite the beach. Extremely close to bars and restaurants at the front or back entrances of the hotel. Staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. The rooms and communal areas were cleaned daily and the food was gorgeous. Eggs made to order every morning whichever way you prefer. The swimming pool and restaurant area were lovely, there was also an indoor bar and spa. We were allowed to use the spa shower area on our last day as we didn't get a pick up til late on.
The locals are extremely friendly and happy to just sit and chat, although I would recommend a massage in the beach front. The equivalent of £5-£6 for a full body!
We couldn't have hope for more in a hotel or area. Fantastic holiday and fantastic hotel, would definitely recommend it and go back there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
222,Great spot,40,August 2017,"The resort is in a fantastic spot ,right on the beach.If you can get a deck chair( Tip...Put your towels on the chairs before breakfast or you wont get one) in front of the pool that over looks the beach then you can sit under the umbrella in the shade or in the sun and enjoy the view of the beach or just people watch..Pool is a fair size and has a swim up bar that you can enjoy a cocktail while cooling down sitting in the pool..Rooms are clean and nice enough, ( After all you are only sleeping in them)..Good shower and bath..TV with all the channels including Australian sport...Breakfast (should be included in your price) is good enough ,buffet style..Bacon ,French toast (one day then) pancakes the next,cereal ,different juices ,Balinese food(Rice,vegetables ect) ,potatoes,fresh fruit basically all the food to get you through to lunch or even dinner..The only bad thing is the coffee is terrible( But drinkable when you have a hangover) and they only have one toaster which is a pain if there is allot of people waiting .....After breakfast we went straight across the road on the beach to the left to place called the Juice bar and grill(Again right on the beach) and had a fresh juice smoothie sitting inside in the shade inside or on the deck chairs on the beach under the umbrellas outside..I recommend the Juice bar for lunch and dinner ,we ate everything including salads,so don't hesitate...The resort food is good for dinner or lunch too and has a good selection,but most people eat across the road on the beach or the many places along the street..The resort is in a great spot that's the best thing about it..EVERYTHING including shopping ,massages ,and all the places to eat are right there...Great place and will be back again as soon as we can..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
223,"Tradtional old hotel, still with class",40,August 2017,"lovely old traditional hotel
needs to be updated though, maybe incorporate old with modern, only rooms need to be done
they are very spacious and clean regardless of date
beachfront property, pool also out there
restaurant was lovely open and clean
staff very friendly",Pelangi Bali Hotel
224,Great way to start our honeymoon,50,August 2017,"My husband and I started our honeymoon here for 4 nights, they knew in advance it was our honeymoon and made sure they accommodated for this by beautifully decorating our room and giving us a glass of complimentary wine. The pool area is lovely and we really enjoyed the cocktails at the pool bar. Its a great location for all of Seminyak's amazing night life without being noisy. The included breakfast is great and there is a lot of choice. We had the honeymoon spa treatment which was absolutely incredible, 3 hours long and completely amazing! Would highly recommend this treatment as well as the hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
225,Great experience!,40,June 2017,"We stayed at pelangi for 7nights and was a great experience.

Friendly and helpful staff.
Located close to beach(with lots of bars/Restaurants) and walking distance from town to draw money and do some shopping.

Breakfast was more than enough had some different options daily.

We watched the show, on monday's I think, and would recommend it for some good entertainment.

Hotel was always clean.
Would definitely recommend it!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
226,Fantastic stay,50,July 2017,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 nights in July. What a wonderful hotel, the setting was absolutely beautiful - right on the beach. The staff were fabulous and so friendly, the hotel room was nice and the buffet breakfast was a great way to start the day. When I return to Bali I will definitely be staying at the Pelangi Hotel again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
227,She's a grand old lady but thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.,40,August 2017,"There is no getting away from the fact that this hotel is dated and no longer up to the modern style westerners are expecting. However, the location is fantastic if you want to be right on the beach and close to the double six area. We loved it. Great beach shacks offering more than fair prices for great local food and drinks usually playing awesome music. We upgraded our room to superior which was much larger with a much better balcony. Very comfortable, staff very friendly, towels and linen are tired and breakfast is ok but not amazing. Quite a few of the older style hotels in this area will be similar, built probably 20 years ago with not much upgrading. But still a great relaxing and clean reasonably priced place to stay and we would come here again. Nice pool and plenty of lounges overlooking the beach, we were overall very happy and would be happy to recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
228,In need of a facelift,20,August 2017,"The room was pleasant but bathroom rather bad with mould on the grout that has not been clean for a long time.I even saw a cockroach in the bath that I imagine came out of the bath drain.The linen was not replaced in all the time we were there.

The pool chairs were so old and with the wheels missing on some and I think in general the place looks old and run down.

The area in front of the hotel on the beach side is very dirty with lots of vendors disturbing once peace .

The breakfast was good but the pricing of beverages,lunch and dinner is ridiculously high rather eat out of the hotel area.

Overall the hotel is not value for money.

I left five days earlier due to unforeseen circumstances back home but they would not even give a complimentary lunch on the day I left.

I don't think I would go back there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
229,"Faded granduer, but a great stay.",40,August 2017,"We were there for 6 nights on honeymoon. Our room was specially decked out with loads of flower petals and towels folded into swans- a truly wonderful touch. Staff were excellent and helpful. The breakfast was buffet style with the option to have eggs freshly cooked for you. There was a huge choice. The pool is bliss with a nice swim up bar. It is quite small for the huge size of the hotel, however it never got overcrowded while we were there. The hotel backs onto the beach which is great and if you are exiting from the back you are only a couple of minutes from bars or restaurants. The only downside to the hotel is potentially its location. If you came for tranquillity you will get it in the hotel, but around it is not. You would be better staying further North. The hotel does have a bit of a faded grandeur about it too and is beginning to show its age. Most rooms will not have a view either. Overall a great hotel I would recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
230,Beautiful,40,July 2017,"Of the three places I stayed at during my trip to Bali, Pelangi Bali Hotel was hands-down the best. With incredibly friendly and helpful staff, all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, 24-hour room service, and an excellent location rolled into one, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. My only issue was the beds were incredibly firm to the point of being uncomfortable, but that is purely a personal preference. However, if you like a firm bed, a big breakfast, and easy access to the beach and the shopping stalls, Pelangi is the hotel for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
231,Perfect stay,50,August 2017,"my family and I stayed at Pelangi Bali hotel in July/August 2017. I can't fault it. Rooms clean, staff are extremely friendly, food at restraint is delicious, pool is perfect and the location is perfect. 5 stars from me. Thank you",Pelangi Bali Hotel
232,Pelangi hotel,30,July 2017,"First stay in seminyak,arrived to not what we expected,quiet old hotel and on a back street but backs out onto the beach,we was on the ground floor(only 2 floors) so no where to sit outside other than on the steps.the food was average,the staff where friendly but reception not very welcoming!! The pool was nice the grounds lovely but needing some renovations,also have to walk out onto Main Street if you want a taxi which we found quite strange so had to pay more to use the hotels driver! Enjoyed our stay as was different to what we are used to but wouldn't stay here again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
233,Outdated hotel would not recommend,10,July 2017,"I recently stayed at Pelangi hotel with my boyfriend. We decided to book a nice place for our last night in Seminyak and decided to pay extra for a ""deluxe suite"". There was nothing deluxe about the room. The hotel was certainly not worth the money we paid. Although the hotel is in a great location it felt outdated. There is no lift in the hotel which makes lugging heavy suitcase difficult up and down stairs. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
234,Awesome trip with family and friends,50,July 2017,"I recently stayed at the Pelangi in Seminyak with 25 of my friends and family for my birthday. From the start, the staff were so friendly and helpful and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean with a great pool area and swim up bar. I particularly enjoyed the location of the hotel, with it being off a small street rather than a main road however is still within walking distance or a short and cheap taxi ride to shops. The close proximity to the beach is also fantastic. I cannot thank the Pelangi enough for their hospitality and I hope to return again soon!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
235,"Comfortable, clean hotel",40,July 2017,"Stayed here in a big group for a joint 30th birthday celebration.
The hotel was well located, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly, attentive and kind. The first room we had had a mould problem, the staff were immediately responsive and moved us and then attended to the room we vacated. The second room was clean, light and comfortable. The facilities were in good order for an older facility. The hotel was right on the beach. The fitness centre equipment could use a little attention but it was still very functional for cardio and weights. Cannot speak more highly of all the staff we met. They were friendly, kind and helpful. There is convenience store across the road for bottled water and other commonly needed items. It was a short walk to a few places to eat and to get a cab. Would stay there again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
236,False Advertising,10,July 2017,"I haven't even arrived yet and I am frustrated with Tripadvisor and the hotel booking. The hotel clearly states ""breakfast, parking and airport transfers are included"". But they now want a $60 fee for the airport transfer. FALSE ADVERTISING if you ask me and to make it worse TripAdvisor is offering no help with a refund or correcting the problem. Stay out of internet problems and book another way!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
237,An experience !!,10,July 2017,"Something we weren't supposed to see but someone had left the door open. The door behind the mirror ... a half cut plastic bottle filled with the dirtiest mouldiest water we have even seen. Look up and there is broken pipes and wiring. It stunk.
The porter came in with out bags and he was on the phone straight away ... people everywhere. One emptied the water into the garden and put the container back and locked the door. We asked to move rooms as this we considered very unhygenic. The next room the mirror door had lock and key on it. Room smelt. Friends in another room, their mirror door was nailed shut. Have attached pictures of this.
Room very humid, very smelly and dark. The view from siding door is of the room across the way and front door view is of a dirty concrete wall. It was like a prison.
There are lots of stairs to navigate.
No room for toiletries in bathroom.
3 of us in one room and only get 2 satchets of coffee but got 3 bottles of water.
It is not near shops .... good walk away.
There was mould on the top seal in fridge. Picture attached.
We got locked out of the safe. Great ... guy came in and unlocked straight away. Not a very safe safe!!
Staff were polite and breakfast was ok.
Walls are very thin. You can hear what is going on.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
238,Very Comfortable,40,July 2017,"We stayed at Pelangi for a week and found it to be very comfortable with friendly and helpful staff. The restaurant is very reasonably priced and the food is amazing. It is close to many restaurants along the beach. Oddly though, you cannot get a taxi from the Pelangi so you have to walk to the end of the street. The taxi will, however, drop you back to the Pelangi. This is just worth noting.

The bathroom was the only thing that I can criticise. It was a little 'old' and not the cleanest bathroom Ive seen. Also, the sliding door to my balcony was stuck closed.

I would recommend this hotel because of its friendly and helpful staff and the great location. Oh, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
239,Nice stay,30,June 2017,"I liked this hotel as it was very close to the beach, although the promotional photos made it seem like the hotel have sunbeds on the beach, which they don't. Checking into the hotel was a chore! Please don't give guests a list of things we can't do when I've just checked in, it's really off-putting. and very impersonal. They offer a shuttle service but it has to be booked 2 hours in advance! my previous hotel you just rang and took 5 minutes to arrive. Rooms were nice and big. enjoyed the pool bar, and the location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
240,Love it!,50,July 2017,"The room was great, not too fancy though, but nice. Clean and no bigs. Their breakfast was really good. The pool with the bar is outstanding. Their beach access it prefect. After trying a fancy private villa, I really wish we have stayed at the hotel for the rest of the trip, I realized that the hotel's facilities, location, food, and cleanliness matters a lot more than a fancy room full of bugs, dirty pool, and awful food! Stay there ppl",Pelangi Bali Hotel
241,A lovely place,40,June 2017,"Great Breakfast, great wifi, great staff. We had a pretty nice/clean room and the hotel is in a good location. I also really enjoyed the pool bar. The price you pay is very reasonable for what you are getting.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
242,"OLD, DATED, DIRTY, MOLDY .......Gross",10,June 2017,"The Front Desk has a big attitude. I asked for the name and email address of the GM. They would not give the name. There is no GM ...... well that is strange or true. True is very visible in the lack of quality of the hotel.
The worst experience is truly the Activities desk in the LOBBY. These people have only one thing in mind: To rip you off. Make it part of the hotel. That desk should be manned by hotel people (the concierge....what a concept!) and guests should be able to charge activities to their hotel account.
The second worst experience is the beach. Pictures and web-site text led you to believe that the hotel ""runs"" the beach. It should be noted that the beach is VERY public and that vendors rent you chairs and umbrellas (For 100,000 IRP a day or 50,000 for an hour!!!) and that you will plagued by a zillion other vendors want to sell you constantly their little trinkets and chotskies.
The room was very humid. My clothes were damp. The sheets were constantly damp. Clearly a maintenance issue of the AC Units. The exhaust in the bathroom was louzy. So all that moisture was added on to the humidity in the room. Mattress has black stains of mold. The bathroom is moldy. The floors were extremely filthy. I used about 3 bathmats to clean the floors and all 3 of them were black after cleaning!
Breakfast buffet is OK. Service there is OK too. Inconsistent. I am not sure why you dont run breakfast until 11:00 AM ...... Nobody ever eats lunch there or dinner??
The terrace restaurant is spectacular but totally not promoted nor is there any idea how to operate it. Add moer more lounge chairs on the lower terrace instead of dining tables that are never used??
We had a few dinners at the restaurant (all alone) . The food is amazingly good! The service is terrific. (You have about 3 servers and 3 helpers for your self!!). They made me a SOTO AYAM (not on the menu) and it was delicious.
In any case, the whole place is old and tired. Badly managed. It is clear that the owners take the profits and do not reinvest.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
243,Great place to stay,40,June 2017,"The Pelangi is a great place to stay, its not 5* but don't claim to be. Staff are very friendly, rooms are very clean, the delux rooms are so much better than the standard superior rooms but if like me you don't intend to spend time in the room then what does it matter. the buffett breakfast was like most a wide variety of cusine and of course eggs any way.
Location is the best part right on the beach walking distance to anywhere or a short cab ride, the beach is out the back and heaps of beach bars right at the door step.
pool is great,
would stay here again thanks Pelangi Staff.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
244,Simply delightful,50,June 2017,"After reading some of the lesser favourable reviews I'm a bit gob smacked. Yes, we have not stayed next to the cleaners room and we probably paid more for a renovated Superior room. If that is what it takes I will strongly recommend spending a few more bucks and do the same.

Overall our experience was simply devine. The room was huge, too big in fact, very comfortable, cleaned daily and conveniently located close to the pool and restaurant.

The breakfast was delightful with a fair selection for a meat lover with a variety of egg options. Lunch and dinner a la cart is pretty much on par with restaurants in the area but we did find the burger buns fresher than any other place. In our opinion portions are slightly bigger and pizza toppings a bit more generous, so the slight higher price if any, I am happy to pay.

I did not meet a single member off staff that did not very politely and friendly greet every morning. All members of staff are awesome and we will return if only for this reason.

The location of the hotel is perfect. Have breakfast, hop over the street and rent loungers under an umbrella on the beach (remember to be friendly and you may negotiate a good deal). Have a chicken Gordon Blue for lunch at the beach restaurant (to the right looking to the beach from the hotel). Make your way to the hotel pool around 2pm. Enjoy a cocktail at the sunken bar served by a super friendly bartender. (Be nice to them & see how entertaining they can be). Take a warm shower & nap in a lovely cool air conditioned room. Freshen up and enjoy an entertaining traditional Balinese evening at the hotel or indulge in the loads of dinner options in the area (But dont dismiss the wonderful options offered at the hotel itself!). The bean bags on the beach with cocktails and live entertainment every night, looking at the waves and occational sky lanterns launched is a must.

Already planning my next visit to Pelangi Bali Hotel!

PS: Don't be shy... be nice... it goes a long way.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
245,Solid choice,30,June 2017,"I came here for my last night at the end of a trip around Bali. It's a decent hotel, a solid choice. Rooms are clean, cool and comfortable. Pool is nice (although there is a slight shortage of sun beds). Direct access to the beach. Staff very helpful. Oh, and a decent gym for weights and cardio, which is a rare find in Bali!

Would definitely recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
246,Not what the photos portray,30,June 2017,"Stayed here for 4 nights based on the advertising photos and price. Didn't expect it to be grand but also didn't expect it to be so tired. Needs a serious facelift (peach colour on internal walls went out years ago), there is no room in the bathroom for toiletries, the window furnishings need to be updated and lightened in colour, all in all the rooms are very dark. There are a few deluxe suites but the majority are basic. Great location and staff very friendly and helpful. Good assortment for breakfast.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
247,Love it here,50,June 2017,"We stayed for 2 weeks in June and it's our 4 th time
Love it here so friendly clean rooms have been upgraded since the last time we were here Central to shops beach scooter hire Legian etc
They staff here are like our second family and we would not stay anywhere else The rooftop restaurant is open a couple of times in the week and what a beautiful view it is and the food is great as well as the breakfast
Thanks once again for looking after us and we will see you again next year",Pelangi Bali Hotel
248,Great place to stay!,50,June 2017,"We were lucky enough to score a room not too far from the pool and restaurant. It was clean, spacious and the wifi was great. We loved the breakfast, the cocktails in the swim up bar were amazing and all the staff went above and beyond to make our stay so enjoyable! Everyone we spoke to was friendly and happy, which made our day. We also booked a hike up Mount Batur through the front desk and it proved to be the highlight of our trip!! FYI take a jumper haha!
Would 100% stay at Pelangi again!! Easy 5 star rating from us :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
249,Tired basic hotel,30,May 2017,"We found this hotel after strolling up the beach from kuta, it's located along a cute beach pathway with bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is big and can be quite a walk from reception to your room. The rooms could do with modernising but they are clean average size and have good aircon although can be quite noisy as you directly face your neighbours. The hotel is right next to the beach, perfect if you want to surf but if sunbathing expect to be hassled every few minutes with people trying to sell you things. The beach has a great view of the sunset with hip bars sporting beanbags, these bars are expensive and we had to send drinks back several times as we could barely taste any alcohol in them so be warned!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
250,Great beach front location,50,June 2017,"The location is great with the beach right in front of the back entrance. There are cafes / restaurants all along the beach. On the front entrance side, there are cafes / restaurants and shops. Our room was big and spacious. A bit pricey but I guess you pay for the location. It's 3/4 star so don't expect luxury. The spa room was really nice too and treatments are affordable. Fitness centre was pretty good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
251,Very Tired,30,June 2017,"6 nights. Very traditional Balinese Hotel but very tired and needs lots of Love.
Photos and brochures make it look pretty amazing but not what we expected.
Pool outlook great and on the beach front. Great if you ridexa scooter.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
252,Good location but that's about it.,30,June 2017,"This is my first visit to the Pelangi and will probably be my last. The place is very worn including the paving around the pool.
Breakfast is nice enough but the staff are not at all enthusiastic. We were never greeted in the morning on arrival and never offered tea or coffee but when you finished your meal they would swoop in to clear your plates.
Do not get any of the rooms next to the cleaners room. The phone start very early and the staff bang about so you don't get a good sleep in. Also we stayed in room 130 and I'm not sure about the other rooms but I could hear everything very clearly next door through the adjoining door. I had a coughing man for 2 nights, then we got young people for the next 2 nights who were up till 2am talking at the top of there voice. Or it sounded due to no noise insulation.
Food and drinks are expensive.
Location is good and really you get what you pay for. It is a hotel right on the beach in Seminak.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
253,Back again,50,June 2017,This hotel looks like nothing when you pull up as it is all hidden out the back. This is a fantastic hotel and is in a brilliant spot. The pool is one of the best we have used. Breakfasts are brilliant. You walk straight from the hotel onto the beach. Everything you want is within walking distance and the staff are great. Will keep using this hotel every time we go to Seminyak.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
254,!st Time in Bali,50,May 2017,"We loved this place and can't understand some of the negative comments.Bali is hot -very hot for the likes of us visiting from cold climes so to hear the pool was ""too hot"" is ridiculous. As regards the gardens every day half a dozen men would be beavering away and they were immaculate.
For us the location was everything.It is superb with some wonderful beach bars to chill out in a few meters away.Each had their own music and In front of them were scattered bean bags to watch the sun setting was bliss and enjoy a cocktail.
The hotel Staff were so happy and friendly.The food at breakfast was good and lobby staff helpful,.Rooms were clean and yes everything worked.
This hotel is lovely.We loved it.Go there and enjoy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
255,Good stay,40,May 2017,This is a good resort at a good position. Just across a small road from the beach. Near restaurants on the beach with evening music not a problem in the resort. Good pool with swim up bar if you require it. If you require a scooter - easy reach from the back entrance. Easy walk into Seminyak for shopping and restaurants. The rooms are small but cleaned well every day. Balianese style with a very small balcony that is not big enough to use. The breakfasts are one of the best we have had in our travels. If you require a taxi or a good price for a day trip I recommend KOMANG SUSILA JAYA. You can find him on Facebook. He speaks good English and knows where to go in Bali.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
256,there is nothing nice about this hotel,10,May 2017,"1. It is quite noisy all night because every surface is covered by tiles.
2. Hotel and pool very very dated.
3. There was glass in the pool. Pool has a bar and they serve drink in glass rather than plastic and the allow people to smoke in the pool itself too.
4. Breakfast is quite minimalistic and always the same, no vegetarian option unless you ask. Staff are lovely but very eager to clean up too quickly, every time I went to get something my full cup of coffee would disappear.
4. I went to reception to complain but I was given a piece of paper to write my complain on.
5. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE",Pelangi Bali Hotel
257,Great for relaxing with fantastic staff,50,May 2017,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at Pelangi. I liked the Balinese music played gently throughout the hotel creating a relaxing atmosphere. The pool is great and open til late. Good variety for breakfast, and the hotel is in a great location to walk straight onto the beach for evening drinks whilst watching the sun go down. The staff were fantastic, very happy to help us at all times, and I liked the late 12pm check out.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
258,"What a dream, life on the beach, cocktails by the pool, nights on the beach, great music and colourful lanterns.",50,May 2017,"Great hotel, all facilities, walking distance to shops and great restaurants. Swimming pool overlooks the beach.
Best of everything. Friendly and helpful staff, couldn't have asked for anymore. Nigh time on the beach with Beans
Bags, colourful umbrellas and lanterns. Sipping cocktails while watching the Sunset over the sea by lovely colourful lanterns lights with great music. What a life.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
259,Excellent staff,50,February 2017,"I didn't get a lot of time to enjoy this hotel because I had to be taken to the hospital. I am writing because I was very thankful for the actions of the hotel staff. They responded immediately, got me in a staff car (an ambulance would have taken way too long) and took me to the hospital where I made a full recovery. When I returned to the hotel, I tried tipping the people who had helped me but they refused to take my money, saying they were happy they could help me. I am very grateful to the staff of the Pelangi Hotel and will definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
260,Stay away from the happy hour at the swim up bar!!!! Worst cocktails ever!!,30,May 2017,"Lovely people, hotel is a little run down, but overall a very pleasant experience. Good breakfast included. I had 2 different cocktails made at the swim up bar, they tasted terrible. I think a refresher course in how to make a cocktail!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
261,Fantastic Hotel & Location,50,April 2017,"Fantastic rooms & remarkable location. This is the second year in a row that I have stayed here with friends. Fabulous service too. Very friendly staff.
It comes highly recommended. :)
The venue is an older style with direct beach access.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
262,Awesome for the price,40,October 2016,"Getting a hotel at a reasonable cost just along the sea shore is itself a bliss.
Excellent service, location and property.
The view from the pool is amazing, beach is just few steps away.
Nearby the hotel , you will find cheap booze and food.
Conveniently located and many places to explore nearby.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
263,Holiday with crazy friends,50,April 2017,"Stayed for 7 nights. Fantastic rooms, great pool, and lovely staff. Will stay there again.
I went with 11 other friends, and they all agree, that for the price it was fantastic value. The hotel is an older Bali style place, with direct access to the beach. The breakfast was fresh and there was plenty of variety. The front of the hotel is on a quiet side street, but only a short walk to the main road.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
264,Dinner and dancing,40,May 2017,Food was good and service was excellent! Dancing was brilliant and well with watching. Our friends stayed there and we visited a couple times and service was amazing! Very big portions! Garlic bread tasted a little funny though,Pelangi Bali Hotel
265,Pelangi Resort,50,May 2017,"We have just stayed at Pelangi Hotel Resort for 5 nights and we had a wonderful stay! All staff were so helpful and friendly, we felt like we belonged there right away. The rooms are serviced daily and we found every area of the resort to be very clean and well maintained. The restaurant is a beautiful place to eat, overlooking the beach and the gorgeous pool, total relaxation right there 😊. We are very much looking forward to returning to Bali , and will definitely be staying at Pelangi Resort!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
266,great for the price,50,May 2017,"stayed here for four nights last week, I really couldn't find much to fault with this hotel, we loved it, especially for the price compared to surrounding hotels, it's on the beach the pool is great, breakfast was fine. the room was airconditioned and clean, beds were really comfy, we had two singles which were king singles. they have a shuttle into seminyak square, we walked back the first time, next time we caught a cab, which will only cost 30,000 rupiah, about $3 Australian, make sure you agree on the price before you get in the taxi. at night we loved going down the beach, right in front of the hotel, it really comes alive, bean bags, food, drinks and live music,alsothe free wifi was really good. it was great.would stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
267,Cleaning Staff Robbery,10,May 2017,"I walked into the room this morning and three boys were in it. It seemed excessive but not wanting to disturb I left. This evening my husband and I came back and the sliding door was open and safe was missing $3,000 in high value accessories and 380,000 Korean won in cash. DO NOT GO.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
268,Lovely,50,April 2017,"Don't let the few negative reviews put you off this wonderful hotel. Everything was lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The bedroom wasn't as big as expected but it had a huge king bed.
Great location. All the staff were lovely. Highly recommend the spa (massage).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
269,Redeemed by location and pool,30,April 2017,"This hotel felt a bit impersonal and basic, but the beachside location is the redeeming feature.
Stayed in a superior room at approx $110 p/n including taxes and breakfast. Room was fine - a bit dated , dark and rough around the edges but the air con worked well. On the bright side , the rooms are conducive to getting you out and about so you make the most of holiday time!

Staff were polite enough but not overly helpful. As noted in other reviews, staff seem to reluctant to provide advice/assistance unless it is promoting services via their own tour desk. We were quoted inflated prices for local tours and airport transfers, but this was easily addressed by organising a driver from off the street (plenty to choose from once you walk 75m down the street). We asked for a tourist map to get our bearings and were provided with a blurry, photocopy of a map that had seen far better days and was illegible . Breakfast was ok - food average but lovely location overlooking pool and ocean compensated.

The large pool area was great - plenty of sun loungers, and towels provided. Terrific location, 1 minor laneway to cross to get to the beach. Mini mart across the road from entry. Free shuttle leaves hotel 4 x daily (no return service). depending on the time, shuttle will drop off at Seminyak square, Bintang supermarket, or Kuta. Loved being so close to the beach and having the opportunity to walk along the water at sunrise before the heat and the crowds. Wi fi was good.

I'm not sure if I'd stay here again, but compared with other Seminyak beachside accomodation it's a lot more affordable. If you keep your expectations in check , this place will tick most of the boxes.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
270,Enjoyed,40,April 2017,"We stayed here for 5 nights and really had no issues. The room was decent and clean, rooms were cleaned everyday and we never had to ask for clean towels. We also received 2 bottles of water everyday free. The breakfast did change slightly everyday but it was good. It had an egg station and they always made them perfect. The staff get an A+, always smiling and saying hello. We felt like we were in Bali in the hotel which is what we wanted. Yes it needs some maintenance work but its nothing serious. Yes some paint and new taps perhaps in our room and it would give it new life. The pool was awesome and we used the swim up bar which was lovely. Pool towels always available. Beach a stone throw away and you are able to walk to the centre of seminyak. All in all we loved our stay and was sad to leave and would recommend this place to anyone.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
271,Pelangi Bali Hotel,50,February 2017,My daughter and i stayed at the Pelangi Bali Hotel for 8 nights. During the whole time there our experience exceeded our expectations regarding the friendliness and attention to detail of all the staff. Our room was clean and very central to all amenities. The daily breakfasts had slight variation but one that was welcomed each day especially the personalised omletes made to my request. The door staff addressed us each day by our first names and took a personal interest in our daily adventures and gave us recommendations.Would definately stay at the hotel again over the more westernised hotels due our authentic experience.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
272,Great time at the hotel,40,April 2017,"was there for 4 days....the best thing is the location....just hop step and skip you are on the best beach in Bali.....great waves,shacks,music and food....hotel is tucked in a quiet corner off the main road which is plus....also many restaurants near buy can go walking...swimmimg pool was decent....over all value for money...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
273,In need for update,20,April 2017,"Hotel is in need for the renovation. There is no any atmosphere, rooms are placed in long hallway that is very dark. Cleaners are noisy in early morning and good luck if your room is next to the cleaners room, like mine was. Food (I'm guessing someone's leftover) was left in hallway too what attracted the ants. Room very average and out of date.
This is my 3rd visit to Bali and this is not your best value for money. Only great thing about this hotel is location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
274,"A ""WOW"" factor hotel",50,April 2017,"For starters we could not believe the price of this hotel it was so affordable an included everything we love. Hot buffet and Continental breakfast -which was awesome, infinity pool an swim up bar, rooftop bar an restaurant and to top it off beach front views and a great location in Seminyak-close to everything!

We were so stunned when we walked into the hotel the decor an furnishings are very authentic an traditional. There is a big pond in the hotel with huge goldfish which looked amazing! The staff are exceptional an go above an beyond to accomodate.

We were offered a welcome drink on arrival an were checked in very quickly which was great because we didn't arrive to the hotel until 2am so we were quite tired.

The hotel's tour office booked us a taxi driver to take us around Ubud for an entire day which was very affordable an they also booked us a white water rafting tour which again was cheap an very fun!

The only thing this hotel could improve on is the bed, for me it was a bit hard but it didn't take long to get use to. Other than that this hotel is great an I would defiantly recommend it :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
275,Way Overpriced,10,April 2017,"This is one of the worst hotels i paid good money to stay in.This is only a basic very old hotel.
There is much nicer places for much cheaper.
hotel staff are very noisey at 6am onwards with phones ringing in all the corridors.Rooms are from the early 90s with the same beds matteresses ect.No views from the rooms only looking into tiny adjacent balcony of another room.
If you require late checker expect to he charged heavily.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
276,Average,20,April 2017,"Rooms are clean but basic.
Restaurant/bar and buffet breakfast is average.
Beds are ok, on the hard side.
Staff polite but not overly helpful.
Spa average.
Pool area old, but good view.
On the whole an average hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
277,No frills hotel,30,April 2017,"This hotel is slightly removed from the main shopping area of Seminyak (IDR 30,000 drive). The hotel itself is pretty bare bones when it comes to amenities, with the exception of the pool which is a good size compared to neighbouring hotels. Landscaping is nice, but the rooms themselves were tired and in need of a refresh. They are clean, but we felt the linens were not appropriate for the room - they felt more like spa sheets? Tried to get them changed, and ended up with more spa sheets. I'm starting to notice that linens are lacking in general across Bali.

We chose this hotel due to its proximity to the beach. While the beach was generally quite nice, there was quite a bit of plastic floating in the water. This appeared to be the case across Legion and Seminyak beaches. If you are looking for a more luxurious stay, it's worth the splurge on the pricier hotels.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
278,Pelangi Magic,50,March 2017,"What a wonderful motel and staff. Located in a quiet position in Seminyak, comfortable beds and clean amenities. Within reasonable walking distance to Kuta and lovely shopping nearby.

Looking forward to a return visit next year!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
279,Don't do it,10,March 2017,"Way way way overpriced!! For bali, this hotel is worn out, run down, musty, smelly and just not a great fit! Location is good but for $130, in low season I may add, there is a lot more out there! The pictures are not st all what the hotel is, I got, got! Don't make the same mistake, so much more in this area for the same price or less!! How it even gets a 4 star, I'm at a loss",Pelangi Bali Hotel
280,Broke-Down Palace,10,February 2017,"This place was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at...it looks nothing like the pictures, the rooms are dirty even when they have been ""cleaned"" and the staff is rude and shady. Half of this ""resort"" is under construction, and the other half is noticeably dated compared to the other hotels in the area. Based on this, you would think that the staff would be extra helpful and courteous, however on multiple occasions they gave us bad directions and tried to con us into using their in-house transportation service when we requested a cab. On top of this, they attempted to make us wait in the lobby to ensure nothing was taken from the wet bar. Looking back, I wish we would have known the ""wet bar"" existed in order to take the sting out of staying at this miserable excuse for a hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
281,Great Stay,50,November 2016,"I was travelling with my mum and was relieved to find this place very appropriate. It was so clean and the staff were very accommodating. The pool area was perfect with the adjoining restaurant, sunbeds and beach - we both loved this place and would stay here again on our next visit.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
282,Not a bad place - nice pool - rooms comfy,30,February 2017,Had three nights here. We had three single rooms which were clean comfy and tidy. Pool was nice and we had friendly people in it at the swim up bar. In saying that we then moved on to the Furama which is just down the road and got a three bedroom apartment for a cheaper price and far far bigger in size. Each to their own but I don't know if the value was there compared to other places.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
283,Great location!!,50,March 2016,The location of this hotel was very handy. We were right by the beach and had lots of cafes and restaurants around us. The pool was lovely and great to have the bar/food service by the pool. The room was spacious and clean however the room had a funny smell. Breakfast was very average. Customer service was great. Hotel lobby was very quiet and not very lively. Overall stay was great.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
284,Bad experience,10,February 2017,"Be careful when you are trying to enjoy yourself at the swimming bar, because once you are intoxicated you don't know what is going on. We had to pay for drinks we did not consume and there was absolutely no reasoning with the staff what so ever. If you can try pay and check your tab before leaving the pool, and we made the decision to be trustworthy and send the bill to our room tab. Other than that, the stay was very good",Pelangi Bali Hotel
285,Excellent stay,50,February 2017,"I stayed here for 3 night, for my first time in Bali. The service and friendliness of all staff is excellent, they all made me feel welcome and looked after, being a solo traveller!
It's a prime spot right on the beach and all the locals there were friendly.
Room, pool and restaurant were all great.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
286,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff,40,February 2017,"We travelled to Bali for the first time with friends and had booked 3 rooms which they were kind enough to place next to one another. Our rooms were lovely and very comfortable and the daily buffet breakfast changed each day and was delicious which is uncommon for most hotels or resorts with a free brekky tasting decent. The pool was lovely and cool and the hotel is right along the beach and walking distance to many markets shops and restaurants.

The highlight for me was all of the staff in the resort. They were all very attentive, helpful and were there for our every need. I cannot recommend staying here enough just for that reason.

We will definitely stay here again when we return to Bali. Great price, great location and wonderful staff.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
287,First time in Bali,30,February 2017,"3_4 Star . Stayed 7 nights end of Jan '17. Good location, quiet and safe; lovely gardens and Balinese style building. Pool area and bathrooms a ""bit tered"". Handy to beach and beach bars although we had 5 stormy days out of 8, so beach filthy and littered with rubbish.Staff friendly but unable to suggest shopping/eating/travel options; luckily had printed out some options in Oz as internet poor.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
288,Great hotel,50,October 2016,"Great hotel for the price! Rooms are a good size and are clean. The breakfast is great offering a variety of options. Hotel staff are friendly and provide a great service. Pool is excellent and overlooks the beach, the cocktails are good too! The hotel is in an excellent location close to bars, restaurants and shopping.
Staying here again in March and highly recommended",Pelangi Bali Hotel
289,Great hotel,40,January 2017,"Stayed at the Pelangi for 6 nights. Was in a good area, easy walk to shops in Seminyak, and a quick taxi ride to Kuta, potato head etc. staff were very friendly always happy to help with any requests we had and always a smile on their faces. Breakfast each morning was delicious changing every morning so we did not get bored with the food. The pool was great, considering the beaches around the area are dirty we spent a lot of time sitting by the pool. The swim up pool bar was ok, not the best cocktails but the novelty was good. Our room was basic but very clean and the beds were comfortable.

All in all for the price a good hotel in a good location!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
290,Lovely hotel,40,June 2016,"Close to the beach, staff very welcoming. Utilised the spa whilst there and had some awesome beauty treatments! Walkable distance to the main seminyak square and shopping. Walk out to the beach and have a few cocktails overlooking the ocean. Bliss!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
291,Returning again,50,January 2017,Been here 3 tomes prior and love it. Re ent room upgrades to panasonic 32 inch Tv's. Downlights paint. Staff are still lovely. Courteous obliging helpful. My wife 3 daughters(18 to 21) son and mother in law. Family live the rooms superb pool with ocean views swim up bar and location. Close to shopping restuarants. Easy walks.. Still a beautiful place to holiday.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
292,"Great value, lovely pool and surroundings",30,December 2016,"We chose to stay at the Pelangi for our first couple of days to chill and recover from our long haul flight and this was the ideal place. The rooms were really nice with the most comfortable which arriving at 3am is exactly what we wanted to see. Breakfast was delicious, a buffet style which was great. The pool was so inviting and the swim up bar great and the bar men were so friendly and funny is was a pleasure to sit there all afternoon listening and taking with them whilst sipping delicious cocktails!! The hotel amenties were good and the prices of the bar and restaurant on par with most hotel prices which we all know are a little inflated. The staff were really attentive and delightful to speak with. In the reception area there is a desk for you to book excursions, i urge you to not book any boats to the gilli islands through them. The company they use are horredous. Not only did we pay a high price even after haggling when we spoke to another group who were also waiting to be picked up for transfer to the boat we found out we had still paid over the odds for what they had paid the day before us at the same desk. The company is Wahanna Boats. We had an unpleasant journey to the
Gillis and the return was equally awful with the boat company dropping us off in the middle of no where without explanation. Please do not book this through them!
Other than that we had a delightful stay there. Another comment to make is that it is a fair walk to the buzzy part of seminkyak and we struggled to find a beach bar or a bar open past 11pm, even the hotel bar was shut.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
293,Not as good as it looks on the photos,20,January 2017,"When you arrive to Seminyak, it is already a cultural shock, that's of course if you don't like spending your holidays drinking from dusk till dawn. The hotels lobby is beautiful, the staff is nice and welcoming.
But as far as rooms are concerned, they are not well maintained, a bit dirty and have A certain smell. Our room was on the bottom floor, with the exit to the patio, that led to the beach. It all sounds nice, bit the only thing walking by our window, were drunk tourists. The swimming pool of the hotel has the view of the beach, a beach full off plastic and other garbage.
There are restaurants and bars along the beach, suitable for tourists described before.
If you ask me, you can skip the whole Kuta region, and go to the inner part of Bali. Or just skip Bali, there are more beautiful places in the world:)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
294,Great Value,40,December 2016,"A group of of us stayed here just before Christmas. We really enjoyed our stay. This is not a 5 star hotel (and it doesn't state to be) and I think the amount charged is very reasonable for what you get. Parts of the hotel are getting old but we found it more than adequate. We (including my 2 children aged 7 and 5yrs) really enjoyed the pool. Never had a problem getting a sun lounge.

For the price paid I thought breakfast was more than adequate. I've of course had nicer but also paid a lot more. So I was more than happy with the breakfast and my children liked it too.

We booked the lead in room and I had asked for interconnecting. Unfortunately (like a lot of hotels) they could not confirm an interconnecting and on arrival in the early hours of the morning they did not have an interconnecting room for us. I was disappointed in this since I had emailed a week before stating that I really would like connecting room as one of my children had to share with my Dad. My children did not want to stay without the room connected. I do however understand it's a request. Anyway check in was ok and nothing special so I agreed to move rooms after 2 nights even though we were there for only 4 nights to get an interconnecting room. We actually ended up with really good service there after. When we arrived at our room there was a pretty large spider above my son's bed. We only phoned for someone to come move it along. The ceilings are quite high so there was not chance of us being able to try and move the spider along. In the end they ended up moving us to a larger room that could accommodate both my children. This was very nice. I hope they didn't think we were using the spider as an excuse to get an upgrade. My child was not happy to sleep with the spider above so it really was very nice of them to upgrade us. We are used to spiders being Australian however none of us like to have one above us while sleeping.

It has been noted in other reviews about the state of the beach in front. I have come to Bali a couple of times (not in December though) and have never seen Seminyak beach with so much rubbish and just totally dirty looking. It's usually beautiful. It was super windy while we were there so all the rubbish was constantly arriving on the beach too fast to be taken away. The sea was very very rough and bringing so much rubbish. The beach and water is not always like this all the time, so for some people saying how horrible Seminyak beach is, it's not usually the case.

There is small road in front of the resort that you can walk up and that scooters use. I thought the location of the resort was excellent for the price paid. One of favorite restaurants called Moonlite is a very short walk and highly recommend for a great view.

If you are on a budget and want a resort in a great location I highly recommend. Our room was clean and we found the service around the resort very good. Air conditioning worked well and didn't find it noisy. I would definitely consider staying here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
295,"Fantastic rooms, great AC, beautiful pool",50,January 2017,"Big rooms, nice balconies, fabulous pool with pool bar. Abazing staff. Great location near restaurants and close to town. Free shuttle into Kuta throughout the day. Highly recommend staying here. I've walked all around and this is the best location with the most amenities I've seen.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
296,Wonderful quiet and comfortable hotel on the beach!,50,July 2016,"Q fabulous location - we walked to Kuta along the beach - it was fabulous to step out of the rear entrance and be on the beach with surfing lessons and all the benefits of Bali at your finger tips...

A great resort - the rooms were quiet and the location quiet - even though we had teenage boys we felt they had security...

The roof top restaurant was very special! And the pool bar went down a treat!

Definitely recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
297,Great pool by the beach,30,January 2017,"The pool is the stand out of this hotel. Lots of loungers and free towels. It faces the beach but the sea is pretty grubby - we went down but after looking at the state of the water decided we wouldn't go in. The breakfast is varied but not great - toast and staples are OK but nothing amazing. The food in the restaurant is pretty bad, I wouldn't recommend. Lots of other places nearby to eat anyway. The rooms were OK, fuctional and generally clean. The bathroom is basic at best. It was pretty cheap (considering it was peak season) and you get what you pay for. Nothing spectacular but a great pool and basic, functional facilities otherwise. Free shuttle to Kuta 5X a day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
298,Bit worn out and need renovations,20,September 2016,"We stayed there with two little kids, and booked the hotel with hope of private beach as reviews are all with beach.

1. It turned out there is a road block your way from hotel to the beach and MOST IMPORTANTLY the beach is not private beach at all, very lousy and quite dirty.

2. The facilities in the hotel are very out dated and need serious upgrade. The bed sheet are wet and not white as it should be(we were thinking it's due to the black sands on the beach nearby so guests are all getting into the room with black stuffs.

3. The restaurant inside is kind of very Low standard and the table/ chairs are not clean enough, the food there is nothing special, just normal street food. Breakfast buffet is less varieties as well.

The staffs there are all nice that leaves without doubt. Overall, I do not think it's a family hotel, lovers, couple and retired couple can stay here.

Tips here, We stayed in the hotel nearby for most day time (moonlite, 3 mins walk to the west), the private beach is fantastic and the food there is Super good. You just spent around 50 SGD and you can get a free beach lounge for free for a whole day to enjoy the five star facilities and food!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
299,Great and varied buffet breakfast!,40,January 2017,"We spent two nights at the Pelangi at a busiest time of year, around New Year's.
The hotel is lovely but very, very big...there are hundreds of rooms!
The pool area and restaurant are nice.
Just a short walk down to the beach, which is ideal.
We thoroughly enjoyed the buffet breakfast, with different food each morning.
I found the ambience a little impersonal, simply due to the sheer size of the hotel.
Other than that, we had a pleasant stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
300,Needs a gerni,30,January 2017,"Stayed at the Pelangi for 6 days in January and as my wife said the whole place needs a gerni (high pressure wash) our air conditioner was leaking and had to be fix the toilet blocked and we had to call maintenance at 6am to fix it, unfortunately the whole place is in need of some TLC? But I will give cudos to the staff who are so friendly and efficient and nothing seems to much trouble for them. The location is good with view over the beach and ocean from the restaurant (at breakfast) is a nice start to the day,next time I will probably go to Sanur.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
301,You get what you pay for,30,January 2017,"Tried a budget hotel to compare the difference in Bali hotels. We stayed over New Years so it was in a pretty good spot for fireworks etc but I definitely would not go back. Super noisy air con which isn't fun for a light sleeper, rooms are tiny and vey basic. Bathroom the same with weird smell. But if you're fine with basic then you'd probably be fine. This side of seminyak beach is disgusting. Obviously not the hotels fault but if you want to stay in seminyak beach I'd probably look at hotels further up where the beach is a little nicer. Overall not a terrible stay but don't expect too much",Pelangi Bali Hotel
302,Beachfront Hotel,40,December 2016,Pelangi Bali Hotel is located right on the beach. There are four different beach restaurants with bean bags on the sand. Pool and sun lounge area has view of the beach. Staff are lovely and remembered our drink orders each day. The Main Street where other restaurants and shops are is a bit of a walk but we did it everyday. Good price,Pelangi Bali Hotel
303,Enjoyed my stay here!,40,December 2016,"The rooms are nothing special.. But the service was amazing! And the place has a great vibe to it.. High probability because it was due to the amazing customer service. I really enjoyed my time here. I would for sure recommend it! Pool, gym, free wifi and the restaurant food was pretty good too!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
304,You get what you pay for...,40,December 2016,"I've stayed here four times in 2016 and my review has remains largely unchanged however, the food has declined a little on each visit to the point where we now go elsewhere most nights for dinner. The Pelangi New Years dinner was very disappointing.
While well intentioned, the amount of staff (mostly all very nice) - watching over you as you eat is also very off putting. Like all reviews here, it should always be remembered ""you get what you pay for"" and Pelangi is good value for money considering its location.
See you in 2017 guys :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
305,Disappointing,20,January 2017,"The rooms are quite dated in this hotel. The bathroom is does not have modern fixtures. Though overall the room and bathroom were clean.

The location is good. However I was extremely disappointed by the fact that they have only one restaurant at the hotel, which is used for both breakfasts and dinners. Bali is hot and humid and dinner was uncomfortable given that there was little reprieve from the heat and while we had dinner we were being bitten constantly by mosquitos.

Breakfast was good - but once again insects had invaded the bread and other buffet foods and it all made for an uncomfortable experience.

Generally the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

Seminyak' beaches are very dirty though and thus although being close to the beach is nice - it's not worth paying the extra amount to be right on the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
306,Foreshore Location,50,May 2016,Stayed at the Pelangi several times and always enjoyed the location and friendly staff.Situated right on the foreshore with umbrellas and deck lounge chairs with food and drink service.Step straight on to the beach for a massage or buy products from the local sellers,Pelangi Bali Hotel
307,Excellent service in a good hotel,40,December 2016,"I stayed 7 nights at this hotel for my first trip to Bali. It's approx. 25mins drive from Denpasar airport and just a 10 second walk to Seminyak beach. There are loads of restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance (including a Circle K opposite where you can get forgotten essentials and snacks etc.). The area around the hotel is not as busy/packed as the hotels closer to Kuta beach. There are still a good number of tourists around but you don't have to wake up ridiculously early to secure a spot on the beach or by the pool if that's what you're after. The rooms are clean and a decent size for solo and couples travelling. Not much going on in the mini bar if that's your thing. The pool is kid friendly and very beautiful. You can walk past the pool to Seminyak beach but you will have to rent the sun-beds. It's not that expensive and as with most things in Bali, you can negotiate on the price. The room service dinner menu is exactly the same as one of the hotel restaurants (there are 2 restaurants). I didn't visit the Sunset Terrace restaurant so not sure what they serve there. The food here tastes good but I would have liked more variety in the buffet breakfasts (I'd give their breakfast a 6/10). The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. My flight wasn't until midnight on the day I checked out and not only was I allowed to leave my luggage at the hotel, but also allowed use one of the rooms to shower and freshen up before leaving at no extra charge. If it's luxury you're after, I wouldn't recommend here, but if you want a really nice hotel with a great atmosphere this is definitely it. With this hotel, you get what you pay for and more. I plan to return.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
308,great place,50,December 2016,"this is a great place to stay, pool area is great with plenty of lounge chairs, beach is close and great to swim in, food, service, and rooms were excellent this is possibly more for couples and the older generation as it has a quieter feel then the resorts in Kuta",Pelangi Bali Hotel
309,Relaxing Holiday,50,November 2016,"If you are after a relaxing holiday with great beachfront views, fantastic spa treatments, yummy food and friendly helpful staff then this is the hotel for you! We spent 8 days here and had a lovely time. Nothing is too much trouble for the friendly staff. The rooms are a generous size and very clean. The pool was very clean and the swim up bar was great for a relaxing cocktail after spending time relaxing on the beach or going boogie boarding. The spa treatments were of a very high standard and the staff were lovely and very skilled. We loved it! Thanks Pelangi Bali Spa Resort for a memorable holiday😊",Pelangi Bali Hotel
310,Best sunset,40,November 2016,The hotel has a nice pool over looking the beach. In the evening a stroll to the Beach gets you one the most breathtaking sunset with the colourful display of umbrellas from restaurant and bars located on Kuta Beach. The rooms are specious and clean with a compliment of friendly staff members.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
311,Pelangi holiday,50,November 2016,"This is a great place to stay, great pool, great beach, breakfast is fantastic, all food great and reasonably priced, beach massages, has everything you would need, curtosy bus 4 times a day to Kuta, any tours etc. can be arranged at front desk",Pelangi Bali Hotel
312,"Wonderful, first time in Bali",40,November 2016,Great place to stay on a budget. Meals prices are very reasonable and of good quality. Breakfast is more than adequate. Staff are exceedingly friendly and very obliging. Rooms could do with a paint and some maintenance to bathroom would be a good idea. Hotel does look a little tired. But the prie of the room makes up for a little cosmetic failings. Sheets and towels could be replaced as they were old and somewhat stained. Perhaps more care by the laundry wouldn't go astray. This is not a 5 star hotel so don't expect 5 star facilities. We had a wonderful stay and will return. A special thankyou to Wayan for making us feel special.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
313,Needs repairs and a good upgrade.,20,November 2016,"I hardly write a bad review but I felt ripped off from what I paid for, especially for a place that is listed on the Accor Hotels site.

Granted, I only stayed for one night between transferring locations but I found this hotel needing repairs and dated.

The bed sheets and room had that usual “Bali” smell of naphthalene and incense, the toilet wasn’t flushing well, very low pressure for the shower and the air-con makes a loud noise. The TV wasn’t working and the gym (main reason for booking) had equipment that was a bit rusty. I complained about the toilet first to which staff responded very quickly but didn’t bother with the others as I was only there for a short stay. The pool facilities and restaurant needs to be upgraded or at least have a paint job done.

One thing that stood out was during check-in the attendant grabbed my bag to take me to my room, they continued to give me an intro on how to use the TV, safe, shower etc it was very obvious they were expecting a tip as they would continue to point things out after the elongated silence when I would say “thank you”.

The food for breakfast and the staff in general were fine but from the website photos and the price I paid, I was expecting more.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
314,Great place to stay,40,November 2016,"The Pelangi Hotel is positioned in a central place, pool over looks the beach, A traditional Balinese Hotel. Vey clean, staff are great. Has a gym and restaurant. Food is best for day eating. They have a bus that heads to Kuta every two hours. Just love it at the Pelangi Hotel",Pelangi Bali Hotel
315,Ok,40,November 2016,"This is the 2nd time this year that we have stayed. Nice hotel, maybe an upgrade in a few areas wouldn't go astray. For the price you pay it is for the location of hotel. There are nicer hotels for less $
I found the beds very hard. Room service was great, staff at front area, security guards and the rest of the staff are fantastic.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
316,Ideal location.,50,November 2016,"We loved this place and can't understand some of the negative comments.Bali is hot -very hot for the likes of us visiting from cold climes so to hear the pool was ""too hot"" is rediculous.As regards the gardens every day half a dozen men would be bevering away and they were immaculate.So much therefore for that.
For us the location was everything.It is superb with some wonderful beach bars to chill out in a few meters away.Each had their own individuality music and food.Infront of them were the scattered bean bags and to watch the sun setting was bliss.
The hotel itself may not be The Ritz but to us it was as good as.Staff were so happy and friendly.The food at breakfast was good and lobby staff helpful, informative and willing.Rooms were clean and yes everything worked.Who wants to stay in their rooms on holiday anyway so does it matter if they are ""dated"".To us they weren't and were there to crash out in.
Embrace what you have.Go into something half hearted and that translates.We did the opposite and loved the place.We couldn't be far wrong as many guests informed us they come back year after year and that was clear to see when they met up with staff and greeted like family.
This hotel is lovely.We loved it.Go there and enjoy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
317,Very average hotel,20,November 2016,"We didn't feel this hotel offered very good value for money and ended up only choosing to stay for 1 night. The hotel itself is huge with so many rooms, the rooms are very basic and needed a good clean, the pool isn't as it looked in the photos and the breakfast was very average. We also found the reception staff to be very unhelpful. The location to the beach is good with only a minor road to cross but Seminyak centre for restaurants and shops is a 25 minute walk away.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
318,Affordable Bali beach hotel with amazing facilities!,40,March 2016,"I was here with my wife and had a totally romantic week! Was doing dome work in Singapore, so it was a quick hop flight to Bali. With so many hotels to choose from, the Pelangi struck a chord of balance between price, location and ambience. All told a great stay supported by friendly staff, and a terrific beach. i recommend to sign up for a private tour of the island directly at reception, as well they have spa staff for massages.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
319,Such a great hotel but don't trust the sales tour reps in the hotel!,40,November 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 8 days and we were so impressed with everything especially for the price we paid! The swimming pool and location is great! It's right on the beach front and so easy to get anywhere! It was my birthday during the week and when we got back from breakfast that morning, they had left a cake and card which was so thoughtful and such a nice gesture! The breakfast is good with quite a large selection! The rooms were tidy and a good size. The only complaint we have is with the tour sales person at reception.. He was very greedy and didn't want to help at all! He was constantly trying to over charge us and just not helpful.. Didn't seem to know much about any tours and just didn't seem bothered to give us information! We asked one day the price to Ubud on a scooter and he said 750,000 for one day whereas we had rented one for the 8 days for 300,000. From then on, we knew not to trust him so I wouldn't bother going through him for any tourist attractions. Everything is cheaper online or in Seminyak square! Overall, the staff were very friendly and the location is great!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
320,An option I would always go for,40,November 2016,"This was the 2nd time I stayed in this hotel after 1 yr almost. I really love this hotel. Great location right at the beach front. Many attractions that you can have around and after all take a walk back to the hotel and rest in the pool are.. specially I like having my long breakfast in this place. Also for lunch and dinner they have a great menu to taste. Both the front line people and all people working in this hotel are with smiling faces and doing their best to make u happy. I would for sure go for this hotel next time I will go to bali.. the only thing is the room decoration and hardware is just basic ones that you need.. anyways since I do spend time at nite to rest, personally more of that is not necessary for me.. I am quite happy with what they offer..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
321,Quite disappointed given what we paid,20,November 2016,"Rooms are tiny, the inclusive buffet breakfast was a disaster. Ended up just eating toast if we didn't want to walk anywhere. All the food was below average which was very disappointing!!!! When we asked to get a taxi from the hotel they wouldn't do it which was also very annoying.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
322,Seen better days,20,October 2016,"Recently checked into Pelangi for a 3 night stay with my daughter. Position is great, on the beach at Seminyak.
Owners take note. !!!! This hotel has the potential to be great, but is badly in need of a major refurb. Rooms old and tired, our smelled and we had to be moved. Ended up checking out as wasn't what we had thought it would be. Gardens even overgrown... gardens are nearly always manicured in Bali.....Pool was so warm it felt horrid.
Would not recommend",Pelangi Bali Hotel
323,"Friendly Service, Good value for money.",40,October 2016,Quite content with this hotel. Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and welcoming. The pool area is great and the beach is just across the street. I would like to mention that i found the Wifi signal to be quite poor and the cleaning could use some work but all in all it was quite a good hotel for the price. Would definitely recommend to others.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
324,Good location but needs a renovation,30,November 2016,"It's on the beach, surrounded by good bars and restaurants. The sunset at the beach is amazing. The pool is not bad.
But the rooms are small, the bathroom is not super clean, everything smells like bleach, the gym equipment are old and unsafe and the wifi is not as fast as other places in Bali. I probably won't stay here again, it's too old.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
325,Pool Disapointing,30,October 2016,"Overall happy with this hotel for the price, location and cleanliness. But actually chose this hotel because of the pictures and write ups of the pool. There's nothing better than a nice pool to cool off in and laze around in the afternoon. Unfortunately this pool was not that. It was always warm, and always had the lounges being barred. There was nothing refreshing about using the swim-up bar, was like drinking cool Bintang in a warm batch. After the first day we resorted to cold showers and air-con in the room, instead of staying around the pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
326,Pleasantly surprised,40,October 2016,"I recently had a 4 night stay at Pelangi on my own for some R&R. I've never travelled to Bali on my own and was apprehensive at first. From the moment I arrived at the Airport I was picked up by transport the hotel had organised (included in accommodation). The driver was friendly car was clean and air conditioned. When I arrived at hotel check in was smooth and fast at 1am just what your looking for. I was shown to my room by very friendly staff. My room surprised me for the amount I paid the room was immaculate newly renovated in Balinese decor, massive big comfy king size bed and aircon was perfect. Pool area was nice lots of lounges pool over looking the ocean. I found breakfast to be awesome nice tasting and good quality. I have no hesitation recommending the Pelangi and I'll be back",Pelangi Bali Hotel
327,Great location for its price,40,October 2016,"Had no major problems during our 3-night stay here. Awesome location, right on the beach, half way between the main hub of Seminyak and Kuta.

Pros:
- Location and beach views
- Nice pool, with a sunken pool bar, where you can relax while watching the beach at sunset
- Rooftop bar overlooking the ocean
- In-hotel money changer to avoid the foreign exchange 'scammers'
- Nice staff
- Decent gym
- Rooms aren't too bad

Cons:
- Room balconies are very small
- A very long hotel means a lot of walking
- Hotel is a little old and could do with some updating
- Reception won't accept ordering of metered taxis to hotel
- Buffet breakfast is average
- Cocktail 'happy hour' is only 20% off and only on Sunday afternoons..

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would go back for the great location at a decent price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
328,Excellent location and a great band!,40,October 2016,"This was the cheapest of the hotels we stayed in on our trip to Bali. It was meant as an overnighter from a late incoming flight but you know what we had such a lovely night at the restaurant with the great band, it was probably our most fun night overall! The rooms are small but good enough and clean and as we were on the ground floor we did not have a private out-side sitting area but it seems as though the first floor rooms do have a small balcony. The location is good, very central to shops and just a few steps from the beach area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
329,Have a look out the back door,10,October 2016,"I know people who have stayed here, I haven't but I do frequent the gang that runs by the back of the kitchen. If you want to know how a business runs have a look behind the scenes and the kitchen is not a bad example especially if you eat there. The gang itself is almost impassible due to clutter, junk and over flowing grease traps. Then there's the vacant block next door which has become a convenient rubbish dump. Terrible attitude to their own immediate environment. For a hotel that rates itself what else is could you question? As always, my interaction with any staff has been good especially the security guys.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
330,Disappointing,30,October 2016,"Great location, initially very happy with hotel but would like to WARN prospective clients that if you make use of swim up bar to sign EVERY TIME you place an order. When going to pay our bill at the end of our stay one of the days was over double the amount. When we disputed amount, management would not listen, unfortunately bar manager would not own up to his mistake of adding someone else's drinks to our tab. This also happened to friends we were holidaying with. Shame Pelangi places more control (sign in and out daily) on pool towels than on bar tabs. Though settled amicably it seemed odd that later staff refused to order us a taxi, telling us to go out the front and flag one. The Pelangi is near the end of a dead end street!! No taxi's so our friend had to walk quite a distance to the nearest main road to flag one down.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
331,What it is advertised as,40,October 2016,"We spent 6 nights at the pelangi with a group. The hotel was everything you would expect from the star rating. Rooms are clean and decorated in the traditional Bali style, The aircon worked well and the rooms were nice and cool. The staff were pleasant and the breakfast included was basic but well made and included an egg station. The location is nice with beach front access which opened onto a range of beach bars and restaurants, a 15 min walk along the beach will get you to the heart of Seminyak. You can get transport there but it takes about the same amount of time to go by taxi/transport, the hotel also offer a free shuttle bus at several times throughout the day to Kuta.

There was an issue with our payment for the stay. we were leaving 1 day earlier than the rest of our group due to work commitments, although we were booked in for and charged for 7 nights. My only comment around this would be to ask to see a printout of your invoice prior to paying to ensure everything is correct. We never received one as we paid or even on checkout, although this probably would not have changed us having to pay for the 7 nights. Also the wifi is quite spotty with reception dropping out and some devices not able to pick it up. This is a minor issue for me as I don't come to Bali to sit on my devices all day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
332,Great hotel and location,50,September 2016,This hotel was amazing and fantastic I could not say a thing wrong with this hotel from when I arrived to the time I left it was great the rooms were comfortable and clean and the food was great at breakfast and right on the beach I would definatly stay here again thank you for your great service,Pelangi Bali Hotel
333,Return visit,50,September 2016,"This hotel is amazing. This is our second visit & without a doubt we will be back again. Amazing hotel. The staff here I believe to be world class, they've just renovated some of the rooms & the they are fantastic. We stayed here last time on our honeymoon & have returned with our 6month old after a disappointing stay at another hotel. We check out early from the other one & came straight back here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
334,For $80 - max $100 a good place in Seminyak,30,September 2016,"Spent 2 nights at this older, a lil worndown almost beachfront hotel in Bali. Rooms comfortable, clean large bathrooms, nice pool and decent restaurant. Close to the 'main street' with nightlife and shopping. I overpaid, Australian holidays, but if you get a rate around $80 with b- fast is a decent place to stay. Fun restaurants / bars on beach right bext door.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
335,Mrs,50,September 2016,"Great hotel, great location, great staff, good buffet breakfasts, good restaurant, pool is great, rooms great, decor of rooms and lobby and pool area fantastic, the hotel massage and spa has private rooms for you to be totally relaxed and at ease, the only thing they need is an elevator, would recommend this hotel to other travellers.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
336,Perfect on the Beach,50,September 2016,"We stayed (as a couple) for our last two nights in Bali - wanting that ""beach"" access. On arrival, we were impressed with the overall ""look"" of the hotel and access for baggage. Check in was smooth and we were shown to our upper floor room - which was perfectly adequate. The sheets were bright white and starched beautifully, and the bathroom was clean - although there wasn't really any room to store your toiletries. The hotel provided free WIFI and a mini-bar fridge, and also coffee/tea making facilities. The wee balcony was ""just that""... but fine. Proximity to the pool and restaurant was great and just a stone's throw from the hotel was a lane which you crossed - and there was the beach. Heaven in paradise! The hotel pool is sectioned into three parts - children's area, swim-up bar and then a two metre deep end. There were plenty of lounges with great cushions and the pool towel cabana had a check in/out system operating.

Our breakfast was included with our stay.. and it was substantial with hot dishes, egg station, pastries/toast/condiments and gorgeous ""ginger"" tea.

We loved our stay, great staff and very friendly ""vendors"" right by the beach. It was beautiful and we will come back again.

PS: There's a shop across the road where you can purchase beer/coke, snacks for your room! Hotel also provides a transfer to airport if needed - negotiate!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
337,Absolutely Fantastic!!!!,50,August 2016,"We stayed at Pelangi Resort in August for 10 days and it was fabulous! The staff are incredible, nothing is ever a problem and always happy to help. Rooms were a good size, hardly in them though. I can't wait to come back next time!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
338,Nice place on beach front,40,September 2016,Hotel is quite adequate in this area of Bali the rooms are a bit dated but still ok. The pool area is nice but the lounge hogs are fully on display especially from those at an age who should know better! So get in early and if you go for lunch or a massage give up your seat to a fellow holidayer 🤗,Pelangi Bali Hotel
339,"Great location, beautiful staff but hotel is antiquated",30,September 2016,"We stayed here purely for the location. It's quite central to most things and is off the main streets. We stayed for 6 nights with breakfast included. The pool area was nice and has areas for both adults (deep end & bar) and children (shallow area this is sectioned off). The hotel is the upper end of average pricing per night. It really needs some maintenance and a little updating and it could be amazing.

Pros:
The hotel is in a great location.
The breakfasts is standard but nice (it has an egg station and not a lot of choice for vegetarians).
The a/c in the rooms is quite cool.
The beach is directly access the lane and you can watch the waves crashing down at breakfast.
The staff are lovely and very helpful.
The rooms were always served promptly and looked nice.
The beds are firm but I like a firm bed.

Cons:
The hotel/rooms are very antiquated and in need of some renovations.
Our bathroom had mould and always smelt of bleach.
The towels were often stained and looked like they hadn't been washed (however, they had been).
The pillows were very high and hard.
The wireless is pretty slow and frustrating as it can drop in and out.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
340,Just a perfect place to be:,50,August 2016,"This hotel is not a 5 star, but the staff and presentation of this wonderful place certainly is, if you are thinking about a relaxed and special holiday in the beautiful island of Bali, then you should look at this hotel for your stay..Wonderful people and a perfect place to be:
Enjoy the atmosphere of the Indonesian Island.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay just that bit more special:",Pelangi Bali Hotel
341,Nice hotel in a good location,40,September 2016,"Stayed at the Pelangi for one night to catch the sunset on Seminyak beach which was beautiful.

The hotel is nice and the staff are friendly and helpful.

The room is a nice size and you have all you need but the balconies on the second floor are pretty small.

Lovely pool area and access to the beach at the back of the hotel.

Breakfast had a nice selection and plenty of spaces to sit, so all in all a great hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
342,Back to Pelangi Bali,50,August 2016,"Had another wonderful week at Pelangi Bali Hotel last month. Since leaving in April all I could think about was when I'd be going back again (I've stayed there many times before) then there was an airfare special too good to miss so I booked & went again in August. The week was fantastic, as always, and I've already booked again for next year. Everything about Pelangi Bali Hotel represents my perfect Bali holiday, it's just the best! 😊",Pelangi Bali Hotel
343,Cute little Resort right on the beach in Seminyak,40,March 2016,"The rooms are clean and tidy but small.... BUT luckily you dont really spend much time in them. Great location, right across from the beach. The beach is a must see/do at night. So many places to sit and have dinner and drinks and listen to live music. One of my favourite things to do while in Seminyak. The resort has a great pool that overlooks the ocean. Not the cheapest place but not expensive. Still Aussie priced drinks. Don't recommend girls walking home alone at night in the area. In the streets or even to rooms after getting out of a taxi.
The verandah on the room is so tiny one person can sit out there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
344,Not as it seemd,30,May 2016,"My first impression of the hotel online looked great, sadly it didn't when we arrived. there was no greenery at the front ? the reception area is very large but not a lot of staff. But the staff we saw and talked with were very helpful when needed. The room was big enough, but need to add some drawers or side bed cuboards to put things on.
There a tiny space outside the room for table and chairs, which are in the room and wouldn't fit outside space is small. Didnt realy see much of the chamber men/women, They were very young, I was wondering why it took 4/5 of them to do one room ? were Food hall I shall call it, well I only had breakfast and one snack. the breakfast (Bacon) I know it said crspy, but it looked as though it had died a slow death like yesterday. so disappointed I was even told I couldn't have milk in a jug for morning coffee ? so I helped myself to milk for cereal. The décor is disgusting it looks like it was decorated in the 50s. Lamps for ceining lights need replacing, infact the whole eating area could do with an overhall. The staff weren't friendly or helpful at all. They didn't smile stood about chatting to eachother. A smile goes along way and doesn't cost a penny. No wonder why breakfast time was the busiest.I may have seen 3 people eat there at any othertime.
The swimming pool was ok, although the step that goes across is abit dangerous for someone who is blind. There wasn't enough loungers or umbrellas for those who needed one. what I didn't understand , the guy packed the umberellas away when it rained? WHY ?
THERE IS A PART OF THE POOL AREA AT THE BACK OF THE HOTEL NEAR THE EXIT TO THE BEACH. I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE SUNLOUNGERS RIGHT NEAR A LONG DROP INTO SOME KIND OF WORKS PLACE BELOW. IT IS DEFINATLY NOT SAFE AND WILL EITHER KILL SOMEONE OR SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE. PLEASE MANAGER YOU REALY NEED TO FENCE IT OFF AT A HEIGHT THAT ISNT A THREAT TO YOUR GUESTS OR ANYONE ELSE....
YOU HAVE FENCE AROUND SOMETHING AT THE OPPERSITE END OF THE POOL..
SO when you go to the back of the hotel towards the beach, which is just literly there.
But what we didn't know was the is a small road which motor bikes use all the time. and in the dark its no fun. we managed to find ourway back to the hotel the back way. very dark and to be honest I didn't see any form of light to show the steps up to back of hotel, and we didn't notice any security. We could have been anyone coming in.. scary thought.
yes the front of the hotel just as it says front its a front. which isn't that bad. but to be honest If you stay here for a couple of days thatd be fine but I wouldn't stay here for a week again. even though recep staff were gud that's all that was. please it needs a big total refurb, its in a prime spot for windsurfing mixin with the locals, meet like to like people. with the strip round the corner plenty places to have a bev and chingwag. very busy... ,",Pelangi Bali Hotel
345,Loved it!!!!,50,August 2016,"My husband and I stayed 5 nights here for our honeymoon. We absolutely loved it, the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We're now staying in Swiss Bell Hotel in Tuban and would prefer to be back at Pelangi!! Thank you so much to the team at Pelangi and especially Agus, he was so helpful! We will be back next year A++++",Pelangi Bali Hotel
346,Good all rounder,40,August 2016,"As mentioned in my last, I have returned. Little has change but some rooms have had a face lift, I stayed in a re-furbed room with a bed so large you would need to phone your partner on the other side. Some of the more friendly staff remembered me by name but this time around I experienced some 'attitude' from some others- which took the edge off desire to love the place as I did before. As a result I will not be returning this trip as I had planned, deciding to explore elsewhere.

Regardless of this, I think this place is a great ""all rounder"" and I will certainly give it consideration when I return to Bali after Christmas.

If your a honeymooner or cementing a new relationship, be wary of the rooms with an adjoining door (family room). You can hear every sound next door so you may very well entertain (or annoy) the oldies in the room next to you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
347,Great location!,40,August 2016,"The location of this hotel won me over... This is my second stay & I would happily come again. The rooms are simple, not amazing but ok when you consider the location which is excellent on the beach, quiet yet central & the pool & restaurant (nice food) overlook the beach! I wouldn't pay any more than $150 AUD per night but at this rate it's rightly priced for location. Most beachfront hotels charge much higher rates.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
348,Nice view,30,April 2016,"I have just walked by and tried their restaurant. The view is nice, their restaurant is facing the beach but not too close. The food was good but not too excellent. the staff was welcoming and warming.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
349,Great spot but getting a little tired !,40,August 2016,"The perfect location ,wonderfull staff but needs a little paint here and there mainly in dining area. Pool area also in need of love ! But a great pool none the less Rooms are comfortable and would stay there again .One thing that puzzles me is that TripAdvisor has been advertising this resort fron $86 ! All the times I have tried it's been double that ,so I would like confirmation of when this rate applies ?",Pelangi Bali Hotel
350,Perfect break,50,August 2016,"I loved staying at Pelangi for my whole trip. Me and my friend stayed there for 12 nights. The staff were fantastic and the amenities were great also.
Was also a good location as it was close to everything.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone and know they will not be disappointed.
I will definitely be back ;)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
351,I will be back next year!,50,August 2016,"Friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast buffet was awesome with a variety of food (eggs anyway you want it, Indonesian and European food, fruit, yoghurt, toast etc). Superior room was big enough. Bathroom and water pressure was good. Pool and restaurant is great, enough space for everyone (never too busy). Beach is so close. There is so many bars, restaurant and entertainment on the beach, everywhere. New mini mart built as we arrived across the road. I will be back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
352,Ideal Location,40,August 2016,"On first arrival at the hotel, it was very late at night and I was tired after a long journey so I wasn't too impressed with the decor. However, I must say in the morning after I rested, I was very impressed. The room was lovely with plenty of space, the bathroom spotless. The pool is great and I really liked the fact that no-one was putting towels to reserve places and I never had trouble finding a good spot by the pool. Just across the road is the ocean with great views. The upstairs restaurant served excellent food and all in all, I would say this is a great hotel in a great location with excellent staff",Pelangi Bali Hotel
353,Nice and close to the beach,30,August 2016,"The hotel was nice and clean - maybe a bit dated. The pool, sun-area and restaurant is a bit tight or small...There were not enough sun-chairs and the sun was gone for the majority of the area at four o'clock in the afternoon.

Attended balinesian evening with dancing and food - only 5 table attended and the
dansing was quiq and had no live music. But the food was very nice and portions generous.

Location was very good - only one step away from the beach and several beachclubs with amazing atmosphere, serving nice food and drinks and offering live music from four to ten o'clock. It was a bit hard to go swiming die to heavy waves and currents.But a lot of opportunities to go surfing and get cheep massages! Massages at the hotell is a rip off - do not book there!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
354,Back to the Pelangi again!!,50,July 2016,"This hotel calls us back each year!! I was a bit worried that we had booked a superior room this time, because in the past we had the deluxe room. But we found the newly redecorated room to be very nice indeed. The room was large enough for our requirements, and also the bathroom was fine, with great water pressure in the shower. It also had a very comfortable pillow top bed which was a new addition. The pillows were were a bit hard though.
The breakfast is always good at the Pelangi, they have everything you could want and the food is hot.
All the staff are always friendly and helpful at the Pelangi, and remember us each time we come back.
The gardens are very well kept and truly beautiful, they are the work of Ketut who works hard every day, and always loves to show off his garden. He is very proud of it.
We stayed at three different hotels this year, but Pelangi wins for the best breakfast.
We will be back!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
355,friendly staff shared us much info about Bali,50,August 2016,"Kadek the receptionist was so friendly,he tell is a lot about Bali and the room in Orlando hotel was clean, just the breakfast is not suite for us. But the location is good and the beach side was the same as the advertiser on.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
356,Wonderful hotel,50,August 2016,I am usually very critical of where i stay but can't fault this hotel! Two thumbs up. Everything was done with efficiency and friendliness. There was a shortage of teaspoons at breakfast for our coffee and tissues instead of paper napkins but that's little quirks we joke about. I got a surprise cake in my room far my birthday!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
357,"Good location,nice staff, but the hotel is getting shabby",30,August 2016,"The rooms are clean and the staff friendly, but the breakfast is below average and the coffee awful.The hotel is very tradional balinese, which is really nice, but it is getting very shabby. The hotel has a very flat atmosphere and the restaurant staff are not attentive.On the upside the hotel is in a good location close to some great cafes and restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
358,Cute little hotel,50,July 2016,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights. Im shocked at the tripadvisor reviews for this hotel as we really liked it. It is on a long narrow piece of land and the balconies are small with a ground walkway that has flowers and trees and is pretty. The staff are friendly and polite always saying hello. People do reserve sun loungers early but we didn't have a problem getting them up until 9am. The pool area is nice with a little swim up bar. We didn't encounter problems with people smoking by the pool or restaurant. Breakfast is good enough, fried food, fruit, Danish etc. The beach is over the road and at night the bars and restaurants put bean bags on the beach where you can sit and have cocktails etc we would stay again for a few nights definitely.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
359,"Friendly Staff, but disappointing hotel and buffet breakfast. Nice SUITE room",20,July 2016,"Although the hotel is fairly clean with friendly service, this was a disappointing experience. There are better hotels in Bali, Seminyak we have stayed before. Unfortunately this is an old hotel, very long corridors, tall concrete walls. The entrance to this hotel is very dark.

We stayed in the Suite Room (this is the ONLY room with an ocean view). The suite room itself was spectacular and spacious and just like the photos advertised on their website.

The other rooms look fairly average from the outside. The breakfast limited in variety, and food was dry.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
360,Mixed Feelings,40,August 2016,"We have stayed at Pelangi Bali over several years and have loved it and given it perfect reviews. The hotel and staff are still fabulous, they are friendly and helpful and the amenities and location are perfect. Breakfast is great, pool bar and towels are great, rooms are clean and everything works. BUT..has Kuta reached Seminyak or were we just unlucky with our stay as the guests were very different from previous years. The guests around the pool and restaurant were generally obese, tattooed, smoking, drunk and loud Australians the whole time we were there. They arrived at the pool bar each day and drank all afternoon until one even vomited and could hardly walk. Some of you may read this review and think we are snobs but we choose not to associate with these people at home on the Gold Coast and we don't want to be with them on holiday either. We love authentic places like Pelangi Bali, we don't like big sterile 5 star hotels.We like the shops, the massages and lively bustle around Seminyak but I fear we may have to look at other places in Bali like Sanur or Ulawatu for future years.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
361,Staff friendly,40,July 2016,Great place to stay location was excellent next to the beach plenty of restaurants close by and staff were very friendly pool was clean rooms were getting very old but still clean but are in the process of refurbishing recommend place to stay,Pelangi Bali Hotel
362,OK for those on a budget,20,August 2016,"I agree 100% with PygmyLeader. This is an OK hotel for the price and location, but it's not for those seeking quality accommodation and a Bali experience.

The reserving of sun lounges around the pool, principally by people in their 50s and 60s who should know better, was rude and inconsiderate, and the practice should be firmly dealt with by pool staff. It was also extremely disappointing that smoking was permitted close to the breakfast area and around the pool. Non-smokers find second-hand smoke obnoxious and paying guests should not have to suffer it.

I agree that the breakfast could have shown a little more imagination, but it was perfectly fine for the price. Tip: Avoid the Danish pastries, which IMHO would make very effective road base! Fabulous coffee.

The room exceeded my expectations, but I agree that the general maintenance and cleaning could be improved. The hotel has quite a shabby, 1970s feel to it. There is no garden to speak of, and the pool area is a concrete wasteland. Those who say the Pelangi pool is great should check out what $215/night gets you at the Royal Beach, 500 metres north along the beach.

We were not thrilled with the one meal we had at the hotel (apart from breakfast) so we ate out every day. The cheap and cheerful Cendana cafe near the entrance to the Royal Beach Resort is highly recommended, as is Poppies Restaurant near Bemo corner, Kuta.

As always in Bali, the staff were great, very obliging and accommodating.

People may not be aware of it, but in the past year or so the beach from north Seminyak all the way to Kuta is turned over at night to beach eating/drinking with different live and recorded music offered every 100 metres or so. The crowds were unbelievable and it was great fun. It all seemed to shut down around 11.00 pm, so noise was not a problem. Be aware that the food is indifferent, and you will pay more for a beer on the bean bags than you would at a sit-down restaurant.

The Pelangi is fine for those on a budget who nonetheless want to be in the thick of the action. However, if you are from that demographic that has become acquainted with the better things in life, the Pelangi may not be for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
363,Good Location..,30,August 2016,"This is about the 8th time I have stayed at the Pelangi Hotel. I love the location of this hotel, as it is on the beach, easy to walk to legian for shopping, seminyak for good restaurant's and has the funky little beach bars out the front of the hotel which offer reasonable food at night with live music. This time I had a 2 hour stone massage treatment in the day spa which was excellent, very professional service in a great part of the hotel that is quiet. The masseuse was outstanding. I had just come from a resort in Levina that had an amazing out of this world day spa, and this was on par with that. I was impressed! The pool bar is fun, a little slow. Breakfast is nothing special, so usually eat out from the hotel. All the staff are friendly and accommodating to your needs, so I believe that this hotel is value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
364,All about the location!,40,July 2016,"A peaceful and comfortable hotel located right on the heart of the Seminyak beach close to La Plancha and all the beanbag beach huts to eat and drink. My room was a great size with a big comfy bed, breakfast had a great choice and the staff were pleasant.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
365,"Budget hotel, budget experience",20,July 2016,"We paid $103/night for a seven-night stay in July-August, which is far less than other places we have stayed at, so this review accepts that the Pelangi cannot be criticised for not providing all the bells and whistles of a $250/night property. The hotel is on a long, narrow block, which obviously presented design problems, especially with the pool area. The accommodation is in two three-storey wings (the top storey is not used) which are only 6 metres apart. This presents as two long, thin buildings with very little space between them.
The good: Great beachside location, excellent staff, adequate rooms with really good aircon and water pressure. The two single beds were firm and comfortable and the pillows up there with the best. Good soundproofing. OK breakfast for the price. I expected noise to be an issue, but it wasn't. Things could get interesting if several families known to each other booked rooms. The bad: No Bali vibe. Gardens non-existent. Long, gloomy corridors, unswept staircases that were gritty underfoot, simple maintenance not attended to, rubbish TV with distorted sound, no DVD player, tiny balcony that faced the room in the opposite wing, six metres away, offering nil privacy. People smoking on their balconies affecting other guests. The place has an ""on hold"" feel about it, as if some time soon it will be demolished and rebuilt. The ugly: The pool is a shocker. I heard someone describe it as ""uninviting"" and we agreed. It has a tiled wall almost to water level dividing the shallow end from the deep. The pool can be accessed only from the two ends and a small part of the side, which means that space is at a premium. There is no shade except at the ocean end. Staff willingly move umbrellas on request, but it's a mission to stay out of the sun. The hotel appears to permit smoking on the sun lounges and at the pool bar, which occasionally made it an unpleasant environment for the 80% of us who are non-smokers. The downright horrible: The rude, inconsiderate guests who place towels on the premium sun lounges (those offering some shade from the few trees around the place) and then go off to breakfast or somewhere else for an hour and a half or more. I saw one lady regularly place eight towels on lounges around 7.30 am, then go to breakfast. This was a daily occurrence, and led to stiff competition for other premium spots. Staff are naturally unwilling to cause a drama, so nothing is done even when the situation is pointed out to them. A firm hand is required here, Pelangi people. You have put up the signs: Enforce them.
All in all, the Pelangi offered good value for those seeking a fantastic location at a reasonable price - but we won't be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
366,Great hotel,40,June 2016,Stayed here for a week nice hotel right on the besch not to expensive for the location. Room was good comfotable bed cold air con good swiming pool .the breakfast was great to .walk out the back to the beach with bars and restuarants there.short walk to shops with pubs bars lots of food options as well.would go back staff were very friendly and helpfull,Pelangi Bali Hotel
367,Home away from home!,50,July 2016,"My partner and myself have been to Bali twice now, first time staying at the Pelangi Bali and we are very confident we made the right choice! We booked 10 nights here and easily feels like our home away from home. Decent sized rooms, hot showers with awesome pressure, aircon works great - everything to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable this place offers it! The pool and pool area is everything it looks like in the pictures, as well as being on the beach front. The restaurant/room service food is delicious and cheap with a broad menu and the complimentary buffet breakfast every morning definitely filled us up for a big day out (both Indonesian and western food available) we didn't use the spa/massage facilities as we have a local favourite we go to. Very central location to everything, many restaurants along the beach and only a short taxi ride to almost anywhere. As a result we found the Pelangi very hard to fault - we aren't fussy travellers and we were more than happy with the hotel as a whole. A special mention to the beautiful and friendly staff from all parts of the hotel; reception, cleaners, waiters, bar staff, even the towel guy at the pool. Highly recommend the Pelangi Bali for all types of travellers looking for a home away from home!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
368,Fantastic Location,40,July 2016,"Took my kids aged 16 - 20. The beanbag pop-up bar on the beach right in front of our hotel proved a winner with the kids, whilst we kicked back beside the pool and could see them. Short walk to great restaurants, bars and shops. Rooms are clean, bed super comfy and hotel staff fantastic. With all the new modern resorts going up, it was nice to stay in a hotel that felt like Bali! Would definitely stay here again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
369,Recent trip,20,July 2016,Staff weren't the friendliest or inviting. Corridors to rooms dark and long. Foyer and entry dark and uninviting. Was disappointed with hotel after price paid. No lift. Breakfast was average. Great location.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
370,3rd time and won't be the last,40,June 2016,"I really enjoy staying at the pelangi. I stayed for the 3rd time over a 5 day period 2 weeks ago. The staff are friendly and accommodating. I feel they have taken on feedback from previous customers. The Wifi has improved across the complex, there are now safes in the rooms and the breakfast has gone up a notch. Love having breakfast there while looking out over the pool and crashing waves of the ocean. You pay in advance now on check in for your stay. This was a change but as staff explained some people have ""done a run"" on them before which has influenced this change. I don't blame them.
Once again I complement the friendly and professional staff.I look forward to my next stay. The location is the best!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
371,3.5 out of 5 in reality. Decent beach side hotel,40,July 2016,"Warm welcome from desk staff in a late night arrival. Room a good size for a couple but either more hangers or more drawers are needed. Bed very comfortable, wide and long which as I'm 1.88 m is always a bonus. Powerful shower but the head was a bit leaky and tended to spray the entire room if on full strength. Even a full sized bath if for some reason in tropical heat you feel like a hot soak! TV a bit old (perhaps the newer ones are in the posher rooms?) but a couple of free film and sport channels gave us all we needed on holiday. We were aware of staff outside at times but even when guests gathered outside the back of rooms closing the sliding door stopped any noise. I'm pretty sensitive to noise and had no worries on this score. The days on which we had room cleaned it happened quickly and efficiently.

Breakfast is a highlight. Lots of options. A guts like me could get juice, coffee (the tea looked weak), toast, pastries, french toast/waffles, fruit (apparently) and the makings of a full English brekkie. Some items are on rotation but there was always bacon and (small) sausages. There is an egg station but not all the staff could cope with poached eggs so stuck with scrambled when I used this facility.

Other meals in the restaurant were adequate but nothing outstanding. I would recommend the Asian dishes rather than the attempts at westernised meals. Not cheap but not outrageously priced either. We declined the chance of BBQ night as this did look expensive.

The pool area was good. Pool guy will remove towels left for ages by guests trying to hog the best spots but probably not right on the hour as the signs suggest. Easy to sign out a towel and he will bring an umbrella as soon as asked. A swim up bar serves beer, spirits and the brand of weak-ish cocktails provided in several of the beach bars. The shallow end has a submerged wall around it for the kids and the infinity style deep end is 2m. Water temp kept at a refreshing level but not cold. Toilets close by to pool.

The on site spa is good. We got a short freebie with our deal and went back for longer sessions. However a problem did arise here. I can't lay face down for long due to a hernia. I asked for an ""off menu"" massage of head, neck and back and a shorter session was agreed. The time was then moved, twice, and finally I was told by staff as we were in the waiting room (prompted by what appeared to be the senior woman) that I had to have an hour long one. A price had not been agreed up to this point but now I had to pay the full hour rate (175K). This change had not been flagged before, nor had it been mentioned in the calls changing the appointment. The massage was great - welcoming tea then back, neck arms and legs massaged, shower, warm drink - but the girl did have to flick ants off the table before I could use it. Incidentally, the shower does have a bamboo curtain that you can lower as it is open air looking over the ornamental fish pond but I left it up as only the most dedicated, abseiling voyeur could have seen in. Stimulating!

Another incident created a dubious feeling. I wanted to call the number of a mate's mate in Bali as he does some driving and we were considering using him for a tour/trip. I should have just used my mobile but don't have roaming so asked the front desk staff to call it. They asked me what it was for, told me it would be an expensive call which I would be billed for, suggested I use their tour desk (situated conveniently right next to the front desk) and when finally called the number fiddled around with the dialling buttons so that - amazingly - the number was unavailable. Hmmm. I could have forced the issue but our main focus for the holiday really was to slob around and enjoy each others company so left it at that. I would be interested to read of other similar experiences.

On a brighter note we found the staff to be generally friendly, happy to see us and helpful. We were there during Wimbledon and asked if the advertised big screen would be used to show the ladies final. The young man behind the bar admitted he didn't know how to set it up. The next night we asked about the men's final and the (different) bar man asked us when it was and what channel it was on. We told him and when we returned to the sports bar at 8:30 it was all set up and ready to go. So top marks to him for that.

The location of the hotel is very good backing right on to the beach. When you step out of the front of the pool area (carefully checking for scooters) it is only three steps across the ""gang"" to the top of the beach. Here there are beach bars, sun loungers, surf lessons, massages and beach vendors enough to satisfy anyone after the Bali experience. It is not a quiet, away from it all beach and the Air Asia umbrellas seem to stretch all the way back to Kuta, but it is still a generally relaxed place to stroll along or to mess about in the breakers. Going out of the main entrance of the hotel it is a short, shady walk to the end of a street filled with restaurants, bars, travel dealers, massage shops, supermarkets and basic clothes shops. A 15 minute walk up this will take you to another street that (in either direction) is filled with more of the same though some a bit more upmarket in some regards.

In summary this is a good hotel. No, not a five star experience but a generally good deal for a lazy week. It could probably use a few tweaks such as a repaint, ensuring all the staff know how to work everything and a bit of a look at the menu. Only at the more senior level of staff did I find anything to reproach them about and that was generally because I was trying to get a service outside of that which is actually offered by the hotel. Whether this is because they like to stick to the rules or because they feel they might be missing out on something I can't say. It was mostly clean, quiet, efficient and friendly so a hotel I can recommend for those with a budget in mind.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
372,Thoughtful staff,40,March 2016,"We stayed here in March, we had a lovely relaxing holiday, it was my birthday and was surprised with a lovely message and a birthday cake delivered to our room. We would recommend this hotel.
A room closer to the pool and restaraunt would have been more convenient.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
373,Honeymoon part 4,20,June 2016,"We are still here in Bali with only a few days left😥 Sad to leave Bali but not this hotel. I have read some of the excellent reviews and think ""am I missing something""!
We left Ubud in Bali where we stayed in a lovely boutique hotel that could not do enough for you, the rooms were gorgeous where here they are small, pokey and need improvement in the bathroom. In the morning you are woken up from 8am from the sounds of banging from the housekeepers. They banged on our door and demanded to clean the room there and then because it will not get done otherwise.
Breakfast serves till 10am, we turned up at 10am because we were not sure, they couldn't be bothered serving us. The woman was very rude she said you have to be quick. We were offered no coffee, no cutlery and everything had gone. We came again for breakfast at 9:30, tables are dirty they don't re set anymore tables for breakfast plus they don't bring more food out because the staff are trying to re set all the tables for lunch, but the restaurant is always deserted I've been here 9 nights so far and seen 2 people having lunch!
The Sunset terrace is never open so the description and pictures of the place are very deceiving, location is on the beach but beds are not provided on the beach, so your best staying somewhere else. Seminyak is not a big place so to walk to the beach would take you about 10 mins .
I wish I did more research I've seen really nice hotels here which I would definitely would of booked this place needs a makeover always deserted, nobody in the hotel bar or restaurant what does that say! The only thing is some of the staff are very friendly and hardworking like the pool guy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
374,Awesome Once Again!!!,50,June 2016,"I came here last year and fell in love with the place with a little help starting with the hotel. This time better and well done hotel for drafting in secure safes in all rooms. Saves going down to the reception everyday too!

Everything you have read is mostly true and all said before. To summarise, you pay for what you get. Please don't start moaning about this hotel if you expect a high 4* 5* hotel as I would rate this a high 3*. If you're looking for a great location, nice relaxing beach holiday then this is the place.

Everyone is so friendly, the place is spotless and as you can guess I am returning next year for 2 weeks in June again.

The cleaner even chased me down when leaving as I left a brand new pair of trainers behind. The Air Max had burst on one of the trainers so left there. I gave to the cleaner and he was made up! :o)

If you guys have any questions out there for the Pelangi just ask me. I will be honest and will do my best to help out. Also on Seminyak region too.

I would like to say one last thing - Chiriquitos (restaurant/bar) opposite slightly to the right as you look out to the beach is an amazing add on to the hotel. Excellent food, watch the sunset go down on the multi coloured bean bags. Smoke a shisha whilst listening to live music in the evening - Awesome!!!

See you next year Pelangi and well done all the staff!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
375,Ideal Location with beach views,50,June 2016,"We had a great few days at this hotel before going home to Australia. Our rooms were the closest to the beach and we thank Flight Centre for that. We were close to the pool, restaurant and beach. From here we were close to shops and beach restaurants and shops. The spa treatment at the hotel was first class. Ideal location",Pelangi Bali Hotel
376,Another Fantastic Stay,50,June 2016,"Another pleasant stay a this wonderful little hotel. The refurbished room was another very nice surprise (as we had not realised this had been taking place). The new king bed - bedhead - lighting - cupboards - flat screen tv - in room safe - all fantastic additions leading to a great stay. The staff can not seem to do enough for you, so friendly and helpful. Cant wait until our next stay...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
377,Decent 3.5/5,30,June 2016,"Our stay at Pelangi was pleasant, but something was missing to give it that 4* rating that I'd expected from the hotel.
Upon entering the hotel, the lobby wasn't lit up as expected and seen in the pictures, we checked in around mid afternoon and there seemed to be little light in the lobby which created a gloomy welcome. Although the staff at reception and bell boys were great; the environment seemed a bit dark for a hotel lobby.
The room itself wasn't too bad, but wasn't amazing. We had ones on the second floor (217). The room itself was large and spacious, with a basket of welcome fruits as well. However, the table that the fruit was one attracted a lot of small ants to it. So we didn't actually eat it as we got slightly put off. The room itself could have been more modern, as the TV was fairly old but something we could live with but overall felt a little dated.
The hotel pool wasn't bad as well, not the biggest pool and comes with a pool bar as well which is convenient. There is also a towel station which was nice, just sign a towel out and back in with ease. The restaurant is also situated right next to the pool area and is completely open air. The breakfast buffet was decent enough to wake up for and has an egg station to order fresh eggs/omelettes. However, the rest of the lunch/dinner menu was very average which is made up of mainly western dishes which is understandable.
Location wise was brilliant as it is right on the beach, so you have the choice of staying by the pool or walking down the steps to the beach. Please be advised, the beach beds aren't looked after by the hotel and are hired privately so bring some money with you if you do go to the beach. The website we booked on made it look like they were property of the hotel and free to use but they're not.
The area outside of the hotel isn't busy as its off the main road, but even on the main road there isn't that much bars or restaurants. To go to Seminyak Square is convenient and only approximately 7 mins by taxi, be prepared to haggle with the drivers as they will try to charge 3 times what it should be.
Overall, it was pleasant stay and I'd recommend staying here for a few days if you want to be close to the beach but close enough to get to the bars/restaurants at Seminyak square.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
378,Right next to beach!,50,May 2016,"I stayed here recently with a group of friends for 3 nights while in Seminyak. Nice rooms & bathroom, good AC, delicious breakfast, very short walk to beach, nice pool, bar in the pool, good restaurant, short taxi ride to town centre. Would recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
379,Enjoyed my stay,50,June 2016,Very clean and the staff are so helpful and friendly....enjoyed my stay here but felt the rooms were a little out dated but not fussed really coz u only use the room to sleep and shower......the pool is great and so are the views from the restaurant.....overall its a nice place to stay...,Pelangi Bali Hotel
380,Family Holiday,50,July 2015,"First visit to Bali and Palangi really set the standard. The staff were over catering and super friendly! Made you feel right at home. Everything you need is on-site and the location is spectacular. Pool and restaurant over looks Seminyak beach with beautiful sunsets. The breakfast selection was A+ and the rooms are cozy. Only fault is the wifi connect dropped in and out, it was very busy during our stay which could have contributed. Maybe something for them to work on.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
381,Good location,30,May 2016,"Have stayed at the Pelangi several times over the years. The hotel is situated right on the beach with a great pool with views of the ocean. The rooms feel a little tired but are comfortable. The buffet breakfast has enough variety but after a week of over eating you just feel like a juice for breakfast. The resorts restaurant is a little over priced although I haven't eaten there much. There are great restaurants in front of the resort on the beach that serve a great variety of meals. I would usually have my afternoon beers in front of the resort at Froggys... the guy hires surfboards , chairs etc.
I just feel at $140 USD per night the place is getting a little over priced compared to other accommodations in the Seminyak area. The staff were always friendly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
382,Old World Charm on The Beach,40,May 2016,"The Hotel staff greeted me on arrival with a refreshing cool drink and hand towel.
The front office staff were professional at check in with a minimum of fuss. I was escorted promptly to my clean well appointed air conditioned room. The Hotel is a little dated and could do with a spruce up, which I was informed was happening to some rooms during my stay. Overall the Hotel provides good clean facilities with very friendly staff in all areas.
The position adjacent to Seminyak Beach is superb, the very large pool and sunken bar overlooks the beach with it's traders and massage therapists at your doorstep.
The Hotel provides free shuttle bus services to central Kuta 4 times a day and the return trip by Bluebird metered taxis is around 30,000 rupiah.
One thing to note, only use Bluebird taxis as they are metered and professional, avoid using private drivers the Hotel staff recommend, one trip cost me 3 times a taxi fare .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
383,Poor communications from reception,20,March 2016,"Having asked on 2 occasions by email for the staff to confirm which room we should book to accommodate us and our infant children, we were referred on both occasions to the website.
We were then told we had booked the wrong room and they tried to charge us full rate to cancel it.
Very disappointing as the location is nice and central, though the hotel is huge so a bit impersonal.
The rooms (deluxe) are however nice and spacious, if you can get through the booking dramas.
We again tried to book through work recently as we were coming to Bali for a work conference.
Our work travel agent contacted them direct but they did not bother to respond.
They have now lost a total of 7 nights bookings from us due to their lack of communication.
The rooms at the Puri Cendana, which is about 100 metres up the road, are comparable and cheaper. You don't get the ocean glimpses and the pool is smaller, but you can at least book a room ahead without any hassle!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
384,dependable,40,May 2016,"I've stayed at Pelangi several times. It is a good, solid hotel: lovely swimming pool, decent buffet breakfast, good location adjoining the beach. The rooms are nothing special, but this year they have added an in-room safe, which is much more convenient. You can get better hotels for the same price, but they are 1km from the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
385,A good choice in Seminyak,30,April 2016,"I was torn between giving this hotel 3/5 or 4/5. Staff are friendly and efficient, food at breakfast is good but not the largest selection on offer and food at the restaurant is good. Our room was adequate but nothing special. The big plus is the location - a few yards from the pool and bar across a small road is the beach and an array of beach bars. For the price I don't think you can do better in Seminyak.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
386,Enjoyable Stay,40,May 2016,"Stayed in a ground floor unit for 4 nights. Good location with access to the beach. Loved the swim up bar. The cocktails were awesome! The rooms were a little dated but clean and comfortable. The only downside was that there was no elevator, which can be a bit inconvenient lugging suitcases up & down the stairs. Staff were helpful and friendly. Free one way shuttle bus to Kuta from the hotel a few times per day. All in all, happy with our stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
387,What a little Gem,50,May 2016,"Please ignore all negative comments I am from you the uk me and my partner are still in this resort with 2 weeks left to go the staff are very friendly you couldn't ask for more.

The pool is very clean and nice weather is so hot out hear not one day of rain so far been hear for 1 week already

The hotel is right on the beach great location walking distance from all the shops and bars, great rooms not dirty at all I recommend the balcony rooms we have looked at them all and like the balcony so you can relax at night very quite and chilled.

Not sure why people comment saying negative comments this hotel truly deserves a 4 star so much culture plants everywhere well looked after.

Any questions don't hesitate to contact me via what'sapp

All the best and enjoy,

Worth every penny.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
388,Quick 4 day getaway Bali Seminyak,40,May 2016,"Pelangi was ok but have stayed in better for cheaper price. I stayed in a ground floor apartment which was clean and quite nice however it was a fair way from the pool and restaurants. The tv was old and small flat screen and not a very good reception.There are no views at all.Found getting out with luggage difficult too as only stairs. Drinks at the pool were expensive. Breakfast was nice with a reasonable selection available. Dinner at the Sunset Restaurant was lovely, food delicious and relaxing atmosphere. The 2 musicians were entertaining. Views lovely over the ocean.The short walk to the beachfront was great. Garden was well maintained, but generally I found the place ok but a little gloomy. I won't be staying there again as certainly are nicer and cheaper places in Bali to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
389,Great place to stay,50,May 2016,"Very relaxing holiday great pool fantastic location
Really enjoyed our stay at Pelangi Bali hotel
Swim up bar in pool was great for an afternoon cocktail
Buffet breakfast was nice friendly staff who looked after our every need.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
390,Chiilin' in Bali,50,May 2016,"This is a BiG place, you will walk off lunch from the front to the back :) Rooms are getting a little tired but there are some re-forms in progress. Very friendly and accommodating staff who get to know you by name. I will be returning in August, not even bothering to ""shop around"". Highly recommended",Pelangi Bali Hotel
391,Nice location,40,May 2016,"The best things about this hotel are the fantastic location, the pool and we liked the local inclusions in the breakfast menu. The location is away from the hectic craziness of central Seminyak but is still very convenient in terms of getting to shops, restaurants etc. It's really nice to be able to walk straight onto the beach. The rooms are a bit dated, but clean, and the service was good, too. Overall we had an enjoyable stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
392,Great location,30,May 2016,"Ok hotel.
Lovely older style.
Right on beach.
Ok breakfast
Lovely pool
Probably not stay again for same price you can get better I feel.
Larger hotel. Many rooms.
Pool nice
Great access to beach.
Rooms ok however spray near aircon a bit yuk. Having eczema and spray stuff for room deodorising was terrible as pretty allergic.
Small out door area to sit on ground floor outside room but not private.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
393,You get what you pay for,30,February 2016,"The hotel wasn't a bad experience, with and excellent pool bar and rooms that were nice and clean, on some occasions there were foreign marks on the bed and had to get them replaced. We did lose our key to the room and were charged a bomb only later to find it and get hardly any compensation for the money we just lost. The morning breakfast was terrible apart from the egg bar which you get tired of after the 3rd or 4th day. Overall it was a good location away from Kuta and the noise and the staff were all very helpful but the food was terrible every morning.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
394,First trip to Bali,30,April 2016,"It was my first trip to bali April 2016 and stayed at the pelangi bali Hotel for a week.I found the staff very helpful and friendly and the food was great although the breakfast was a bit of a flop.
I didn't like the vendors on the main street to deal with and found Legian and Kuta vendors much easier to buy from,Rooms are very dated and small but all in all it is very close to the beach but could do with a facelift in the near future.
Dont think i will stay there again as there are better hotels for less per night in the same area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
395,Pleasant stay,40,April 2016,"Very nice hotel with wonderful friendly staff. We stayed here 10 nights this month after booking a great deal on line last year, hotel was very accommadating when i had to change dates just before we were due and didn't charge a higher rate for the extra night stay. Stayed in a deluxe suite right by the pool, big balcony, huge room ( could have fit 2 king size beds plus), big bathroom with bath.
Staff were all lovely, the rooms serviced well daily ( not quite up to my standard but I'm very fussy. Hubby was satisfied with the quality).
The breakfasts are at the same standard of most 4 start Bali hotels, nothing to write home about but ok with western and eastern choices.
We had a lunch in hotel restaurant which was awful ( i did give feedback to hotel about this).
Great location as you can walk to all the beach bars, 30,000 taxi to Eat street and 5 minute walk to Circle K for supplies. I would recommend people request a ground floor room as if you are staying in the cheaper rooms as it's a much nicer walk to the pool with lovely surroundings. The upper level rooms had tiny balconies on the superior rooms.
Nice to sit at either end of pool, one gives you view over the pool and the other can be over the street to watch all the action.Staff remove towels from sun lounges after an hour which i liked as people were leaving towels then coming back from shopping etc for a dip so it's good to see the staff could tell they wern't there. Pool is divided so kids can safely swim, pool bar (overpriced) where you can sit and watch the beautiful sunsets before heading out for the night. We didn't do this much as we could have a cheaper beer right across the road.
Nice enough hotel, great location, had a relaxing pleasant stay. If you're after 5 star this isn't for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
396,Stayed here for a week,40,April 2016,"We stayed here middle of April for a week. Was such a great location, easy access to stroll on the beach or the street. Rooms were simple but in all honesty your not on holidays to stay in your room. The staff are friendly and we had a great chat to a team member first day we arrived and our last night waiting for our transfers. Would come back and stay here if we come back to Bali. The restaurant was good and they were re opening the roof top restaurant which was opening after we left. But would have good view and be good for sunset!
Thanks for a great holiday.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
397,Back to Pelangi 2016,50,April 2016,"I have stayed at Pelangi Bali a number of times over a number of years & it just gets better every time! From the staff to the rooms, the food and the grounds full of beautiful plants & flowers, not to mention the fantastic beachfront location, Pelangi Bali is just awesome! I'm already looking into my next trip/stay there, probably later this year 😍🌴🌸🍴🏄🏻🏊🏼🍹👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😎",Pelangi Bali Hotel
398,CDS,40,April 2016,"Enjoyed very much the stay at Pelangi. The hotel was very conveniently located with easy access to the beach and the other amenities. The Hotel does show its age but all in all value for money for those seeking a clean, friendly and conveniently located hotel and service whilst enjoying the other attractions available in that part of Bali. Would certainly return if staying in semniyak on future visits",Pelangi Bali Hotel
399,noisy,10,April 2016,"the room was only small dark and dismal. the view was like being in a prison. There was a noise all night like a washing machine spinning. this didn't happen in the day time. We complained and they said it was air con or mini fridge. We stayed 3 nights so hardly any sleep. Then outside our door was a phone and that kept ringing all through night and early morning and apparently the reception said that it was when they were trying to get the bell boy.
The food was awful breakfast was horrid.
Drinks in swim up bar expensive.
They removed our towels off our sun loungers even though we was just in pool.
Very bad experience",Pelangi Bali Hotel
400,Pelangi Hotel,40,April 2016,"Just got back from a great stay at this hotel. Location, location. Staff very friendly and helpful, pool is amazing, beautiful sunsets and music at night on the beach and the breakfast was very enjoyable. If you want absolute 5 star, then Pelangi is not for you, but I would rate it 4 star and great value for money. I was a solo female traveller, stayed on the second floor rather than the ground floor, just because that suited me better, and I really loved my 2 week stay there. I will certainly stay at Pelangi again on my next trip to Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
401,You get what you pay for or less,20,March 2016,"Great location, walk out of the resort over a little street and your at the beach, at night great beach restaurants and beautiful sunsets. Close to shopping areas. Staff not so friendly, buffet breakfast not so great as there were ants in pastries and on tables. The pool area was good but you needed to get there early if you want a beach view. Would not get transport organised from the hotel there is a private car/driver hirer just outside the hotel. Good if you're on a budget, rooms are clean and bed was comfy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
402,Wow I love this hotel,50,September 2015,"It is a beautiful hotel, with extremely friendly helpful staff, great room service, great breakfast, all around great hotel. Our room was lovely, towels need to be checked for cleanliness but it was definitely a minor detail for me. The pool bar was amazing as was room service food.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
403,"Quiet, clean, tidy hotel handy to Seminyak",40,March 2016,"We are in the middle of a 10 day holiday staying at the Pelangi - lovely quiet spot, very handy to the beach and plenty of nearby stalls. Quiet and peaceful. Lovely staff. Very relaxing place to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
404,"Old, in need of a face lift and cookie cutter rooms",20,March 2016,"Rooms are small and the hotel dated. It's identical looking rooms are set along two long corridors which are lack lustre looking. Would not stay here again.
Best thing is the location in terms of proximity to the beach and that there was a buffet breakfast with tropical fruit. Felt a little impersonal in terms of service and staff. The pool was big enough that it didn't feel crowded but there was not enough to take me back there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
405,good budget hotel,40,April 2015,"The breakfast is pretty basic. Good family hotel.The pool overlooking the beach is lovely although not very big. Nice quiet beach with lovely views fro the hotel, A bit of a walk to restaurants but worth it as there are some lovely restaurants. I found the rooms clean and bright but rather small. The staff are helpful and polite. A good budget hotel. There was not an option for me to put the date I actually stayed as it was prior to April 15. My daughter stayed there in 2015, she had been with prior to that, and said it is still as good as when we first stayed there. Hope this is a helpful review.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
406,Loved the pool,40,February 2016,"The room was ok although a little tired looking. The best part was the lovely pool. The restaurant was pretty good and the breakfast wasn't too bad.
The staff we met around the hotel were friendly and always greeted us with a smile but the reception staff didn't seem as friendly or nice. We didn't have any problems with them but they didn't seem as happy as the others.
Overall it was an enjoyable stay for our first time in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
407,Pleasant Stay,40,February 2016,"Many times to Bali , this our first time staying in Seminyak .
Check in was smooth and we were welcomed by very friendly and helpfull staff .
Rooms are very comfortable and clean and have everything you would need , though rooms are a little tired .
Location is a big plus , so close to the beach , restaurants and shopping . They have a great pool with a swim up bar and a friendly atmosphere .
Breakfast was ok with not much change from day to day .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
408,Loved the pool and cocktails,40,February 2016,"A nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay.

Pros:
- Balinese decor and feel. You really feel like you're in the ""old"" bali, unlike in some of the new hotels.
- Nice beach front pool area. Lovely water temperature.
- Cocktails by the pool were good and reasonably priced at around $10 aud each including taxes and service.
- Friendly staff who are very willing to help.
- Cold air conditioning in the room.
- Room was nice and quiet, we couldn't hear our neighbours.
- Beach front location.
- Egg station at breakfast for fresh eggs and bain marie food was kept quite hot. Good coffee.

Cons
- You can't just leave the hotel and flag a taxi, you have to walk about 50m to the main street to get a taxi (including with your luggage, and you can't call a taxi because they're not allowed on the hotel street)
- Hotel is a bit tired / old, could do with an upgrade to building exterior and gardens.
- Hotel transport and tour prices are not competitive.
- Breakfast is just average. A lot of the food was quite oily. No pancake/crepe station which a lot of comparable hotels have. Pastries not very good, and selection of fruit was basic.
- Not many pool lounges or umbrellas. This was fine in off season but I wouldn't want to be trying to get a lounge in peak season.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
409,"Great location, great staff",50,February 2016,"Couldn't have booked a better hotel for our first Bali trip. It's right in the beach and 200m's walk from a street of shops, restaurants, trust worthy money exchange and cute cafes with delicious coffee. There are multiple beach bars with bean bags to watch the sun set at. The room service, buffet breakfast and restaurant dinners are always delicious and suites all tastes. The cocktails at the swim up bar are amazing and very competitive with price. I would definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
410,"Good Hotel, Decent Location",40,January 2016,"Id say my rating for the Pelangi would be closer to a 4.5 The pool area and hotel grounds were stunning. The room service food was lovely and I actually couldnt fault it. The rooms were decent for the price and the staff were all lovely.

My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktails available at the swim up bar and the bar staff were very friendly and very accomodating.

My only critiques would be that the lay out for the hotel was rather confusing at first. There needs to be clearer signage to get from rooms at the front of the hotel to the pool and resteraunt area out the back. Obviously once we worked out where it was we realised how simple it was to find, but our first attempt had us wandering all over the grounds and up and down stairs haha.

The breakfast was ok but not as nice or with as much choice as other places i have stayed. I also noticed there was a slight ant problem on the tables located closer to the outdoor patio area.

All in all though, this was a nice place to stay and we loved the beach bars off the back of the hotel. The beanbags and live music on the beach at night was a perfect touch to coincide with the friendly and absolutely hilarious staff at Chiringuito which quickly became our favourite drinking spot :-)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
411,Great!,40,December 2015,"When we arrived we were greeted with a cold fruit drink at the reception. The staff were very friendly and explained everything. The room was very simple but comfortable with everything you needed except for a safe (there was the option of leaving your valuables in a locker near reception). The pool was fantastic, and the smoothies which you can order from the pool bar were excellent. Breakfast was great, overall value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
412,Nice pool and breakfast,30,January 2016,"Beautiful location being close to the beach. Glad we only booked two nights as apart from the pool and the breakfast there wasn't much else to offer.
Recommend for a nice relaxing day in the pool . The room was very out dated and dark . Very friendly staff tho :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
413,Great Hotel,50,January 2016,"My daughter and I have just returned from a two week holiday in Bali, 9 days of which we spent in the hotel. The hotel is in a great location, right across from the beach. The staff were very friendly and most helpful. The rooms and grounds were clean and we'll maintained and the food was a good price. Breakfast was great with a range of western and Indonesian choices. We had freshly made omelets most days. Right out the front of the motel there are a number of massage ladies on the beach. If you stay here make sure to get a massage from Ruty, she has been doing massage on that beach for 40 years and herror massage is very relaxing. Also on the beach there are a whole range of restraints to choose from where you can sit of an evening, have dinner and listen to some live music. All in all a great spot and reasonably priced.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
414,Disappointing!,20,January 2016,"We stayed in this hotel as it was on the beach in Seminyak, despite several reviews I had read that said it was tired as others also complemented the location. In balance I thought it was worth the risk! They were right unfortunately in terms of the hotel showing its age and lacking character. The staff were efficient and helpful when required, but I did not find them particularly helpful or ready to go the little extra when needed for specific requests. The rooms were clean but very dark and quite small and the hotel generally was old fashioned in concept and design. The breakfasts were very disappointing and on two of the mornings we stayed the pastries were dry, inedible and seemed as if they had been held over from the day before. Although the pool was relatively large, it was not very attractive in terms of its construction or entry into it. There was also a lack of greenery generally as the design of the hotel was outdated and like an old fashioned tower-like apartment block of the 70's. It was nice to be on the beach, but it was not always cleaned well enough in terms of the amount of rubbish on the beach. Closeness to Seminyak was a plus, but overall we were underwhelmed. I would not recommend the hotel as it needs complete renovation if it is to compete with other more modern hotels in the area. It also does not have a Balinese feel about it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel

416,Awesome value and location,40,February 2015,"Would definitely stay here again, staff were amazingly helpful and in obtrusive. Meals and drinks reason able price and unless you intend spending all your holiday in the room it's all you need. Clean and affordable. Being close to the beach is nice although we spent more time in the pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
417,Superb!!,50,January 2016,"JUST BEAUTIFUL!this hotel is in the perfect location far away from the madness that Kuta has but still has a beach culture that by night turns into a hub of trendy travellers, hip families and loved up couples that bop to all sorts of sounds playing from the small bars on the beach on coloured bean bags underneath cute umbrellas!! Just makes you happy all the time!! The hotel pool really couldn't get any better with the size of it and position on the beachside... The sunken pool Br is a bonus... The rooms are great and staff are lovely...just a fits tic place to stay... Would highly recommend",Pelangi Bali Hotel
418,Amazing christmas break.. we will be back,40,December 2015,"My partner and I both 27 years old visited Bali for a week over the xmas period and stayed in this hotel. It was a great trip from start to finish. The room was everything that you want and more and not outdated as the others have said. The buffet breakfast every morning was delicious, everything you would want from cereals, fresh fruit, hot breakfast and eggs made the way you want. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We loved the swim up pool bar, which was perfect when it became to warm or the beach, which was just a few footsteps away. The spa was something else, so beautiful inside and the free massages we received may possibly of been the best massages we ever have had. I would def recommend this hotel and if we are to return to bali we will stay here again. Thanks pelangi :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
419,Good Location,30,December 2015,"Must say this hotel has great value for money due to the fact of the location. I love being able to wake up and see the beach and walk along it. Rooms starting to get a bit outdated. Beds not the comfiest - fault hard.
Staff are really friendly and cannot fault at all.
Breakfast is reasonable although each time I have had pastries they have been a bit stale but eggs are awesome.
Pool is great with good little swim up bar.
Good place to stay if you are on a reasonably low budget.
Probably give it about a 3/5. It has a fair bit of room for improvement, and would be awesome to see that happen.

I have stayed here on all occasions of coming to Bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
420,Take the suite 401,40,January 2016,"The lobby doesn't do justice to the rest of the hotel. Quite plane and dark. However check in was quick and easy.
401 overlooks the pool. Very spacious with huge bathroom and jacuzzi. King size bed also. Free mini bar and other perks come with this room.
The pool is nice and is also one step from the beach. However the beach beds are not park of pelangi so you will have to pay for their use.
For NYE this place was the best. Right amongst he fun.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
421,Step back into 1970's awful....,20,December 2015,"Day 2/5 & cannot wait to leave this hotel. Very outdated, not ""4"" star would give it 2.5/3
Been avoiding spending any time here....

The pool is great, but that's it!
Staff are friendly...
Bad smell in room... Furniture not ""modern"" as it's been described.
Bathroom dirty & spotty towels.
Breakfast very basic - pastries stale Been to 4 star hotels with a much bigger & fresher range)

Feel like I'm stuck in a prison and not on a holiday, avoid booking!!'",Pelangi Bali Hotel
422,GREAT LOCATION,40,August 2015,"Stayed in August 2015. Rooms very clean, pool area small but can manage to get a chair most days. Breakfast was always a good selection, bit of a wait on the omelette station, but fresh. Great people watching as is right on the beach. Pull up a bean bag on the beach at one of the many restaurant's close by. Staff are helpful, friendly and we really enjoyed our stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
423,First time visit to Bali,40,November 2015,My room was spacious with a separate sitting area. The bathroom had all I needed and fresh bottled water was provided everyday. All rooms are very adequately airconditioned although the rest of the hotel is not. The lovely pool has a swim up bar and overlooks the beach. Breakfast was provided in the room cost and set us up very well for the day,Pelangi Bali Hotel
424,Soothing Bali,40,November 2015,"We were coming to Bali extremely apprehensive...I was a first timer! And we were going to be ""Poolies"". Our girls stayed further down the beach at Legian, at Schoolies central at Jayakarta...thank God we didn't stay there!! Too many youngens - good for a laugh though.
So back to Pelangi. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Beautiful smiles and welcomes. The decor and gardens were just lovely. Very Balinese. The sunsets from the pool and the restaurant were incredible...some of the best ever!
The rooms were well appointed, I would however have like a screen on the very small balcony just for fresh air...had air conditioning on the whole time. Didn't want mozzies in the room! Not that there were many, it was just to be sure. The hotel does all it can to protect you from them with plug in mozzie thingo's and weekly spraying too. The bed was very comfortable too.
The hotel is situated close to all the action! You have the cool restaurant/bars along the beach with the bean bags and umbrellas, then out the front a quick walk to the shopping precinct.
All in all, after the initial shock of the lack of road rules, we had a wonderful holiday and Pelangi played a big part! Thank you. xo",Pelangi Bali Hotel
425,our time at pelangi,50,September 2015,My husband and l have stayed here many times its the only place we stay at. The location is perfect the staff are always very friendly and love to have a chat and they go out of their way to make your stay perfect. The rooms are always extremely clean with plenty of space. I cant wait to stay there again in January 2016,Pelangi Bali Hotel
426,amazing staff and location,50,December 2014,"the location was great,clean, friendly staff the morning breakfast was amazing and the spa room, the massages were fantastic. The swimming pool was great close to restaurants shopping and close to the markets",Pelangi Bali Hotel
427,Bali Hi again,40,November 2015,"I decided to try another location this time in Bali. Seminyak is a bit quieter than Kuta but just as much fun. The Pelangi is a great place to relax (a great pool) and so close to the beach. The rooms I had was spacious, clean and the hotel staff were very pleasant, the restaurant staff were great people to talk to (food was superb). Would I come back here again, sure will.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
428,Fantastic time,50,November 2015,"What a great hotel, right by the ocean. Great staff, they are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is very clean and lots of painting and updating of the building going on in preparation for Christmas. Some people say the hotel is a little dated, we have ten in our group who would disagree with the above comment.We loved it here and will all come back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
429,Love this place,50,October 2015,"We have stayed here a few times and will always come back. Perfect location, beautiful staff and always someone to meet around the pool. Food is great and breakfast is awesome overlooking the beach. Theres a good selection of everything you need within walking distance and a beach full of music right on your doorstep each night. The hotel is really well kept, the rooms have everything you need, plenty of space and are well maintained. They were grafting some new coloured frangipanis onto the existing trees while we were there this time so we are looking forward to seeing them next trip!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
430,Near the beach!,40,November 2015,"Pelangi is a good, mid-range hotel. The room was neat and reasonably spacious, with good linen. The location is great with the beach on the other side of the road. You can watch sunset from the large pool facing the sea and then pop over to the beach to enjoy the evening where people gather under colourful umbrellas and on beanbags to enjoy drinks and dinner. There is live music on the beach and each restaurant is alight with colour.
Breakfast was buffet style with a great selection, for vegans too.

The main tourist shopping area is several blocks away but there is a hotel shuttle you can make use of. We chose to rather stroll around closer to the hotel and found plenty of small shops and restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
431,PELANGI BALI HOTEL.,40,October 2015,Our stay at pelangi hotel was all we had hoped for.The staff on our arrival and right through our holiday were more than helpful and always friendly.The location was great.Beach out the back and great pool with swim up bar.Lots of great restaurants within walking distance or you could eat at the hotel restaurant which had a great menu and lovely food.Our rooms were of the older style but very clean with a great airconditioning unit.Also on the beach of a night time you could pull up a bean bag and listen to live music while having a nice cold drink.There was three of us on this stay and we all loved it and will return again next year.Good shopping close by too.Everything you need at a very resonable tariff.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
432,Good for the price,30,October 2015,"I spent one night at this hotel at Seminyak and it was fine, but not as nice as I'd hoped from the photos. The pool was a good size, and it was nice to be able to walk right onto the beach from the hotel. The beach was fantastic and there were lots of little bars and restaurants on the beach, and a boardwalk that ran between the hotel and the beach. The restaurant was good and the staff were friendly. The breakfast buffet was a feast! It was nice to have a fridge in the room stocked with some water, beer and pop. I also got a massage at the spa onsite. They were having a half-price promo on spa services, and I wouldn't have paid full price as it was not as nice as some other spas I saw in Bali. If I were staying longer at the beach I would like a room with a slightly better view, and a bit more luxury. The first front desk staff I talked to told me that I should leave at noon to catch my 4:15 pm flight, and then when I arrived at noon for my shuttle the person acted as if I might be late for my flight. In the end it took 25 minutes to get to the airport and the ticket counter wasn't even open yet!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
433,By the Beach if thats what you like,30,October 2015,"This is one for the beach lovers, with the pool and restaurant overlooking the sunset, all you need to do is to turn up. The hotel is a little dated with its decor and as usual in Bali there are always renovations being performed. During our stay the rooftop bar and restaurant was closed. The staff are very polite and helpful however need a little more training in English as they struggled with basic questions at times. Overall a good experience though reasonably priced for the area and close to the usuals, i.e. Seminyak Square and shops, worth a stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
434,I always stay here on my first night in Bali,40,October 2015,"The Pelangi is a brilliant first nighter, particularly if you are flying in late which I almost always seem to do. It's traditional in décor, has a comfy bed and clean rooms. The location is pretty sweet and in all honesty, for what you pay for, it's good value. I use it as a launching pad into my Bali holiday.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
435,pelangi Hotel,50,October 2015,"We had 12nights At The Pelangi , This Was Our Second time There And We totally enjoyed Our Holiday, The staff Are friendly And Helpfull, The Rooms Are Nice And Cleaned properly Everday, Breakfast Was Great, All The Food We had At The Hotel Was Great,would recommend This Hotel To everyone, Will definitely Be Going Back To The Pelangi On Our Bext Trip To Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
436,quite old and shabby but good location and nice staff,20,October 2015,"My husband and I spent our last night at the Pelangi before flying out of Bali. I found the hotel quite old, which I had anticipated after reading the comments here on trip advisor before booking. I didn't anticipate the weird smell in our room though. We got put into a ground floor room which smelled like a mix of mould and air freshener. Maybe it also came from the old air con that was on. We tried to air the room out but the bad smell persisted. It was so intense that we decided to ask for a different room, which we got given straight away. The staff at reception didn't seem to be surprised, so I think they are well aware of the mould in the room. The second room they gave us was on the first floor level, and the smell was better. Again, I think the aircon needs to be cleaned. The room was spacious but looked tired, the toilet was very clean but the bathtub and tiles in the bathroom not so much. The linen and towels were very old and had lots of wear and tear marks. Breakfast was ok. Pool would have been nice but a big group of guys was hanging in the pool all day, drinking lots, so the pool seemed a bit crowded. The staff was very friendly, which was the best thing about this hotel. Overall, the hotel and its facilities are old and a bit shabby even the location right across the beach didn't make up for it. I wouldn't stay here again and also wouldn't recommend this place to friends.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
437,fantastic location,40,September 2015,"we are regular travellers to bali with kids , Stayed at the Pelangi first time and can not fault it ,its an older hotel , however its freshly painted interconnecting rooms are clean and very generous in size . Staff are very friendly and helpful and the location is fantastic directly on the double 6 beach with its glittering sand and clean beach , the tide makes it fab for beachcombing and sunset shots and the surf is brilliant . many beanbag resturants directly on the beach great nightlife and resturants in easy walking distance .The hotel has a free shuttle which runs to kuta 4 times a day . the breakfast is great terrific selection . We hire scooters for the week we were there and put two kids with hubby on one and me and daughter on the other , very safe to travel along the beach path all the way to legian and discover and enjoy many yummy hotels and resturants along the way .Also made it very convient to go up the street to bintang supermarket . WILL DEFINATLEY GO BACK great wifi connection in room and outside",Pelangi Bali Hotel
438,Great location - poor service,30,October 2015,"Perfectly located across the road from double six beach. Good pool.

The restaurant serves decent breakfast. Also serves good Indonesian food.

But....

Rooms are quite old. Needs refurbishment. Would rate max 3 stars for comfort eg shower head is blocked. Can be quite noisy too from nearby parties.

Reception service is useless, no customer service and and not helpful at all. Not helpful for booking cabs. Cannot change CHF, after 3 days they send you a reminder of outstanding balance although having a credit card as a guarantee and knowing we are staying for a week.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
439,Great place to stay,50,November 2014,"My stay at the Pelangi was peaceful and rest full great swimming pools bar and restaurant good service and nice staff
It was a great location close to some excellent shopping and restaurants. Night life around the hotel is also great plenty of action if that is what your after.
Ignore the hawkers on the beach and they will ignore you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
440,Another great stay,50,October 2015,"Had another week in the Pelangi which continues to uphold it's excellent customer service. Add this to the location straight onto the beach for surfing, massages and now night life it has become a central spot to rest and recuperate.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
441,Pelangi,40,October 2015,"Great location right on the beach which is what we love being in Bali. Only complaint I would have is, the towels are very old and once wet actually look dirty and stains can be seen on them. Not changed even when left on the floor just hung back up.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
442,Great pool hotel,40,September 2015,Stayed here for two nights and a day and really enjoyed it. Friendly welcome & staff. Atmosphere good. Lots of rooms. Which are a great size with big bed. Liked being on the ground level for easy access to the pool etc. Pool best part of hotel which was huge with handy pool bar. Great that beach was right next to hotel. Would stay here again.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
443,Awesome value for money,40,October 2015,"Service, staff and accommodation fantastic, just finished an awesome week at the Pelangi. Ideally located, wonderful buffet every morning, great pool, great staff and excellent value for money in Seminyak. Definitely back again next time",Pelangi Bali Hotel
444,Lovely stay by the beach,50,December 2014,"Atmosphere was lovely and laid back, nice interior with wood accent. This hotel is so Bali, and basically close to almost everything. Beach just at the back door, motorbike rental just at the front. 10-15 minutes walk to kuta square thus the shopping place. Friendly staffs, spacious room, lovely view. I love having a quiet and peaceful breakfast here with nice sea view and sound of wave crashing onto the shore.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
445,Amazing stay!!!!,50,September 2015,"When we first arrived at the palangi (at night) it looked beautiful. We were greeted at the door to help with our bags and a complimentary drink.
The hotel is not the most modern but was perfect peace and tranquility. The staff are amazing and will bend over backwards to help you with anything.
The pool and beach are the best part spending many a day having dinner at the pool bar relaxing. The beach is 5 second walk from the pool where you can chill on the bean bags, nice music, a drink and watch the sun set go down.
This hotel is in the perfect location just 5 minutes walk to the main area of seminyak yet still in a very peacefull location. Would deffinetly recommend thos hotel and look forward to retunring again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
446,"Great, economical beachside location",40,October 2015,"This hotel was chosen purely for its location and price - and it was a good decision. Whilst the hotel itself is a little bit tired the room was more than adequate and very well priced given that it is surrounded by ""higher end"" establishments. The beach location is ideal and starting the day with breakfast overlooking the ocean was a real bonus. There are many restaurants and shops within easy walking distance and Seminyak and Kuta shopping districts are easily accessible, especially if you choose to walk via the beach. If you need total silence to sleep music from the beachside restaurants might be an issue.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
447,Love this place of rainbows,50,August 2015,2nd year we have been back here - 3 weeks this time. Our new home away from home. We love the laid back friendly atmosphere of this hotel. There are always staff available to assist you in any aspect of your holiday.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
448,Pelangi revisited,50,September 2015,"Our visit was all that we expected which ensures our next trip to Bali includes a stay at the Pelangi. Our first night was interrupted by a bunch of drunken guests. The Pelangi management dealt with them quickly, and they were no further problem. A great stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
449,Another great stay,40,September 2015,"This was our 3rd time at the Pelangi and once again we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel is well located for lots of exploring in the surrounding areas. The rooms are adequate although could do with a bit of an update, but really we are only sleeping there. The breakfast offers a wide variety of food and everything we had was very good. The pool area is stunning and as we were there to relax we spent a lot of time on the sunbeds. The view from the pool over the water is still a favourite. The staff are just so friendly, from the front of the hotel to the pool attendants and the waiters and waitresses. Will hopefully be back for visit no 4 in 2016.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
450,Great Location & Setting,40,September 2015,"My husband and I had a group of our wedding guests stay here - the communication before our stay was excellent. It's a great location, breakfast is good and you can walk straight out to the ocean. Great pool and pool bar too! Walking distance to shops/bars/cafes. This is the second time I've stayed here and would definitely stay again if I was staying in the Seminyak area. Good for couples, friends or families.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
451,Good for a long wekend,40,October 2015,"Once we started accessing the pool and beach through the garden rather than the long dark corridors we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Great beachfront location - poolside lounges overlooking the beach, so could cool off in the sea or the swimming pool. No ocean views from the rooms, but very clean and friendly staff.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
452,Great value on the beach,50,September 2015,This 4th time I have stayed here & the place doesn't change. Very clean & lovely maintained gardens . Friendly staff. Great pool & position overlooking beach. Borders Legian & Seminyak so great spot to visit different areas.Delicious buffet breakfast.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
453,Pelangi Hotel Bali,50,September 2015,"We have stayed at several place in bali but keep coming back to the Pelangi Hotel. We recently completed our 5th time at Pelangi.
Staff are friendly and always willing to assist you.The Service is first class and rooms tidy. The Bar Pool and meals are fantastic.We have no hestitation in recommending the Pelangi to anyone wanting a fantastic holiday and location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
454,Great beach location!,40,September 2015,"Pelangi Bali Hotel is one of the only resorts on the beach in the Seminyak area that is an affordable price. The pool area is really nice and right across from the beach. It's also right next to a large number of beach bars/restaurant eg the well known La Plancha (bar/restaurant with a multitude of bean bags set up on the beach).

The shops in walking distance are OK - the usual sunnies, sarongs, tshirts etc. I attempted to walk further into the nicer end of Seminyak shops, but it was too hot. We ended up catching taxi's for around $3 (30,000 IDR) to Seminyak Square and Eat Street for more/better food options.

The rooms were fine - nothing flash, fairly basic and no views, but there was nothing wrong with them, clean and met the 4 star standard (without any frills though). Buffet breakfast was good, staff were friendly.

Overall, I'd probably try to find somewhere closer to Eat Street, but still on the beach - dependent on price. If I couldn't find anything closer that was reasonably priced (ie not the W at $$$$$ a night), I'd definitely stay here again due to the beach location and proximity to cool, cheap little beach bars/restaurants, and a great pool & pool bar.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
455,Great Value,40,August 2015,"We had just landed on our honeymoon and this was exactly what we needed.

Location - It is set up beach side. Unfortunately, there's a road between the hotel and the beach, but its still right there. It is also really close to the main strip. This makes it easy to find food or drinks or vendors. Its all really within a short walk.

Rooms - They're pretty standard. Nicer than average but nothing really that provides a 'wow' factor.

Food - Breakfast is provided, or was at least for us. It was again pretty standard. 2 Juices. Instant Coffee. Fruit mix. Pastry/bread bar. Egg bar. Random assortment of local dishes. We didn't have any other meals at the hotel. Beers are around the same price at the bar/restaurant as everywhere else...Just a little pricier.

For the price, I definitely loved the place though...and this was my favorite location overall.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
456,nice and clean,40,September 2015,"good hotel. Close to all amenities. Very close to the beach. Nice pool and staff. Walking distance to shops, beach, restaurants. Had a great stay. Hotel offered great deal with upgrade to nice villa in Nusa Dua.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
457,Great value for money...Very Clean,40,August 2015,"We stayed for 10nights with our 4yr old and had an awesome time. The staff are exceptionally friendly and everyone made us feel so welcome. The pool was fantastic and so clean. The shallow pool was ideal for our child who loved swimming everyday. The breakfast was very good, with a selection of breads, Danish, pancakes, fruit, cereal, egg station and hot buffet of sausages, bacon, rice, noodle etc. The food for lunch in the restaurant was ok and could do with some improvement.
The room was a good size esp as we had an extra bed in the room. Very clean with no sign of insects!
We would deff be back, very friendly crowd of people who were all there to enjoy the sunshine and fun times of Bali...
We also used the babysitting service and Wayan, was FANTASTIC with our child. Thank you :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
458,Awesome Value For Money,50,November 2014,If you want a nice clean simple room (beds aren't soft) and then a nice pool and pool bar on the beach with great restaurants all around then this place is for you. The foyer is dark but still nice! The pool is what makes it out the back. It is a relaxing place if you aren't looking for a massive resort type of place! I would stay there again.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
459,Not what we expected...,20,August 2015,"From entering the reception area, to walking the long corridor to the room, things just got darker, literally. The foyer area is rather dark and not very inviting. The more than 2 meters tall dark concrete walls surrounding the whole complex gives one a kind of unpleasant feeling. Not at all the pleasant Bali feeling one can see at most other hotels. The outdoor areas really need some renovation. The room was large and clean, but with no pleasant atmosphere. No Bali style here either!
Breakfast was nothing special, but staff were nice and kind.
The pictures on the hotel's website are grossly exaggerating reality. The image of one bedroom surely is not the standard. We had a large DeluxeSuper room, but it was rundown and sterile in style. No modernization to see. The two nice images showing the 2nd floor terrace with a nice view of the beach and sunset, is totally misleading. This terrace is closed for all guests, and only in use for weddings, etc. What a disappointment! Incorrect marketing like that serves no one good.
There is by far not sufficient number of sunbeds available (due to space restraints), and the beds are a few centimeters apart, with no room to slightly move or change the position as the sun moves.
There was live music in the hotel's only restaurant every evening. This musician was pretty good.
This is probably the one hotel on Bali where we have spent as little time as possible on the hotel's property. during the stay..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
460,Totes go back,40,August 2015,"Awesome place. Will go back. Quite, more adults than kids sort of place. Only downside is the breakfast is pretty lame but it's cheap to eat out anyway so who cares. Pool bar rocks! Staff super friendly and awesome",Pelangi Bali Hotel
461,Disappointing,10,October 2014,Stayed at this hotel last year was not impressed At all first of all the foyer was really dark and dreary not a good first impression our room had a bad smell even though it was clean alwAys had a smell when you walked in breakfast very average pool area only had a few beds not that you would want to stay very long no view at all except dirty unkept walls the beach outside the hotel not a nice area to sit we checked out early and went to another hotel same price but so much better I would not recommend this hotel the photos are very deceiving,Pelangi Bali Hotel
462,Pelangi Beach Hotel,40,August 2015,Great position and friendly staff. Rooms big and clean. Mostly Australian visitors. Only downside is the noise from nearby places that sometimes have music that plays until 4am and the windows vibrate…..count that as a sleepless night and should be addressed by the hotel. The upside is the staff are lovely and very accommodating.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
463,Excellent location,40,August 2015,Location of this hotel is fantastic! Walk out of your room and past the beautiful pool area and straight onto the beach! Massive hotel with plenty of rooms. Bed was ok great spa and shower in room. Staff were good and friendly. Only minus was breakfast is too late as it starts at 7am so not too good for those who have excursions planned or early flights but when able to make breakfast it was beautiful. 9/10.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
464,Great location on the Beach,40,June 2015,"Older hotel, without all the bells and whistles. Breakfast was good with a good selection of hot and cold food. Location on the Beach, but far away enough from the huge crowds.Great pool with wet bar. Loads of restaurants and shopping close by. Staff very friendly and able to organize day trips as required.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
465,Another wonderful stay,50,August 2015,"Our second time at Pelangi and it was great again. It is not luxury but the position cannot be beaten for the price. The pool and restaurant overlook the beach and ocean and that is what it's all about. There are warungs straight out on the beach with cheap food and drink and entertainment every night. You can walk a short distance to good restaurants, massages and shopping. The hotel has a traditional Balinese design and feel about it, the staff are wonderful right through from reception to the breakfast staff, the pool towel boys and pool bar. The free wifi works well. The hotel and rooms are clean and well maintained, the pool is always in top condition. You can just kick back and relax at Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
466,Back again to the Pelangi,50,August 2015,"This is our third holiday at the Pelangi Bali Hotel..
The hotel is in prime position on beach frontage. It is also an older style hotel with lots of charm. The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly and always helpful. They always remember the guests by name, even though there are so many people to remember.
The food at the restaurant for breakfast is always very good. There is a very wide selection to choose from.
We also ordered some dinners in room service, and the food presentation and quality was excellent. Actually the best Mie Goreng I had in Bali.
We hope to return in the coming year.
Thank you Pelangi Bali for welcoming us back and making our stay comfortable and enjoyable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
467,A long weekend getaway,40,August 2015,"We've been to Seminyak 5 times and wanted to stay at the Double Six end for a change...the Pelangi ticks that box..the location is great for the beach, beach bars and Cocoon. Much more shopping choices than Seminyak Square and Eat Street. It's a 20-30 minute walk to the other end but who counts the time on holiday..have a leisurely wander and you'll find things you didn't know were here! It is an older style hotel so wouldn't suit those who find stairs a challenge. Rooms are spacious, clean and have basic facilities which will suit those who want a base rather than a resort. All up, great location and value for money.

To address a couple of issues raised in other reviews:
Bali taxis can't enter the driveway...there's a taxi rank 5 minutes walk away and they can drop you off at security which is a minute from Reception
The lack of room safes makes perfect sense given the resort has open access from the beach and the rooms have glass doors to the gardens. Security deposit boxes are free, locked in a room and you have to sign for access. Not a real hassle for peace of mind",Pelangi Bali Hotel
468,Absolutely amazing,50,August 2015,"Absolutely amazing, gorgeous pool, delicious breakfast, wonderful view, beautiful rooms comfy bed, lovely shower. Thankyou for an amazing stay! And wonderful and amazing Staff that will do anything to make you happy ☺️ Definitely recommend to everyone! ☺️😊",Pelangi Bali Hotel
469,Great place pelagic hotel,50,August 2015,"Just had 4 nights at pelagic hotel great staff ,great location ,great pool ,great food , beautiful beach and night life lots of good restaurants close by heaps of shopping around hotel thank you pelagic hotel will be back for sure",Pelangi Bali Hotel
470,"Great Hotel, great location",40,August 2015,"Pelangi is a fine hotel with one of the best locations. It is not your top end resort, but it also doesn't have that top end price.. It was clean and comfortable, the staff were very friendly. It was a nice swim up bar.. and the back of the hotel is right on the beach. It was the perfect location, wander down to the Beach Hotels and grab a bean bag for the evening, or even walk along the beach to Legion or even Kuta (if you are a walker). Main street of Seminyak is also just around the corner. After looking up so many different hotels prior to leaving, once there, i think we made the best choice.
Wifi worked fine for us at the hotel, a couple of slow or dead spots, but that is technology, can't expect it to get around every nook and cranny. All the Beach Hotels have wifi aswell along with most bars and cafes throughout the area (or you could switch off.. and have a holiday).
Honestly think it was the best value for money. If you are looking for a high end resort then of course go pay the money for one. Pelangi Bali Hotel was great in my opinion, especially if you grab the early bird pricing.
Seminyak location i found was also the best, being out of the hustle of Kuta or Legion, but still close enough to go check it all out. Pelangi offers free shuttle service into Kuta multiple times a day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
471,My home in Seminyak,50,August 2015,"This was my fifth stay at the Pelangi and it still ticks all the right boxes. Clean, comfortable, on the beach and close to the action in Legion and Kuta without all the hustle. The beachside cafes are a real treat for after dinner with loads of atmosphere and live music to suit all tastes.

I will be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
472,One very tired hotel,10,August 2015,We had 8 nights at Pelangi Bali Hotel and won't be back there. Staff were wonderful but the hotel itself needs a big overhaul! Breakfast was ok - can't really go wrong with toast and fruit- but an empty restaurant at lunch and dinner time speaks for itself.... Room ok. But bathroom needed work with cracked or non existent grout and plumbers tape on taps to stop leaks. Bath water couldn't be turned off while shower was running - so not much pressure. Luckily we didn't have to spend a lot of time in our room.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
473,Perfect location,50,May 2015,"Pelangi is on the beach at Seminyak - close to Ku De Ta, La Luchiola etc. Perfect location. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Has a gym. I have been coming here for over 5 years and it doesn't fail to disappoint. Great value for your money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
474,on the beach,30,October 2014,it was pleasant. hotel is located on the beach so was convenient and walking distance from the shops. they did get our rooms mixed up despite us reconfirming so check in was a bit of a mess. restaurants nearby walking distance.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
475,Pelangi hotel by the beach,40,July 2015,"Good hotel in perfect location, by the beach and a short walk to the shopping and restaurants etc.
Friendly staff and free shuttle bus to Kuta was a good inclusion.
Usual problem with guests leaving towels on pool side lounges, and not monitored by staff though there are signs around the pool area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
476,Excellent stayed,50,August 2015,"We stayed at the Pelangi Hotel twice on our stay in Bali it was that fantastic,

The first night we got to Bali we stayed in the Pelangi. It was the start of our honeymoon. The hotel picked us up from the hotel which was lovely.

When we arrived at the hotel the service was fantastic . We received a welcome drink on our arrival which was lovely and we were shown to our room.

Our room was lovely. It was a second floor room. It did not have a view but I don't think any of the rooms had a view. The room itself was beautiful and had a huge bed . The shower was fantastic and the best we had in Bali.

Breakfast is a buffet breakfast and each morning there is different dishes available but they had a wide range .

The pool is a lovely pool too and is very relaxing. You can have drinks while in the pool as there is a bar in the pool.

The location of the hotel is simply amazing. Right on the beach. You simply set about 5 feet outside the hotel and your onto the wonderful Seminyak beach .

This hotel is a fantastic hotel and it was made even better by the assistance we received from one of their staff members called ""Dexpool"". Dexpool was fantastic and was constantly trying to help us out and sorted things out for us. With out Dex Pools assistance our stay in Bali would not have been as enjoyable.

Thank you Pelangi for your wonderful friendly service and Dex Pool for all your help.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
477,"Fab location, food & pool",40,July 2015,"We stayed here for a quiet location and that is what we got. Whilst in the quieter area, we still had the option of the bars along the beach which served until 11pm. Large pool from which you can view the sea. Breakfast was amazing as was a complimentary dinner we received. Staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again - however - I see that we received quite a good deal online and I wouldn't pay the usual daily rate.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
478,Great Holiday,40,July 2015,We stayed here for 7 nights. Was very comfortable and reasonably clean. The swim up pool bar is fantastic. The location on the beach front allows you access to many of the beach cafes at a moments notice. The usual market shopping is only moments from the front door. I'll come back again.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
479,"Great location, bean bag on the beach a must!",40,July 2015,"Great location across from beach, plenty of places to eat. Grab a bean bag and listen to the music. Quiet, within walking distance of good shopping. Rooms basic, bed great. Breakfast was included and it was fantastic, some days fruit was not very sweet but this was a minor thing. If you need transport you need to organise on the day and not at the front desk, don't arrange the night before as it doesn't happen. If you have changed any details via email be prepared for them to not know about these changes when you book in. At airport on arrival didn't have all travellers details for pickup even though this was confirmed the day before. Bathrooms are very basic and in need of some TLC. Overall great location and the rooms were clean and tidy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
480,Reasonable for the location and price,40,August 2015,"My partner and I stayed for four nights for approx $570 AUD which we thought was reasonable given the price of some of the other hotels in Seminyak. The hotel is right on the beach with the cool beach bars out the front so location wise it is good and only a short cab ride to eat street (30,000 IDR).

Breakfast is served overlooking the pool and beach. A reasonable buffet spread with eggs cooked on demand. Advice though is order your eggs when you first arrive at breakfast as the egg station can get busy.

Yes hotel is a little dated and fixtures are a bit old.

You need to reserve a sun lounger by about 9am if you want to be guaranteed a spot. They fill up quickly.

We were happy with our stay here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
481,In the heart of it all!,40,July 2015,"Older style resort, but very clean and tidy. Nothing out of place. Staff were great and extremely friendly. The best part was the position. On the boarder of Seminyak and Legian I would say. Nice breakie which was included in our rate. Stones throw to the beach. Lots of places to drink and eat along the beach front, massages and pedicures on the beach if you wanted them also.
Perfect location for us!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
482,like staying at a haunted hotel,10,August 2015,"The hotel is in a nice location but for its size and former glory it is now very run down. There are no lock boxes the TV is old style the walls are clean but old looking the bed is hard. Not a nice vacation destination. Stay at other hotels nearby, it is a close walk to the beach anyway.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
483,Great location,30,July 2015,"We liked the location, being able to walk directly out onto Seminyak beach was the highlight. Rooms were fine but noise was an issue. The open corridors that run along the complex carry the noise into all the rooms, just people walking was enough to wake me, but we had full on conversations and loud laughing from somewhere in the complex right through the night. And someone moving and scraping the furniture around in the room above us one night nearly drove me insane. Bathrooms need a bit of attention, but otherwise it was comfortable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
484,Great family complex,50,July 2015,"Good friendly staff and clean and tidy.. Loved the location, beach right out the front and plently to look around in the area.. I did read something about Pelangi being a party resort, but didnt look anything like it while we were there. Very quiet and perfect for families",Pelangi Bali Hotel
485,Mr Stow Melbourne Aust,50,August 2014,Wife i stayed with 2 children last year. Older place. Pool was great. Terrific location being beachside. Walks to nearby shopping. Happy for long walk or cab to Kuta. Older folk happier away from main Kuta Legion. Looking forward to returning next month. Value for money. Breakfasts are sensational. Beds are compfy.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
486,right on the beach in the middle of outdoor beach life.,40,June 2015,we loved the Pelangi. its an older property but the rooms are very Bali our room was huge toilet wouldn't flush when we arrived one call to reception fixed in ten minutes [at 11.30 at night] we loved being right on the beach and used the cafe's beach beds daily massage right at front steps continually. We have stayed at more palatial resorts but we really enjoyed the laid back pace of the Pelangi. if your looking for five star look elsewhere but value for money great location great pool non intrusive staff and access to the nightly fun on the beach then this is your spot. It's not new but it has its own style.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
487,Tired and worn out,30,July 2015,"This hotel is in desperate need of a face-lift. You can tell that at one point (maybe 20 years ago) this place was premium, but doesn't seem they've done anything with it since and it has a run-down feel about it.
The location is a bit tricky because it's pretty much a cab ride anytime you want to leave the resort.
The resort's restaurant food is really awful and our bath towels had stains on them due to not being replaced for many years.
The photos on the website definitely make the place look a heck of a lot better than it actually is. The rooms are also quite noisy and the walls paper thin, so we didn't get much sleep. Could hear the person in the next room snoring, sneezing and even going to the bathroom.
This hotel has so much potential but I'm sorry to say when there are so many newer, cleaner and better value resorts in the same area, they're going to need to lift their game !!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
488,"Great location, otherwise nothing special",30,July 2015,"The location of this hotel is definitely its selling point, right on Seminyak beach. If you aren't planning on spending too much time in the room then it's fine. The rooms are small and a bit dingy. We couldn't use our bathtub and would have preferred not to use our towels. Walls are paper thin and a lot of the clientele is here to party so it gets quite noisy. There's a reason it's a lot cheaper than its neighbors, if you are looking for an affordable way to stay on the beach then it's perfect but if you are hoping for a beautiful Balinese hotel you might be disappointed. Service was generally quite friendly if a bit hit or miss.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
489,Disappointed,20,July 2015,"Our Room was ok, but no balcony or view and the fridge was so noisy we had to turn it off to sleep! The staff were unfriendly, unhelpful and unwelcoming. We only ate there once as the food was terrible. Won't go back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
490,Traditional Balinese Hotel,40,July 2015,"We love the structure of the place. Very Balinese but with modern amenities. Friendly and helpful staff. The beach is just a few steps away. The breakfast buffet is awesome. We also enjoyed balinese massage at their spa. Overall, it's a great hotel at a reasonable price 😊",Pelangi Bali Hotel
491,"Graduation, kids reward!!",40,December 2014,"Traditional type buildings,but great pool, location and buffet breakfast. Had the kids in one room and my wife and I in an adjoining room on the ground floor with a short stroll to the pool and breakfast area. Hotel is right on a good section of beach with many eating places nearby. Staff were very helpful and polite. A great swim up bar and excellent happy hours. Enjoyed my first ever stay in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
492,Great locale,40,June 2015,Basic but that's all we needed. Attentive staff. Quiet but perfect location for strolling South to Legian and Kuta or North to KuDeTa ;) and shopping. Right outside the hotel there is lots of shopping. Beach across street. Pool was nice though we didn't use. Buffet had great options both for an Indonesian and American breakfast. Rooms were clean. Bed comfy. Nothing fancy but we didn't plan to spend all day on our room dont online our selves down every night after a fun packed day this hotel was perfect. Their is a safe to keep valuables locked up and staff that helped us arrange our taxi ride to Ubud.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
493,Fantastic,40,August 2014,"Great Hotel!
Excellent location, friendly staff and well priced. I was pleased each morning when I was welcomed by name to breakfast. Resort backed right onto the beach and there was an amazing sunset each night you could watch from the pool or restaurant.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
494,Great stay,40,July 2015,"Great location and staff were friendly and courteous. The hotel is in a great location close to shops and restaurants and a skip across to the beach.

The pool is also great with a nice pool bar and the daily breakfast was great.

A really good hotel and thoroughly recommend!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
495,Great 2nd visit,40,July 2015,"Last visit 4 years ago. The hotel is dated... But clean, safe and a great location with a good pool and direct beach access, hence my return visit. I'll stay again. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. They do the best they can. This isn't a 5 star hotel but, great value for money in my view.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
496,Great Value,50,July 2015,"Stayed here with a group of friends, clean and reasonable sized room. Situated right on Seminyak beach where you can head down and watch he sunset. Great pool facilities and very friendly staff. Great spot, would recommend to friends and family.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
497,Fantastic location without the expense,40,June 2015,"Although the hotel is smaller than it's boutique neighbours, the location is fantastic. Situation right on the beach, right near the famous bean bag bars on the beach, the hotel is clean, staff are friendly, breakfast is fresh with variety each day and a small pool with pool bar. Easy walk into the heart of Seminyak shopping area or a short taxi ride to the more popular restaurants and bars. If you're looking for the Semiyak location, without the expense, this is a great hotel. I would stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
498,Pelangi Bali Resort,40,April 2015,Property is a little dated but in general is in good condition and reasonably clean. Friendly staff and awesome pool. Adjacent to the beach. Restaurant is OK. Nothing special but not bad at all. Overall I would stay here again.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
499,hiliday in Bali,30,June 2015,"First impressions -hotel tired and room given damp smelling.
However we moved upstairs which was much better.Disappointing in that we were expecting wide beach frontage and beautiful views which you don't get.However food very good and location excellent.Viby beach front atmosphere which is just what we wanted rifght in front.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
500,Excellent place to stay,40,June 2015,"We stayed at the Pelangi for 1 week and enjoyed every moment of it. The staff are excellent, so friendly and willing to help with everything. The location is also great, you are right on the beach and just a short stroll to shops.

They rooms are very clean and the whole resort is nice and quiet which is great when you are traveling with young children. The pool is fantastic and the restaurant has a great range. 100% recommend to anyone looking for relaxing holiday accomodation.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
501,family friendly hotel,40,July 2014,"Stayed here and was pleasantly surprised by the service of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. The hotel is right on the beach and the pool and terrace is very comfortable.
Rooms were air conditioned and was cleaned daily.
The hotel is close to many attractions bars, shops, beach, nightclubs and restaurants

over all I can highly recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
502,Our iPad was stolen from our room !,10,November 2014,"We stayed here for 2 nights-we have stayed here before! Our iPad was stolen from our room-the hotel manager was adament that this sort of thing had never happened before but when we stayed several years ago the comments on TrpAdvisor were warning about security and we changed our room (on our previous stay) to a first floor room instead of a ground floor room-this time for a 2 night stay I didn't ask for a first floor room-a bad mistake!
I am security conscious and it was actually clear that the lock on the door on the balcony side of the room on the ground floor was very simple and unsatisfactory. I checked it carefully every time we left the room and it was locked every time. You could not see the iPad from outside and it was next to my wife's handbag which had money and credit cards in it. Nothing was taken from her handbag. We were in room 303 or 301-the last room closest to the swimming pool-our balcony door could easily be seen by the security people at the pool!
When I complained to the manager they checked our room carefully and our iPad (which was normally left in our security safe in the room) was gone. The manager said that they would check their security camera footage from the hallway. I asked her if they had a security camera covering the balcony door-they did not have a camera there.
Our room was locked every time we left it as I checked it carefully each time-no money or credit cards were stolen from my wife's handbag which was sitting next to the iPad.
We left the next day and did not report the theft to the Police as we had little time left in Bali and did not want to spend a significant amount of time on the theft of our uninsured iPad. The hotel never contacted us to indicate they had checked their security footage!
The Pelangi is actually in a good location but we will not stay there again as they cannot be trusted! We love Bali and have been about 25 times but have never had anything stolen there or anywhere else before and we travel a lot!
Unfortunately the cost of an iPad is a lot of money to a Bali person but not to us-how did anyone get into our locked room?",Pelangi Bali Hotel
503,Relaxing Stay,40,June 2015,"Stayed at Pelangi Bali on the first and last nights of a trip to Bali. Hotel is located right on the beach, with a wonderful pool and outdoor area overlooking the surf and sunsets. Found the hotel to be quite central without being right in the noisy centre of Seminyak. Rooms were clean and comfortable, breakfasts and food were good quality, cocktails & lunch in the pool bar was enjoyable. Was able to book room for late checkout which was very convenient.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
504,Great location - if you like Seminyak,30,June 2015,"We had never stayed in Seminyak, this was our first time. We stayed Legian, Lembongan, Canggu and then Seminyak for the final 3 nights of our holiday.

I was a bit worried after recently reading some other TA reviews, but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived.

The hotel is old, but has great character. Reminds me of a museum. The room was nice, big & clean. I didn't mind the layout of the hotel at all (some reviews have said it was strange). The pool and beachfront area was fabulous.

Unfortunately when it came time to sleep, it was all bad. If you are a light sleeper, this is not the hotel for you. I was woken by other hotel guests walking past our room talking & laughing. Then banging of doors as guests returned to their rooms. I could hear the people directly next to us as though they were in the same room - to the point I could hear them draw their curtains and turn on their air conditioning. Needless to say, unfortunately I could also hear their bed springs. Ugh!

Likewise will the guests in the rooms above and below me. Voices, TVs, showers, banging and sliding doors. I had a pretty terrible sleep. The bed was also really hard, that didn't help. There was also construction noise - at 10.45pm on a Sunday night!!! At 11pm I was looking for alternative accommodation.

After a REALLY average breakfast, we told the front desk we were checking out. To the hotels credit, they offered us a room upgrade, but we had already booked somewhere else. They were initially going to charge us a nights accommodation to check out early, but after I explained why we were leaving, they decided not to.

This is a big hotel, with lots of people. If that suits you then you will enjoy it. The pool is amazing and the location is fabulous.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
505,Great stay,40,June 2015,"My partner and I stayed here for one night and really enjoyed ourselves. Yes, there is no safe box in the rooms which I do agree is inconvenient however we were very happy with the value we received for the price we paid here. The rooms are clean and accomidating and the hotel provides friendly customer service. I have to admit that I can be quite a picky traveler but considering the price - it ticked almost every box!

The pool and Resturant area is simple with a relaxing atmosphere, not the best cocktails but the location being right on the beach is a definite highlight!
We really enjoyed the spa here - fantasic prices for treatments from staff who are well trained, we even came back just before our flight home to have another relaxing massage!

If your looking for a reasonable priced hotel that is convientintly located I would highly recommend",Pelangi Bali Hotel
506,Mr,50,June 2015,This will be my third visit to the Pelangi Hotel. The rooms are well maintained and the staff do their best to make you feel welcome. The food is good and they make it your way. I fly Garuda First Class from Melbourne and the service is better than all Australian airlines combined. The return night flight is a great way to catch some sleep. Excellent.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
507,Somewhat disapointed,30,June 2015,"Dissapointed by this resort. No safe box in the room you have to deposit all your belongings at the reception. The pool area is poor, no place enough to get a chair at the pool, The breakfast without fresh vegetables (salad, tomatoes and cheese). No chair offered by the resort at the beach. The resort looks like a destination for charters visitors. Positive points; the personal very kindly and smily and the location closed to the beach and the restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
508,Relaxed and well located hotel,40,June 2015,"Had a good short stay at the Pelangi. Close to food, sunset beach drinks, multiple highly rated restaurants, shopping and anything else!

Hotel was clean, well serviced and full of all the appropriate amenities. Good value for a beach front hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
509,Nothing special,30,June 2015,"Spent 5 days here. The location is good but it is a pity that motor bikes travel on the pathway, between beach and hotel, which should be reserved for pedestrians. This is no fault of the hotel but it does make strolling along, unpleasant and dangerous. The pool and dining area are large and spacious. The rooms are average and face each other so there is no view. The staff is friendly and helpful, as all hotel staff seem to be. in Bali, Just one sour note;- One day we were given ""clean"" towels which were so grubby we had to use the pool towels",Pelangi Bali Hotel
510,A great resort in a beach front location!,50,June 2015,"Everything about this place is amazing! Highlights: pool with swim up bar, nice clean rooms with great aircon, delicious food, super friendly staff, and THE BEST sunsets on the beach right across the road. I would recommend it to everyone!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
511,Great resort and great location!,50,June 2015,"I will definitely come back here! Lovely pool with swim-up bar, beautiful gardens, super friendly staff, delicious food, nice clean room with great aircon, beach front location, the list goes on. Everything about it was amazing!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
512,"Great location, lovely swimming pool",40,March 2015,"Hotel location is very near to double six beach, and near to place to eat.
We very enjoy the swimming pool, also the morning breakfast, delicious mangosteen.
You can also walk to seminyak shopping center which quite near.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
513,"Excellent location, excellent rooms",50,June 2015,"Excellent location, great rooms, awesome pool area. We were there for a wedding and everything was great about the resort. It is right on the beach so easily accessible to everything. We would definitely stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
514,Amazing staff,50,June 2015,"As a hotel manager of a small boutique hotel in South-East Asia, I did not have high expectation while booking this resort. But the staff made the difference! They are just amazing! Very welcoming and attentive. Thnk you for taking care of us...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
515,3rd stay and many more to come 👍😀,50,June 2015,"we love this place . Stayed in the deluxe rooms the first 2 times and superior this time. Been here 3 times now and wouldn't stay anywhere else as its across the road from the beach, warungs out the front with beanbags and music, rooms are clean and serviced everyday but utmost was the staff, they make you feel so welcome and are always happy. It's not a flash hotel but has a good feel to it and has everything you need. The breakfast is nice and the egg station is fantastic. When we come back to Bali we will definitely be staying here again. We were here for 2 weeks and loved it. Thanks to everyone at pelangi Bali hotel for everything again. Hope to see you all soon. Karen and Steve.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
516,No private balconies on ground floor,30,April 2015,"We were very disappointed to find no balcony or courtyard, after selecting this hotel with this as a priority. Staff were fantastic besides reception, who told me to complain to Wotif, although their own website advertises balconies for all rooms!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
517,Great holiday in Seminyak,40,June 2015,"Just returned from 2 weeks at the Pelangi Bali Hotel -superb location!!

Rooms were fine, staff really nice and the pool is great.

The location makes this a 'must return to' hotel - right on the beach with two bars literally seconds away.

Breakfast got a little 'samey' but it is cheap enough to skip it and go to one of the beach bars across the road.

You can get a flasher hotel but a better location?? Doubt it!

Loved it - would recommend to anyone who is not too picky about their rooms - you only sleep in it at the end of the day.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
518,Our Home Away From Home,50,May 2015,"This was our 5th time staying at the beautiful Pelangi hotel and it suits us perfectly! From the moment we arrive we feel like we have come home as we always receive the warmest and most genuine of welcomes. The staff are always friendly, the location is perfect, right on Seminyak beach, the rooms are clean and have all you need and the breakfast would have to be one of the best in Seminyak. This time we noticed quite a few new hotels near Pelangi and walked past to have a look but they seemed so sterile and had no charm whatsoever and many of them looked like city hotels. These places also cost a lot per night compared to the reasonable price you will pay at the Pelangi. If you are like us and don't need all the fanciness of a new hotel but are looking for a more casual, homely feel then the Pelangi is for you! Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and I'll be glad to assist. Thank you once again to all the lovely staff who once again made sure that we took many special memories home with us.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
519,Great location,40,May 2015,"We stayed here for 8 nights on our trip to Bali, great friendly service. Fantastic location right on the beach. I was a little worried after reading some reviews of the quality of this hotel, but after staying and seeing for myself the Pelangi out-did the reviews. The rooms are a little dated, but very clean, serviced daily and the air con works great!! Breakfast buffet was fantastic, was good to watch the ocean of a morning & great changing variety everyday and the guys on the egg station made my eggs perfectly! We ate at all different times- from 7am breakfast to 930am and the quality & quantity were still there. Loved the pool and pool bar was great to hang out in the afternoons, while having a snack to eat. We caught the free shuttle to Kuta one day, the driver was very informative giving us other ideas on what to do... Thanks for a great experience Pelangi staff!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
520,Overnight Stay,40,May 2015,"We only stayed the night but it seemed like a nice resort. Rooms were a little older but kept clean and up-to-date. Restaurant was clean, the service was good and the food was tasty. It's right on the beach so close to cafes/bars which is always good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
521,Best location & value for money hotel in seminyak,50,June 2015,We stayed at the Pelangi hotel over the long weekend and as usual it was perfect. With ocean views from the breakfast area and with the great pool where you can also see the ocean this place has a great feel. Although an older hotel by comparison to some others close by the rooms are very neat & Spacious. Cable TV is standard which is a welcome sight. Room service was excellent and food very tasty. The biggest draw card of this hotel is the location. You can take 5 steps and be on the beach with 2 warungs either side offering quality food and drinks and great spot to take in the sunset. Situated between double six and the Gado Gado restaurant. You can walk just about anywhere and if on a scooter then it's minutes to shopping. Overall it is great value for money and we are booking in again for xmas,Pelangi Bali Hotel
522,Yet another great stay,50,June 2015,"Have stayed here many times and again the staff were very friendly and helpful , rooms very clean and spacious enough , pool great, location excellent and buffet breakfast good only down side is price of food in the resturant for an evening meal",Pelangi Bali Hotel
523,On the beach,40,July 2014,"Great location with amazing views of the sunset from the infinity pool.
The pool bar is always a good place to enjoy the arvo and sunset.
If you are an early morning person like us, a quick dip in the sea, walk back to the hotel which is just on the beach rinse the salt water and back to the pool for a good relaxation.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
524,Good- will stay again,40,May 2015,"Overall it was a great place to stay, only 2 things i could complain about is
1: i booked through hotelopia and was told i would get extras that pelangi would not honour, how ever they did give me 2x days free laundry- still i was disappointed about this.
2: one day on my stay a very loud machine came through and smoked out the place, was quiet toxic too- not sure what it was but assume mosquito control.

Staff at restaurant and cleaners very nice 10 out if 10",Pelangi Bali Hotel
525,My Stay in May 2015,40,May 2015,I would like to thank all the wonderful and friendly staff for making our stay with you such a wonderful memory. It catered for all our needs and is so central to Seminyak and the beautiful beaches. The pool area is excellent and the beach is on your doorstep. Wonderful shopping just around the corner. Will definitely be back very soon,Pelangi Bali Hotel
526,Fantastic location,40,August 2014,A small intimate well priced great location hotel. Perfect for families and singles. Love having breakfast overlooking the ocean and the little food hits out front for a sunset beer. Stayed about 5 times and now then oops have been updated which is well welcomed.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
527,Great quiet hotel.,50,March 2015,"This is the 2nd time I've stayed at Pelangi Bali hotel, the first time on my own. I'd stayed here previously with my sister, and I knew the location was great, it was quiet, which is what I wanted, very clean and a great pool. Yes, it's an older style hotel, but for the price and location, it's well worth the stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
528,Denise,40,May 2015,"location location location. Older style hotel love it stayed there twice would stay there again. Basic brekky but lovely view of the beach.
Helpful and friendly staff always a hello.
Basic rooms with quite small balconies on first level probably my only negative.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
529,"Ideal, peaceful little piece of Bali",40,May 2015,"This quaint hotel is perfectly located, clean, quiet and has everything you would be looking for during your stay in Seminyak. Rooms of reasonable size, comfortable bed, perfect quiet air conditioner and very quiet location. The staff were all very pleasant and could not do enough for you. Nice sized pool with swim up bar, plenty of sun lounges, nicely positioned restaurant for breakfast (with REAL bacon!) and views to the beach and the waves. Would certainly stay there again. Only little negatives was the WIFI a little hit & miss, no safe in your room and the bath towels have seen better days.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
530,Tired property,20,May 2015,"This is an old and tired resort. It does not appear much has been reinvested to maintain the facilities. The general area and gym in particular is in a poor state of repairs. There are no safe boxes in the guest rooms; guests are reminded to keep valuables in a safe deposit room near the front desk.
The site layout is unattractive. The property sits on a narrow strip of land leading from main road to the beach - guest room are housed on two building blocks facing each other and there is no view of the beach except for where the pool/restaurant is.
The only saving grace of the hotel is its staff who come across friendly.
For the asking price, there are many other more attractive options in Bali - I decided to move on the same day I checked in.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
531,Nice but could do with an overhaul,40,May 2015,"We recently stayed in May 2015 and although it was comfortable and clean, it could do with an overhaul as the rooms are quite out dated but still comfortable. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. It is within walking distance back into Legian and Kuta about 20mn if you walk the front beach road its the quickest option. Very quite area but also still with easy access to the other areas close by.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
532,Fabulous location!,40,May 2015,"We recently stayed at the Pelangi resort for 18 days. We both found the hotel to be a fabulous base for our holiday. This hotel is perfectly located along Seminyak beach without the steep prices of other resorts in the area.

The Pelangi has a great view of the beach area from the pool and restaurant area and it is great to some times just relax and watch the beach activities, the surfers, beach traders and tourists going about their day. The shuttle actually picked us up from the airport when we arrived. (I suggest a reminder email the day prior to arrival)

The staff at The Pelangi are amazingly friendly, even by Balinese standards! Staff in all areas of the hotel are smiling and more than happy to help with any enquiries. (Wayan, the shuttle driver seems to remember every guest's name)

Our room was very neat and clean. It was a basic room but was very pleasant.It also had everything that we could possibly need including satellite television. There are no real views from the rooms but this did not concern us at all. The views from the restaurant and pool area made up for it. We found the wifi was good strength but often had difficulty logging onto the correct hot spot. The bathroom was clean, the water pressure of the shower was great. It would have been convenient to have a safety deposit box in the room but it was no real trouble to us accessing the safes in the reception whenever we needed to.

The pool at the resort is brilliant. We enjoyed swimming and watching the sunset over the ocean at the same time. It is kept very clean and is always a perfect temperature. We never had any trouble getting a sunlounge but this may be a different story in peak holiday season. The swim up bar is a great novelty which we made good use of. We did not find the prices expensive at all, comparable to many local bars anyway.

The Pelangi is located just a short stroll to many of the best beach restaurants such as Capil Sands and La Plancha. Alternatively, some of the fine dining areas are also nearby or accessible by a short taxi ride. Their is a driver depot situated in the street which we made use of when we needed transport. Metered Taxis can also be easily hailed at the front of the hotel. We also used the free shuttle service the pelangi offers a number of times to get to Kuta.

I have no hesitation recommending The Pelangi resort. I think that it was fabulous value for money. It is more expensive than other Seminyak hotels which are inland but here you are getting beach front exposure. We had a fabulously relaxing and enjoyable time!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
533,Being Renovated,30,February 2015,great hotel for the price we payed and the location is great. It's right on the beach near some great night spots and beach restaurants. You get to eat breakfast looking out onto the beach and the pool is great. Breakfast was good they had Indonesian and western food to choose from. The staff were very friendly and always happy. Would stay again rooms are a little bit smaller than I thought they would be but the aircon and wifi worked and was a nice place to stay.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
534,Typical Bali,40,May 2015,I have been to Bali many times and have found that the most important thing is location as most hotels are the same unless you pay top $$. We chose the hotel because it was on the beach front not because of the amenities. Having said that the rooms were clean and the pool bar is handy. Its not a party hotel nor a young kids venue so is good place to chill and use as a base to go exploring.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
535,"Great hotel,freindly staff",50,May 2015,"This was our second stay at the Pelangi and they didn't let us down. Very friendly and helpful staff, rooms clean and food was fantastic .We would certainly stay there again. The pool is ideal for kids with a good size shallow section as well as plenty of room for adult swimming and also has a great pool bar. The hotel also backs right onto the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
536,Still a Great Place to Stay,50,April 2015,"I recently returned to The Pelangi for my 4th visit. This place is still a great hotel, and its location is one of the biggest drawcards for me. Right on the beach, and not an ""over the top"" 5 star resort feel. The rooms are clean, fairly modern, and all are comfortable. Showers are great, with good pressure and temperature.
Staff are always happy and the breakfasts are more than ample.
Only problem I have with The Pelangi, is Happy Hour. They do have one on weekends, but it is in the bar at reception, (and only 25% off). I feel they need to have one in the pool bar. It was nearly empty each evening between around 5-7:00pm. If there was a decent happy hour in the pool, people would stay around the hotel, instead of migrating down to the beach for sunset drinks.
I still thouroughly enjoyed my time at Pelangi, and will definately return.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
537,Had a good time at Pelangi,50,May 2015,"I stayed 4 nights at Pelangi , in May 2015
I agree with other reviews , the hotel is not the latest one ,but the room is well kept and doesn't give signs of tiredness neither the bathroom , the room at first floor did not have a view ,but was so close to the swimming pool and beach!
Wifi works rather well ( comparing to other hotels in Bali ) , the restaurant is quite ok , and not more expensive than other restaurants around , the food was good and they takeout to you at your sunbed close to the s. Pool, with a smile and no extra charge
The swimming pool is nice and well kept , all the personnel were very kind , smiling and helpful , and you see the beach , the waves and the surfers from around the end of the pool and the terrace of the restaurant; lots of restaurants and shops around , nice and rather clean beach , of course ,in Kuta you probably have a better quality / price rate but for Seminyak it is a good option if you want an hotel on the beach ( the Oberoi is much nicer but also 3 to 4 times the price)
I'd recommend this hotel and I'd go back there again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
538,Traditional Balinese Hotel in great location,40,May 2015,"We returned to the Pelangi for the third time to be greeted by a letter of thanks for our patronage - left in our room. The staff remembered us and we were made to feel very welcome. The location is fabulous, right on the beach, which can be seen from both the restaurant and the pool. If you want modern 5 star go somewhere else (and pay for it). The Pelangi offers a traditional experience, the rooms and grounds are neat and clean, the staff are wonderful, it's close to everything but out of the madness of Kuta and it's good value for money. We'll go back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
539,Wonderful,50,May 2015,"After reading the reviews for the Pelangi, like any other trip I decided to take a chance and was I ever happy with my choice! I really do not get why people want to travel and at the same time have the commodity they have at home? Anyways , this hotel if you are looking for beachfront, close to the nicest little resto on the beach to watch sunset on your bean bag, breakfast included and room that are functional and close to Semniyak square this is the place. Yes the hotel is not on the beach like the Oberoi, but you are also paying a third if not more of the price of the Oberoi, yes there is trees in front and a little street for scooter that you have to cross to get to the beach but you see the beach very well and hear the waves crashing in! You can walk all day long on the beach if you like and Semniyak beach is still pretty clean.
The breakfast has a variety but let's also get real, if you were home for 7 days in your country and had to eat every single morning at the resto well you would end up eating the same at one point so, the breakfast had all you needed to enjoy your holidays.

The walk to the square is a good one but if you are in no hurry it is feasible, if not lots of driver and taksi will help you along for e ride.
The room are very decent, hot water, good pressure, I was on the first floor, plain room and I cannot understand what more you would want, yes the towel are dated but you have no control over that.

I have travelled all over and was so happy to have picked this hotel, I am a solo traveller and love the pool as well which was clean and big, there is also enough chairs to sit by the pool or by the beach view side! If you rather be on the beach as far as feet in the sand from your hotel, well you better have money, Pelangi has it all, and the view is still unobstructed , unsure if one day they will build.

If you need further info please write me an email",Pelangi Bali Hotel
540,Pelangi was perfect,50,May 2015,"I'm not sure what anyone has to complain about this place.

Yes, it is a little older than some other bigger resorts in Seminyak - but the price is reflective of that, those other resorts are $200++ per night.

The Pelangi, for us, was perfect. Spacious clean rooms, fantastic clean pool which was kept at a perfect temperature, great pool bar, good cocktails (expensive as they are everywhere in Bali), lovely friendly staff, a fabulous location right on the beach where you can enjoy all the happenings on the beach from your deck chair without being hassled by the touts on the beach.

Breakfast was great with little changes every day and the spa was also very good there, more expensive than on the street but worth it for cleanliness and professionalism of the staff.

The only way you would be disappointed is if you were expecting 5 star ++ at a 4.5 star price - this is the real world- you pay for what you get, and you get everything and more at the Pelangi at a fair price.

We were a group of 4 adults and 6 in their early 20s and all of us said we would definately stay here again - it's the best location in Seminyak.

All of the beachfront little restaurants around that area were good, we particularly enjoyed Champlung and the Juice Park (straight out the front on the left).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
541,Great Hotel and friendly staff,50,May 2015,Great Hotel and friendly staff always make my trip so much easier. I have stayed here on several occasions and love the location of this hotel to the beach. Breakfast is always good and rooms very clean.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
542,Great Stay,40,March 2015,"Stayed here with a group of freinds, really enjoyed the stay breakfast was awsome. Cannot beat the location of this hotel is in a great spot right on the beach, staff where freindly and helpful.
The hotel is a little older but nice with lots of Bali charm.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
543,Great Beach Friendly Staff,50,June 2014,Lovely hotel and very friendly staff! The pool is beautiful and the open air restaraunt serves breakfast lunch and dinner overlooking the beautiful beach. Walking distance to shopping and restaurants as well.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
544,Fair hotel but don't step outside,30,April 2015,"Hotel - rooms spacious clean all amenities
Well serviced
Breakfast western choice - many Aussies and Europeans
Pool excellent swim up bar
Restaurant closed and apparently not recommended
Hotel surrounds nice and well maintained
Quiet at night
Good location to beach and beach bars at back doorstep
Lots of mid range restaurants close by.

BUT........ watch for scams, ripoffs, constant harassment by shop owners, massage girls, motorbike and taxis....ruined my holiday....yeah been in other Asian destinations before but felt I was a walking ATM to the businesses around the area.
Really turned me off Bali

Fair hotel but don't step outside",Pelangi Bali Hotel
545,Best relaxing holiday,50,April 2015,"This has been the most relaxing holiday of my life. I've just turned 40 so my friend and I decided to venture out to Bali. For the price you really cannot complain. Yes there are nicer hotels along this beach but costs a lot more. Everything on Tripadvisor has been said i.e. clean rooms, friendly people etc... Here I want to share some points I came across which could be of some help to you guys that may not have been added on Tripadvisor?

Ok the safe point can be an issue but it does work. Make sure you do not lose the safe key and there are a couple of big safe boxes. Basically most of my valuables I carried out in my rucksack.

You will feel safe along Seminyak beach and the locals will sure look after you. I even left another bag on their sun lounge and it was sure looked after all day.

No complaints about using the taxi service from the hotel, just agree a price before you leave and I can assure you it’s very cheap. Yes you may get a cheaper taxi waiting outside the hotel but it’s not really worth it.

I bought water from the beach which was 4x cheaper than the hotel.

The hotel Gym was not hardly used, it’s a shame because the facilities are there. Ask for a clean towel, you will have to bring your own tunes. The treadmill wasn’t working but they have free weights, mats etc... so enough to do if you know your way round a gym.

The room service facilities is excellent too, 24 hrs and the menu has everything from starters, mains to deserts. All types of drinks and basically the whole menu from the restaurant is shown on their room service – great work guys as food is yummy too.

Local mini supermarkets 300 meters up the road and fridge to store goods in your hotel room.

I tipped the cleaner 50000 (£2.50) Rupiah at the start of the holiday and was sure appreciated and room looked after every day.

Bring ear plugs to wear as the air con can be a bit noisey but works great and keeps the mozzies away at night.

If you have any questions just asked.

I will be definitely going back to Bali and I will be booking this hotel again. It’s so relaxing to stay and the location is the selling point where you can walk along the beach either to in Kuta or further North which is even quieter than Seminyak.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
546,Great location on the beach front,50,April 2015,"Swim up Pool bar great opens at 11am, great being able to sun lounge at your hotel pool and still hear the waves breaking at the beach, can hear the chill out tunes playing at the beach front bar if you sit up the front. Rooms are simple but adequate, bathrooms the same. We wanted to use the roof top sunset terrace bar to watch the sunset but was told only open for functions, which was a shame. We thought view would've been better from above, so ended up walking on the beach to a bar for sunset and drinks. We used the spa today for massage and pedicure and was very relaxing, planning on going back again tomorrow. Yes I would return again. Value for money and location, being on the beach front is a winner for us",Pelangi Bali Hotel
547,Enjoyed one again,40,March 2015,"This is our fifth time, we have stayed at Pelangi. The location is really good as you can look over the beach. The pool is great. We really like it for,the times we have stayed, there has'nt been to many kids. Which has also been a big plus with other like minded,people we talked with, That alone helps keep it nice and quiet, and relaxing. The staff, are also lovely,and have become friends, over our stay. Another really nice thing is, the fact they play, Balinese music, in the restaurant and foyer, which reminds us of their culture, and why we came to Bali. It's refreshing not having a bunch of loud music around the pool, that's not what Pelangi is about. We will definitely go again xxx",Pelangi Bali Hotel
548,not what we were expecting!,10,April 2015,"now we aren't to fussy about what we stay in but not once we came from two much nicer hotels for the same price and even cheaper before staying here, we werent happy with what we got for the same price, really aged room, room smelt, not what the photos made it appear to be like thats for sure!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
549,Great Value for Money directly at the Ocean,50,January 2015,"The Pelangi is a Hotel conveniently located near the Beach and the staff is quite Helpfull. We got a great deal on there Website.

Since I export Furniture from Bali I am there quite often and it was a great place, The onlyx negative is the loud Ventilator in the bathroom",Pelangi Bali Hotel
550,Good location,40,April 2015,Very clean and well positioned hotel in Seminyak right on the beach. They have an Extensive buffet breakfast every morning which is recommend including when booking your room and a great pool! Beers and Cocktails are fairly priced but no happy hour which would be nice. Rooms are nice.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
551,Great place to stay with friends,40,April 2015,"We stayed in March with a big group of friends as we celebrated a milestone birthday for one of our group.
She and her husband have stayed at the Pelangi many times, but it was our first time, although our third trip to Bali.
The hotel was quiet, clean and is in a sensational location.
It is not flash and is priced accordingly.
I think it's the perfect base for exploring busy Seminyak combined with staying somewhere beautiful ( like Ubud or Nusa Lembongan) if you want the luxury experience.
We will definitely return.
My only criticism is the use of glass at the swim up bar, even for children's drinks.
This is very unsafe and we witnessed two occasions where breakages necessitated the pool be evacuated for cleaning before anyone cut their feet.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
552,Perfect place for a Bali beach vacation,50,April 2015,"This hotel is perfect for location. Convenient to the beach and restaurants there as well as other dining streets in Seminyak. The rooms are clean and spacious.
I would stay here above every other place in the Kuta-Canggu corridor. For the price, location",Pelangi Bali Hotel
553,Great hotel on the beach,40,March 2015,"Spent 3 nights at Pelangi, clean spacious rooms, very good breakfast, right on the beach, all was very good. We booked directly with hotel and got a really good rate including airport transfers and breakfast.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
554,"Right by the beach, quiet and architecturally interesting",40,March 2015,"Pelangi is one of those hidden gems in Bali, located in the quiet neighborhood of Semiyak, north of Kuta and Legion that are frequented by touristists. The trade off is that you have to walk about 150 meters/500 feet to the nearst convenience store or getting a taxi. Not a bad tradeoff to me.
The rooms are quite large and comfortable, equipped with a balcony you can get a glimps of ocean. The swimming pool deck and open terrace of the restaurant are well designed to fit nicely to each other. If not close enough to the ocean, just walk a few steps, you are on the beach with all the beach restaurant and bars, very civilized, not crazy like those in Kuta.
Super nice of this hotel is that it allows to use a so called hospitality room after you check out, which is basically a regular hotel room that you can shower and rest before heading to the airport. It was a life saver for me after a exhuasting cycling tour of my last day in Bali.
One suggestion is that the airport transportation arranged by the hotel is best for large group with lots of luggage at price of 200K IDR. Regular taxi (Blue Bird) should be less than half of it, but you have to walk 500ft to get one.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
555,"Great value, great location",50,March 2015,"This was the second time I have stayed at the Pelangi Hotel and it truly is a fantastic hotel for the price. The staff are so friendly and happy, always smiling and will do anything to help. My husband got injured while we were there and they happily offered their driver and car to take us to medical centre and again when we checked out at 12pm and did not have a flight till 1155pm that night they stored our bags, allowed us access o pool all day and even gave us a room to shower in before airport! Very impressed. Rooms have everything you want and are comfortable. Location is fantastic, close to everything, walking distance to loads of great restaurants, bars, massages and shops. Breakfast has a great variety. All in all, very impressed with the value for money. Thanks Pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
556,A great hotel in a good location,40,March 2015,"While it might be as new as many hotels in Bali, this place has lots of character. The rooms are immaculate and the beach is right out front. Breakfast was good and varied. The staff were so pleasant and helpful",Pelangi Bali Hotel
557,60th Birthday,50,March 2015,"Am a regular visitor to this hotel and never dissapoints, This time I booked 8 rooms for friends an family all first visitors for wifes birthday all had a great time and all said would return to hotel. Great location walking distance to bars and cafes, clean rooms lovely staff all you need for great holiday.
.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
558,Good value given the beach front location.,40,March 2015,"The beach front location is great, and good value for the price. The hotel and facilities are dated but clean and staff very friendly.
The hotel backs into the beach and quite a few beach from cafe and bars which was great at night.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
559,Great location,30,March 2015,"Just stayed at pelangi for 10 days What wins for this hotel is the location close to every thing .Staff are friendly and always made us welcome,but the hotel needs a good high pressure clean.Pool is great and restaraunt ,breakfast great.Unfortunately the beach was very littered with garbage which was hard to get use to on the sandBut the locals also made a good effort cleaning it up..will come back but not in march as the rubbish comes from java from the wet season washed down.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
560,Good location and clean :),40,March 2015,Very Friendly and helpful staff. Easy check in and out. Safe. Nice clean pool and yummy buffet breakfast. Rooms cleaned well. Airport transfer is great. I would definitely stay again for my next holiday.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
561,Highly recommended,50,March 2015,"This was my 2nd time staying at Pelangi, this time by myself. Very lovely staff, very clean, great pool, great location. Yes, it's a little bit dated, but very quiet and clean. Great location on the beach, not far from Eat Street and seminyak square. Highly recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
562,You can find better value for your money,30,March 2015,"We stayed at The Pelangi for 5 nights recently and when I booked it I did know it was a bit tired but in a good spot. The hotel rooms appear to have had a make over and were comfortable and clean. The pool area really requires some softening up as the pool is quite nice but the areas around the pool are cramped and have no appeal at all. Just plastic day beds on a concrete slab. The view onto Legian Beach however is very nice. The breakfast included was very basic. My husband booked me into the hotel spa for an hour massage but the massage only lasted 45 minutes and was just ok ( expensive for what it was). The pond near reception really needed cleaning as it was deep green. Overall the hotel needs some TLC and you can certainly get better value for your money In Seminyak. The one thing that did disappoint me was the older gentleman at the porters desk. When we were leaving the hotel we asked him to call us a taxi he offered the hotel driver ( which we knew would be expensive). When we declined and asked if he could just call us a taxi as we were only going to Seminyak. He told us he couldn't and we would have to walk out to the nearest main road to pick up a taxi, which we did pulling our luggage, in the dark. I was not at all impressed and we will not return to this hotel. We know Bali well and suggest you consider other hotels before booking the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
563,Pretty good,40,March 2015,"The hotel has a good localization, close to the best restaurants, beach clubs and bars. The staff helped us and everything that we need!
The rooms are great and the pool is in front of the beach, which is great, so you can walk in the beach and comeback anytime to go to the pool",Pelangi Bali Hotel
564,Great location,30,March 2015,"We stayed here for 10 nights and we selected as we wanted a place close to the beach, cheap and that had a great pool which this ticked all boxes.
It's quite old school hotel but the rooms were clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are tiny but everything else was good for us. Pool is great and the staff were all amazing and so friendly. It is in the lower end of the price scale especially for the beach location, we enjoyed our stay and we will be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
565,FANTASTIC!!,50,February 2015,"I really enjoyed my stay here - located right on the beach and a short walk to shopping and the vary many and varied restaurants/bars. The staff here are amazing and treat you more like a friend than a customer - their great service and friendly smiles certainly brighten up your day. My room was large with a very comfortable queen bed, and a lovely little balcony. Breakfast was buffet style and plenty of it - they even have an egg station where you can have your eggs made to your liking. I had dinner in the restaurant quite a few times, as I didn't feel much like going out after a day of sightseeing and/or shopping and had no complaints about the quality, quantity or taste. The cocktail menu was pretty good too and cost around AUD $8.50 each. There is a shuttle bus that takes you to Kuta 5 times a day and they are more than happy to drop you off almost anywhere along the way. The gardens are lush and well maintained - the gardeners do an amazing job. In fact, I'd like to thank ALL the staff, including those that work ""behind the scenes"", for making my first trip to Bali an enjoyable and memorable one. I would definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
566,Nice Hotel,40,March 2015,"Advantages:
Swimming Pool
Ocean View
The restaurant manager ordered especial breakfast, when I told him that I cannot eat this Indonesian food. Especial Thanks to restaurant manager.
After I had check out, the reception facilitated a room for 30 Min. to change my clothes at 3PM.
Thank you.

Disadvantages:
No Safe Box at room. You have to store your valuable at the reception desk and if you lost the key, you will pay more than $100.
The TV is old fashion TV. No screen TV at the room.
Reception cannot call a taxi for guest. You have to use hotel Limousine which is expensive. Although, normal in all other hotels in Bali, the reception can call a taxi at any time for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
567,Great location!,50,December 2014,"My wife and I visited the Pelangi Bali Hotel in December last year. The Pelangi Bali is really well situated, right on the beach and restaurants all with in walking distance. The rooms are a little dated as some people have mentioned, however they are extremely clean and of good size. Our only dislike were the bath towels, they were washed but were very old and marked with stains. Definitely in need of an update.
The breakfast each morning included in our package was great, but I would not recommend eating lunch or dinner there. We had a complementary dinner and it was very average compared to other places you can eat at. If you need somewhere safe to put your valuables, we used their safety deposit box at reception it was very convenient and we had no problem at all.
The pool and the swim up bar was fantastic, this hotel definitely has some old charm. We would definitely come back here in the future, the value is fantastic and not to mention the friendly service we received.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
568,Great location,40,March 2015,Great location right on the beach. Room was clean and everything was in good working order. Restaurant had a view over beach. Definitely recommend checking out the little bars/cafes on the beach as the atmosphere on sunset was great. Walking distance to restaurants and maskets/shopping.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
569,"Great beach location with more pro's than cons, affordable hotel.",40,March 2015,"We enjoyed our stay at Pelangi, the staff are great and the hotel is affordable, nice location on the beach front. The bed we slept in was quite hard and uncomfortable, but the room is a good size and very clean, rooms are in a nice quiet location away from busy areas like the pool/restaurant. The one thing we really dislike with Pelangi is the fact taxi's are not allowed to the hotel to pick up guests, you have to walk up the road to hail a taxi, not fun in the rain. You can have a driver in a private car come to the hotel, but they are expensive and the price must be negotiated with the driver. One suggestion we would like to make to Pelangi management, please make use of the roof top area above restaurant, it would be a fantastic place to have an evening drink at sunset.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
570,"Great quality, affordable awesome location",40,February 2015,"Have had many vacation trips to Bali and have never stayed in the same place twice however, that may now change following the stay at Pelangi Bali Hotel. Location is fantastic, steps from the beach, many beachside bars and restos. Also close to Seminyak's main shopping area (about a 15 mins walk or 5 min cab ride) and many more fantastic restaurants.
Stayed in a Super Deluxe room for 12 days. Outstanding room quality. It isn't 5 star and doesn't pretend to be. But it is great value, comfortable, clean and has everything a fussy traveller could want. The staff are very accommodating and friendly and always looking to help.
The grounds are very well kept with a fantastic pool and pool-bar. Restaurant is good without being overly pricey. Included breakfast provided good variety of cooked food, bread/pastry, fruits, cereals and juices which was a great start to the day.
This is one of the Best Value options I have come across in Bali, and thoroughly recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
571,Great location,30,March 2015,"Very dated Rooms spacious and clean
Wifi excellent in room
No safes in room air con barely coping
Well kept building for its age

Reasonable room rates
Defiantly would stay again because it ticks the boxes for us",Pelangi Bali Hotel
572,Location,40,February 2015,"Overall, you can't beat this quaint hotel for its location and value for money.
After all, we only sleep in the rooms and out and about during the days
Perfect views over looking the waters in Seminyak , having cocktails by the pool watching the world go by",Pelangi Bali Hotel
573,excellent holiday,50,February 2015,I had a great time.The staff were very friendly.Breakfast was very good.My room was clean and everything worked.The pool was sparkling and easy to get in and out of.Just needed a few pot plants to soften up some of the paved areas in front of restuarant.Nothing negative to report.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
574,"Outdated, lovely small resort",40,February 2015,Dex was amazing always made us feel special and welcome little out dated sunset bar never open pool bar and pool needed to be open long staff always friendly breakfast amazing as always very family friendly,Pelangi Bali Hotel
575,10 days in bali left after 5,30,January 2015,"our room was large near the back of hotel and lovely v clean, the stairs were a prob as I am disabled also people with prams, pool looked fine not much privacy, .breakfast was good anything that wasn't out you could ask although the coffee was dreadful, my 20 year old daughter used the gym, very basic and machine started to burn electrical fault hmm. The beach was filthy, bags, rubbish, my daughter went surfing and cut her arm on something! rubbish swept up , steaming in the heat, the main streets similar, children begging and bike everywhere, We hired a car and driver for 8 hrs which was brill, we went to nusa dua and turtle farm and other islands etc we left after 5 days not the paradise we were expecting!!! we then flew to Perth ahhhhh",Pelangi Bali Hotel
576,Great value for money,40,February 2015,"Great little hotel , good value for what you pay.
Location good, staff awesome .
Clean and tidy, probably a 3 star.

Only real down was not good for elderly and families with pushchairs as lots of stairs and no lifts.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
577,Room great and cool!,40,February 2015,"We booked the honeymoon package. It wasn't our actual honeymoon but we liked the look of what was on offer. The superior room was nice with good aircon. Pool and pool bar was awesome however it would be good if it had cheaper drinks at some point in the day. Could get quite pricey. Gym was quite dated.
Included in the package was breakfast everyday (a pretty good buffet!), one dinner (not that spectacular if it was our honeymoon but delicious nonetheless), a full day tour (our guide was great and we saw another side of Bali!)
We were really keen to try the spa for a massage, but even with the discount on offer it was expensive. May have been worth it.
Staff were all lovely. Yeiki working in the XO lounge was so nice to us.
I would stay again but without the package so it's a bit cheaper.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
578,Acceptable,30,February 2015,"Our accommodation was part of a package deal so we had no real choice, it's 3 star we had breakfast added which was mess food at best, tea and coffee are best avoided along with the juices which give ""Tang"" a good name we had green tea, trust only the egg station for grub, the cereals are scary, fruit and yogurt are passable. The pool is great and position next to beach is bonus, it's a tired old warhorse full of Aussies mostly. Located in the less trendy side of Seminyak and better value many be had elsewhere, on the plus side it's clean and staff attentive without being a burden AC, beds all good if you like a flat pillow bring your own, wifi is slow so don't plan a working holiday here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
579,Standard Accomodation,30,February 2015,"Stayed here Feb 2015. We stayed for 4 nights. Had to change rooms after the first night as there was a foul smelling liquid leaking from the roof of our bathroom above our toilet. The hotel were good and moved us quickly to another room. They were renovating a large number of rooms whilst we were there.

Rooms were clean and the air conditioning was nice and cold. Bed was comfortable and nice linen used. Breakfast was included, it was standard buffet. I was over it after the 3rd day though. Views of the beach and open air terrace seating whilst eating breakfast, which was nice.

They forgot to pick us up from the airport when we landed, we ended up having to pay for our own taxi to get to the hotel. Be wary of using their hotel transfers, We had it confirmed in email that they would be there, but they never showed.

Overall, the rooms were nice with working air con and nice linen. Those are important things in my opinion.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
580,Very dated and over priced!,20,January 2015,"Stayed here for 4 nights and then moved into another 'hotel' which was actually suits.
This hotel was $40 more each night and it was about half the 1/3 of the size of our next place.
The towels were stained- marks on them everyday.
Beach is not very nice. Breakfast is average, nothing special.
The spa service was great and friendly staff. However if you want to go to the airport in the shuttle you have to give them 1 day notice otherwise its badluck- which i found odd..
In my opinion thi si more of a 2 star hotel. I have stayed in nicer and cleaner hostels!!

Keep searching!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
581,Lucky it had a great pool,30,December 2014,"Not much to rave about. But the pool is great and the staff fantastic. The beach is disgusting, covered in litter. The hotel could use a good gernie and paint job. Food quite pricey once you add the 21% taxs. We still had a nice stay. But would probably stay off the beach next time in a five star for the price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
582,Riccardo Seeber Review,40,January 2015,"Very pleasant stay as always. Beautiful staff and customer service.
This time only 2 worries: Its was very hard to track down the tailor in the hotel, and when we needed to use the computer service in the lobby it was not working.
Otherwise, lovely.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
583,Pelangi Great place and great people,40,January 2015,"My wife and I just recently came back from staying at the Pelangi for 18 days and throughly enjoyed it .So close to the beach ,the rooms where clean and tidy ,breakfast great & good selection and the staff where Exceptional very friendly & obiling. Plus it is handy to everything shops,restaurants and spas .The pool and swim up bar where fantastic My wife and I would have no hesitation on staying their for are next vist to Bali .Thanks Pelangi from Christine & Alex",Pelangi Bali Hotel
584,"Awesome hotel ,",40,October 2014,"We have stayed at Pelangi twice now and won't hesitate to stay again , we love Bali and intend to travel back as regular as possible.
Pelangi Bali resort is a Balinese style resort that is not a new resort , but it is comfortable, affordable and the staff are so friendly and professional. They will help with any issue you might have so that your stay at Pelangi is a enjoyable experience. The pool is awesome and the restaurant never disappoints. Being so close to the beach makes it easy and quick to get to the beach bars and restaurants. The local shops and markets are the same prices and goods as in Kuta and Legian. The night clubs rock most nights and the environment is happy and safe and oh so casual. As you can tell by my review we love Pelangi and Saminyac it's just that bit mor relaxed than Kuta and Legian but busy enough if you want it.have a look you won't be disappointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
585,Good 3 star hotel,40,January 2015,"I was a little disappointed in Booking.com rating this as a 4 star hotel. To be fair to the hotel, it is an excellent value hotel but not to the standard we are used to. No in room safe, clunky keys that our kids couldn't use and their failure to provide adjoin rooms when we had specifically booked these leads to a poor review from me this time around. If you don't have adjoining roomw when we ask, say so, I will book somewhere else. Don't give me the 'subject to availability' line. The location actually grew on me, we could walk down to Double Six and up to Oberoi street although it is about 10 minutes further than Id like South from Oberoi. Easier to get a scooter. The breakfast is good, pool is good, beach location is also good. If you want value for money accommodation I definitely recommend it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
586,"Pelangi Hotel Bali, Indonesia",40,December 2014,"Last December I and my wife visited Bali for a pleasure trip from 10th December to 19th December 2014. After going through various hotel reviews on Trip Advisor we decided on Pelangi. As we were staying for over seven days we were offered a sixty minute Spa and a complimentary dinner or lunch. There was also a free airport pick up.
From the time we landed and till the time we left we were taken care off very well both by the hotel and also by the Tour company with whom we had booked our daily tours.
We had booked a superior room and I must say that in spite of the fact that the room was not carpeted it was certainly quite comfortable. The basic needs of a tourist was taken care off and a free Wi-Fi in the room was very useful. They have only one restaurant but the service is good and quality of food was good. Morning breakfasts were not lavish but were sumptuous.
The Spa was a real treat with a courteous and well trained staff though the rates in the hotel were on a fairly high side compared to the rates prevalent in Spa centres outside.
The hotel staff, each and everyone of them, from front office, room service to those in the restaurant made you feel welcome and an honoured guest.
The hotel does not have its on private beach but there is just a narrow breadth of road between the hotel and the beach that makes it convenient for all who want to enjoy the waves and the sunset.
There are a few drawbacks in the hotel. First, in the superior rooms there are no locker facility and you have to make use of their locker facility in the front office. However it did not create much problems. The other point is the long corridors through which one had to pass to reach our rooms. The weather was quite humid and walking down those corridors was extremely uncomfortable and one ended up sweating until one reached the comfort of the air conditioned room. I would be happy if the management addresses this problem by installing fans in the corridors to make things a little comfortable. All said and done we would love to go back again to this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
587,Great pool and lovely service,40,January 2015,"Pelangi had great service with adequate facilities and a ripper pool. The restaurant was slightly dearer then nearby places and the food average but the breakfasts provided were lovely with a slight variety everyday. The rooms were basic but the air con worked well and the beds were comfortable and clean. We got bottled water provided everyday and the staff were friendly and helpful.
The pool!!!! The pool was AMAZING; great size, swim up bar and suitable for all ages with a deep end and a shallow end.Towels were provided daily which was very handy. It had easy access to, and was overlooking the beach (without being hassled). The location was good being near la plancha and other beach cafes where you could enjoy a bintang relaxing in a beanbag. You could also get a great massage directly in front of the pool on the beach and hire surfboards if you wished. It's a pleasant walk along the beach to kuta or you can catch a taxi for $2-3. It was an easy place to meet people of all ages.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
588,"Nice hotel, really friendly staff, pleasantly surprised!",30,December 2014,"Just stayed here over Christmas with my mum and daughter. We decided to upgrade to the Super Deluxe Room and thank goodness we did. The Super Deluxe room had additional space with another dressing table and mirror (separate to the desk & TV) and plenty of room to move around in. The bathroom was big with a triangle shaped spa bath and big big shower in the same area. The basin area was also big.
I strongly recommend the Super Deluxe Room if you have 3 or more people in a room. Anything less and you will be crammed in.
I was a bit concerned reading previous reviews that the hotel was old and rundown. Whilst it looks like its been around a while, I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the hotel. The rooms and bathroom were great. Everything is really clean and tidy. The staff are fantastic and super friendly.
I had a massage and facial at the Spa Centre and again this was a really nice experience in a great environment. Recommend if you are willing to pay a bit extra for the environment versus a massage in one of the many cheap massage places where you will simply be 'behind a curtain'.
The pool was really nice with plenty of beds. We never couldn't get a bed. The breakfast buffet is nice, but basic. You can order eggs different ways (I didn't do this) and they rotate through options. So one day it might be pancakes, then banana cake, then french toast and back to pancakes. The have all the standard other stuff as well.
My other worry with a 7 year old was that there wouldn't be other children as again previous reviews had shown this not to be a family resort. Fortunately there were a couple of other children. However, I would say this resort is more couples and older couples. Its a smaller resort, so not really aimed at families, plus they don't have a kids club.
Our only sore point was getting Bali Belly from the buffet on NYE. Talking to other guests, this was a common occurrence post the NYE compulsory dinner. We looked at it as a weight loss strategy and it went fairly quickly.
The hotel also has free Wi-Fi throughout if you used your own devices. So you could use it around the pool, in the restaurant and rooms. The only time you pay is if you used their computer (which we never did).
Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel. It has a nice ambiance, its smaller and in a great location. It was really relaxing and the staff were great. I would stay here again. Recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
589,Friendly staff,50,July 2014,"Rooms are basic but are very clean. Staff are wonderful very friendly can't recommend this place enough will only stay there from now on. It is right on the beach,great pool, nice restaurant and close to shopping, but still in a very quiet area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
590,Not right on the beach but good pool,30,December 2014,"The first thing I would say about this hotel is its advertising photo is a sunbed on the beach. It is not on the beach nor do they actually provide sunbeds on the beach, if you want one you have to pay. It is extremely close to the beach, but there is a small road that runs between the resort and the beach. Never having been to Seminyak before we did not realise this until we arrived and were really disappo ted we were not on the Beach. Despite this disappointment and false advertising the pool is excellent, really big, deep at one end and just great, and there are a lot of sunbeds around. The pool area by the beach is a bit of a concrete jungle but it's just a bit ugly is all. The room and bathroom is good but a bit dated, the balcony is pretty much non existent and you don't get any view really from the rooms. The spa is really good, they had 50% off ( I guess this is probably running all the time) which made the prices good for what you get. The couples VIP room is amazing, well worth the money if your a couple. The wifi is ok but is an open network so have to be careful and finally some of the staff are really friendly. Breakfast was really good, good variety and all good quality food. Other food was ok. Easy to grab some thing for lunch and room service is good but it's quite expensive for the fairly basic quality of food. Our final criticism though would be the bar prices, the drinks are soo expensive and not amazing quality either. Considering there are beach bars on your door step which are cheaper, or cocktail bars with actually decent tasting and looking cocktails for a fraction more and supermarkets a 5mims walk away where you can get beers for less then have the price, I don't understand why they charge what they do. In the end we just filled our fridge up with stuff from the shop. Because of the prices as well, the bar and restaurant area was always dead, so there was no atmosphere there at all, which when we were here for Xmas was a shame and we just ended up going out all the time. The one time we did sit at a bar table to play some cards, because the balcony is so small you can't do it there, we were made to feel quite uncomfortable by a couple of staff for sitting there without buying anything. Overall a nice resort, just a shame about the beach and restaurant/bar.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
591,Nice hotel with a beautiful ocean view,40,December 2014,"This hotel exceded my expetations for the area. The rooms were nice and clean, the service and staff was very kind and helpful. The pool was lovely, and although there was not a beach to walk on, the beautiful grounds offered a spectacular viewing of the ocean. There were many outdoor things to do at this hotel such as bike riding and hiking and cultrual dances on the grounds were planned. The restaraunt and seafood BBQ were also a big hit with our family. The only downside were the bathrooms. They could use some updating and repairing. I would definitely stay here again however.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
592,Pelangi hotel,30,January 2015,"Best access to the beach, great pool and clean rooms. Service lets them down a bit as the staffs English isn't as good as other hotels we stayed at so very hard to communicate. The food is very average and breakfast was a real dissapointment, lacking in variety and the staff just stand around and happy to watch you refil your own tea and coffee. Also standard room doesn't have a safe which all rooms should have.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
593,Great location and hotel!,40,January 2015,"There is little to fault about this hotel. The location is perfect - you are meters from the beach front and beautiful bean bag restuarants, within walking distance (max 5 min) to mini marts and massage, always taxi's close by. If you enjoy walking, potato head and other restuarants in central seminyak are close.

The rooms are comfortable and all you need when staying in a location where you will not be in them much. The beds are comfortable, you have a little balcony and they are cleaned daily by friendly staff.

The pool is lovely and spacious with plenty of sun beds to lay on. The breakfast was great. I had read other reviews stating that there was limited variety - I am not sure what else you could ask for. They have: an egg station, american breakfast (bacon, tomatoes, potatos, sausages), noodles, rice, breads, cereals, jams, honeys, fruit, pancakes, juices and coffee/tea. The serving staff are fast and efficient.

Reception are also efficient (could be slightly more friendly) however, on the last day they provided us with storage space for our luggage, allowed us to shower in the spa suite as we had a late flight and also charged my phone for me in the back room.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. For the price that you pay, it is difficult to complain. You are not paying for a 5 star resort, so there should be no expectation to be staying in one. In saying that, the resort is kept in immaculate condition, there are cleaners everywhere and staff are happy to assist with anything. I would highly recommend staying here and would stay again if I were to return to Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
594,"Average hotel, will stay somewhere else next time",30,January 2015,"The hotel was average. Good location on the beach however rooms were very dark, dirty linen, bad views and did not feel inviting or comfortable. We had to ask for our sheets to be changed twice on one occasion due to stains. The staff were lovely however. Breakfast each morning was satisfactory.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
595,Awesome swimming pool,40,November 2014,"Enjoyed our 2 nights stay in this hotel, especially the swimming pool. Swimming located at the back of the hotel, next to open plan restaurant. Beach located straight behind the pool area and restaurant and there is an access to the beach. Beach itself is far less crowded compared to Kuta. You can learn surfing, there are several stall who offered surfing lesson, or just sit the under the umbrella and enjoy cold drink. There are many seat for rent there.
Room is not in a closed building, but in an open long corridor. Balcony open up to the well maintained back garden leading the way to the pool and beach. Room itself is not new but clean and comfortable. Our room located on the second floor and almost at the back, so it is quite close to the pool and beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
596,Good location and value,30,January 2015,"Seminyak is constantly increasing In price. This hotel is great value for money in regards to the location. On your door step is the beach, once on the beach 50 m on your left is La Plancha, a great place to drink cocktails at sunset. It is not too far from KU DE Ta and potato head. Walking distance to the shopping and restaurants you need, it shouldn't cost more than $5 to get anywhere in a cab around kuta, seminyak and legian. The rooms are a bit dated but do the job. The pool is awesome and has a swim up bar. Worth the stay",Pelangi Bali Hotel
597,Nope,20,December 2014,"To start with our rooms weren't ready on time.
Poor considering the hotel was reasonably empty.
Finally get our rooms and they are nothing like what our booking form said.
Asked for rooms as described and were told we would have to wait another couple of hours and be separated from our kids room.
Accepted what we were originally given to avoid this.
Rooms were comfortable enough although quite dated but this is an older hotel.
We were put at the street end of the hotel so nowhere near the beach or pool.
A strange layout since we had to go upstairs to go downstairs to our rooms.
Reception not overly helpful but ground and cleaning staff always friendly and smiling.
Breakfast was just ok with all the hot food being cold.
Cocktails at the swim up pool bar were nothing short of terrible.
Drank 1 soft drink and accidentally 1 water from the mini bar thinking it was one I'd bought. This came to $12aud. Price at the minimart around the corner for the same thing? 97 cents!
Beware the minibar",Pelangi Bali Hotel
598,Great Place to stay with kids and groups,50,May 2014,"had a fantastic time with my hubby,kids and parents, pool was fantastic, we stayed in superior rooms which was upstairs all close together very clean and everything worked well

599,Nice location,40,February 2014,"Good location
Infinity pool almost on the beach
Perfect for sunset cocktails (the pool that is)

600,"Nothing special, not awful.",30,January 2015,"The hotel is dated!

The photo's do it way too much justice! I have attached some of my own.

We did enjoy our stay however as there was nothing particularly wrong with the hotel and the price to stay is cheap.

The over 4 night stay free meal is not the normal restaurant meal, its a limited menu, 4 dishes not great, we didn't use it and ate out instead.

We asked to extend our room on the last day due to a late departure but was told the hotel was too busy and we couldn't even if we paid extra, but we could keep our luggage in a room and use the showers in the spa before leaving. This wasn't great but nothing could be done about it so fair enough. BUT some friends we had made during our stay were also leaving an hr before us and decided their luck in asking, only to be told YES they could have a room at an extra cost!!! Surprised at this response we asked at reception but the lady at reception was unsure and didn't speak great English, we would have to wait for the other lady to return. We were leaving that day and just decided to go by the pool and forget about it.

The roof terrace advertised was not open for the entire stay and considering there wasn't enough sun beds you would of thought they may of opened it for people to use?

Internet for us was great, I did read other comments that it was slow or didn't work, maybe we got lucky?

We requested an upstairs room which we got and i'm glad as we had a balcony, I recommend you ask for this and the only other floor below has an outside area that is part of the general walkway for the hotel and not private.

For any European travelers the hotel and area reminds me of the uk TV series Benidorm!!

For the rainy days (most days) we had massages/shopped or if we stayed in our room there was plenty of films to watch on the movie channel. Not sure what you would do in the rainy season with kids? not that i have them but the hotel didn't look like it catered for kids and rainy days??

Food, nothing special, breakfast nice enough buffet style.

The hotel provided umbrellas on rainy days which I thought was good.

Room service standard, ordered Pizza and wedges, good/standard.

All the staff very polite.

Pool area ok, lots of grey concrete by sun beds near beach, again a bit dated.

Location great, near lots of shops and restaurants

This hotel definitely isn't a bad hotel, people will always write negatives over the small positives. Our room was spacious and clean so can't fault that, we enjoyed it just don't expect the Ritz.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
601,Wonderful Stay. Highly Recommended!,50,January 2015,"I stayed with my boyfriend and another couple for five days. We have no complaints and everything was wonderful. Staff are friendly and helpful when you have requests. I had a massage at the spa and it was of a high quality. Room is clean, and has everything necessary. Location to the beach is handy for sunset cocktails. Thank you to the staff at Pelangi, would stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
602,Polite staff but outdated,30,January 2015,"Nice enough and clean but very expensive to eat and drink. Not enough poolside shade, you have to put your towels out at breakfast time.2 drinks at the bar cost us $20aus! Breakfast very good with a large selection.Dosent stock Bintang Radler (which is very nice with a lemon twist) so have to leave the hotel to get one. Good location on the beach with cheap restaurants outside on the beach. No safe in room. No balcony and long walks to get to pool and breakfast.Played the same music over and over again poolside!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
603,Good location but dated amenities,30,January 2015,"From the moment you walk in the lobby, you can tell it's a dated hotel that has had its glory days in the early 90s. Most of the staff are nice and helpful, but the reception desk sounds a bit annoyed answering questions we asked. The walks to the rooms are very long and they don't help you carry your luggage to the front desk and there is no elevator. The food is ok. The only good thing was that it is pretty much on the beach. Very average, but you get what you pay for. Will not come back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
604,First international experience,50,October 2014,"thank you to the staff my first time overseas with my seasoned traveller mum and they made our stay wonderful, felt safe and secure the rooms were clean and beautiful, planning on next trip back to Bali and won't even try stay anywhere else, our bell boy wayan was absolutely wonderful thank you, food was just amazing also",Pelangi Bali Hotel
605,"Good location, nice pool",40,October 2014,"Overall a great place to stay!
Pretty much right on the beach, beautiful pool with plenty of pool chairs to lounge in and nice views from the restaurant where they had a buffet breakfast every morning!

The room was clean enough though the washroom could use some updating.

Good location and easy walk to many shops and restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
606,Pretty Average.,30,December 2014,"This place is exactly what you pay for- it's cheap, but that's what you're getting.

Let's start with positives- rooms are quite spacious, most rooms have access to some sort of balcony/outside area. Beds are very comfortable, room service is reasonably priced, pool is pretty good but the view of the beach is majorly hindered by buildings in the way. Not enough sunbeds facing the pool- most are away from pool facing the beach. Some drinks on the menu, juices etc were good but for a basic Bintang at the front bar were 40K rupiah without tax (bit over priced). Outdoor walkway in centre of hotel was pretty, very green. Very close to double 6 area in Seminyak (restaurants like La Plancha, Capil beach, etc).

However: Negatives- room service is AWFUL, food was reaaaaalllly gross (also by the pool). Most staff weren't that friendly at the front desk, (though at the bell counter, cleaners, and other staff were much more friendly). No safes in basic rooms - Only at front desk. When asking for specific room requirements (ie interconnecting rooms) over 5 times they still failed to get this right. Though after complaining they moved us to interconnecting rooms for half our stay. Internet incredibly slow unless at odd times of day. Cannot get a normal taxi ordered to the front of hotel, have to walk down the street (can only get special cars which are 4x the price of normal cab, if not more). Showers are the bath/shower combined in the basic rooms (pet hate of mine). Hallways were really stuffy and very thin. Don't forget to put the do not disturb sign up, as they can come as early as 8am or even earlier to clean, knocking on your door continuously.

Overall. Average. Definitely not terrible but definitely wouldn't come back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
607,I would recommend Pelangi Hotel for accomodation.,40,December 2014,"The staff are delightful, nothing is too much trouble.
The breakfast every morning was fresh with heaps of variety to choose from
Our stay with Pelangi was amazing.
The pool area was clean and a bonus of a swim up bar. You could drink cocktails in the pool or even eat whilst relaxing on a bar stool in the water.
The rooms are serviced daily with clean towels.
The staff are more than happy to organise taxi if need be.
We used the free shuttle bus to go into Kuta which was great.
We also had free pickup from the airport which was another great saving.
Thank you Pelangi Hotel we will return.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
608,Amazing experience and pleasantly surprised,50,December 2014,"My husband and I booked our trip to Bali through a Groupon with a travel agency. The resort was chosen by the travel agency and if I was booking myself I probably would not have booked it based on some of the negative reviews I have read on here. I was a little hesitant but we gave it a shot because it was a good deal and it has always been my dream to come to Bali. I am so glad we stayed here and it just reminded me again to not believe everything you read on these review boards. With that being said, I am going to go ahead and tell you about the wonderful experience we had. I felt so strongly opposed to what some of the bad reviews said that I was compelled to put in another positive one.

From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and smiles and that continued throughout our stay. Everyone we passed greeted us and anytime we had a question, they did everything to help us and make our stay pleasant. While everyone was great, one employee went above and beyond and his name is Agus. We first met him at the swim up pool bar which was very convenient and relaxing in a beautiful atmosphere. He informed us of the other days he would be working during our stay and where he would be located (as they move around to different positions daily). He helped us out on a number of occasions and we are very grateful to him. The man at the concierge was helpful as well. We wanted transportation to the Pandawa Beach. He asked when we wanted to leave and we said ASAP. He responded that he could have a driver there in 2 minutes and he did! By the way, you can hire a private English-speaking driver for $50 for 5 hours (and $5/hour every hour after) who will take you anywhere on the island and wait at the locations.

Breakfast was the best I have ever had at a hotel. It was included and differed daily so there was always some new items along with the favorites (eggs, bacon, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit, breads, etc.). There was always some type of Asian cuisine and an omelette bar too. We did order room service a few times (late night) and had dinner at the hotel restaurant twice - the first night because we were exhausted from 3 flights and 2 layovers for a total of 41 hours of travel and the second time was because the dish my husband ordered was the best I ever tasted (sweet and sour chicken) and I had to order it myself for a meal. Beautiful view, attentive staff and good prices.

The pool was never crowded and we never had a problem finding a spot. The beach was just a 2 minute walk from our room and had many bars and restaurants with bean bags and lit umbrellas. While this isn't the cleanest beach I have been to, it was close, pleasant and had lots of seashells.

We got the basic superior room which served us just fine. We had a shower with great water pressure and lots of hot water (yes I still take scalding hot showers in Bali), the bed was comfortable, lots of closet space, outlets and lighting. TV with English stations, comfortable beds and free wifi in the room and on the balcony. Yes, the balcony was a bit small but we were able to put both chairs out there and sit outside comfortably. The air conditioning was great and everything was clean and updated. Again, I am not quite sure what people are referring to when they say this hotel needs updates.....but then again, some people complain about everything.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
609,"Doesn't feel like a 4star hotel, but very good value for money",30,December 2014,"Despite not really feeling like a 4 star hotel it's not a bad choice since we consider it to be very good value for the money. The hotel itself is wedged in a very narrow plot of land and this makes it feel like an endless corridor without much light and in my opinion this factor is what creates the feeling of it being less than spectacular. However, everything is very clean, properly maintained, the staff is very friendly. The rooms are also ok with more than enough space.

I have to mention that we arranged for an airport pick up which they failed to do, as well as an early check in which despite not being a complete miss they still had some trouble to accommodate.

We also tried the spa, which was acceptable.

I must stress, however, that despite having some problems, it really is an awesome value for money...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
610,Great value for money,40,December 2014,"We stayed here for three nights at the start of our holiday. The location is right on the beach and you can sit in the pool and see the ocean. The pool is not huge but adequate enough. They have a pool bar and plenty of sun lounges. The staff are wonderful here and very friendly. The buffet Breakfast is great and you get a great view onto the beach and coastline. We stayed in a room with an extra bed, and although the rooms are a little tired, we slept well. The hotel is a little on the worn in side but for what you pay its really no different to a ""luxury"" hotel down the road. I wouldn't stay here long as it's a little bit out of the action, but you can quite easily walk to legian and kuta via the beach. For the price I paid I would stay here again, especially if you only use your room to change, sleep and shower. A great stay! Thankyou pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
611,2 time stay and will be back,40,January 2014,"I went here twice and i loved it. Both time i stayed with my stepmum. Pool is good, room service could be better but it's ok. Staff are so nice and polite.
Seminyak shopping is close, there are few good bars down the street, drag queen shows etc. so much fun. I will go back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
612,Paying for paradise,50,November 2014,"Expensive small rooms, that are modern and well upholstered. Air conditioned for the bali heat and located right next to the beach is convenient. Breakfast, drinks and food is great although a little over priced for bali. Overall this is perfect for the middle to upper class with some money to spend. The pool is great and so is the service.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
613,Affordable hotel in good location,40,December 2014,"I recently stayed at Pelangi with my mum and three sisters and we loved it! It was our first time in Bali, and we wanted somewhere that was affordable, in a good location, and had a swim up bar and Pelangi ticked all the boxes. On arrival we were blown away with friendly staff and a man playing a xylophone-like instrument in the foyer!
We booked two twin rooms, with an extra bed in one, and found they were brilliant, and the air con was great. The only minor downside was the beds were a little hard, and the TV's were old and had no English channels - but who comes to Bali to watch TV in bed!
We had dinner at the restaurant a couple of nights and found it had something to suit everyone and reasonable servings.
The free breakfast was very impressive - with cooked and continental buffets, as well as an area where you could request a fresh omelette or poached eggs.
The pool was great, swim up bar was ok, but a little pricey.
I would strongly recommend Pelangi Hotel and enjoyed my stay there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
614,neither good or bad,30,November 2014,We stayed for 1 week. The staff are really friendly but the hotelnis not for a family with toddler. We have a 15 month old son and our room was on ground level. The hotel has no elevator so we had to constantly carry the pram up and down the stairs.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
615,Old hotel need repair,20,November 2014,"We staying in this place the location is good,but really the food is bad,the bedroom is fine but old. The sheets are old the toilet and the fan is very noisy as well the fridge .

I won't back to this place is really old fashion

The only good thing is the location but Seminyak beaches are dirty and horrible .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
616,Peace & quiet in Seminyak.,40,November 2014,"My husband & I were recently in Bali for my girlfriends 40th, as they were staying up the road in the Bali Breezes, I wanted to find somewhere local to that but as we had no kids we wanted somewhere we could just relax that was not over populated. I found the Pelangi on Booking.com & although the reviews were mixed I thought we'd give it a try. We stayed for 7 days in a deluxe room (50+ sq's) that overlooked the pool & restaurant & straight onto the beach. It is an older hotel but adequate, our room was quite large & had a little lounge area. Beds were quite comfy & the bathroom water pressure was great although could prob stand a regrouting. The service was great too - swim up bar and a good poolside menu. As stated in other reviews, the pool lounges got snapped up quickly so our ritual was to pick a seat at breakfast & reserve it for the day. The pool itself was lovely & never overcrowded. As we were there in November (hot, hot, hot!) we loved the fact that the Airconditioning worked well & was left on after room service cleaned the room. The food we ordered from room service was very good & delivered quickly, and although we didn't eat in the restaurant in the evenings the breakfast was very good - crispy bacon & eggs made to order, though I would have liked to see some hashbrowns at breakfast at least once! The only problem that I had was that somehow these little red ants kept finding their way into our coffee cups & kettle so had to keep spraying them & not leave any dirty cups around, & I just shoved a few tissues under the lid of the kettle to stop them getting into the leftover water so we didn't have to keep throwing it out. When I booked the room I requested a 6pm checkout (an extra $90) because our departure flight was at 11.20pm, this was confirmed but when we arrived we were told that they couldn't do it because they were fully booked, but after sending an annoyed email to booking.com that first night, I was pleased to receive a note from Ketut (yes Ketut!) that our late checkout would be ok. That being said Wifi was great & complimentary in all areas & overall we had a lovely stay. I would recommend & stay again if just me & hubby as I don't think they had any family rooms or villas but I would recommend the deluxe rooms or bigger as the standard rooms seemed quite small with tiny one man balconies, & especially due to the proximity of the Bali Spa around the corner where I indulged EVERYDAY in sumptuous massages & treatments for exemplary prices.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
617,Recommend,50,October 2014,Good for the price you pay and amazing beach front location. Is a little bit out if the way but we had a scooter so it was fine! Would recommend doing that. We loved how close it was to the beach. Only downside was that bintangs from the pool bar were way too expensive!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
618,Best area for Hotel,50,October 2014,"Pelangi Hotel (Pelangi means Rainbow) is situated right on the beach with lots to do and see including massage ladies, restaurants and the usual trinkets for sale. Just along from the Hotel there are several restaurants also facing the beach. At night the little restaurants/bars always have a great atmosphere with a band on the waters edge and bean bags on the sand under brollies and colourful lights. Jalandhar Double Six is just around the corner and is quite a peaceful street to shop. We love this area and will always stay there. The staff are also lovely and like all Balinese people very friendly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
619,"Lift your game, Pelangi",20,November 2014,"Is in need of a serious ""revamp"". For the price of places you can get near by or on Air B'nB The Pelangi needs to much more shmick. Check your bills we were over charged over $100. Staff are nice but only do bare minimum. Spa is crap! Massages all the same and $$ for what you can get at other places near by Annora Villas, Spa Bali, Vitamin, dont waste your $. Resturant food is also awful and $. Stick to the Indo food, or pizza/club sandwhich as a stretch. Seemed to have a fair few ""schoolie"" esque people staying as well. Gave it a more ""Kuta Vibe"".",Pelangi Bali Hotel
620,In need of repair,30,November 2014,"I agree with the bulk of the comments raised here re Pelangi. The hotel is in much need of a renovation given its prices are equal to ""resort-style"" living down the road in Kuta/Legian. The rooms on the web site look nothing like what you actually get and there are no safes in the rooms (only at the front desk) apart from this (like always) the staff were fantastic and really made the place bearable. Dont fall over at the pool as there is bugger all people there that can help you and the first aid kit consists of a packet of band-aids and Mecurachrome. The food - breakfast was good an ample (the bacon is a mystery) but the eggs where brilliant. Didn't eat dinner there - its Bali why would you? - The rooms were small and well cooled but the general appeal of the building looked run down - or from dg3225's post ""beaten up"" by drunk aussie's so you do get what you pay for.

Dont pay $18 for a booked cab from the hotel as the cabbie gets this money in a month minus the hotel's cut. Grab a cab 25m up the road and it will cost you a lot less. Use Blue Bird Group only - as they use meters everytime or if you use the others make sure you ask if the meter is operating - if they state its broken, get out and try another.

General notes on Bali - expect everything to be about shopping, this was our third trip and UBUD is basically turning into a shopping mecca so dont expect ""old world"" Bali up there any more. Ulluwatu was our choice this time, drier than other places but nice. Nusa Dua - what a made over joke. If there was any place in Bali that looked fake this was it - everything lush and geen and with a $$$ attached.

For all those that go please remeber that they are 4 million people in Bali (excluding the Javanese) and no social security. So they have to make their money the best way they can. The pushy sales may become tiresome - but they are just doing their job and trying to make a living. Don't accept the ""you may win an iPad etc.."" from the guys giving out card in the markets this will see you at some sales conference for time share and these guys get quite narky when you dont accept their card - I use the statement ""no thanks boss, dont need a new condo have 3 already"" they see the joke and generally laugh, but they are friendlier than if you say no.

From what I understand it appears that the Indonesian government is opening up Bali to overseas workers and HUGE investment from overseas - so this is probalby our last trip as we dont expect the same kind of service that we always receive from the Balinese. Any Bali salespeople that may be reading this - most of us DON'T want/need Viagra, Ciallis or Valium while on a morning walk at 6:30am.

Eating out - 3 words ""Lucky Day - Seminyak"" - prices are good, quality and quantity is brilliant- staff are great - tell the big guy on the door ""Ramone"" sent you. T-Shirts go see Riski or James right next door to Lucky Day.. Little shop but you can browse in peace as he is the only one there. And he is a scream.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
621,Photoshopped!!,30,September 2014,"Please be aware the photos of Pelangi Hotel have been extensively photo-shopped. There is a large building right in front of the Hotel that blocks over 50% of the view. Looks nothing like the photos in real life. VERY DISHONEST. All the rooms shown are executive suites also. Normal suites are old, small and uncomfortable. The service was good but the Hotel as a whole was massivley over priced.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
622,Back to the Future...Renovation Needed,30,November 2014,"I finished up business at the Grand Hyatt and booked a couple of final days in Bali at the Pelangi. I know the neighborhood and on the map the location was perfect. The hotel, as you can see on the Google Map, is a very long couple of buildings stretching to the very busy and beautiful beach front. The hotel itself is just plain in need of renovation and updating. It is hard for me to understand why the owners/property manager do not bring the hotel up to decent modern standards and do more maintenance. Possibly they are letting the property run down for tear-down and rebuild as I see major new properties under construction in the area. See the pictures and you can kind of see it. But up close and there the grounds are overgrown, fountains and statues etc all over-run or broken. Lighting is broken, wires exposed and cracks all throughout the facility. At night there was a problem at 2AM with a gang of drunk guys making huge noise, banging doors and walls and screaming. I called the desk, he said he was afraid to confront and quite frankly, I don't think the sole security guard wanted to as well. So this went on for two plus hours. At first I thought the hotel was under attack as it is completely open to the ocean without any real security as proved that night; I felt quite irritated and realized how exposed the hotel is as all doors front the open hallways. I am telling you, there is no security as this property. Meanwhile, the food was less than mediocre, the included breakfast was exactly what you expect when it is considered ""free"". You can get breakfast and meals right on the beach for much less and better quality. The rooms are missing plugs, they are very subject to noise. The AC was good, but again old. The toilet ran at night and the place just felt dreary and old. The balcony is large, some hard chairs to sit in with an ok view of the ocean for many. Service was ok, some nice some who did not care. They are freaks about the towels at the pool, get ready to sign your life away. The pool is nice, cool and clean. But it is old and the area needs repair, wear something on your feet for sure. This hotel has location and the price is not unreasonable. But the ambiance and the lack of care for the property really detracts from the overall experience. Bring ear plugs. I rented a scooter from the taxi service for about $6 bucks a day, that was really good. I bought ice at the Circle K, don't expect any from the hotel. I paid $18 for a hotel taxi which really was good, the price of fuel is rising fast in this country. Enough. You get what you pay for and less. Still, it is ok for what it is.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
623,Great Holiday..Thank you Pelangi,40,November 2014,"The Pelangi was a great place to stay. We had a great time! The rooms were very clean. Our room (204) had a very small balcony but we managed to fit an armchair and single chair out there...just! More than necessary for the amount of of time we spent out there which was minimal. We had an ""incident"" ..a nearby stall owner hurled an iphone 5 box at me because I wouldn't pay $70 for a USB lead. Needless to say the incident was pretty revolting. I reported the incident to the Pelangi Manger who bent over backwards to ensure that the responsible stall person was held accountable. This was my 3rd time in Bali, and nothing like this has ever happened to me before. It was very reassuring to have this kind of support. Breakfast was great (Bali bacon is a bit of a mystery...) but who cares when you have fresh fruit and juices and everything else in abundance! Nights on the beach in beanbags is glorious..especially watching the sun set. Air con was magnificent! Just wish they had a lift...Hated those 12 and then 9 steps up to my room each night (I should be fitter...and maybe have 1 less Bi-tang!).
Overalll...A GREAT place to stay! Would definitely go back. Well done Pelangi...you care about your guests! Thank you. x",Pelangi Bali Hotel
624,Nice,30,June 2014,"We booked a standard room, it was ok, but too small for us, were a messy couple. And the balcony was tiny, as in, you couldn't sit down. So moved to a deluxe, I think it was. Much bigger, ground floor, few metres from the pool for about $20 extra! Perfectly comfy. Staff lovely and very helpful. Buffet style breakfasts were great, a good choice for everyone. Nice pool, but in a lot of shade most of the day. Seminyak beach with all it has to offer, a few steps away. Very busy area, if you like that kind of thing or want to learn to surf.. Gentle waves out the front. That particular part of Seminyak is frequented by quite a lot of the gay community. Absolutely no bother to us, but if you're homophobic, it may be. Altogether, probably a great, not too expensive hotel for families. Close to everything and very nice ambience!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
625,Great Hotel,40,October 2014,"We stayed at the Pelangi for 10 days in Oct 14 and found it clean, comfortable and really good value. The hotel is in a great location right on the beach in Seminyak with just a footpath to cross. We travelled as a family and had two adjoining rooms on the ground floor which were spacious, clean and comfy. Like most hotels in Bali some of the decor is a bit dated but really who cares as long as it is clean! The staff were lovely and the pool was great. Breakfast is in the restaurant which has a patio overlooking the pool and beach. The breakfast was a buffet - plenty of choices, if I am honest not the best buffet breakfast I've ever had but certainly good enough and nothing to complain about. Lunches and drinks in the hotel seemed reasonably priced and there are loads of little cafes out the front and along the beach. Loads of restaurants are within an easy walk and you can walk into Seminyak shops pretty easily. This was our second trip to Bali and first time in the Pelangi and I'd happily return. Great value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
626,Perfect location,40,November 2014,"The hotel is in a great location with access to the beach. It was lovely to sit and have breakfast and watch the sea. The pool was stunning and right outside the hotel you could sit on bean bags and listen to live music and order food and drinks from the bars lining the beach, then stroll back to your room. It was bliss. The rooms were spacious and clean, very comfortable. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly, used our names when talking with us. I would definitely go back to the Pelangi again and recommend to all.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
627,Great hotel in a perfect location,40,November 2014,"I stayed at the Pelangi with a friend for 5 nights a couple of weeks ago and we were really pleased with our stay. The hotel is in a brilliant location between Legian and Seminyak and right on the beach. Being able to walk out onto the beach during the day and evening was brilliant. The beach was filled with small restaurants that offered sun lounges during the day, which were replaced with beanbags at night. We loved ending the day with a couple of drinks on a beanbag listening to the live music and looking at the ocean. It was perfect. Our rooms were on the second floor (there are only two). The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The rooms were a little bit tired but were lovely nonetheless. I didn't experience any major problems with noise, although the people underneath me had put all of their chairs outside and did tend to congregate there. Breakfast was perfectly adequate. There weren't as many choices as the bigger choices, but all of the usual stuff. Pool area was great with plenty of lounges. The staff were really lovely and helpful. We had a great stay and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and would definitely stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
628,Very poor,20,October 2014,"Reception staff were useless. Rooms were very dirty. Not cleaned properly
Property has no General Manager. This is a poorly run hotel without any leadership. When you ask for a taxi the staff just point you to go outside and find one. The only taxis are on a main road 200 metres away.
Pool is good and breakfast good but everything else is very very poor. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone",Pelangi Bali Hotel
629,Great location if you love the beach,40,October 2014,I booked this hotel for our 7 night stay based on the location to the beach which was directly across the lane way . The pool was a good size & sun beds were plentiful &'availability good. The superior room is basic but was adequate for the two of us as we were out & about for much of the day & evening. The breakfast was included & was the usual style of breakfast offered with a variety of hot & cold food. There weren't any safes in the rooms however the safety deposit boxes at reception worked well to store valuables. The shops were a short walk away & the hotel provided transport into Kuta however you had to arrange your own transport back. The bean bag restaurants of a night time were a colourful addition & cheap food could be bought. The staff were very friendly & helpful which made for a lovely relaxing time. I would definetly return for another visit.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
630,Definitely worth staying at this beachfront resort.,50,October 2014,"Hotel still has the Bali vibe which hasn't been lost like a lot of newer resorts. Location is great right on the beach where there is restaurants, bars and massages. Go for dinner and sit on a beanbag as watch the sun set. Pool and swim up bar is very good and service throughout the hotel was great. Would definitely stay again when we go back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
631,Close to the beach,40,October 2014,"I stayed here for 2 nights last week. It was the perfect spot for me, right on the beach behind the bean bag restaurants. I could spend everyday of my life in that spot. The most chilled out place with great atmosphere. The hotel rooms are spacious, and feel like the 'old' bali before the big fancy westernised hotels muzzled their way in. The Pool is great, with a little swim up bar, it is true what other reviews have said the pool bar staff do take a long time to make a drink and serve the next customer. But seriously if you are in that much of a hurry for a drink, you need to relax.
Rooms on the bottom floor are noisy so bring your earplugs or ask for a room on the top floor if you would prefer quiet and don't want to hear conversations from other rooms or people walking past.
You can walk to anywhere from here, or just grab a taxi for 20 000Rp when you have walked enough. I'd stay again based on convenience, away from the bogans of Legian/kuta, price, free breakfast and wifi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
632,Great value stay in seminyak,40,October 2014,"Ok the hotel rooms are a little dated, but this place is spot-on for value. Rooms are clean and any problems fixed immediately. Location is tops, walk into the sea for a dip or lie beside the lovely pool with bar. Always seemed to have sun beds available with a great view of the surf and beach. Surfing lessons just beside the hotel make fun viewing! Walk out front or back of hotel and spoilt for choice of places to eat.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
633,This hotel was great and the staff very friendly,50,October 2014,The swim up bar was great and the staff were happy to make drinks and order food in which I couldn't fault and room service was quick. They have a free shuttle into Kuta and and is walking distance to shops. The beach is just outside the hotel along with plenty of places to go for a bite to eat if you want. I did have I minor problem with the toilet but the staff were very quick to fix the problem. I will be staying there again on my next trip to Bali.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
634,Unexpected quality and location,40,October 2014,"We booked this trip as a quick business trip and for a little R'n'R. Our travel agent made the suggestion and arrangements. We didn't really mind if we were staying on the beach, but now that we have we will never go back. The atmosphere of beach front, beach restaurants and sunset drinks in a bean bag was heaven.

We were on the first floor (room 225), the stairs weren't a problem to us as you only use these to walk to the pool and restaurant. The room was clean and the size of the balcony wasn't an issue for us as we chose to relax on the beach rather than our room. Air conditioning was awesome, no plumbing issues and well, we would recommend this property to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak.

Staff were always friendly, breakfast fabulous and all in all, a great choice to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
635,Great location and staff,40,October 2014,"Had 3 nights at Pelangi, staff was very friendly and helpful, hotel has a fabulous location right on the beach and only a short walk to main shopping strip. Pool area is great. Breakfast was plentiful. Great to be so close to several options each afternoon for sunset drinks and tea if you didn't want to eat in restaurant. Room décor is a bit tired but very clean and overall a great place to stay with a great price tag for its location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
636,great place to stay,50,September 2014,stayed here on first arriving in bali. great place five minute walk to shopping area. walk out onto beach from back of hotel. good food and good variety for western food lovers. stayed three nights and the hotel was quite and peaceful at night. security is very good. staff very helpful. would stay here again. this place is very central to everything. transport is two minutes walk away. food places on the beach very close with good food.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
637,Fantastic stay,40,October 2014,"Just returned from an 8 night stay at the Pelangi on Seminyak Beach. We asked for a ground floor room (booked superior) as we had read the balconies are very small (only one chair fits). The ground floor was great as you could bring your chairs out of the room and have them outside to have evening cocktails or even just hang wet simmers/towels over.
The pool is great. Shallow end is seperated from the main pool to keep kids safe and the swim up pool bar was lovely and just so relaxing to sit with a drink in the evening watching the sunset come down. We never had a problem getting a sunbed and there are plenty of umbrellas for shade. Plus toilets and showers after a swim.
Wifi throughout hotel was fine, rooms serviced daily very well (I am fussy)
Breakfast was fine, egg station was really good and juices, fruit and croissants available. We did order room service once and also had a club sandwich by the pool - these meals were average. But you don't need to eat in your hotel room when there are restaurants right outside on the beach. Plus they have a free shuttle to Kuta every 2 hours which is a great saving.
Moments walk to Cocoon Bar and Chez Gado Gado. Restaurants/bars on the beach all good for snacky food and drinks.
We also received a free 60 minute massage as we got this with our package booked direct with the hotel and the massage was amazing - best ones we had.
Totally loved our trip and will definitely be back. Loved the Balinese feel of this hotel, not a modern chain resort that feels sterile - totally has character.
Coupled as a couple.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
638,Good traditional bali style hotel,40,October 2014,"Have spent past 9 days here, booked well in advance & paid a good price of $85 per night. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are a good size, but the bathrooms are older style and could do with some updating. The food in the restaurant does leave a bit to be desired, we had breakfast included & the hot food was very rarely hot, the cook to order egg station was good though & I used that mostly. Pool & pool bar area are very good and used well...great location for the area, close to everything. I would come back here again as I do prefer a more traditional hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
639,Great Value Hotel!,40,October 2014,We arrived later than expected to Pelangi Hotel and were greeted by very friendly staff. During the booking process we said we may want to upgrade so upon arrival the staff offered for the two of us to be shown both rooms to make our decision. We ended up staying with original Superior room as we did not see much advantage for us staying in the Deluxe room. The hotel is situated right on the beach and only a short walk to shops and restaurants. The pool was amazing overlooking the beach and the staff were extremely friendly making it a wonderful experience to stay here. Will highly recommend!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
640,A definite sense of home at the Pelangi,40,October 2014,"I had a great experience at the Pelangi! The staff here are beyond helpful and accommodating. After a day or two, they knew me by name which I felt was amazing considering the plethora of guests staying at the hotel! Unfortunately I was sick for two days whilst staying there however the staff went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable (this included ordering doctors visits, and even checking in on me). It is also worth mentioning that after visiting an Apotek/Clinic and leaving my mobile phone there, one staff member drove there, picked it up and delivered it back to my room - free of charge.
A lot of reviews mention the lack of privacy on the ground floor - for me this was not an issue and provided as sense of homeliness.
The pool here is fantastic and suited to all (very kid friendly) and the location is amazing - just a short walk up the road to the Bintang Supermarket and the main strip of shops, and literally on the beach.
I have two minor negatives: the food here is slightly overpriced in my opinion for what it is and the room I stayed in had very little natural light.
Nevertheless, I stayed in three places in Seminyak and this was a definite favourite - I would recommend the Pelangi to the younger traveler as this felt like a bit of a 'party' hotel with guests taking full advantage of the swim-up bar! (not necessarily a negative).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
641,Lovely Hotel,50,September 2014,"I stayed at this Hotel for two nights in September; it was the first Hotel that my Mom and I checked into at the beginning of our Holiday in Bali, after a long 20 hours of travelling from South Africa we were ready to just relax. It was absolutely lovely, the staff were super friendly, the reception was welcoming and our check-in went very smoothly. The room was clean and spacious for the two of us. Wi-Fi wasn't too great throughout the Hotel but that wasn't a problem for us, we were still able to get hold of our loved ones to let them know that we arrived safely.

I am sad to say that I only made use of the swimming pool on the one night after a long day out exploring because their swimming pool was amazing.

The Hotel is located away from the shops and busy area, but not so far that you can't walk there in the evenings or during the day. We never felt unsafe. It is located right on the beach front, which we only really discovered on the second night. If you stay there you just have to go sit and watch a sunset and experience the bean bags all along the beach.

I loved staying in Seminyak and would definitely return to Pelangi Bali if I were to travel to Bali again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
642,Reality meets illusion,40,September 2014,"Am already recommending the hotel. Room on the ground floor, would get top floor next time, just easier with luggage when leaving. Room was neat, clean & airconditioned - ne issues. Pool & breakfast area just as pictured. Could get a sun lounge by the beach front to watch the world go by..watch tourists learn to surf, hawkers working their trade, people walking by...nice change to just looking at hotel area. Good view from any of the sun lounges, always somewhere in the shade for us. Breakfast more than enough to keep us going all day & nice to watch the early morning beach scene. Walking distance to restaurants & shops either through beach front or hotel front. Staff friendly, fellow guests relaxed, common opinion was Pelangi was truly relaxing.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
643,Think twice before paying for what isnt worth it!!,20,September 2014,"My partner and I stayed at the Pelangi 5 days, and it wasnt worth for $120 per night for a superior room, i would pay for those type of rooms up to $70 as there was mosquitos, the toilet was blocked couple of times, there was issues with the plumbing which we had to notify reception to get it fix, the bed is so uncomfortable, they had the same breakfast menu 4 days in the row.

Transportation if you are new to Bali, you better off catching a taxi at the airport as Pelangi would rip you off if they send a tax driver to pick you up which you be paying to them $35 US. The taxi would only cost you from the airport $15 US to Pelangi .

The location is perfect if you want to be near the beach either than that there wasnt anything good about it. People are very friendly and you can't swim in seminyak as the water is too raft, it would be recommendable to stay in Noosa Dua.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
644,Great location,40,September 2014,Comfortable and friendly. We have stayed at the Pelangi a few times and have always been happy with it. Perfectly located with lots of food and bar options nearby. Lovely to walk to Kuta along the beach.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
645,Very good service,40,September 2014,"We spent 4 nights at the hotel, clearly the location is wonderful.
The service is very good, the breakfast decent the rooms are clean.
Overall the hotel looks a bit tired specially in the evening it seems sleepy.
The beach is a stone throw and is wonderful with nice bars.
The wifi is not very good.
Overall we had a very good stay at this property.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
646,2012 holiday,40,October 2013,"The Pelangi Hotel at Seminyak is a very nice hotel, just walk onto sandy beach out of the rear of the hotel, rooms are clean and spacious serviced daily, friendly staff, a good buffet breakfast which I can recommend, Seminyak is close to all Bali attractions only a Taxi ride or you can walk the beach path to Kuta. Trips to all Bali attractions can be organized from the Hotel with pick up and drop off at the Hotel foyer. The perfect stray to unwind or enjoy the wonderful sights of Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
647,A Disappointing Experience,20,September 2014,"We have stayed at the Pelangi 5 times. We are a family of 5. 3 teenage adults and 2 parents. Each time we stay we book 2 rooms (we have stayed in all the room combinations). The rooms are reasonably priced (well I considered this to be the case in the past). This time we decided to book a superior deluxe room the difference between the deluxe and superior delux is a total waste of money (don't go beyond the deluxe). The room is only bigger because of the spa bath and 3 of the 4 are downstairs (on the major path to the beach and pool. Noisey and no privacy). Sitting in the out door area of the downstairs rooms you have no privacy at all, in fact you could almost pass a drink to your neighbours or anyone heading to the beach or pool without getting out of you chair. My perception is that the hotel is begining to deteriorate,  in our superior delux room we only had one bedside table the fridge was noisy and the aircon average at best, the sheets and towels whilst clean are overdue for replacement. Wifi was very poor and the hotel is just looking a bit tired.  On the upside the staff are as pleasant as ever and the rooms are clean.
     The location of the resort clearly hasn't changed but the area has deteriorated markedly in the last 12 months. A large warrung has been built out the front of the hotel obscuring 25% of the beach view. It looks like Kuta has finally arrived on the outskirts of Seminyak with the Drunken untidy Aussies marching along the road out the front (which is now busy). The beach is awash with bean bags and wanky bars. South of the hotel and you might as well be in Kuta, north of the hotel and the beach remains largely untouched.
     Many may find my review a little picky and I would understand why, however, our experience of the Pelangi this year is a total contrast to last year or any othe other 4 preceeding stays. The change probably mostly to do with the tiredness of the hotel and the change in the area. With the new emerging short term Villa availability I now cosider the Pelangi only average value and would suggest there is much better value accommodation available. The hotel is becoming a bit like The Bounty Hotel (for those that are familiar with the Kuta Icon).
     Its further north or to the islands for us next time too many white wankers not enough good old fashioned Bali fun. But if you want a great fun cheap drinking holiday on the beach and dont care where you are in the world the Pelangi would work, try and get a deal as the full rate is over the top. Or look for a Villa.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
648,Great Start,40,September 2014,"This was our first stay on Bali and the staff are super friendly. Nicely situated to shops and beach, especially to the ""restaurants with the bean bags on the beach"" the room was average but adequate. Breakfast was average. I would stay here again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
649,value for money with beach front,40,September 2014,"This is our second time at Pelangi seminyak. A long skinny hotel with absolute beach front location. Great pool and the obligatory swim up pool bar with views out to sea - just lovely
It's an older hotel which shows its age in places with the smaller rooms etc. But the trade off is the lower price combined with the awesome beach location and access to all the hip restaurants and bars. We opted for the larger deluxe room which just gave us that extra room to move & we weren't sorry. Wouldn't go back to the standard room.
The staff are very friendly, happy and helpful.
Highlights of our stay-
Eating well :
12 course degustation at Menjakawi at Ke de Ta - just fantastic.
Potato head for lunch. Big fat juicy burger.
Cheaper but still great :
La Plancha - little tapas shack right on the beach almost directly in front of the pelangi (just to the left). Phenomenal food. Puts all the other little eat shacks to shame.
Lucky Day - Sports bar arrangement with delicious good portioned food
Not so good :
The sausage meals at The Bush Telegraph - what are they thinking? Just awful.
Smoking - arrggh it's just everywhere. Funnily enough, not an issue at ku de ta or potato head.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
650,Great Location,50,September 2014,"We usually stay at Legian so this is our first time we have stayed at Seminyak. Our choice to stay at the Pelangi was for 2 reasons, the location and the great value for money. Although this is an older style resort, it made no difference to the comfort and size of the room. We chose a larger room which was more like a small unit. The staff were more than helpful and could not do enough to help with anything you require. The bell hop staff were the most amazing, especially Wayan and Dex, they always greeted us with a huge smile and were extremely cheerful every time they greeted us. My wife and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly to all who are looking for a great resort in a fantastic location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
651,best 1st experience,50,October 2013,"As this was my 1st time traveling to bali, i couldnt of ask for a better stay!
every problem we had was quickly resolved (just bedding issues). the staff were very helpful and always remembered your name and asked how your day was!.
they were such a pleasure, as never travel to bali before, i was unsure about certin things, and the staff helped and assisted with my questions.
the room was very clean and the daily room cleaning was perfect!, toilet paper, and towels were replaced daily as well as new bottle of water in the room.

The breakfast was quite average, if you didnt get there with in the 1st hour or so all the good items were etiher gone, or had to cold and hard.
the egg station was great!, always remembered your order from the day before!.

over all it was a pleasure and i have now rebooked back to bali, as this was a great pleasure of a experience!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
652,Nice hotel & right on the beach,40,September 2014,"Older style of hotel, but good service, friendly staff and everything you need just around the corner or on the beach within couple metres.
And all of this in the heart of Seminyak.
Highly recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
653,Amazing Location,40,September 2014,"My sister and I just spent 8 nights at the Pelangi. At first I was a little disappointed by the room ""balcony"" is very very small. But by the first day I was more than happy. We transferred to a ground floor room which was much better. LOCATION of this hotel is unbelievable. I had a list of places I wanted to go and everything was within easy walking distance.
The pool was sensational with a view of the beach. The food was great. Not the best Bali breakfast I've had but the staff were great and it was everything we needed.
Staff were a little slow if we wanted to order food and drinks by the pool so we had to go up and order.
Would I stay here again? Absolutely. Very very good value for money and it was quiet as well considering the location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
654,Not what we expected for Bali on the beach,30,September 2014,"decent size room with a balcony that faces your neighbor across the small alleyway. Toilet didn't work, had to call several times. The beach area is just ok. Safe during daytime but seedy after sunset. Dangerous with so much motorcycle traffic speeding by 2 inches from you. The bar is typical for Asia..they can make some very common drinks but dont expect a good martini or even a good bloody mary. We wouldnt try this area again. Far too much traffic that encroaches on your personal space. Breakfast is pretty good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
655,"Pelangi Hotel & Spa, Seminyak",40,August 2014,"Great family holiday on the beach. Recommend for families or individuals who that love the beach, surfing, eating out, great restaurants near buy, great shopping etc. This is an older style hotel but it's rating reflects it's clean and comfortable rooms, good service and hospitality.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
656,Excellent Location with Great Staff,40,August 2014,"I visit Bali twice a year, one being a boys trip ( to put it in context we are mixed from mid 20's to 50's) and the other with my wife. This time was the boys trip with a mates 50th and the second time we have stayed here.

The hotel is right on the beach and centrally in the extremely popular Seminyak area. It does not have the large grassed, palm tree pool area some people maybe looking for with a smaller paved beachfront area facing the beach.

However the beach is straight out the front and is home to 6 to 7 little bars which are very popular for drinks and a light meal and is the main spot to be when the sun is setting sitting in a bean bag with a drink in hand. One of the must dos when in Bali. The water can be very strong but if you are a good swimmer it is one of the best places to swim along the stretch from Kuta to Seminyak.

The staff as always are very very friendly with some remembering us from our last trip in 2011. The rooms are typical of this style and age of hotel in Bali. Not luxurious but spacious and very clean. Breakfast was good with a good choice and always easy to find a seat which was a requirement wi 9 guys sitting together.

The location provides excellent access to restaurants, bars and shops without having to look for a taxi.

Summary, excellent location, very friendly staff and very good value for money and we will be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
657,Beachfront relaxation,40,May 2014,"I had a great stay here with my family in May 2014. Unfortunate our stay was just for 2 nights but we made a good choice with Pelangi. It's on the beach and right in the heart of Seminyak. The restaurant where they serve breakfast overlooks the beach.

Didnt get to use the pool and poolside bar but it looked quite inviting.

Overall great experience. Would definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
658,Great Location next to the ocean!,40,August 2014,"Pelangi is a rather nice hotel, clean and spacious enough! we had a deluxe room and it was quite big with all the facilities! positives: great pool, great location, nice beach bars just in front of the hotel, nice staff! negatives: the balcony was seeing in the corridor which lead to the pool so we did not have privacy i would prefer a room in the 1st floor! expensive and mediocre spa!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
659,Disappointed,20,August 2014,"Good location . The rooms are clean but very dated, especially the bathrooms. Disappointed that the Roof Top area is not used anymore (perhaps the photos should be removed fro the web site). The breakfast was the poorest we have ever had as the food was cold ., Will not stay here again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
660,"Great Place, Great Staff.",40,August 2014,"We were looking for somewhere to go for my partners 50th birthday and a few friends said that that would join us on the trip. We looked at another place but our friends thought that it was out of their price range ad decided to stay at the Pelangi as they had enjoyed it on previous occasions. So we opted to join them at the Pelangi. Upon arrival we were greeted, with what we now know as true Balinese hospitality, the bell boy unloaded suit luggage from the car and showed us to reception and checked us in. We were shown to our room a super Deluxe suit. The room was spacious and very clean, and the air conditioner worked a charm and the room was very cool. If you can request a room ask for one close to the pool, and restaurant. Our friends had superior rooms which were small but comfortable but room size really isn't an issue if your on the ground floor as you can sit out in the well groomed garden just outside your door. The upstair rooms have a small balcony with only room for one person. But then again your on holiday and you wouldn't travel all that way to sit in your room. Most of the day was spent travelling and seeing the sights, but make sure you get a good driver, we used Subadi Nyoman - Bali Private Day Tours see my review, or sitting by the pool. The pool lounges fill quickly and people get up early and claim the best ""Real Estate"" and then go back to their rooms. There is singe that says ""unattended towels will be removed after 1 hours"" yes ""hours"", but we didn't see this happen but if you watched and obviously nobody was using it it was a problem if you took it. The staff at the Pelangi were all lovely and it wasn't long and they were all calling us by name. The Pelangi has beach frontage and several beach Restaurants close by on the beach. The days that we were't sight seeing we had lunch and dinner at one of these. Be careful when stepping out onto the path/road as it used by people on scooters, and there is there ever present beach hawker trying to seek you another watch, belt, pair of sunnies, or even a massage, but leave you well alone once in the resort. In all the Pelangi was a great place, it's clean and tidy, although a little tired, but if you look past this and enjoy the people and culture you'll have a great time. Oh and the staff are truly beautiful and grateful and will look after your requests without fuss. They even put cake in the fridge for my partners birthday and put a floral arrangement on the bed to mark the occasion.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
661,Very good hotel,40,September 2014,"Everything was really nice.
Clean rooms and towels, very good service and friendly stuff all the time. Also the breakfast buffet was good and delicious.
The spa is very relaxing and they do really good.
The hotel is almost at the beach (1min). Over there is a nice restaurant where you can get a nice lunch with a beautiful view for less money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
662,Beautiful staff great location,50,August 2014,Amazing experience the staff went out of their way for any of our needs.. greay value right on the beach will be staying again and recommending to friends. Amazing buffet breakfast selection which changed daily and beautiful sunset views.. we just left and already cant wait to go back,Pelangi Bali Hotel
663,"Top location, will stay again!",40,July 2014,"This was my 2nd time to Bali when we stayed at the Pelangi in Seminyak. Previously we stayed in Seminyak on our first trip but the location of the place we stayed was no where near as good.

We really enjoyed the Pelangi and will stay again. The location is amaizing, you can be sitting by the pool and watching the beach. A few steps away (literally) is the beach. In the day you walk up and down the beach, plenty of funky places to get coffee and really yummy food. Night time gets even better on the beach, bean bags, live music, cheap food and alcohol, lanterns, fire works..etc. we loved it so much we went to the beach every night!

The breakfast at the Palangi is really good, all you can eat!
The pool is really clean and beautiful. Staff are very friendly and nice. Food and cocktails by the pool is perfect.
Rooms are good, obviously not 5 star but hubby and I were happy with them.

Day spa is good. Gym is average with most machines not working, but we still used it and were happy to have a space to work out and played music via our phones and wifi!

Overall, I enjoyed me stay and would stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
664,Holiday in bali,40,July 2014,"It was our 30 th wedding anniversary ,we had a great time and nothing was a problem, great staff and friendly ,couldn't fault anything , if you needed anything in your room Thay where there straight away, we will go back again ,thanks very much to you all at pelangi Anna and John",Pelangi Bali Hotel
665,"2nd. time, and we will be back!!!",50,August 2014,"Oh, what isn't there to like about the Pelangi? The staff are all amazing, and even remembered us from last year. They all go out of their way to help you with anything you might need.
The rooms are large and comfortable and cleaned well each day. We like the deluxe rooms but the superior rooms are good as well.
The buffet breakfast is perfect, if you complain about that, you must be very fussy. It's better than last year, and I thought it was great then too.
They have everything you could possibly want, from egg station, to cereals, fruits, hot dishes, bacon and sausages, toast, bread, croissants, and Danish pastries, and must not forget the pancakes.
The pool is outstanding, and lounges are plentiful, some overlooking the beach.
Just outside, there are plenty of warungs, such as Bali Juice Park, which is my favourite, and have a few Bintangs with Daywa or Froggy in the afternoon. Too much to mention, but this hotel is in a prime position for relaxation, entertainment, beach, restaurants and shopping...and amazing sunsets!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
666,Nice place to stay,30,August 2014,"Friendly Staff, clean rooms, nice pool area, best breakfast I have had in a Bali hotel. Only negatives were toilets were an issue, standard rooms were a little small but easily bearable, Pool bar opened way too late.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
667,It all about Location,40,August 2014,"it was first time to Bali and i Traveled with my mummy and they made sure we had a bed each and didn't share one as my mum a snores. They were a full house with a wedding party/family guests. Not sure what to expect but the hotel is good and always keep clean which is a great thing. the pool is great. The one Bone i have to Pick is the Sunbeds around the Pool. if you go out for the afternoon its only Far the you FREE UP THE SEAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE STOP BEING SO SELFISH. I love the choice of Breakfast it was great. the in-house menu for dinner and room service was not that great but with the choice you have out on the beach why would you eat in the hotel for main meals.
the swim up bar is good it get stocked up everyday and the Prices are cheap to for in-house. my mum and i wanted a massage but did want it on the beach so we had one in the hotel and the girls were so great made the massage relaxing and enjoyable. A big cheers to the girls in the in-house Spa loved the time and effort.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
668,Brilliant location,50,August 2014,"Have stayed here a few times,great location if you love the beach .
Lots of quaint restaurants along the beach ,and awesome view of sunset.
Hotel is clean ,rooms are large,staff very good .
Downside not enough pool chairs ,and lots of steps to reception.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
669,"clean, tidy but access to hotel facilities limited",30,August 2014,"Great location, had a super deluxe room which was spacious, clean and comfortable. Great access to the beach especially for 'sundowners'. The hotel despite its beachfront location did not take advantage of this - there is a Sunset Terrace on top of the restaurant which would be prime sunset viewing cocktails and snacks, we were very disappointed when told by hotel staff we could only access this if we booked a private function. Also the restaurant offered a very pedestrian menu for lunch and dinner. Overall there was poor access to the sun lounges around the pool and those facing the beach front. There are not enough for all guests, and also there were some guests who would 'save' them from day to day - we had to hire on the beach as there was very little option. On the whole the hotel staff were helpful and friendly",Pelangi Bali Hotel
670,Beautiful motel on the Beach,40,August 2014,"Stayed here for 3 nights in a superior room which was lovely and quiet and conveniently located between reception and pool.
Motel is idealy situated on the beach and not far from restaurants and shopping.
Pool was beautiful and spent most our days here looking out at the fabulous views of the beach and watching the locals as they went about their day.
Breakfast was nice and service was great.
Pool chairs were in short supply and although there is a sign saying unattended towels will be removed after an hour - nobody seems to care and most chairs have been reserved from early morning without anyone is sight for hours.
Don't miss sunset on the beach when the beach chairs are replace with bean bags and you can sit back and enjoy the music and views and the staff will bring the drinks to you!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
671,Breathtaking,50,June 2014,Bigger and more impressive than we imagined on our first inpression. The best hotel I've stayed at for sure! The service was second to none. There were only two slight negatives: it was quite windy at the resort and the beach wasn't world class. Other than that the whole stay was absolutely amazing.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
672,Clean tidy hotel,40,August 2014,"We stayed at Pelangi with friends, we where booked into a superior room, be warned there is no balcony other than to stand on and smoke, we where lucky with our room as was light and airy but friends room was't, really close to other building so not that light. Location is great, short walk to supermarket and right on the beach, this section of beach comes alive at night with beanbags for you to sit on and watch the sunset. Lovely. You have to pay 100,000 (10NZD) if you want a sun lounger on the beach for 2 hours. There are free sun loungers around the pool but they get full really quickly, so if you are out they are tight on space, it's a shame that hotel doesn't have more considering the size of hotel. Really nice pool area, bar in pool etc. Breakfast food was great, didn't eat at the hotel other than our breakfast. Overall good value for money. Surfing lessons available on beach from hotel, well recommended guy was very good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
673,"Location, Location, Location",50,July 2014,"Our first time in Bali, and won't the last. The Pelangi was a lovely hotel, a little bit dated, but still a lovely place to stay. The staff were wonderful so friendly and accommodating. Breakfast every morning, pool, swim up bar and the beach on it's doorstep, what else do you want. Different Warung's all the way down the beach, so you can pull up a bean bag, staff take your order of drinks and food if you want. (All so very cheap...) Everything is 3 mins away from the hotel, shopping, spa treatments and transport. The hotel also has a little booking desk for booking your tours, they were excellent, just leave it all to the hotel, pickup - tour - drop off. We would definitely return to the Pelangi Spa Hotel, hopefully very soon.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
674,"Wonderful location, need an upgrade but still comfortable",40,July 2014,"This is our second stay at the Pelangi. We were there Aug 2013 and returned in July 2014.

Of course we like the hotel hence we came back and I will tell you what is good about it.

Location.
Right in the heart of Seminyak beach...its ""almost"" beach facing. A tiny little lane separates it from having beach access but that is basically fine. You can lie of one of the numerous sun beds by the pool and stare at the ocean or just go out and hire one of the sun beds on the beach or like me, a beach towel will do.

Its a short walk to double six road where there are numerous shops and restaurants. In fact, you don't have to venture far outside the hotel to find lots of bars and restaurants serving food right on the beach itself.

Location is probably the biggest draw for me.

Rooms
Rooms are decent for the price but the hotel does look a tad jaded. Don't expect the best looking rooms. There really isn't anything wrong about them. The beds are comfortable...so are the pillows. The bathroom is decent with the usual amenities. House cleaning comes daily to change so no issues there.

Breakfast/Food
I believe most booking options come with breakfast which is ample. There is an egg station where you can get your eggs cook anyway you want. Selection of all you can eat local and international spreads - sausages, hash browns, noodles, fried rice. You can get cereals and fruits for a healthier option.

Spa
There is a decent spa where the price is of course more expensive then among the hundreds of spas outside but the spa in Pelangi is definitely cleaner and of decent quality. I had a 1 hour Bali massage for around US$25.

Other events
its a small hotel so there really isn't much in terms of activities but I reckon most are there to enjoy the location ie beach and the rest of Bali rather than staying put. There is a Bali Traditional Dance and Dinner event every Monday which is actually quite well put on.

If I ever want to go back to Seminyak I would consider Pelangi again for the location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
675,Comfortable accomodation and great location,40,July 2014,"Have just returned from this hotel. Older building but placed right onto the beach. You can lie on sunbeds and either swim in the pool or have a two minute amble to the beach to swim in the ocean.
Comfortable bed and clean linen daily. Breakfast was plentiful and did not alter much daily but worth it.
The desk staff and room staff were very friendly and obliging. Nice gardens surrounding the hotel rooms made it relaxing.
Easy walk or cheap taxi ride to restaurants in surrounding area and about a five minute walk past restaurants and stalls to the main shopping street.
Bars and restuarants on the beach front for night life. We found the warungs and food places cheaper on the roads leading away from the beach.
Good wi-fi coverage and there is a safety box room beside the front desk, not in the room. (We thought this may prove inconvenient, though it was not a problem)
Safe to walk around this area at night and beach bars on the beach outside the hotel. Lots of live music and cheap food.
Overall a lovely stay and I would return.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
676,nice stay at Pelangi,40,July 2014,"The Pelangi is what i would call a typical balinese style hotel that were built in during the boom in tourists to bali in the late 80's and into the 2000's. This hotel is now looking like quite and old lady but is still very good value for money considering it is located right on the beach in Seminyak. It is one of the cheapest beachfront hotels in seminyak, which makes it very appealing. Whilst lacking some of the modern conveniences of the newer hotels it has everything that you need to enjoy a holiday in this part of bali. It is close to shopping, very good restaurants, and is on the beach. The rooms are clean, the aircon worked well and the staff are very nice and friendly. the breakfast for us was simple but adequate. the balcony was very small however and not conjusive to sitting outside as one chair basically filled the little space. I would definately stay here again but for those who like ultra modern hotels with the latest and greatest in decor this hotel probably isnt for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
677,Good location and friendly staff,50,July 2014,"Stayed here with husband in July for a week. The welcome drink and cool towel on arrival were much appreciated after a long flight and customs delays! Our room was spacious with a spa bath and a very comfortable bed. The hotel is in a great location, opposite the beach and there are excellent restaurants walking distance away. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The pool layout caters for young children and adults. As the surf over the road was too strong while we were there, it was good to have the alternative option of the beachside pool. Breakfast choices were very good with wide variety of hot and cold dishes and the service was excellent. Would recommend this hotel to couples and families.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
678,Another great stay!!!,50,July 2014,"I've stayed at Pelangi 4 times over the last 6 years. I love the location and the friendly staff. It's great to still see some of the same faces from 6 years ago. Good surfing opportunities (for beginners) out the front of the hotel. A perfect walking distance between Kuta and Seminyak. Great hotel for couples, singles and friends.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
679,Excellent hotel in a good location,50,August 2014,"My husband and I stayed here recently for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

We were greeted at reception with a welcome drink and although our room wasn't ready (we were a little early) we made full use of the facilities until it was.

Nice rooms with lots of amenities and reasonably priced mini bar. Made to feel very welcome by all hotel staff. Drinks were a good price in all bars with good cocktail selection.

Breakfast was very good - fresh fruit, pancakes, yogurt, cereal, bread, pastry, cooked items e.g. Bacon, sausage, egg station and Indonesian rice and noodles! Plenty of choice!!

Excellent bar in the evening that plays love music if you come out by the pool and turn right, it's called taris!

30 min walk to Kuta if you want more night life along the strip, with brands such as McDonalds, Starbucks, Hardrock Cafe and even Pizza Hut and express! We didn't like it though, too busy!

Rooms were nice, good service, well priced! Highly recommended",Pelangi Bali Hotel
680,Excellent loacation but be careful when booking,40,September 2013,"stayed at Pelangi last year and going again in October which speaks for itself. Location is great being right on beach and not a long walk to decent restaurants and shopping. Just be careful when booking - went through Booking.com thinking I was locking in aud pricing only to find out it was only indicative rate. The rate they use to quote the indicative price won't even get close to what you will get charged on your Mastercard so do yourself a favour and don't use that website. Tried to cancel my booking after immediately realising the ""rip off rate"" only to find there was a cancellation fee involved (basically 5 minutes after booking). My own fault for not checking the detail when booking, so will live with that, but at least I can warn others about the website. Will enjoy stay at Pelangi again no doubt but with a bit of a sour taste in mouth.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
681,very very good,50,July 2014,lovely hotel very very friendly staff who help with everything! rooms nice and clean. hotel is basicaly on the beach and close to legian for heaps of shopping plus good shopping in seminyak. very good breakfast perfect hotel,Pelangi Bali Hotel
682,Pelangi Bali Hotel,40,July 2014,"We travelled to Bali with our 3 kids and their partners/husband all aged in their 20s. They actually chose the hotel because of its location to the beach. The rooms were dated but spacious and clean, although ours smelled musty. There was no safe in the room but they had safety deposit boxes at reception. The shower was in the bath which I dont like but the pressure was good. Breakfast was basic but after a while thats all you want anyway. The breakfast area was overlooking the beach and by the pool. The pool was great with a swim up bar, the water was a great temperature to cool off and overlooked the beach as well and they had lounges around the pool or overlooking the beach but the beach lounges were generally full by about 10am. You could go to the beach right out the front of the hotel and they had lounges to lie on during the day and at night these were exchanged for bean bags with little tables under bali umbrellas and fairy lights. What a great place to watch the sunset. We would go from there down the road to have dinner if we didnt eat on the beach. The first couple of nights it was very quiet and boring but it did get busier towards the end of our stay. The worst part was the traffic, it took about 45mins taxi ride to get into Kuta and 20mins by taxi to get to Seminyak Square. Kuta is good for shopping and Seminyak Square is very popular at night for dinner. Overall we enjoyed our stay but I think you have to make a choice of beach, shopping or upmarket Seminyak square when you pick where to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
683,good accommodation right on the beach,40,July 2014,while this hotel is nothing glamorous is has a pool spa and restaurant so what more do you want? its clean. and to top it off its right on the beach. the towel sign in/out policy seems a bit odd but make people move on when finished with benches by the pool. avoid the restaurant for meals other than breakfast.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
684,Great location run down rooms,40,July 2014,Fantastic location right on the beach and very close to go into the heart of Seminyak or go into Kuta. The pool was great with a swim up bar although if you want a bed to lay on you have to get in early. The breakfast was pretty good had all the main things you could want. The staff were really nice and always asked how you were etc. pretty good value for money although could probably find better with a more modern room and if you are of age or have some form of disability the shower is in the bath and may be difficult for some to get into. It also seems to get water all over the bathroom so that could be an issue too. No safe in your room could be a problem for some although they have a deposit box at reception.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
685,"Perfect, friendly start to our Balinese Holiday",50,July 2014,"The hotel made us extremely welcome from the off. We arrived quite late in the evening but was greeted with a warm welcome and cocktails on arrival. Room was large, although a bit dated, but did not bother us (a couple in our early-mid 20s) Breakfast was very nice everyday. All staff were very friendly throughout our 5 days there. Perfect location for drinks and food on seminyak beach. Hotel would be perfect hotel with a bit of TLC",Pelangi Bali Hotel
686,Pelangi on the beach,30,July 2014,"My husband and I stayed 5 nights here and enjoyed the Balinese style rooms and beach location. It was lovely on the beach at night as the bars set up bean bag lounges to watch the sunset or stay on for candlelit drinks . There were cafés on the beach if you didn't want to go out. It was a short walk into Main Street for more restaurants or a short taxi ride into the 'posh end"" of Seminyak with its upmarket bars and restaurants. There was a lovely big pool but the area around it was a bit of a concrete jungle. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was okay. The place had lots of potential.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
687,"Pelangi was, well...perfect",40,July 2014,"We'd stay again. And we will. The service provided by the entire staff was of a high standard. The morning breakfast was spot-on, with the backdrop of the beach as an added bonus. The estate is central to most things , with a free (one way) shuttle to Kuta daily.

As a small aside, the TV provided in the room could be updated -- but, hey, holiday rooms are to sleep in.

But the pool/spa more than makes up for any shortcomings. THe pool, with its swim up bar was great.

Overall, a great place. The staff, ever friendly, were always happy to chat and advise, with a genuine interest in how your time in Bali was going.

Two thumbs up from me.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
688,Perfect location,40,May 2014,"A very nice place right on the beach. Service was very good and people were lovely. If you want a nice, quiet place, this is the one. The pool are is wonderful and had a great time at the swimming bar. The only thing I don't recommend is the restaurant but there are plenty of other good places around where u can have great meals.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
689,One night stay,40,July 2014,"We stayed at Pelangi for one night in a super deluxe room. We were happy with the room; it was clean, very big and spacious and had everything we needed. We had requested one double bed and ended up with two single beds pushed together which was a little disappointing. The bathroom was also big and clean, and had a spa bath / Jacuzzi which was lovely. The breakfast had a good range and the dining area was right next to the pool with views of the beach. We did not spend much time here as we arrived late at night and checked out the next morning to go to another hotel, but overall we were happy with our stay and the service of the staff. However I think it was over priced compared to similar / nicer resorts in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
690,Perfect beachfront escape,50,July 2014,"My partner and I had a fantastic first stay at Pelangi. It's not a new resort but the rooms are clean and the staff attentive and helpful. Highlights were the day spa, pool bar and (almost) beachfront location. Great views of the waves crashing from the resort restaurant and it's a stone's throw from the restaurants and bars along Seminyak Beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
691,Second time just as good as first,50,June 2014,Have nothing but good to say about this place. Yes its not brand new but that doesnt detract for me. Picked up from the airport and driven to the hotel. Rooms nice and tidy and air con worked a treat. Wifi was also pretty good. Awesome pool with swim up bar. Breakfast was great with lots of variety. The egg station was magic ! Loads of places nearby to eat and drink and the free shuttle can take you into the madness of Kuta if you need. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming. Was our second trip to Pelangi and we will be back again November 2015 for the wifes 30th and will be bringing a group with us.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
692,Return visit didn't disappoint. A gem in Seminyak,50,June 2014,"This is our second visit to the Pelangi and it once again was great. Staff are awesome and can't do enough for you. We loved the complimentary room for shower after our check out due to late flight. Rooms are comfy, good aircon and as we requested rooms up near pool on ground floor, we were very happy. The location next to the beach and eateries is a big plus and this visit we took our daughters for their first visit to Bali and they have both said they would stay there again. Well done Pelangi. It is true value for money and we have stayed all over Asia.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
693,Nice location spacious rooms,40,March 2014,"My Partner and I (me 29 him 32) stayed here for 5 nights at the end of our trip in Bali.

We had booked the deluxe room, it was very spacious, nice to have our own little table and chair set outside to sit at at our room.
The bed was nice and comfortable, the major downside was the toilet in our room leaked. We are pretty sure it was the Bidet function on the toilet which was causing the leak, but it would flood nearly half the bathroom in a day. We reported this to the staff at least 4 different times to multiple different staff over our stay, and eventually gave up as no one seemed to care. instead we went through a lot of towels, hand towels and bath mats as we placed these on the floor to help stem the flow of water all over the floor.

Breakfast at this hotel was very nice, highly enjoyed we had lunch once which was lovely and ordered room service once which was hot, prompt and lovely.

We found the food and drink at the hotel was a bit expensive, however we did find a nice shop just up the road where we could buy our own drinks and keep them in our fridge.

A map in the room showing some of the surrounds would have been nice, especially for first timers who were not sure where anything was.

The pool was just magnificent. Only holiday resort I have been to which has a proper deep end in it's pool which was over 6"" so you could actually swim, as we were having stunning weather, with clear blue skis and hot the pool can get quite warm, nothing can be done about this and it is still refreshing considering how hot it was, the beach directly opposite the pool was fairly clean and I was happy to have a bit of a dip in it.

Highly recommend taking a walk down the beach in the evening and getting a drink and a bite to eat at one of the bars on the beach, we picked which ones we liked based on the shape and colours of the laterns in the evening and were never disapointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
694,Old but good value for money,40,June 2014,"I arrived on a Friday evening for a 2 night relaxation after doing some lectures in Denpasar and the first thing that hit me when I arrived were the Australian voices in the lobby, after spending 3 days with Balinese people. There was also a huge TV in the lobby with people watching an AFL game which horrified me. The corridors were pretty dank but the room was nice and clean but not luxurious, but for the cost, who cares!. THe shower's power was the best I have ever had, even at home!
One thing that was very disappointing is that as my back was hurting after arriving on the Friday night, I booked a massage at the hotel spa. It looks quite old and tired, like the hotel but needed it. THe massage rooms with the windows open overlook a blank wall for privacy and water with fish, which was quite relaxing and lovely. However, the open windows were directly under the lobby and, my whole massage was full of noise of the people watching their AFL.
The breakfast was lovely, with a restaurant overlooking the beach. The staff were friendly and always said hello, even if you passed them 3 times. THe hotel looks like it would have been the height of luxury when it was built, however, it has not had upkeep done to keep it looking modernised. Having said that, the pool looked lovely, the view from the restaurant was lovely and the staff were lovely and, it is not a very far walk into Seiminyak. I would definitely stay again. I met some people when I was there who all come every June and meet up. Some have been coming to this hotel for 15 years, so it certainly has something going for it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
695,Very enjoyable,40,June 2014,"My daughter and I have just stayed here for 5 days. Quite comfortable, clean and relaxed. Handy to Seminyak, and great having the beach so close. Staff were very helpful and I received a cake on my birthday. I would recommend this hotel for its smaller more personalised care. Thankyou.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
696,Stay at the Pelangi,50,June 2014,"My stay at the Pelangi was defiantly one to remember, the staff were incredible and so welcoming. Everything was so clean and neat - the morning buffet was also very amazing.
Would highly recommend to anyone going to Bali to stay at the Pelangi.
Beautiful employees who were so happy to help with any needs that you had.
Also the spa/beauty was very lovely and wonderful pricing.
Will defiantly return!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
697,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,10,June 2014,"I'm writing this from my hotel room! We have only been here for literally a couple of hours and with the Poor/very little wifi we are managing to get, we are DESPERATELY looking for a new hotel to stay in. Dirty, old rooms, horrible lay out, restaurant and pool (although we have not used either yet) look very lousy. What a poor excuse for a 4 and a half star hotel, I'd give it a 2 at most. Very upset and disappointed, wish we could get our money back :( DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
698,Still good,50,May 2014,"We have stayed at Pelangi twice now. Enjoyed our stay both times. Great accommodation at reasonable price. Friendly staff and very caring. Food is always nice, breakfast included in price is buffet with good selection. Nice to relax by the pool or grab a drink at poolside bar. Great location on the beach, not far from shopping. Will be back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
699,Get me outta here!,30,May 2014,"I had just come from heaven at Ayung Spa in Ubud - green tranquility. I did not expect Seminyak to be so unpleasant. I heard it was busy and crowded, but damn! Maybe if we had a nice hotel to come back to I cd have enjoyed it more.
The hotel was indeed 2 1/2 to 3 stars. It's old and needed sprucing up. Paint was peeling from the ceiling and onto the stairs. The handle on the shower came off, the sink surround looked like it was stained. The room originally had 2 twin beds. The headboards remained in the same place while the beds were pushed together. There was no night table or lamp on one side. The internet was slow to non-exsistent. The ""view"" was of an alleyway looking at the room on the other side. Can you say ""back to Ubud""? We left the next day, back to Ayung and heaven!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
700,Finally Reached Nirvana @ Pelangi Bali Hotel,50,May 2014,"After 10 days in Indonesia and touring extensively, we finally arrived at the Pelangi Bali Hotel for 3 nights of total relaxation! Here we were on the Indian Ocean in a beautiful hotel and loved every minute of it! We were in beautiful, serene Seminyak on a white sandy beach and a roaring ocean! Everything seemed to be perfect, especially our breakfast by the rolling waves, followed by a 2 hour Balinese massage! The swimming pool was huge and refreshing. The hotel restaurant was so great that we ate breakfast, lunch and dinner there. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our guest room was very clean and comfortable with a private balcony. There was a narrow alley between the hotel and the beach with many, many places to eat and a fun atmosphere on the beach at sunset. We had finally reached Nirvana! A perfect ending to a long trip. We were so happy that we were able to spend a few days here. We had NO complaints and highly recommend this hotel (we are very picky travel agents!).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
701,Friendly service in an ideal setting,50,June 2014,"The first thing guests will be aware of when entering the hotel is the warmth of the reception. Throughout our stay everyone, from front desk, to cleaners and waiters, smiled warmly and greeted us whenever they saw us.
Not just friendliness but competence, too. A minor maintenance problem was reported by phone. The technician arrived ninety seconds later and the job was done in five minutes.

The rooms (we had the cheapest of the options) are simple and functional. The beds more comfortable than in many more expensive hotels I've stayed in, the A/C quiet and efficient and the hot water plentiful and with excellent pressure. The one amenity lacking was an in-room safe, forcing us to use a very-secure looking room and safes in reception. More expensive rooms have them.

The public areas are showing their age but we noted the exceptional efforts made to keep them clean (and mozzie-free). Indeed, cleaning everywhere was of a high standard. It was typical of the staff that my leaving a tip for the room-cleaners led to a charming ""thank-you"" note being left on the bed. A ""first"" in my experience.

We ate breakfast and lunch with a view of the Indian Ocean breakers pounding the beach. We found breakfast particularly enjoyable.

The swimming-pool was also well-maintained with plenty of sun-beds.

In Bali, you pay a high price for a beach-front property. Pelangi is cheaper than many such hotels. Its public areas are not the most alluring but the total experience of the stay, particularly the staff (the most charming I've encountered in fifty years of travel) makes it good value.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
702,Stay May 2014,10,May 2014,"Lousy hotel. Lousy service. We booked 2 twin rooms and got a room with a queen size bed and a rollaway bed. When we asked about twin beds, we were told to pay extra for an upgrade. This was a confirmed booking. Shabby property. The manager offered us complimentary dinner to make up for not honoring our confirmed booking, and then took back the offer. Do NOT stay in this property.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
703,Unsatisfied and Unexpected Experience,30,May 2014,"My wife and I stayed at Pelangi Bali Hotel for three days and two nights, May 19 - 21, 2014. We were planning to enjoy our 2nd honeymoon in Bali. As the main travel organizer, I decided to pick this hotel since my wife wanted for us to stay in Seminyak this time (we stayed in Tanjung Benoa before). Long story short, we found Pelangi Bali Hotel was a bad choice, since it did not meet our expectations. First reason, mainly due to its poor service attitudes. As a local tourists, my wife and I certainly did not want to receive a ""2nd class treatment"" from our fellow Indonesians hotel staff, even though we know that we're going to stay in Bali, where lots of tourists from overseas came to enjoy the beauty of this island. As far as I remember, this hotel is still resides in Bali, one of the many islands in Indonesia, so the staff should recognize that they get their business license and permit from Indonesian government, not a western government. We sensed that the hotel staff did not treat us as well as they treat other foreign guests. Compared to our previous experience staying in one of Tanjung Benoa hotels, the service we received from Pelangi Bali Hotel was very poor. Second reason, the interior (design and color of the room and hotel surroundings) was quite tacky and seemed too old-fashioned. The color of the walls in its halls was too dull and muddy, which can drop your moods when you got back to the hotel to get some rest after spending a day outside, in addition to a lack of light at night as well, which is not really convenient. Now, it's time to give good compliments after telling the things we didn't like about this hotel. Two good things that we like were, first, the beautiful view facing the ocean in its restaurant, so every morning we enjoyed the scenery from the restaurant while having our breakfast. Second, the breakfast itself. The menu selection and quality of the breakfast was fine for us. OK, that would be all, I certainly will not recommend this hotel to my friends and family, and we will not get back to this hotel in the future. However, we hope Pelangi Bali Hotel can improve its services in the future, most importantly to its fellow Indonesian guests, because we certainly deserve our best after spending our money to stay in this hotel. Thank you for reading, hope this review helps.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
704,We will be back,50,April 2014,"Ended up staying for 2 weeks instead of one.. The staff, the room, the restaurant, the pool, the view... We had such a wonderful time. Nothing was too much trouble. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends and family. It is not a 5 start resort - nor does it claim to be, but why would you want to stay in a resort that could be located anywhere in the world. There was never an issue with sun lounges being available, though alot of our down time was spent at the swim up bar. Just beautiful. Can't wait to go back. We have found a new 'home away from home'.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
705,"Fantastic place to stay, right on the beach with great pool and amenities.",50,May 2014,"Second time here, just love the location, friendly feel and accomodating staff. Clean and tidy rooms and great buffet breakfast. Good value for money. It is a very short roll out of bed to the beach and cheap massages on the beach for a few dollars for great 1 hour treat. Cold beers. Very quiet location, but also close to all the action at night for dinner, bars and shopping. The staff really go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome. Will keep coming back here whenever we come back to Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
706,Pelangi Bali Hotel - Nothing but fantastic!,50,May 2014,"Staff fantastic, rooms spacious and clean, shuttle service wonderful, great breakfast. Fantastic location on Double six beach with great restaurant options. Our family loved our holiday, will definitely stay at the Pelangi again if we go back to Bali.
Some of the reviews on this hotel left us a bit sceptical, but we are so happy that we decided to stay here.
If we had any issues (very few), they were immediately taken care of. Staff greeted us always with a friendly smile. A birthday cake was delivered to our room for my husbands birthday, a lovely little surprise. Would highly recommend for families and or couples, we were not disappointed...Thanks Pelangi for helping make our holiday one to remember!!.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
707,"Great location, clean, good value, friendly staff.",40,May 2014,"We stayed 7 nights in May 2014. We booked a super deluxe room as we were staying as a family of four (2 adults, 3 year old and 1 year old) and didn't want to be too cramped. The only hiccup with the room is that the extra bed was not in the room when we arrived, but it was brought it immediately and the staff were very apologetic. Could not fault the service.

The room type was actually larger than expected. We had a king bed, a single and a cot in the room (along with the small couch and chair etc.) and still had room to move, we didn't feel cramped at all. There was a reasonable amount of storage space appropriate for the room normally being for 2 people. Some drawers or cupboards in the bathroom would have been handy, as would some hooks or wash line to hang up wet bathers etc.

The room was well supplied, neat and clean. Air con worked well and the room was quite dark which is great for the climate. I found the bed quite hard and a bit uncomfortable but my husband (who usually hates hotel beds) didn't complain about it. The couch/chair in the room were practical I guess but not comfortable.

We had requested a room close to the pool/restaurant and couldn't have got any closer. The only downside to the room is that being on the ground floor if you want the curtains open you have no privacy.

The restaurant was decent enough. Breakfast was supplied and had a good mix of local and american type offerings. No issues there. We had lunch regularly delivered to the pool area and room service a few times as well. No additional charges for room service. Food was delivered promptly. Huge variety of food on menu, something to cater for mosts tastes. Food average overall but not bad.

Staff were all very friendly and great with the kids. The hotel doesn't seem to be marketed as a family friendly one, and our children were among only a few we saw. In saying that, the pool has a shallow end (80cm) which is separated by a wall in the pool to stop them going into the deep section. High chairs were available in the restaurant as well.

The pool was great, nice temperature, enough lounges, pool bar as well. It wasn't peak time when we went but it was never too crowded at the pool.

We used the spa/beauty for 3 books (two for me, one for my husband). The treatments were quite good and although apparently1 expensive for Bali (we didn't go elsewhere to compare) very cheap compared to similar treatments back home. In one of my bookings the therapist was on her phone (texting I assume, I could hear the clicks) and finished 20 minutes early on a 2 hour treatment. As the manager wasn't there when I left I complained the next morning, which was just before we were due to the depart. The manager dealt with it professionally, she was very embarrassed and apologetic about what happened and immediately offered me a 1 hour free massage, eventually convincing me to have a 30 minute massage as I was running very low on time. I was more than happy with how the situation was dealt with. And the 30 minute massage I got was fantastic!

Location was great, opposite the beach ( very narrow road separating hotel and beach which was used by pedestrians and bikes). I didn't like the beach area, was a bit dirty. Waves were huge (not surfable) and I didn't venture into the water. Most nights we ate at the bean bag restaurants on the beach, watching the sunset and enjoying cheap meals. You get a bit hassles by the sales people but they weren't too bad. It was only a few minutes walking to the boutiques in Seminyak and lots of the normal cheap shops too.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Pelangi again but if I had a bigger budget I'd look at other options too.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
708,Great place to stay,50,May 2014,"The Pelangi Hotel is a beautiful place to stay, friendly staff helpful when when wanting to book tours. The pool has access for people with disabilities. Rooms are cleaned everyday with a touch of love. Bottled water everyday. Friendly place for families. Just one thing would be good, on Friday nights a group called Ebon need new speakers to sound perfect when singing.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
709,Great Hotel............,40,May 2014,"Hands down a great experience... I came here by myself a couple weeks ago..As soon as I was settled into my room, I did a quick walk around the hotel.. I was amazed at the location and the beauty of this hotel.. The beach was less than one minute walk from the pool.
If you get a chance locate Madie he has a little shop to the left once you walk out towards the beach. His hospitality was second to none. He seemed to know everyone in the area. A great tour guide.. Also, there was this pizza joint to the right once you walk out towards the beach... You will not be disappointed..

Oh and the swim up bar.....FANTASTIC..

Thank you for a great experience..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
710,Best Spot In Seminyak,50,May 2014,"Stayed here 9 or 10 times in past and keep coming back, right on beachfront with beach bars in front all with live music nightly,plenty of good restaurents in walking distance, clean rooms with good bedding and friendly staff and a great pool all I need for a good holiday.The only problem is breakfast is good however dining at other times is not up to standard of other places in area.

711,Accommodation,40,May 2014,"Stayed at Pelangi for our 1st ever week in Bali.
Staff all very friendly and helpful.
Nice place but getting a bit dated and could do with a bit of updating and exterior cleaning.
Room was good size and comfortable will everything we needed.
Facilities were all good with nice big pool with wet bar.
Right on the beach and handy to everything.
WIFI free but not very reliable.
Buffet breakfasts were good but the cooks at the egg station were hopeless. Gave up on trying to get a decent poached egg after a couple of tries and no chance of a soft boiled egg.
Overall a good place to stay due to location and facilities.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
712,Good all rounder,40,April 2014,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed at this hotel. Initially I wasn't impressed (4 years ago), but went back as we holiday with my uncle and he likes it and is a creature of habit.
The location is brilliant, right on the beach, lots of bars and eateries close by.
The hotel is a little tired looking, but it's clean and functional and great value for money. They also offer a free shuttle service to Kuta a few times a day which was great.
The pool is lovely, it's a pity it closes at 8pm though.
The worst thing about this hotel is the food, it's awful - no wonder the restaurant is always empty. The food was terrible 4 years ago and it really hasn't improved. Breakfast is good though, so that's something.
Due to location and functionality I would stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
713,All good,40,May 2014,"Pelangi is a practical hotel. It has all most people need. Clean rooms, good air con, nice pool, great places to watch sunsets on the beach. And pleasant staff. It was almost booked out when we visited due to they above reasons. Let's face it, some people are never happy, but we really enjoyed our time at the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
714,Honeymoon,50,May 2014,"We chose Pelangi Bali Hotel as our Honeymoon destination out of all other hotels around Seminyak because the pictures on the website made it look more like a resort which is what we were after. When we arrived the staff were so friendly and helpful. We looked around and felt like we were in paradise. We loved every second of our stay, the breakfast was delicious especially the bacon, watching the rolling waves of the ocean while enjoying your breakfast was a great start to every day. There was a free shuttle bus every day about 4 or 5 times a day to Kuta and then just catch a taxi back but make sure you only catch the bluebird group as they are metered and should only be about 30,000 rp from there all the other taxi's are not metered and will try and charge you more. There are lots of restaurants close by 2 of our favourites are Gosha and Indonesian Cooking absolutely delicious. Your only a step away from the beach which is fantastic so i could watch my Wife battling the waves of the ocean while i stayed up on lounge beds near the pool. The pool area was just awesome and so relaxing, a swim up bar and you could also order food from there too. We highly recommend Pelangi Bali Hotel for either a short or long stay, we stayed 9 nights and then didn't want to leave. We have decided to come back for our one year anniversary next year. Thank you so much Pelangi for making our Honeymoon special.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
715,Back again to this great location,40,May 2014,We have stayed at the Pelangi on many occasions over many years and it is always the same.

716,"""10th Wedding Anniversary""",50,May 2014,Loved the Pelangi!! Going back there again soon! Right on the beach with several beach restaurants at your door step. Hotel restaurant and pool area overlooked the beach. Great swim up bar and pool. Lovely staff and nice food. Great scheduled bus into Kuta every day 5 times a day so convenient for shopping. Can't wait to come back!!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
717,Beautiful!,50,May 2014,"Great location, beautiful resort and friendly staff... Very much appreciated the swim up bar ;) we ate at the restaurant most nights- food was fantastic! Really got the relaxing vibe we were after on our holiday.... Will be back! Thank you!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
718,One step to the beach,40,May 2014,"We choose this hotel because of its location, one step to the beach. The room is nice, clean, and spacious. Having breakfast while you enjoy the ocean view directly in front of the resto.

We were upgraded to deluxe room at that time. Easy to find transportation rental and near to the stores.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
719,Wedding Trip,40,April 2014,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Pelangi and we can not fault it. The rooms are basic but perfect for a nice holiday away. Great location, great staff and food. The pool and bar area are fantastic",Pelangi Bali Hotel
720,Great Location with Room for Improvement,30,April 2014,"Positives
- Fantastic location (I highly recommend La Plancha for drinks)
- Good pool area
- Helpful, friendly staff
- Relatively clean
- Beautiful greenery on hotel grounds

Room for improvement
- Rooms outdated (especially bathroom)
- Hotel won't call taxi for you however you don't have to walk far to hail one
- No safe in hotel room (you have to put valuables / cash in a safety deposit box at reception)
- Only one room key is given out (annoying when you both you need one)
- Terrible pillows

Overall, good hotel but a little over priced (we paid $100 USD pn). If you want no frills, love the beach and watching the sunset with a cocktail in hand you'll like this place.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
721,"Fantastic pool, quiet rooms, great breakfast",50,April 2014,"Large pool with swim up bar, shallow area for small kids and lots of loungers. Pool is right on the beach so can pop out to swimi in ocean easily. Also surf lessons out front. Froggies, 250,000 rp for two hours and can then hire surfboard for 50,000 rp an hour. Also just out the door on beach are a pile of restaurants where you can sit on bean bags and sip cocktails while watching sunset. Walk to the right down the beach and get to ku da tar, and then seminyak main dinining area (wacko burger etc). Have free shuttle to kuta every two hours and then taxi back (take bluebired ones) is only 30,000 rp. Buffet breakfast was great - recommend pancakes, omelette from the egg station. Rooms comfy, nice and quiet after the roosters of ubud. Little hard to find the first time as when you go down street then actually turn left off it down another street which has a whole lot of other busiinesses but not pelangi! Won't regret staying here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
722,What a lovely homely hotel in a great location.,50,April 2014,"On arrival, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool water is warm and well balanced. The breakfasts are yummy and filling and, the view of the rolling waves is so relaxing. The rooms are very clean, a it retro but well looked after.

723,Best spot in Seminyak,50,April 2014,"My daughter and I have now stayed 4 times at the Pelangi... it feels like coming home. This hotel has got to be the best kept secret in Seminyak. Not the most modern but right on the beach and very comfortable. Rooms, pools, meals and location couldn't be better.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
724,Nice,40,April 2014,"I stay for 4 nights...overall is good...a clean and good, but small room...air conditioner worls very well...breakfast quite good...the seminyak beach right behind the hotel...all the staff are friendly...definitely recommended...and i will come back again...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
725,Family vacation,40,March 2014,"We were a party of six who stayed at this beachfront hotel march 2014, having three superior rooms. There is really nothing any one of us can say that did not full fill our expectations, with all of us saying we will return and not look elsewhere , in fact two of our party are fortunate enough to be able to and have re-booked to stay again October 2014. The rooms were clean and comfortable , the swimming pool large and overlooking the sea with a swim up bar .the staff were all happy to help with anything. Breakfasts were also good .It certainly ticked all boxes .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
726,Fantastic,50,March 2014,"What a Great place , Right on the ,beach close to restaurants . The Staff are fantastic and helpful. Great buffee breakfeast and the pool was superb looking over the beach..we will be staying there again for sure.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
727,Excellent everything you want hotel,50,March 2014,3 couples of various ages stayed here from the uk....this hotel is superb........it has an amazing huge pool with beautiful comfortable sun loungers and parasols. An excellent pool bar and free towels provided by amazing pool staff all day long. The breakfast is plentiful and you would be pretty fussy if not satisfied here.we didn't eat here so can't comment on evening meals. The beach is at the rear of the hotel and most nights we went out to the beach bars barefoot as no need for footwear......rooms are superb and regularly stocked with everything you need. The staff are excellent and friendly and can't do enough for you....there is an amazing safe storage service at this hotel for extreme peace of mind........you have to go there. If you need anything just ask the staff at reception they even rang the number for me to call home and handed me the phone when it was ringing......excellent staff superb hotel and perfect location book now,Pelangi Bali Hotel
728,The lovely 'rainbow' hotel,50,April 2014,"Having read some of the reviews from previous guests I was a little apprehensive about my first visit to the Pelangi, however having returned from our trip I wonder if the poor reviews were allocated to the wrong hotel!

The staff are so friendly, welcoming and happy to help with any query or assistance you might need 24/7. Reception is open round the clock. There is also a travel booking desk manned all day and again more than happy to efficiently help you plan and book your excursions at your convenience.

The location is perfect, no where is far away and as the beach is literally at the end of the gorgeous pool and swim up bar you literally only need to walk metres to one of the great beach bars with more awesome views and great food and cocktails.

Breakfast is good with daily changes to the hot food choices and the egg station staff will make you whatever you feel like that morning. We also had room service a couple of times and again the food was lovely and arrived quickly.

In terms of the rooms, the air conditioning was excellent (kind of important in Bali!), the beds were really comfy, cleaning standards were impeccable, and the rooms had every convenience that you would want. Bottled water is supplied daily and the mini fridge is replenished each day as well.

As our driver Wayan was telling us, the Pelangi is a long established hotel, well known in Bali, therefore dont expect to be walking into a 5 star, shiny and sparkling funky joint with minimalist furnishings and Jo Malone toiletries! What you will get is a beautiful traditional place to stay with a stunning pool and beach outlook with lovely staff, decent food and a very chilled out vibe.

Will absolutely stay at the Pelangi on our return to beautiful Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
729,Birthday holiday,40,April 2014,"It was our first trip to Bali. This hotel was lovely. The staff were always helpful and polite. They even gave me a birthday cake on the evening of my birthday,delivered to our room(I am not even sure how they knew!!!) which was a lovely touch. No safe in our room but there was safes that we could use at the front office and this was easy to access all day and as often as you like.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
730,Bali getaway,50,September 2013,"Our 1st ever trip to Bali, and 14 days at the Pelangi Bali resort, What a stunning location!
Awesome lagoon style pool area over looking Kuta beach. Excellent daily breakfsts consisting of everything with daily changes to fruits,hot food etc.
Rooms a little dated but nice and quiet, and importantly dark and cool. Fantastic room service and the staff are soooo friendly and helpful.
We are going back again this year 920140 and staying at Pelangi for another week.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
731,Honeymoon Stay,40,March 2014,"We stayed 11-13 March 2014 and had an amazing time. The weather wasn't great, but the hotel staff and facilities were amazing. The only downfall was that the hotel needed a little updating, but it looked like they were in the process of doing this.

They went above and beyond the duty of a hotel, even to the point of sending a car 40mins drive away to pick up my sunglasses I had left in a Tour car. Thank you very much and if we come to Bali again we will definitely stay here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
732,Thank you Pelangi - Carlene & Geoff,50,April 2014,"Returned to the Pelangi Bali Hotel for the third time March /April 2014.
Had a party of 5 and we were not disappointed. Rooms were very clean, bathrooms impeccable, once again ALL staff were amazing. It feels like coming home each time we return. Would not go anywhere else if we had the choice. Stayed for Nyepi, enjoyed lazing around the beautiful pool all day. The Beach Bars had all been refurbished so that was good to see. Guests were really nice. The hotel is only minutes away from Oberoi or Eat Street (we recommend Ultimo). Cannot fault the Hotel at all. Always feel safe at the Pelangi. Thank you Pelangi Bali see you again next time. Carlene & Geoff",Pelangi Bali Hotel
733,great break,50,April 2014,"This is our second stay. Hotel is great. Pool is great. Staff are warm and friendly, particularly the pool man Gustav, always a good morning and a chat. All th staff were friendly. Hotel is clean. It is right on the beach. Lovely little break. Definately stay again. They even left birthday cake in our room and a letter. Nice special touch. We had the ground level in the garden. Beautiful",Pelangi Bali Hotel
734,Mixed bag,30,March 2014,"Having stayed in many locations and hotels all over Bali, I have to say the only good about this hotel is the location. The food was awful, the rooms small and dingy.
But will say some of the staff were very friendly, not all but some.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
735,Top Location in Seminyak,40,March 2014,"Just spent 7 nights at Pelangi Bali - great location within walking distance of town, beach and beach cafes. As others have said, hotel is old but well maintained. Definitely needs a spruce up - furniture & furnishings so old they're almost new again - retro! All staff very pleasant and helpful - remember your name and ask about your day. Breakfast buffet adequate; egg station good. Vegemite available! Free shuttle to Kuta several times a day, but best to book ahead.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
736,Don't stay here,20,April 2014,u can find so many nicer places to stay for a great price air cons don't work very well hotel is like a concrete jungle the only good thing is the pool and that seminyak beach is on your doorstep ! No atmosphere at all and food here is the worst I ate in Bali,Pelangi Bali Hotel
737,Next!!!,20,March 2014,"Unfortunately my partner and I stayed at this hotel for 7 long nights. friends wanted us to stay with them here and we relented and agreed, that was our first mistake!!
The Pelangi is on the beach and thats pretty much it!! if you are a young traveller who is looking for a basic clean hotel then this is, I guess a good choice. Its dated and in dire need of renovating. It has one pool, close to the beach and thats its best feature. Breakfast is average at best. rooms are an ok size, air conditioners are cold and the fridges work. everything else is standard. Unfortunately we payed way too much for this hotel. If I had paid 65 dollars a night as some other people who were there had, then this hotel would have represented value for money but anything more than that is way too much. the main problems with this hotel are at management level. Lack of training of staff and lack of maintenance of the building are its downfall. If you enjoy sitting around the pool at the swim up bar with M & M blaring then this is probably your sort of place, It was not mine. would never even contemplate staying here again. As I said, its probably 2 and a half stars at best but still I think there are other hotels that offer way more value for the money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
738,Great position near the beach,40,January 2014,"This is our 2nd stay at this hotel. Our family stayed here for 3 weeks in January and we had such a relaxing and fun time here. The rooms are clean and functional and are well maintained daily by the staff. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms are possibly starting to look a little dated and would benefit from a freshen up. The pool area is a lovely place to relax and unwind. We had breakfast daily in the hotel and loved the egg station. There is a good variety of hot and cold dishes available. All of the staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and friendly, they really do help to make your holiday memorable. Nyoman, Dex and Dian are a great asset to the hotel nothing is too much trouble and they are always smiling. We look forward to staying here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
739,Okay,20,March 2014,Food was okay I think it gave me slight bali belly. Location is good the beach it is on defiantly doesn't have white sand like it was advertised. Much of the view has been covered by surrounding hotels and construction work was slightly irritating. But it was okay. The surrounding restaurants are awesome and it's not far from nightlife. Ohhh but the breakfast Buffett was really awful !,Pelangi Bali Hotel
740,"Girls Trip - Excellent Pool, Basic Rooms, Lovely Staff",30,March 2014,"Overall it was a nice enough hotel In a fairly good location. The staff were lovely and always happy and helpful, as you would expect in Bali. It is located at the southern end of Seminyak and on the beach so access to Kuta or Legian was only a short stroll away. Seminyak square was too far to walk but only a short taxi ride away. The hotel provides a daily shuttle bus to Kuta which is free of charge and a great convenience.
We stayed in a standard room. They are very basic and not modern and also there was not safe. However they were clean and tidy and the A/C was excellent. They also provided two bottles of water to your room daily, which was great.
The pool was lovely and overlooked the beach so was for me the best part of the whole hotel. The day spa was well over priced even at 40% off however the gym facilities that were provided were really good! Lots of equiptment which was a nice surprise.
For a girls trip this accommodation was fine as we were mainly at the pool or out of the hotel. However if you're a intending on spending lots more time in the room know that they are very basic.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
741,Excellence at Budget prices,50,March 2014,"There is not one bad word we can say about our experience at the Pelangi Bali Hotel. We chose a superior ( Basic ) room and it more than met our expectations. Very well kept room and more than ample for our needs, King size bed, separate bathroom, TV, fridge etc. What more do you need when most of the time you are out and about soaking up the atmosphere and sights Bali has to offer. Staying around the hotel for the day, they have a great pool with a swim up bar and a decent restuarant. Breakfast included every morning with a great variety of western and aisan cusine. Within very close walking distance were many fantastic restuarants, beach, bars, markets etc etc. For the money you pay to stay here everywhere else will be hard pressed to match what you get for your dollar. When we return to Bali, the Pelangi Bali Hotel is where we will call Home. For the people who have written bad reviews, they must be genuinely sad, introverted people. Absolutely nothing bad to report and well worth the money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
742,What a dive,20,March 2014,"It amazes me this got a certificate of excellence from Tripadvisor, terrible rooms and useless unfriendly staff. Rooms look like something from the 50's, as does the whole hotel, even the front gate looks crap. The pool is the only good part, food is terrible. No safe in the room, they give you a safety deposit box at reception, what planet are they on?

Bali in general is dirty, full of scammers and aussie bogans making sure they get as many $1 Bintangs they can. If you want a real holiday head to thailand, better food and much friendlier people.

I would not recommend this place to my worst enemies, i booked for 4 nights and leaving after 2.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
743,"Clean, great location, needs a freshen up, awesome staff.",30,March 2014,"Stayed for 5 nights, paid a good price for twin room only 1 week before staying. Ground level room definitely smelled of damp and wasn't pleasant, wouldn't have been able to sleep in that room- we were easily moved on our request without any problems- no smell.
Rooms need a freshen up, tired and need of update though very very clean, beds firm to medium, a/c was always on within room.
Meals are below average including breakfast. Could do some work their variety.
Drinks are 1/2 nips which is disappointing for full price.
Need more umbrellas around the pool as early risers always get them.
Staff are Amazing- always happy, always helpful.
Location is what your paying for, would go back for this reason and price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
744,Very Happy,40,August 2013,"We visited the Pelangi Hotel in 2010 and were quite happy with everything we encountered. The Atmosphere, Staff, Breakfast, Pool, Service from the start of our 10 days until the end we couldn't fault. There was a small mixup with our rooms upon arrival, but that was quickly sorted and we were even upgraded for the inconvenience, even though there was none.

Would happily stay here again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
745,Third visit,40,March 2014,"We keep coming back because :-
Position position position
Right on the beach
Close to lots of restaurants
We like the little beach bars
Rooms are fine and spacious
Aircon working well
Beautiful pool
Breakfast is adequate

We were concerned about construction and were initially shocked by the new beach bar right in front of the hotel but it really hsd no impsct on our stay. A good three star hotel...four stars would definitely be stretching it.

Ask for upstairs rooms closer to pool",Pelangi Bali Hotel
746,What a disappointment,20,March 2014,"We were excited about our last stop in Bali being in seminyak. We arrived late to our hotel and were greeted with a refreshing drink. The front desk were not as friendly as previous hotel we stayed in at Bali. We were taken to our rooms and as soon as the door was open a huge stench came out that smelt like mould. We were not happy. The only option was an upgrade which they took us to show us another room for an extra 70US a night. This room also smelt so we decided we were not going to pay for another smelly room. Our friends room also smelt. It was so bad it made our clothes smell. The bathroom was leaking where the sink was as well. The room was quite small and the bottom rooms had no balcony. Breakfast was pretty good. The pool was so hot it felt like a spa. The pool bar was a good idea just uncomfortable in the pools heat.
Overall the place needs a major renovation. The inside areas were dead as no one wanted to hang around there obviously I.e bars area. Not recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
747,A tad tired but otherwise lovely hotel,30,February 2014,"Stayed at the start of Feb, this was my 7th visit to Bali & my friend & I stayed in a room with two beds. Checkin was quick & they helped us carry our luggage to the room. Our room was on the ground floor & the lobby was on the 2nd floor (bit odd but just the way the hotel is shaped). Didnt like the room initially as it looked tired & the bathroom looked dated, however everything was clean, water & amenities stocked daily, beds were firm (not too firm though) so I had a great sleep & air con was powerful.

Our wardrobe door didnt shut & there are no safes in the room so we kept valuables locked up in our suitcase, there is a safe at Reception though. No where to hang your wet bathers as we only had a few steps outside our room - so we just hang then on the chairs inside the room.

Pool area was lovely, plentiful towels, swim up bar comfy, pool was nice & deep in some spots, plenty of chairs to over look the dirty beach, they was building something to the left of us but it didnt obstruct any views. A short 15min stroll to the left took you to heaps of Restaurants.

Out the front there is a short 4-5min walk to a main rd to get taxis, try Spa Bali - great massages.

The breakfast was ok, garlic potatoes & noodles were great but the juices on offer were thick & syrupy - not to my liking. Nice view of the beach & pool when eating.

Didnt try the spa at the hotel or the bar, no one was ever in it anyway.

Admittedly I am used to more luxury settings which this hotel isnt however it was still a satisfactory stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
748,Run Down and Falling Behind,10,March 2014,"We were so excited about our Bali Trip, we have been here lots of times before so we should have known some of the traps like advertising and promoting your hotel as something its not.
First impressions count right? We were sooo disappointed when we walked in and our experience went down hill from there. The reception and halls to the rooms were badly in need of some TLC the staff failed to make us feel welcome and lacked the warm smile we are used to on arrival at Balinese Hotels .
We stayed in a deluxe room which was of average size but straight out of the 1980's it was not clean and had no verandah. The bathroom was needing attention the towels badly stained and the whole room smelt. Our room was noisy as it had a adjoining room access. The rooms did not have safety deposit boxes which meant a trip to reception every time we wanted to use our valuables.
Breakfast was included in our rate, it was uninspiring and monotonous, pastries were stale and menu did not change during our visit. Best part was the omelet station.
The location of the Hotel is great but they have now lost 40% of the waterfront view as a beachfront Warung has been extended an impedes the ocean view.
Internet is particularly bad even for Bali.
This is a $60 a night 2.5 star hotel, for which we paid much more, its not horrendous but certainly does not offer value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
749,A relaxing stay at the Pelangi,40,March 2014,"The Pelangi Hotel provides real value for money when one considers the Seminyak location, and located adjacent to the beach. I stayed for a week this time - The second time I've been here. It's not a fancy hotel by any means but my own experience was one where the room was clean and well maintained. The staff are very genuinely friendly and I'm always impressed how they remember my name.
The hotel Spa was particularly good. Clean, fresh and well run. So quiet and peaceful. I fell asleep it was so relaxing.
I used the local beach extensively and the locals always had a chair and umbrella for me!
Good restaurants are not far away - suggest a review of Seminyak restaurants on TripAdvisor to help decide.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
750,Sadly in need of upgrading,30,March 2014,Having read previous reviews I have to agree with things that others have written. Pelangi's rainbow isn't too bright these days and a revamp would be beneficial. The breakfasts are mediocre at best. My travel agent stated it was 4 star but I'm afraid 3 would be more apt. Great staff though except in the restaurant late at night. I shouldn't have to go and ask for another drink if I'm the only one in the restaurant with 4 to 5 staff hanging around. If you are looking for something a little special do your homework and look elsewhere.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
751,Great location!,40,February 2014,"i stayed in two hotels when i traveled to bali, this was my first destination. The service was so good, they greeted us as soon and we came with welcome drinks and gave us all the information we needed to make our stay comfortable. The location was in front of the beach, with restaurants with bean bags and a 10 min walk to the market. The rooms were comfy, clean and decent size, the room service food was pretty good, and they provided free breakfast in the morning which tasted average.
I loved the Pool, it had a pool bar and located right near the restaurant.
I would love to stay here again, the layout of the hotel is beautiful, very Balinese",Pelangi Bali Hotel
752,Starting to look dated,30,February 2014,"I visited Pelangi Resort restaurant some 10 years ago when it was fairly new and had a good view of the beach.We decided to stay here for 3 nights.
Sadly time has taken its toll and although the rooms are large and comfortable they are lacking in an outside area to sit/ dry bathers etc. There are no in room safes - deposit boxes are in the reception area.
The breakfast was cold and not a great selection. The egg station was outside the restaurant and we didn't realise until the second day!
The pool area now overlooks building work on the beach . I would not stay here again as there are better options for the price .
On the up side - the staff were lovely , very helpful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
753,Great time at the Pelangi,50,February 2014,"Just returned after 8 days at the Pelangi and was thoroughly impressed. We stayed in a superior room on the first floor and couldn't have been happier. The room was clean, bed super comfy and air con perfect. The staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was memorable, even delivering birthday cakes to the room, as we were celebrating two birthdays. Breakfast was American style buffet with some Indonesian choices, fresh fruit and an amazing egg station. The pool was clean and towels supplied. The location is perfect, beach directly in front with plenty of restaurants to choose from. Close to shops and stalls. Would definitely return. Thank you Pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
754,"Great location, average food",40,February 2014,"We spent five nights here. Rooms were great, a decent size but nowhere to dry wet clothing, bathers etc. pool area ok but needs some work. Staff were very accommodating and our main complaint was the food. The breakfast selection was poor. Very basic, under ripe fruit. Poor choice of cereal and yoghurt. Even had to get your own tea/coffee while staff stood around talking to each other. Location was perfect, right on the beach and walking distance to both legian and seminyak.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
755,Great staff and great breakfast,40,February 2014,"The room is really comfy and clean. The location is a walking distance from many great restaurants and, although the beach in front of the hotel is not that nice, it has a great pool and a pool bar. It has a great breakfast and the menu for meals has also great deals.
The staff was really nice and helpfull and we could organise our tours with them also, which was a great facility.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
756,Pools average......,30,February 2014,"Stayed 7 nights. Staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are good size and clean. Breakfast was average and so was the pool area and pool bar! Its not really a relaxing spot around the pool it needs work! I wont return, sure there's better value per $ elsewhere.....",Pelangi Bali Hotel
757,Not my favourite stay,30,February 2014,There is probably nothing wrong with the Pelangi but there is also nothing that stands out as well. We stayed here for 4 nights on a friends recommendation and there really are so many better places to stay in Bali for the same price. I will do a bit more shopping around next time.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
758,Needs a makeover,20,February 2014,"Stayed three nights here. Wouldn't return. The best thing about this hotel is the close proximity to Ku De Ta and Coccoon beach clubs. It is beach front, however quite old and requires a makeover. I would stay a few streets back, somewhere nicer for the same price and head to the beach bars that Seminyak has to offer as you won't want to spend any time at the Pelangi. The roof top terrace is also closed. Pictures quite misleading.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
759,Value for Money,40,February 2014,"After reading a lot of mixed reviews about the Pelangi we were genuinely happy with our stay here. Yes the resort is a little dated and getting on, but for the price we paid ($90AUD p/night) it did the job perfectly. We originally were in a room on the ground floor but after the first night we requested a change to upstairs, as the room was seriously damp (I would assume most rooms on the ground are like this). The upstairs room we got changed to was great. Standard room but more than enough space for a couple, comfy bed, nice bathroom and balcony.

The pool area is lovely. Lots of chairs to lay on and swim up bar is awesome. Only downside is that although the pool backs onto the beach, there is a lot of construction work going on and not a very nice sight. However, not the fault of the hotel.

I came down with a case of Bali Belly and the hotel was super efficient in getting me a doctor and changing the tour we had booked for the day, which was very much appreciated.

Some might consider the location of the hotel a little out of the way but realistically it is a short walk to Eat Street, Jalan Seminyak and other parts. There are a lot of restaurants right near the hotel though, so not a problem for us at all.

Overall, a good hotel for the price you pay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
760,TOURIST GUIDE,10,January 2014,"Hotel needs to be refurbished. Room 236, dusty, bath room not cleaned thoroughly. Stained towels!!! Terribile experience!!! Reception staff not very helpful!!! Hotel does not deserve 4 stars!!!!
Customer care poor!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
761,Fab stay in a lovely hotel,40,February 2014,"I was a little worried about this hotel after reading some recent bad reviews, however as soon as we arrived I was more than relieved!! Staff are all amazingly friendly, and greet you with a smile. The hotel is beautiful with an amazing outside pool and bar. Cocktails are all great and drinks reasonably priced (one thing I would say is it is much better value to buy large bin tang beer than small..but you specifically have to ask for a large as they will otherwise give you a small)!!

Rooms are all clean and cleaned daily with new towels and water.

We checked out the hotel but due to flight delay we had to re check in for a night....this was no problem and easily resolved.

The beach isn't the nicest as it is a little dirty but at night there are plenty of restaurants that have live music on the beach which is just a few minutes walk from the hotel.

It is about a 10 minute taxi to Seminyak square, and they provide a free shuttle bus into Kuta.

Free towel hire for the pool is also provided.

The only negative is the food, we had a burger for lunch there are it wasn't the best...however some of the snacks bits like potato skins were fine, I would probably say eat outside the hotel as there so many amazing places to eat.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
762,we couldnt even stay the night at the Pelangi,20,January 2014,"Hotel was dirty, reception had marks on walls, stone steps leading to pool area were cracked and looked dangerous. Had to wear something on feet because floor around the pool was so dirty.
Upon arrival we met up with friend who had stayed the night at the Pelangi, they showed us around and we decided not to check in. We paid a 1 night cancellation fee and moved on to The Bali Mandira Beach Resort & Spa in Legian which was clean and heaven in comparison.
The only good thing was the Reception staff were very helpful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
763,3days of R & R,40,January 2014,"Our stay at Pelangi was very pleasant, friendly helpful staff, good food, lovely pool, amazing cocktails, close to some good boutique shopping plus the traditional shop front stalls, all walking distance. The spa in the hotel provided some good services but the ones outside of the hotel and close by provided a wider range of services.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
764,Not just PERFECT customer service but a caring family of staff :),50,February 2014,"The Pelangi are well deserving of a perfect review for their impeccable service. I stayed here with my sister and best friend for just over a week. The pool is fabulous and the breakfast location is wonderful, overlooking the ocean. The rooms are very clean and are serviced everyday to a very high standard.

Not only did the hotel fulfil these requirements for three very fussy girls but they were there to help whenever we found ourselves in a pickle.

My sister had lunch out one day and by the evening was feeling quite ill. In about five minutes she had turned white, had enough sweat to seem as though she had just come out of the shower and basically had a severe case of bali belly. From the restaurant that we were at a 'taksi' took us to a random doctor in the middle of nowhere which left our pockets empty and stranded. Having tried to get a taxi for what seemed like hours in the pouring rain and blistering humidity I went back to the doctor reception to ask them to dial the only local number that I had which was the Pelangi.

The hotel, very concerned for our well being then swiftly got the bell boy to come and pick us up, and free of charge I might add. When the lovely man arrived his first comment in my response to thanking him for coming was 'I'm sorry that I'm late' (which he wasn't). The following day the hotel also chartered us to see that my sister received the best medical treatment.

All the staff consistently checked on how my sister was after she was admitted to hospital and for their service and caring nature I am forever in their debt.

The Pelangi is an affordable, safe and friendly hotel. I definitely recommend!!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
765,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!,50,February 2014,"Loved our stay here so much we came back for the last few nights of our trip. Both our rooms were impeccably clean, the staff were an absolute delight. So helpful and friendly. The pool was amazing!!

Will be back!! Thankyou for a wonderful stay!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
766,Second time and we will be back,50,January 2014,"This is our second stay at the Pelangi and we were once again welcomed wit friendly staff.
We had to change our booking around to accommodate our large family group and it was no problem at all for the staff. The hotel is situated in the heart of Seminyak and everything is easy walking distance. Security is great also. While we were there the maintenance staff were busy painting and scrubbing the unoccupied rooms - so things are being maintained and we will deffo be back later in the year.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
767,Great location and for price excellent,40,September 2013,"Stayed in September 2013. Got in late on the Jetstar flight and met at the airport by very friendly driver. ALL staff we found to be fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. A small room issue was solved in 20 minutes after a call. The shuttle to bogantown- I mean Kuta was available a few times a day.
Best part is location. Close enough to shop, party and play, but away enough to lie by the pool and not be hassled North Seminyak (towards Ku De Dah) is only about a 20 minute walk, with better (and more relaxed) shopping than Kuta. Beach is right at the door and day is swim and beach while night transforms to night clubs and food venues. Amazing changes that suit all families or couples like us who have older kids now (who can pay for the tip themselves if they want to come!)
Breakfast is OK. Some comments here about it being awful, but it is not the Hilton, and for what you get it is OK. There is massage on site (not used) and travel agent along with money changing at the Hotel. (Used once, but Kodak changer in the next street better value and appeared we did not get 'stooged') Just re-booked for April 2014. Staff made it great. Yes an older hotel that could be re-vamped but for the price and value we certainly got more than we paid for and were happy to come back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
768,Overall it's an ok place,30,January 2014,"Staff are friendly & accommodating. The room was a decent size & clean. No problem with the bathroom as on some other comments ours was fully tiled & no mould! Breakfast was adequate not as much choice as other places we've stayed but it was enough for us. Yes there are a lot of flies in the restaurant but it's open air so what can u expect ? The only bad thing for me was that there are no safety boxes in the room, they do provide them free of charge at reception but it was too much of a hassle to use them ! Didn't want to swim in the sea as the beach has lots of rubbish washed up. They do try to clean it but it keeps coming back in. Didn't really bother us too much as the pool is nice & clean so we just used that.
Overall it was a pleasant stay. The beaches are far cleaner in sanur !!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
769,Surpised. Didn't love it,30,January 2014,"Let's start with the good. The room was really big. Loved the pool area. The bar and restaurant service were excellent and tasty for the most part. We really enjoyed the meals we ate here. Staff were friendly. Good pool area for kids.

This place almost gets a Poor - But the pool and restaurant really brought it up.

Reading reviews ahead of time, we just thought people were being picky, but...

Cleanliness -
Our room was very dirty. A prior guest had left medical supplies in the room that had not been cleaned up. Also, the toilet was covered in brown drip marks. We had to ask the staff to clean it twice b/c they didn't really seem to notice. It was gross.

Location -
The neighborhood is fine. I think I would just avoid the southern side of Seminyak and go even further north for cleanliness. I heard the beaches farther north were really beautiful and chill. Plus, when we went up there for dinner, the shops and bars in northern Seminyak looked a lot more interesting. The Pelangi part of Seminyak is pretty dirty and littered. When surfing at the beaches, I kept looking down expecting to see seaweed wrapped on my leg, but it was always a plastic bag. Each morning, the beach was covered in trash. Clean-up crews came and raked up a lot of it, but it's not possible to get it all.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
770,Beautiful pool area and friendly enough staff.,40,January 2014,"On approach, the hotel appears a bit intimidating. It is big, dark and looming. You are greeted at the reception desk by a delicious welcoming drink and smiling bell boys. The guestrooms stretch a long distance towards the beach. You can walk down the middle of the complex through nice gardens, or if you walk on the outside of the complex, the hallways are a bit drab and unappealing. As other reviewers have said, go to Grandmas Hotel (De Nyuh Spa) down the road for a massage instead of using the hotel's expensive day spa.

Pros:
- Gorgeous pool area
- Reasonably priced drinks at swim up bar
- Air conditioning works well
- Right on the beach (but beach isn't very clean!!)
- Nice balcony onto garden areas but needs chairs in all balconies
- Reasonable breakfast selection (eggs, bacon, potatoes, pastries, cereals, fruit, coffee/tea, noodles etc)

Cons
- Beds aren't very comfortable (quite hard)
- Bathrooms becoming dated/stained
- Mouldy hallways and other areas in the complex
- Expensive day spa
- Wi-Fi which logged you out repeatedly
- Thin walls

Overall, I might stay here again, but only for a great price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
771,Bad stay,20,January 2014,"My family and I stayed here for 5 nights. It has a good and very strategic location. The beach is right at the back and they have a lovely pool. What upset us is that twice we witnessed the water in the toilets to be black in color. Some of us even accidentally gargled with this water before realizing that it was contaminated. Not long after, 6 of the 18 of us started vomitting and having diarrhoea due to this. Ruined our holiday completely. Also, their rooms are in need of upgrades for their air conditioning. Not cold enough.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
772,Not a good surprise,20,January 2014,"We arrived in the dark, We stayed here from 8th January until 16th January 2014 for our 1st trip to Bali, We were part of a group of 21 out of that. 2 had been before and stayed here 11 years prior. The receptionist were very pleasant and efficient and made check in very quick and easy, as were all of the staff but that is where it stops for the Pelangi. Once we got to our rooms we were slightly shocked at the tiredness off the rooms, the beds were hard and even the pillows were hard to gets use to the rooms needed steam cleaning and a proper disinfecting as the bathrooms were very dirty. As we talked to people. In the hotel they advised that a gastro bug was sweeping through the hotel with many people being struck down including 19 of our party and we were careful with what we ate and drank in Bali too. If you decide to stay here do as we did too and take disinfectant wipes and spray and clean your own bathrooms. We stayed out of the hotel most of the time going for trips around the island, and was not impressed with what we saw there too. Yes the hotel is on the beach but I wouldn't spend time on the beach as it is full of rubbish, The hotel staff tried to do the right things but it looks dirty, tired, dated and in some cases smells mouldy, throughout our stay some members of the party had brown water from their taps and shower, on the last day ours looked like mud and silt coming through. Oh and there was a strong smell in the bathrooms of sewerage too. Needless to say will not return to Bali or the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
773,Poor all round experience,20,January 2014,"My partner and I arrived at Pelangi after family in the new year. From what we had heard, we were very disappointed. Mould was all over our walls and even after falling sick, staff were unhelpful and irritated when we asked for a room change. The rooms were sparse and not worth the price, and reception were cold and very reluctant to make our stay as enjoyable as it could have been. The food was terrible- at breakfast bugs would be in the jam, yet the food was not replaced. We could not enter our replacement room as we were given a broken key, and we preferred to spend time mostly away from the hotel. Overall, our experience at pelangi was not a good one, and we won't be returning again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
774,Fantastic value and such a location,40,January 2014,"Bed was comfy and big
Room was the size you need for 2 people, bathroom could have done with an update
Balcony was fully covered, lots of shade abd reason protection
Good ac
Breakfast was great (so much bacon :D)
Staff were wonderful
Pool and sunken bar are a blast (a couple of shaded areas)
Food was as good as anywhere else we had eaten in Seminyak
Beach access from the hotel
Shuttle was reliable.
Wi-Fi was temperamental but allowed me to check emails and Facebook.

Not sure why people complain about the tv, yeah it's old and small but why are you in Bali to watch TV?",Pelangi Bali Hotel
775,Not bad not great :(,30,January 2014,"We stayed at the Pelangi from New Year's Day this year. Our initial reaction was to quickly try and change hotels, but we stayed on. The room is basic and as we know not a huge part of the day when travelling. Staff were very obliging and helpful. The meals in the restaurant were okay but search out some top spots closer to Seminyak Square for a fab meal. Breakfast needs to be improved. I told staff there were bugs in the strawberry jam expecting it to be replaced. The lady scooped the bugs out and left the jam. Not an option for me. It is also located down a less populated road not fab but hey the beach view from the pool may out weigh that?! Overall good but not great.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
776,First Time Traveller,40,October 2013,"My Son and I spent one week at the Pelangi and had a ball. We enjoyed our stay and the staff were so helpful. I did lots of things I had never done before like scuba diving, ATV riding and jet skiing. The markets were typical clothes and more clothes, but I didn't go there to shop.
Sat on the beach at night and slept like a baby every night.
The breakfast was a huge variety of foods and cereals.
We would go again. Rooms were clean and tidy and the beds were firm. good air conditioner and the pool was fabulous. I have never traveled overseas before and I enjoyed every minute.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
777,"Beach front hotel, although a bot worn out, it's good value for money",40,January 2014,"For $85 per night that we paid in 3-7 Jan, I'll say this is the place for good value, but if u need to pay more then probably it's not.

As a lot of reviews said, the room it's a bit worn out, we stayed at the supper room coz it was the only type available at the time we book, it's not big, 20sqm, with a small balcony which u can only stand for a smoke.

The tv is really small 20"" maybe, n out dated model too. Well we don't choice a beach front hotel to watch tv so it's ok.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
778,On the Beach,30,December 2013,"This is a traditional Balinese Hotel and it fronts on to the beach at Seminyak.
The rooms are a reasonable size but after spending one night on the lower floor I was fortunate to be moved to a higher floor - There was a very distinctive unpleasant smell coming into the room.

The beds are firm and comfortable and the rooms are very quiet.

Breakfast is very average with not a lot of choice, but you get a reasonable selection of hot breakfast which includes eggs, bacon, and a local rice dish, potato dish. The fruit selection is excellent and there is not much in the way of yoghurt. The staff are very attentive.

The pool is at the front of the hotel and over looks the beach.

The reception staff were very good and answered all of our questions. The always were eager to please

There are no safes in the rooms but you can leave any valuables in a safe at the front reception.
I found this slightly behind the times. Internet access was okay but had far better reception at the front lobby or the breakfast/restaurant.

I have stayed in Bali before and next time I will return to my favourite hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
779,Still good,40,December 2013,"This is our 2nd time to pelangi and it is still good, friendly staff, good food and nice and clean accomodation comfortable bed. Plus it is right on the beach great for sunsets and walking to other restaurants. Great location close to double 66 and also eat street seminyak. You must try Rumours in seminyak eat street . We have been 7 times and it just gets better. All in all a good place to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
780,Lovely Location on the Beach,40,July 2013,A great hotel just across the road from the beach and La Plancha. The rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable. We stayed here with friends and had a beautiful relaxing time. The breakfast isn't awesome but there is plenty of choice and the staff will happily stay and serve without grumbling. Sitting in the morning sun watching the ocean is a great way to start each day. The pool is a perfect temperature and the beer always cold. This is a nice reasonable priced hotel to stay that is is walking distance to eat street and Seminyak square.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
781,Genuine Bali experience,50,December 2013,"We wanted somewhere traditional to stay with our five children (aged 14 - 20) who had never been to Bali. We had some essential criteria - buffet breakfast included, free wifi in rooms, swim up bar, on the beachfront, lots of greenery, decent sized rooms, nice bathrooms, reasonable price, out of the main drag of Kuta. We got it all, and more. The staff were fabulous. They looked after us when one of our kids was ill by calling a doctor and letting us continue to use our room for free until we left for the airport. Several of them asked how she was during the last few days of our stay. The hotel has safety deposit boxes which are available 24 hours a day and very professionally operated and you can change money at the reception counter - also 24 hours a day. It is close to nice restaurants and a good variety of shops - both market style and fixed price. If you are looking for a five star resort experience the Pelangi is not for you. However, if you want an authentic Bali holiday in a lovely setting at a reasonable price, this is it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
782,Great Hotel and perfect location,40,December 2013,"We arrived at Pelangi Bali after a very long day trip down from Ubud exploring the country with a driver. Staff were helpful from the start taking our bags, and we get a welcome drink on arrival. Room was normal hotel room, could do with an upgrade soon - but has everything you need, besides you're only sleeping in the room. One thing - they don't supply facecloths, only handtowels. And also only 2 small bottles of water each day are provided, compared to our previous villa we received 4, and they run out fast as you have to brush your teeth with the bottled water. Pool is awesome - nice temperature, and the swim up bar is great and good prices ($3 bintang, $6-$8 cocktails AUD). Restaurant is good value for money and large meals also. Great location - right on the beachfront so you can walk to many restaurants on the beach and also only 10 mins walk along beach to the right to famous Ku De Ta. Overall great stay here at Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
783,Relaxing in Bali,40,December 2013,"My wife and I have just spent seven days at the Pelangi with the intention of unwinding after a very hectic year and have to say the Pelangi was the perfect place to do just that, we had a very relaxing break.
I am not sure why some say it is tired, it is traditional Bali decor and we found our room was spotless, the staff were all very efficient and pleasant, always eager to say hello and attend to whatever we wanted, we had a minor problem with our room fridge not being cold enough and after an enquiry we had two maintenance men turn up at our room within 5 minutes, fridge replaced with no fuss and no further problems getting our drinks cold.
Great pool area, nice beach front with a regular surf break and several nice Warungs within a few steps where you can sit back on a beanbag and watch the sunset with a huge plate of Nasi goring and a Bintang for a grand total of $6 Aus.
You can walk many places especially along the beach if you are energetic but if not Downtown Kuta or uptown Seminak is no more than a $3 taxi ride, note always tell them to put the meter on.
All in all we would recommend the Pelangi as a place to stay for all ages",Pelangi Bali Hotel
784,"Tired looking, reception staff a let down but good price for beachside location",30,July 2013,"Unfortunately my review is a bit tainted by the fact that I came to stay to join a wedding party after 7 nights at the fabulous Elysian Villas who were lovely enough to drop us to The Pelangi. The positives I can draw on are that it was a really good price for a beach side location, everything in the room was functional and breakfast was everything that you would expect from a 3 star hotel. What really let the hotel down was unhelpful hotel reception. Running late for a wedding due to a wardrobe malfunction we panicked and called down to reception to call a taxi for us. Get there and no taxi and when they did get one it was a minimum 50000 for a 10000 trip. Not a biggy in terms of foreign money but a big disrespect/blatant rip off that you shouldn't subject your guests to. Big tip here, just walk out the front gates and up the road to hail a taxi. Unfortunately we didn't have time to as we had 5 minutes to get to the wedding. Another negative were the full priced cocktails we had seemed to have half the correct amount of alcohol. Recommend going to one of the many places with bean bags on the beach. We liked the one with the orange bean bags and umbrellas. Before departing the Elysian they rang Pelangi to confirm we would be transferred to the airport on departure but when Pelangi advised us otherwise, the Elysian kindly took us. Word to the wise, you get what you pay for",Pelangi Bali Hotel
785,Pelangi.... Only 4 Trip Advisor Stars to Avert the Hard to Please,40,December 2013,"My wife and I are here with our 5 kids (20, 18, 18, 17, 14) and what a great time we are having at the Pelangi.

I have read some of the reviews and can understand that this is not a 5 Star KL, Phuket, Penang hotel.... As it is a great Bali family hotel.

We did our research and made the right choice here. All these kids, free great WiFi, which I am using now and us reliable and fast enough for Skype.

Rooms are a good size each with a porch or little balcony (we checked out the room sizes of some other hotels and these are much bigger) Breakfast is great with good choices. Some of the staff are shy and in training but we help them our and learn with them... A nice interaction (take the time it is worth it!).

Prices... There pool bar prices are cheaper than some of the restaurants, and mini bar and room service prices are great, again, cheaper than some restaurants. (And nowhere near some of the other equivalent star hotels

The best part!! This hotel has direct beach access so you feel like you are really in Bali, not tramping through the streets just to get to the beach, the pool overlooks the beach which is just great... This again is real Bali holidaying.

Seminyak shopping is nearby without it being at ever exit to the hotel. The close by beac bars and little restaurants are fantastic, and cheap... The kids love sitting in the bean bags on the beach after the meal!

This is a good (I mean great all round, location, facilities, beach access, good pricing in everything) more traditional Bali hotel. For those a little hard to please, just actually ask the staff and they will help... We needed wine glasses and had to ask a couple of different staff to get them to understand they were for in our room, but hey, we got them and I am now sitting on my little balcony having a wonderful time!

We will be back (minus the kids!) and will take one if the large suite room a couple if which overlook the pool/beach....

We have found our place in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
786,Best hotel experience,50,December 2013,"What to say about Bali, perfect holiday for couples, great weather, great people, and amazing experience at pelangi. We stayed 3nights there and we loved it. Staff are amazing and attentive , great cocktails by the pool and what a pool just overlooking the water. Best sunset I've ever seen in my life. Thank you to all the staff at pelangi you guys rock.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
787,Not happy rude front desk staff,20,December 2013,"I stayed here few days ago and I thought this place would be very good because we were staying at a budget hotel before and the service there was excellent but when we arrived I was very disappointed. The front desk staff was very rude they did not smile looked like they couldn't care less and I thought maybe its the time of the night because we checked in around 8pm but they were the same next day.

They don't have safety boxes in the room they provide this very old group of safe boxes at the front desk but if you lose the key they charge you $100USD which I thought was ridiculous they should provide safety boxes in the room to start with 2nd surly it don't cost $100USD to replace key in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
788,Fantastic holiday with friends,40,November 2013,"I spent 5 nights at the Pelangi in November this year with 7 girlfriends. We had booked based on price and location and were nervous about whether the website photos etc were genuine and whether we might get a rude shock when we arrived. We were all sooo pleasantly surprised when we did arrive.
The Pelangis location right on the beach with the pool overlooking the beach was fantastic. The lobby etc is not particularly luxurious but its lovely. The staff were all helpful and none of us had any complaints at any time. The rooms were really clean and serviced beautifully every day. The bathrooms were surprisingly of a very high standard for Bali I thought. The restaurant was good, not anything to write home about and we only ate there for breakfast as there are so many wonderful eating options in Seminyak so we made the most of that at night. But brekky was great, plenty of options and it changed every day. And Nasi Goreng around the pool for lunch got a workout by all of us during our stay.
And the spa was really lovely and we all enjoyed several treatments at really reasonable rates, as were the massage girls straight out the back of the hotel on the beach.
If you are looking for a great, value for money resort in a great Seminyak location, then the Pelangi is for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
789,Location location location,40,November 2013,"We have stayed at the Pelangi numerous times, each time in 1 of the larger deluxe rooms.This hotel for us is all about the location- Seminyak right on the beach. Pick up a room at a discount rate and it really is hard to beat for value in this location. The rooms are clean, service is fine, the pool bar is quite good and the restaurant is nice although the menu and food could use some improvement.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
790,Good location!,40,November 2013,"The Pelangi is a beautiful resort situated on the beach front in Seminyak which is fantastic for strolling along the beach or grabbing a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants lining the beach (we loved Taris, grab a bean bag, some local food and watch the sun fade out) or you can head out for a walk up the street which joins the main road which is host to many stalls, major shopping labels and restaurants.

The room itself was huge and quite close to the pool bar and breakfast restaurant which worked well for us, the bathroom was clean, well presented and quite large, the bed was comfortable and the selection of tv channels and room service was fantastic.

On the first night we had issues with Mosquitos however house keeping set us up with a plug in repellent thingy that fixed the problem for us.

We had an enjoyable time and would recommend to anyone wanting a nice resort that isn't over run by kids in a good location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
791,Great girls trip,40,October 2013,"My friend and I stayed here for 1 week in early October, the hotel is clean and has beach frontage which is great. Only a short ride from Ku De Ta and Potato Head etc. The pool is great as is the swim up bar. Staff are friendly, probably the only downside would be room service food not great but your aren't there for that.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
792,"Top location, great value for money",40,November 2013,"The location is superb, right on the beach. The pool is a real highlight and was kept brilliantly clean the whole week. The towel boys, deck chairs, pool bar and service are wonderful. The front desk staff are helpful and friendly with the safe deposit box service being great. Rama restaurant has a lovely position overlooking the ocean and pool.The included breakfast is varied and good with cereal, fruit, yoghurt, pastries, toast, bacon, eggs and more. Lunch is ok with sandwiches at a reasonable price. The only real negative was dinner at the Rama. It was without doubt the worst restaurant meal we have ever had anywhere in the world so don't go near it for dinner. The warungs on the beach for dinner as the sun goes down are fabulous. La Champlung is our favourite with beanbags, live entertainment and a laid back feel. $2.30 Bintangs, Nasi Goreng for $4 and great service. The superiour room was big and clean although as others have said the beds are hard. We were in 232 on the 2nd floor midway between the lobby and the pool and found it a good position. Don't waste your money upgrading to the deluxe room. We didn't use the Spa as massages were $27, we went to Carlas opposite the Kodak shop and enjoyed $6 massages. The Kodak shop just down the street was great for changing money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
793,Good location,30,October 2013,The rooms need upgrading.. The bathroom is old alot of spiders coming in through the roof.. Other then that it was good.. Pool was very nice right on the beach.. Breakfast was good.. The staff around the pool where very nice.. If they upgrade the room i would definatly be comin back,Pelangi Bali Hotel

795,Great Location!,40,April 2013,"First impression.....older style Balinese flair. Rooms comfortable, however the only reason I might not stay again is the Hard beds. The pool area is lovely with swim up bar, very friendly staff and patrons. We liked that there weren't many kids. Great location right on the beach, eating Brekkie every morning watching the surf. They have an excellent Tailor and Spa on the premises. A good walk to shopping areas, mostly we flagged pale blue cabs and made sure they had working Meters. We went to a few shows in Restaurant, food was quite nice, but nothing to rave about. We stayed 8 nights and had a great time. We had adjoining rooms with our close friends.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
796,Good cheap family holiday!,40,September 2013,"Great low budget hotel reasonable service, cheap drinks and meals. Good family orientated clientele. Central location yet quiet and relaxing. Bit dated but we weren't there to sit in our rooms all day! Lovely pool and outlook over Seminyak beach",Pelangi Bali Hotel
797,try harder,30,November 2013,"dated, dirty linen, poor food, tired building. tour standard, but 3 hours late.
front desk staff miserable rude and unhelpful.
gardeners,pool attendantsand tour desk were the only great staff. comfy bed, 13year old filthy bathroom.
the place is doing the bare minimum to get by and it shows.
maybe they should up date the website to reflect this.
dissapointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
798,"Good rooms, great pool",40,November 2013,"It was a fine hotel, reasonably proced, helpful staff. The breakfast is what you expect of a buffet (nothing special). The pool is good. It was a bit of a boring (rabbit warren) walk from reception to the rooms. Unusual for a bali hotel, they usually feel quite open and invite you to the pool area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
799,"Home from home, with a beach.",50,October 2013,"My wife and I returned to the Pelangi for the 6th time and caught up with my brother in law and his wife from New Zealand. Having been before we received a very warm welcome from many of the staff. We took advantage of a special offer which included free pick up from the airport, a free meal and drinks vouchers, good value for us.
The staff as always were terrific, the included breakfasts more than sufficient.
The Pelangi has a very nice pool with loungers overlooking a very nice beach and we enjoyed both. We love the location as it is very handy to the Warungs on the beach which are perfect for a relaxing evening meal as there is often local bands for entertainment. The free shuttle to Kuta is very handy although the taxis in Bali are quite cheap. We really enjoyed my birthday cake provided by the hotel, a nice surprise
Our only disappointment was the big jump in prices they charge for going to the airport, we used the normal public taxi service.
We are now planning to return in the new year and introduce some more friends to our relaxing getaway holiday.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
800,Pelangi,20,November 2013,"My partner and I had stayed here for three nights, and honestly we wouldn't be back we came from another accomodation in Bali, which we loved which was 3 stars!

The staff are not at all friendly, we get the feeling that they don't want to be at work! Over all just not friendly at all or helpful in all departments.

The breakfast was terrible, are their for two mornings and the third we went some where else. We also had lunch there one the first day.

Rooms are fine, house keeping do a good job.. I wouldn't recommend it and I won't be back!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
801,"Great Location, Good For The Price",40,October 2013,"I stayed at the Pelangi with my mum for 4 nights in October. We arrived at the hotel around lunch time and had to wait maybe 30 minutes for a room. I think this was because they were looking for a twin bed room, even though we wern't really fussed whether we shared a bed or not.

Rooms were okay, nothing fancy but neat and clean. If you are getting a twin room, note the beds are single sized beds, not the larger single/double beds you usually get at other hotels.

The pool area was great, nice sized pool, swim up bar, the pool water was a perfect temperature. Beds always available.

The breakfast was average but okay to get you going in the morning. They do have an egg station if you like fresh cooked breakfasts but everything else was pretty plain and standard. A couple of types of cereal, some toast and pastries, some bacon, some fruit then the eastern food like rice etc.

Staff were very friendly and always happy to help. We aren't the type of tourists who need a lot of things or a lot of attention when staying somewhere so never really had a problem with any of the service.

I was a little worried about trying to get a taxi back to the airport as a lot of people talked about not being able to get taxis at the hotel or the ones they order for you charge you $30AU or more. Not sure what those reviews were about but we went to the desk to ask about the taxi's and they order a car for you, not a taxi and it costs 150,000 IDR (or about $15 AU at the moment). This is a little more than the cost of grabbing a taxi off the street (we paid $80,000IDR or $8 AU on the trip from the airport to the hotel) but it wasn't worth the hassle so just ordered the car from the hotel.

As everyone else says, the location is awesome, right on the beach and lots of places to eat or drink right outside the door. Massages and nails available directly across the road, as well as anything else you might want to buy as lots of vendors are walking the beach. The massages on the beach were costing 100,000IDR, great massages and nails were 200,000IDR for fingers and toes which I think is a little expensive for a beach vendor with bad tools and not a big selection of colours.

Overall, worth the price if you just go for the basic, cheapest room. You get what you pay for so don't go in thinking you are getting a 5 star hotel and you won't be disappointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
802,Value for money,30,October 2013,"I've stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The rooms are comfortable, and the linen although clean and fresh are always stained. The gardens are beautiful and staff is very nice.
The spa needs some updating , but the prices and services were ok, but not the best.
The gym was a disappointment !! It's not well equipped and the room is small and run down.
I had a lovely time, but would not go for a romantic time.
Location is also very good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
803,I'm sure there's better,30,October 2013,"Not having stayed in Seminyak before, I thought the Pelangi would be ideal. It was on the beach, had good reviews, won a Trip Advisor Award, was decently priced and had great looking photos. But I was terribly disappointed. The room was much like others I had stayed in in Bali and I had no fault with anything other than the tiny balcony (but who spends much time there away!) and the lack of a safety deposit box (located at reception instead). The pool and reception was nice though. We had breakfast on the first day and was very upset with what was offered and its presentation. I've stayed in many places in Bali who serve breakfast and I was disappointed with Pelangi. We had breakfast elsewhere the following morning. We also ate at the hotel one night and another night ordered room service and the food was nothing to rave about there either. The cocktails were good though. The service and friendliness of the staff was top-notch as most hotels in Bali are. We were also upset that the rooftop terrace was shut during our stay... The location is reasonably good, it backs onto a small street which you walk across to reach the beach. Of a nighttime there are beanbags on the beach where you can order a drink/food and watch the sunset and listen to live music. its beautiful. Unfortunately I wont be recommending this hotel to anyone nor will I stay here again. I believe there are better places on the beach in seminyak for similar prices and I'll do better to research next time. Happy Holidaying!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
804,Pelangi,50,May 2013,We have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past and will do so again this coming May. The location is great and not to far from the beach or shopping for the women. Many places to eat and easy walking. We like staying down the front near the beach in. Breakfast is as good as you would want and plenty of it. Staff great and just a good place to stay.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
805,Probably won't be back...,30,October 2013,"Having stayed at the Pelangi in 2004, I thought a return visit might be in order, we had a super deluxe room and paid $180US a night, to be blunt, the room was av, big, but average, I think the extra cost is for the spa, but definitely not worth the money, the spa had very little power in the jets and the bathroom was quite grubby, the daily cleaning was below par also. The staff are all very friendly, couldn't be faulted & the brekkie selection is good, the location is great, right on the beach, but this hotel is tired and the floors in all areas could do with a good clean. Wifi on again, off again. Sorry Pelangi, for the money paid, not good enough.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
806,Good hotel,40,October 2013,"The hotel need some renovation. The humidity in the room creates a bad smell.
Anyhow the hotel is good and has a wonderful beach access. We had two times a very good dinner at the hotel. Use the massage facilities in front of the hotel!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
807,my 2nd home in Bali,50,November 2012,"Pelangi is in a great location on the beach at Seminyak, I have stayed here every year for the past 9... the staff are amazing, friendly, always willing to help, rooms are clean and comfortable, just out of the way of the kuta hussle, 10 mins walk to either ku de ta, or kuta beach. I look forward to my stay here again very soon.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
808,Family Getaway,40,October 2013,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my family. What i love about this hotel is that the rooms are nice, there are mini bus that will take us to kuta, the staffs are nice, and the location is the best. i love that this hotel is right at the beach of seminyak and near to this hotel there is La Plancha restaurant. i love to play at the beach so I will definitely stay at this hotel for the next time. The thing that i'm not so comfortable is the price. It's a bit expensive, and I just don't really like the lobby room and last is that this hotel is definitely not for a backpackers hotel or teenagers, it's best for family hotel. But overall i enjoyed stay at this hotel",Pelangi Bali Hotel
809,Great location,40,October 2013,We stayed here for 9 nights as it's location was great! We had about 25 people stay here for out wedding and they loved it. Being on the beach it's so close to so much. Staff were pleasant but food options were not the best. For what you pay here you can't go wrong. Had a delux room which was big and clean. Many guests we had said they would return. Overall great location and great value for money,Pelangi Bali Hotel
810,Good value,40,October 2013,"We stayed at the Pelangi for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon touring Bali.
We arrived early morning and so our room wasn't ready, however this wasn't a problem as we went and sat out by the pool and had some drinks and our room was soon ready.
We had a superior room which was a decent size with a small balcony area. There was a fridge in the room and decent amenities.
The pool area was nice and I spent a couple of nice lazy days there. My husband enjoyed the surfing at the beach here and hired a board from just outside the hotel on the beach. There are plenty of places to walk locally and there are shops nearby.
I agree with other reviews that say do not use the hotels taxi service, by going outside the resort you will find them much cheaper. We had a lovely trip to Bedugal, Gitgit waterfall and Tanah Lot for 550,000 IDR by booking externally.
The internet access is free and good.
The breakfasts were decent although the egg station not as good as we have experienced elsewhere. There was plenty of choice. We also are by the pool during the day on one occasion, this was also decent.
We did not use the spa here but I did use the one up the road (based at ""Grandma"" hotel) which was excellent and very reasonably priced.
There are lots of food restaurants locally (for a special occasion I recommend the breeze at Samaya, see separate review. Needs booking).
Staff were all very friendly and the resort was kept clean and tidy. They were very attentive to detail, giving us a couple of free glasses of wine for our honeymoon and also it was my husband's birthday whilst we were there and they left a lovely cake in our room fridge which was a lovely touch.
For the price paid it is a decent hotel and we would stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
811,Friendly hotel in perfect location,50,October 2013,"We enjoyed the hotel location, pool area and restaurant . The staff are very helpful and friendly and facilities were good and never too crowded. A great choice for a reasonable stay right on the beachfront with the views and breezes. The room was clean and ok, but decor, sheets and towels would benefit from an update. Still we didn't spend much time in our room, so it was fine. We would choose the pelangi again if we went back to seminiyak. Thanks to all the staff",Pelangi Bali Hotel
812,Traditional older style hotel,40,October 2013,"This hotel was built in 2000, so there is a bit of wear and tear. 9 nights here and yes I would use this hotel again. Deluxe room good, large but beds are ridiculously hard. First night no sleep, so housekeeping applied some extra padding. Do your homework when it comes to taxi use, only use bluebird, light blue, around seminyak 3-$4. There is a free shuttle to kuta, $5 return in a taxi. Meals around pool, not so good, breakfast very basic choices, other meals ok. Staff great and helpful.
There are many fabulous restaurants in seminyak, so explore! Ku de tar, merah puti, sardine, gado gado, scratch, métis, sarong, Chandi to name a few. Don't eat from restaurants on the beach, Bali belly abundant! Good shopping in seminyak, a mixture of good quality and then your typical market style cheapies. Great location right on the beach. If your looking for a modern, up market hotel, this isn't the one for you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
813,The only good thing is location....,10,October 2013,".... old rooms, old facilities, dirty, and always try to cheat you with their taxis... For a 50.000 -60.000 IDR ride, they offer us ""only 150.000 IDR"". So if you want to be in Seminyak/Legian beach, near good restaurants and Beach Chiringuitos, go there... but we will not never come back again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
814,Dated but very good value,40,September 2013,"We stayed here overnight before moving onto a villa for a wedding. I went fo value for money as we were arriving late.
The rooms were fine size wise and in fair condition. The location was excellent backing onto the beach and it wasnt to far to walk to local amenities. Staff were wonderfully friendly. Pool was nice but a little small for such a big hotel, especially when you consider the condition of the sea water meant that the pool was the only option for swimming. Overall, good value compared to most hotels I have stayed in.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
815,Great place to stay,40,September 2013,I really liked this hotel. The room was fairly small but comfortable. The mattress was rock hard though! The rooms are clean and modern. The staff were all friendly and very polite. Nothing was an issue. Breakfast was excellent. The pool is great and goes out to where the beach starts. The hotel is situated in a nice quiet cul de sac and within walking distance of the main drag for Seminyak shopping and an easy 20 to 30 minute walk to Legian and Kuta along the beach. For a family on a budget or anyone really it's great value for money.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
816,Nice place to stay,40,September 2013,"Upon arrival our rooms were not ready and werent going to be ready until 7pm that evening. They gave us a nice room to use until then though. They also gave us free meal vouchers for the inconvenience. The room was nice the air conditioner worked but I found it too cold during the day, it was either cold or no air conditioning. It was good over night though. The pool bar was really good. Lime Crush was a favourite. We could also order french fries, onion rings and mini pizza. They were good. The egg station was fantastic, the omelette with the lot was the way to go. The lunch and dinner menu was average. Not that great. The location was great, leaving out the back past the pool was straight onto the beach. Lots of restaurants and stalls.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
817,Not up to standard,20,September 2013,"This hotel is too far from everything, the food is poor, the rooms are not clean, the sheets and towels are dirty. The staff are friendly the pool is great. Not much i can say on this very over rated.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
818,Real value for the money,50,September 2013,We stayed here for 3 nights. It is not one of this posh hotels but it has real value for the money. We had a delux room. The room was big and very clean with air-condition and a flat screen TV. Great location direct on the beach of Seminyak. It has a great pool area with a poor bar where you can get in touch with a lot of Australian people. Twice a week they organize some dinner events at the restaurant. The staff were very friendly and helpful. A highlight is definitely the breakfast with direct view to the sea. It is really nice to relax at the hotel area whilst you can see and hear the ocean.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
819,"Nice, but not quiet!",40,September 2013,"The Pelangi is a nice hotel, very simple. It's right on the beach which is great but means it gets a bit rowdy, not really the kind of place you would stay for relaxation. The pool are gets super crowded because its not that big. At night you can hear other guests talking and walking around the sound really echoes. The spa is good for massages but that's all, I had a facial and it was pretty clear that neither of the 2 'therapists' had any idea what to do. Service is flawless as always in Bali :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
820,great hotel,50,August 2013,"spent a great week at the Pelangi in August 2013, great pool and handy to everything. Friendly staff . Would definately recommend this place & stay again. Started on 2nd floor superior room but was a bit dark, then moved to a ground floor room that opened to the garden path, much better. Look forward to staying there again, still very close to legian and just as close to everything in Seminyak too.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
821,"Great location, great service",50,July 2013,"Stayed here for 10 nights, there were 16 of us in one group. The staff were fantastic, helped organise a lot of trips and also gave us some good advice. The location is great, next to the beach and a good walk from Legian and Kuta. It had been recommended to one of our group and I’m glad we took up the offer.
Breakfast was fantastic, plenty of variety and we would generally eat enough to keep us going until dinner!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
822,Great Hotel,50,September 2013,"I stayed there for 10 days and it is a great Hotel and real value for money. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and a good size and the pool is well maintained .There is a shuttle bus for free if you like to go to Kuta and lots of Restaurants in walking distance for dinner.
I really enjoyed my stay and will be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
823,Great hotel in great location.,40,September 2013,"The location is excellent right on the beach but also easy walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. The staff were extremely helpful and all of them were really friendly at all times. The pool was lovely and clean, and you get fresh towels for the pool each time you go. There were always enough sunbeds and the service everywhere was great. The restaurant served good food at good prices. The rooms were also good, I felt that the bathrooms could have been a tiny bit cleaner and there were worn in stains on some of the sheets but otherwise the rooms were great, and the staff went out of their way to ensure we had twin rooms next to each other. The spa is quite expensive so we didn't use it but it looked lovely. Overall this is a great hotel with a lovely pool, great location for an excellent price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
824,Two star resort at best!!,10,September 2013,"I recently spent 5 days at this hotel with my partner and was happy to leave when our time was up!! Firstly the hotels policy which does not allow Meter taxis collect from the resort is a joke! The hotel called us a cab to the discovery mall kuta and charged us 15 usd when I questioned this price I was assured it was fair, I assumed I was wrong untill in our way back the meter taxi cost only 3.50 for the same journey!!! The driver also informed us that if he were to collect us from the hotel there would be tension and trouble for him!! Secondly, the breakfast was not up to the standard we experienced in other hotels in bali of the same star rating nor was the decor or rooms! This hotel to me is equivalent to a 2 star so don't be fooled by the ratings! To top it off the reception staff were not one bit welcoming or accommodating! I will not be back!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
825,Love this hotel,50,September 2013,"I have reviewed this hotel previously and was very positive about it. The great thing is that my opinion has not altered. The staff are just fantastic, in fact they said welcome home, and that is what it feels like , an oasis of calm in the frantic world of Bali . Just another nice touch, the shuttle bus was returning from Kuta, and the driver saw my husband and myself walking along and pulled over and gave us a ride back to the hotel. I think that this is something that is what makes this hotel special. The staff really seem to care about you. We love the location, the breakfasts, the pool area , the beach atmosphere at night, the rooms are clean and our bed was comfortable but really the staff are wonderful",Pelangi Bali Hotel
826,Great location,40,August 2013,"Great location with pool overlooking the beach. Great pool and surrounding area. Room OK with small balcony. We had a late flight and loved that they gave us a room to change and shower in before leaving, much appreciated. Overall a great place with shopping and plenty of restaurants within walking distance.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
827,Great Hotel and Excellent Stay,50,August 2013,"Great hotel, and excellent location. This hotel has the best location right on the beach so you can exit the hotel from where the pool is and get straight on to the beach. There are Beach Cafes/Restaurants right out the front of the hotel on the beach. Easy walking distance to shopping and Restaurants. Pool was great, nice to cool off after a day out sightseeing with a great swim up bar. Staff are friendly and Breakfast was great with Egg station, Bacon, Rice, Sossages to name a few hot foods, cerial, Toast and fruit. The only negative of this hotel that i found was the beds where hard and made it a bit uncomfortable for sleeping. But in saying that i would definately come back to this hotel a it was all about Location for me.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
828,Will come back again.,40,August 2013,I found the staff ever so helpful. They even remembered my name. The pool is great. And of a good size. The breakfast was ok and not of resort standard but it was still nice. Beach front views were great.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
829,"Average hotel, our spa treatment was unprofessional.",40,August 2013,"Good location by the beach to affordable warungs. Clean hotel, friendly staff, lovely pool...

My husband and I had couples spa treatments and found it unprofessional. Rather than the therapists leaving the room so we could undress and get under the sarong they asked us to undress infront of them. They asked us to change into the black undies provided prior to the scrub infront of them (they would hold the sarong up) I had to ask them to leave the room! Overall My treatment was fine, but my husband had quite an aggressive massage, and scrub was basically slapped on (his treatment was done by a male staff, do not know his nam, only remember he was 34.)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
830,Good but not fancy,30,August 2013,"We had a perfectly nice time at this hotel although it has obviously had less money invested in it than city hotels we'd stayed at earlier in our trip (Singapore and KL). The room was clean and tidy and everything worked. The pool is nice but v cold! Some times it was busier than others but nothing off-putting. Breakfast is OK but not resort standard. Not a problem for me as I'm not one for a full breakfast anyway. The spa did nice treatments but wouldn't have been good value without the 40% discount, although I wouldn't go anywhere near 'Lady Gaga'...in fact, I wonder if he's been fired yet!

Main complaint would be that I think this hotel being marketed at Seminyak is a bit of a stretch. In reality, the nearest 'area' is Legian/Kuta and the big resorts/high-class restaurants that are actually in Seminyak are a 20 walk away/20K in a taxi. Do not take one of the taxis that quote you 50K from the end of the road and refuse to use their meter!!! Rip off!

This coupled with the affordability of this hotel attracts a quite mixed clientele. We were on holiday for over 3 weeks and were spending accordingly but there were some CUBs who arrived during our stay and caused quite a stir with their anti-social behaviour. Don't worry though...they got chucked out and it helped us to bond with the other guest who were nice people like us!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
831,Lovely and very central hotel,50,June 2013,"We stayed as a family group in June for 2 weeks. It was great. The hotel is very comfortable with lovely staff who remember your name.
The food is quite good there. The breakfast has plenty of choice. The pool is gorgeous and the location of the hotel is prime. You only need to cross a lane way and you are on the beach.
There are massages available right at your doorstep on the beach as well as some great beach food. You can sit on the beach at sunset at one of the restaurants in the bean bags or with one of the locals you can buy a beer from.
The shops are not far away with plenty of money changers, food, massages and Bali shops with morning price!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
832,Karen and Steve,40,August 2013,"This is our second stay and we love it here. Pool is great and yes you can smoke and if you don't like it move away, not rowdy at all and we are older couple 47 & 50. Food and service is great. It is a 3 1/2 star hotel and don't pretend to be a 5 star, so go to one if you want that sort of hotel. Room always clean and stocked up everyday. Its not a cheap hotel, just affordable for the location right on the beach. Warungs out front with umbrellas, food and music, so relaxing. You can get a massage or Lisa will do your hair, nails etc out front. Also look for Benny Silver as well for great variety of Silver and leather jewelry. We stayed in deluxe which is a good size room with flat screen TV as well as a king bed. Will always come back here when we come back to Bali beautiful service, hotel people and great location. Stayed for 13 days in August 2013.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
833,Perfect location - fantastic staff!!,50,July 2013,"We have just returned from our fourth stay at the Pelangi and it is as good as ever. What's not to love? - perfect location on Seminyak beach where you can be in the pool watching the waves rolling in. One thing that keeps us coming back to the Pelangi, aside from the affordable price is the warm and friendly staff. We have never had a problem and we just love this place. Having breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the water is very special and the choice we had for breakfast was amazing - eggs & bacon, a selection of cereals, Indonesian specialties, fresh juice, toast, Danish pastries and my favourite - the beautiful tropical fruits. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Pelangi to anyone and we look forward to returning next time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
834,Budget hotel,30,August 2013,"We stayed here for 8 days during a 4 week trip around SE Asia. There was nothing wrong with the hotel... The staff were polite and helpful, rooms clean, breakfast had plenty of choice. However, as this was a relatively inexpensive hotel, some of the clientele were quite rowdy - drinking in the pool away from the swim up bar and smoking in the pool.

If you are looking for somewhere cheap, clean and on the beach for an inexpensive holiday then stop here. If you have a little more disposable income head for the 5* resorts that will have a more refined clientele. I will go back to Bali but I will avoid Kuta/ Seminyak and head to the warmer waters and more sedate pace at Nusa Dua.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
835,Great Location Friendly Staff,50,August 2013,"From the moment of our arrival the staff here were great, friendly, helpful and easy to deal with. I could only secure a superior room before leaving Sydney, but asked for a room with a balcony which became available the next day. Staff moved our bags to the new room whilst we were out shopping as promised. The hotel has a nice pool overlooking the beach. No jockeying for positions on the sun lounges each day. Right on the beach near the hotel are a number of warungs with bean bags and live music to sooth and relax at the end of the day. We found The Crystal Palace warung (restaurant) 50 mtrs to the left as you exit the hotel on the beach a great meal, cheap and lovely spot to watch the sunset have a cocktail or cold beer. Breakfast was nice, egg station, bacon, noodles/rice, cereals/fruit/juice dispenser with Danish pastries toast and pancakes to finish. Hot tea and coffee also provided. This is my 4th visit to Bali staying at various hotels. Pelangi rates as a nice hotel for me. I would return. If you want five star this is not your scene.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
836,Nice accommodation,50,July 2013,"We had a great time staying here. We found the staff very helpful and friendly.
The rooms were serviced every day. We had a free breakfast daily as part of the package and found the food very nice with lots of variety. We had lovely views of the sea from the restaurant.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
837,Pelangi Bali Hotel (Seminyak),20,July 2013,"We stayed at The Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak, it must have been a different hotel from all the other peoples reviews about it, whoever took the photos for the website must have been good at photoshop. Found the room small, housekeeping wasn't very good, dirty bathroom and towels and bedding were stained some days, Mouse droppings in the cupboard, not much benchtop space, breakfast ok. Staff were really friendly and helpful. We wouldn't stay again. Sorry.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
838,Very good hotel,50,March 2013,"We spent 4 days in this hotel.
The location is very good, it was not so busy. The rooms are big and clean! The breakfast was superb! There are nice bar nearby on the beach which makes it perfect to watch the sunset and enjoy a coctail!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
839,Great spot,50,July 2013,"This was our second stay at the Pelangi and it was still as great as it was 4 years ago. The rooms are clean and adequate and the hotel is wonderfully situated to walk as far as Kuta, and we are in our 50s, and the surrounding streets offer a variety of food for dinner. We especially liked the bean bags on the beach to watch the sunset and drink and have a lovely meal, this was not so popular 4 years ago.
Would really recommend this hotel,very friendly staff and well situated.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
840,Excellent staff and location,50,July 2013,We stayed for 5 nights. Arrived late at night and everything was organised. Loved being at a hotel that fronts right on the beach.Enjoyed having breakfast with the sound of the waves breaking. Pool also excellent and rooms a bit dated but very clean.Hotel is close to shops but love the peace and quiet of Seminyak. Breakfasts were your typical Bali style with the normal egg station. Will be back again hopefully in the not to distant future.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
841,Great experience,40,July 2013,"We stayed in a Superior room - clean, huge with King bed, lounge suite, bathroom, balcony right next to the pool and beach. We booked a few months in advance and specifically asked for a room near the pool end of the complex.
Best features:
-staff - from the porter to the restaurant and bar staff - unbelievably friendly and helpful.
-location - central to everything and right on the beach.
Worst features:
-The Gym - cardio equipment comprises 1 dated treadmill & 2 bikes.
-weak WIFI if that's important)
TIP: bring your own hairdryer!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
842,"Excellent staff, rooms and location",40,July 2013,"My friends and I stayed in a deluxe suite which was clean, huge and very close to the pool. The staff including the service, bell staff and reception were fantastic and could not be faulted. The breakfast was... Ok. Nothing to write home about but filling and the egg bar was a good addition.

I recommend this wholeheartedly though not the restaurant which is certainly ok but not 5 star.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
843,Celebration,40,June 2013,"Pelangi Beach Hotel was a good experience overlooking the beach and close to shops and restaurants. Room was clean and comfortable though a little dated. Service was friendly and professional.

One nice touch - had a birthday cake delivered to the room on the big day!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
844,Excellent Holiday,50,July 2013,"Stayed recently at the Pelangi Bali Hotel, we both enjoyed our stay and the room was great, the staff so friendly and nice and helpful.

The hotel was located right on the beach with great access for walking and shopping.

Will stay again on our next trip to bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
845,How fabulous,50,May 2013,"Took the family to Bali and stayed 10 nights at the Pelangi Bali hotel. The staff were fabulous very helpful and always there with a smile. Our kids were aged from 10 to 21 years and all enjoyed the hotel, pool and lovely breakfasts each morning. The location of this hotel is perfect. It's in walking distance to Kuta, surrounded by beautiful places to eat right on the beach and very close to Seminyak shopping. Not to impressed with the evening meals in the hotel. Quite expensive for Bali so ate on the beach most nights and loved it. We didn't try the spa as we had been recommended one near by. Can't wait to get back there again. Great value for money the rooms were spacious and very clean.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
846,"Wonderful staff, great location",40,May 2013,"This was a really nice hotel with clean standard rooms. The staff were very friendly and the room service was quite nice. The breakfast gave you a large selection to choose from.

We didn't try out the spa because we found somewhere cheaper up the road. The pool area was really nice and well maintained and the beach is right there too!

Overall this was a great, friendly place to stay at and I'd definitely stay there again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
847,"Wonderful hotel, hard to leave the Pelangi!!",50,July 2013,"Just had the most relaxing and fantastic holiday for 3 weeks at the Pelangi...we really did not want to leave. We had a deluxe room in a garden position close to pool and restaurant and beach. It was perfect. The room was large and comfortable. The air conditioning worked very well. The security of this hotel is also very good. The location is very central to all great shopping, restaurants and of course the beautiful beach with the famous Seminyak sunsets. All the staff at this hotel are very friendly and polite and fun to talk to. The buffet breakfast was very good. We are looking forward to returning to this hotel next year.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
848,What is not to like at the Pelangi,40,July 2013,"We are a family of 5 (parents + 3 tenagesers 15,16,17) we booked 2 rooms, a superior and a delux. The rooms were clean and reasonably appointed and had comfortable beds. the delux being the larger having lounge seating for 4 inside the room and a reasonable sized balcony, both rooms were upstairs. The superior room was a lot smaller and it would have been difficult for two people to sit outside at one time. Both rooms had renovated bathrooms (within the last 4yrs). The breakfast at the Pelangi is the measuring stick for bali resort breakfasts, the breakfast choices and the quality of the food are well above average the food was regularly restocked and the waiters and waitresses were extremly efficient. The resturant has been extended since our last stay and has a great outlook over the beach. The pool area has plenty of seating and we didn't have any trouble getting pool chairs even when busy. The staff were fantastic and we really enjoyed our stay vowing that next time it woud be longer. Several nights we encountered lound music from the bars on the beach which could have been a problem if we weren't so tired due to our day time activities.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
849,"Great location and staff, but overall, pretty average",30,December 2012,"A friend and I stayed at Pelangi over Christmas. The best part of this hotel is the central location, and the pool overlooking the beach. The hotel itself is dated and in need of some new energy. Our room reeked of mold, and our clothes stunk when we checked out. The included breakfast had quite a few options which was nice, but we ate elsewhere for the other meals. We had a massage at the Pelangi. I found it satisfactory, but my friends was not. I would recommend the Pelangi for young travellers who aren't looking for luxury, but rather an affordable, modest getaway located close to the center of town.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
850,Good stay by the beach in Seminyak,40,July 2013,"We were looking for an affordable beach side hotel nearby Kuta or Legian (away from the noise and bustle) and we found this gem in Seminyak. We booked a ground floor room for our 4 days trip. We had a complimentary airport pick-up and checking in was smooth with a refreshing welcome drink. The hotel compound is long; about 250 meters long stretching from the lobby to the beach front.

Our room was clean, spacious, comfortable, quiet and all the amenities were in working condition. Although a little worn out e.g. bed creaks slightly, stains on shower bath tub and scaling in kettle. Also I would have preferred if there was a ceiling fan. But it was great that the hotel provided travel adapters in the room at the electrical outlets which was a really nice thought.

We love the complimentary shuttle service to Kuta town. There's also a tour desk where you can book tours, hire a car and get information. However, the prices are slightly steeper than those available outside. We only used the tour desk to get a car for us to the airport on our departure day.

Complimentary breakfast was a continental spread with a mix of local favourites as well. There's plenty to fill you up. However, it was almost the same food every day. It would have been nicer if more dishes were alternated. The egg station was really good with eggs done any way you like.

Pool was clean and great too with the bar serving cocktails. And the view of the beach below was nice. However, I couldn't see any indication of water depth level at the pool and had to feel my way as I don't really know how to swim and preferred to just soak at shallower levels.

Overall it was a good stay with great friendly service. Love the quiet surroundings, short walk/taxi ride from great eateries and being by the beach. We would definitely recommend others to stay at this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
851,"Pelangi ""Rainbow"" Hotel and Spa",40,June 2013,"Pelangi Bali Hotel and Spa is strategically located in Seminyak, it is in the beach front of double six beach, where guests can both enjoy the lovely swimming pool with a bar and the beach at the same time. The staff are nice and friendly and they are very attentive to their guests request. The room is simple but nice, however it doesn't have a safety deposit box inside the room. The safety deposit box is available at the lobby though. The computer center at the hotel is available too for a small cost. We enjoyed the food from the restaurant and the breakfast buffet has a variety food to choose from. We also loved the spa, try their signature spa for a total rejuvenating and blissful spa experience. We stayed in the hotel for 7 days and we had a great time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
852,A perfect stay in Seminyak,40,June 2013,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from an amazing holiday to Bali and spent a week at the Pelangi Bali Hotel in Seminyak to avoid the craziness of Kuta.

The hotel was perfect for what we wanted it for, an ideal base to travel to different parts of Bali as well as spending days relaxing on the beach or by the pool. Lots of options for breakfast (great egg station), the pool and swim up bar was a bonus and the staff were friendly and helpful on all occassions, whether it be recommendations for places to visit or arranging drivers for days out.

The rooms were clean, spacious and done the job. The bed was comfy and I also had a good nights sleep with no real noise to keep me awake.

It was walking distance to great restaurants along the beach or in the main part of Seminyak.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
853,Great Basic Hotel in Bali,40,September 2012,"The hotel was very nice, Great service at reception and all over the hotel.
They really couldn't be nicer.
the rooms are good sized and clean, the decor is dated Balinese, very typical beach hotel.
The pool is really nice and the breakfast was well stocked with all types of food to satisfy many different appetites.
The location is Excellent, right on the beach. walk out the pool exit and turn left, just walk and there are many good places to eat right on the beach, walk further and you'll find Zanzabar restaurant. Great food, great prices and great service. that area offers many places to eat and drink.
If you walk back in town, there are small convenience stores that sell anything you may need.
there are also tons of bars and restaurants in a short walk from the hotel.
also on that street are at least 3 gay bars, that have shows almost every night of the week.
very entertaining!
all in all this was a great place to stay for a few days of sun and fun.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
854,Great stay,50,June 2013,"Just returned from our first family trip to Bali, wasn't exactly sure where to stay but wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of Kuta. So glad out travel manager recommended the Pelangi. Stayed in a deluxe room down the bottom next to the pool for 6 nights. Room was plenty big enough for 2 adults and 2 children and always clean. All staff very friendly. Pool was lovely. Breakfast plenty to choose from. Quiet at night. Friends commented prices for drinks and food at near buy restaurants and bars dearer than Kuta (only a few dollars). I feel the location was worth it. Little cheap laundry service about 200 metres down on back street at front of hotel. No problems with catching cabs. Would definitely stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
855,"Good hotel, beautiful view to the sea",40,June 2013,"The hotel is big and nice, the room is ok. The staffs are really friendly, they greet you every time they see you. The swimming pool is very nice and at one corner I can sit on the steps inside the water and see the sunset, drinking some wine. Fabulous experience!

The hotel is near some very good warungs and restaurants, which helps to reduce the taxi fare a lot :) There are many shops nearby too.

I like the breakfast even though I hope they can include more dishes in.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
856,Great Experience,40,June 2013,"The staff the the Pelangi Hotel were so helpfull, welcoming and friendly. The hotel is in an ideal location, being just out of the way of the busy streets and right on the beach. There are amaziong resturants just in fron of the Pelangi where you can eat and have drinks on the bean bags on the sand, live music, cheap food and drinks. Great choice of resturants towards Legian about 200m down the road.
The rooms have everything you need and are clean and tidy.
The breakfest was dilicious, a buffet every morning with lots of choices.
The swimming pool was really nice, not very big but has great veiws and has a swim up bar with really good service. Drink prices at the hotel are on the high side, and happy hour is only 2 days a week, however, drinks can be brought from the 'Circle K' stores for alot cheaqper and can be drunk at the resort. These stores are scattered about the streets, you will not miss them.
I would deffently return to the Pelangi hotel. Was very pleased with it and enjoyed my stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
857,Good value,40,June 2013,"Spent 4 days at the Pelangi 1 week ago. Great, friendly service, good Breakfast, fabulous swimming pool. Very cheap meals at restaurant but no atmosphere in the restaurant at nighttime. Beach not as good as I expected. Rooms clean and good value. Will return",Pelangi Bali Hotel
858,Great value,40,June 2013,"The most fantastic beach front position, great pool, and very obliging staff make this a great place to stay. It is also just a short walk to shops and restaurants.
This was my second stay in this hotel and I will return!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
859,Calming Spa,40,January 2013,As a single traveller I was made very welcome. The room was very comfortable but a bit dark. Complimentary buffet breakfast was more than adequate. I particularly enjoyed being able to step out of the hotel straight on to the beach and going for a walk early in the morning. The swimming pool was not very big but very pleasant for a cooling dip and a drink. Staff were all very helpful and I liked the calming atmosphere in the spa.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
860,great place!,40,June 2013,"very nice grounds, so close to the beach, very good rooms, lovely friendly staff ,nice people and restaurant. Our stay was great at pelangi bali and would recommend it for anyone going to seminyak. great value for money!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
861,horrible stay,20,June 2013,"I've been in this property the second week of June 2013. Unfortunately sleeping was impossible, because the disco music annoying in the night and the poor room insulation. The AC also did not work properly, so my room never cooled below 26 degrees. Clubs and pubs around were empty and boring.

Defenitely overpriced.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
862,"Friendly Hotel, great beach location",40,June 2013,Just returned from a long weekend. This Hotel is ideal for beach and shopping. The Superior Rooms are worth the extra for space and more daylight. Breakfast is a bonus and I loved the swim up pool bar. I will definitely say here again on my next trip.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
863,All staff are very helpful and friendly,50,June 2013,Staff at front desk are very helpful. Room service and house keeper are very friendly. Nice hotel with a nice pool and its so near to he beach and walking distance to bars....will definitely go back again......,Pelangi Bali Hotel
864,"Nice location, easy access to the beach and shopping areas.",40,May 2013,"We spent two nights at the Pelangi Bali. The hotel is nestled off the main road in Seminyak,with a back door access to the beach and various shacks. It's a cool 5-10 minute walk from the main street shops and restaurants, making it very convenient. We're glad we didn't stay in Kuta, between the traffic and the tourists, it seemed like a nightmare.

Pelangi Bali is a comfortable 3 star hotel, with a nice pool (though it was smaller than I'd had expected).The hotel food was average at best, and other than a basic breakfast we didn't care to indulge in it more.

The hotel is a little older, and doesn't have a very modern look. But I think that added to it's charm. Gave it a resort feel.

The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. We were well taken care of the entire time. The rooms are clean, spacious with a backdoor access to the pool/beach- which was very handy. For the price, a great pick.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
865,On the beach,40,May 2013,"I was wanting a hotel on the beach with views of the beach and also a swim up bar. From the bar you can see the ocean but no views from any of the hotel rooms. The rooms are a good size and the beds are comfortable. The down side is the hotel is on 2 levels and they only have stairs, pools on one level, reception on the other. The staff were friendly and helpful and i would stay again if Seminyak was where i needed to be.
We used the aura spa over the road for our massages and they were great, highly recommended",Pelangi Bali Hotel
866,"Great location, great price.",40,May 2013,"Part of my decision for choosing the hotel was both the location and the price. For it literally being beachfront without the high $$ was definitely the motivating factor. The hotel is a bit older and could use a little upkeep. The bed was comfortably although the room and bathroom did not have a clean feeling to it. There was a sliding glass door in our room that opened to a pathway to the pool which was very nice. The pool was very inviting and had gorgeous views of the beach where we watched the sunset. The service at the restaurant was very slow and the staff did not seem very friendly. We did not utilize the spa services provided although the prices seemed pretty high even it being advertised at 50% off. Front desk staff was efficient and happily provided us with a driver to take us to the airport the next day. Overall, for the price it is worth the stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
867,Great stay,50,May 2013,"I spent 7 nights at the Pelangi as was well impressed with the overall service by the staff. as a single female staying there and felt very secure and safe. Easy access to the beach, massages and great, cheap food as well as being well located for entertainment. The drivers used by the hotel were lovely as well",Pelangi Bali Hotel
868,Great location!,40,May 2013,"My wife and I were chasing a hotel right on the beach and with a swim-up pool bar. Pelangi did not disappoint. Location was fantastic! Swim-up pool bar made great drinks. Breakky was good.

Laundry was a bit expensive but I am sure there is cheaper laundry nearby outside if the hotel.

Ground floor rooms did not have a private balcony (no balcony at all actually). Rooms were ok. A little dated. The plug in our bath leaked so we couldn't fill up the bath. Only a CRT tv, not that we even watched tv while in Bali.

Oh, also the reception would not call metered taxis for us, only fixed price ones which I found strange.

Would I stay here again.....possibly. I think it is a little over priced for what you get.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
869,"Nice views, nice staff and nice part of Seminyak close to Eats, Shopping and Surf",40,May 2013,"Nice views, nice staff and nice part of Seminyak close to Eats, Shopping and Surf. Stayed here with family of 5, needed two adjacent rooms. Friendly english speaking staff eager to help, free 15 minute massages, comfy beds, clean bathrooms and cold air conditioning. Taksi (Taxi) costs very little to Seminyak Square, approx 12,000 rp, or $1.20AUD or $8AUD to Kuta. You can Surf right out front of hotel, or sit back by the magic kids and adult pool. Free brekky was pretty good, and they had Egg Chefs,on duty from 7am to 10am. Free shuttle every 2 hours from hotel, but we've never used as Taksi so cheap. Did the Bali Zoo, Bike ride, Bird Park, Ubud, Waterbom Park and Cheapy shopping. Check out Potato Head restaurant - awesome.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
870,Ninth Trip and have already booked for Tenth,50,May 2013,"Just returned from 2 weeks at our second home. Had an amazing time and the staff are now like family to us. From Adek in reservations, Eka at reception, Gustra and Murdi at the pool and Tari and all the wonderful staff at the Rama Restaurant, we love them all. We have booked to return same time next year but if our schedules allow will be sneaking another few days there before then, Seminyak is having a growth spurt and there are many more restaurants, hotels and shops opening up which is good for the locals. The Pelangi has one of the best sunset views in Bali ! Terima Kasih Di and Shaun xx",Pelangi Bali Hotel
871,Excellent Beachfront location and great vale for money.,50,May 2013,"A friend and I stayed at for a week in May. The hotel is quite cheap compared to others in Smeniyak. It isn't brand new but doesn't appear run down in the slightest. The rooms are cleaned every day, good air conditioning, free wifi, the staff are all very pleasant and helpful. Nice pool and right on the beach.

If you walk onto the beach and turn left you will come to Cacoon Bar and the Deck restaurant. I highly recommend the Deck. The beef tepanyak and the sushi is the best I have ever tasted. It is much cheaper than the other fine dining restaurant you'll read about on Trip Advisor.

If you take a left you'll come to SOS Supperclub. Take a taxi for 30,000 IDR to anywhere else. Everywhere in Seminyak is a 5 minute drive away. Don't walk along the beach to Ku Te Da or Potato Head, as you will need need to wade through a sewage river that runs from Eat Street (the busier part of Seminyak) directly into the sea.

Other fine dining places - Breeze at the Semaya (not to be confused with the Breezes hotel), the beachfront is beautiful. Watch out for the high 15% service charge. Ku Te Da for all day sunbathing, you can use the large luxurious loungers as a non staying guest.

Most of the taxi drivers also do all day tours. We took a taxi at 9am one day and visited Ubud, a couple of temples including one where you can dip into the holy waters and cleanse yourself, a coffee and fruit plantation and the monkey sanctuary. We finished the day enjoying fresh lobster on Jimbaran beach. The whole day cost 500,000 IDR between the 2 of us. You hire a driver all day and they will show you a map of the local attractions and you can tailor make you trip. I'd avoid visiting the painting, silver and sewing places if you don't intend to by anything. Paintings start at $100 US.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
872,"Fantastic, Clean, Friendly Hotel",50,May 2013,"This was my first trip to Bali and a friend recommended the Pelangi Bali Hotel. I hereby also highly recommend this hotel, with its friendly, professional staff and clean facilities it was a pleasure to stay there. The hotel is located centrally amongst great shops and having the resturant looking directly over the beach is wonderfully relaxing. The room was airconditioned and very quiet. The pool and grounds are kepted to a high standard. They organized 1 tour for us and were extremely helpful. The pick up and drop off they also organized was clean and tidy as well. I would higly recommend the hotel to anyone and look forward to returning with my family in a years time. Thank you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
873,Great hotel close the everything,40,May 2013,"This was my first trip to Bali and I would highly recommend this hotel. Great location close to all the good shops in Seminyak.

The building is a little older but the rooms are clean and fresh. The staff are just lovely and very helpful.
However I wouldn't recommend using the hotels tour service. We only used it being of the convenience however I'm sure if we had done a little bit more research we could have found our selected tour a little cheaper.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
874,Great Hotel for a relaxing time,50,April 2013,"This was my first trip to Bali in over twenty years. Had a great time. Staff are very friendly. Would recommend to anyone. Pelangi Bali Hotel was great. The rooms were nice, cool, aircon, very clean and good to sleep in. The location was perfect, near Legian and Seminyak, and right on the beach. The pool and bar were great for a drink and something to eat.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
875,Great value for money,50,April 2013,"This was my third visit to Bali and have stayed at the Pelangi each time. The location is perfect... right on the beach and right in the middle of a selection of clean and friendly restaurants to cater for all tastes. The rooms are cool, clean and comfortable, the staff are friendly and treat you like family (welcoming you 'home' on each return visit), the breakfasts offer anything and everything you could hope for in a hotel. The pool is ultra clean and offers a range of lounge chairs most with umbrellas to kick back and relax on while you watch the activity on the beach, or simply sit back and enjoy the waves and beautiful Bali sunsets. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Kuta available to all guests (bookings are easy) which leaves at regular intervals during the day. Return taxis cost next to nothing to get you home again. I intend returning soon and would not even consider staying anywhere else in the area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
876,Excellent Location,40,May 2013,"Pelangi was great. The rooms were nice and cool, with A/C, very clean and good enough to sleep in. We thought the location was perfect, in between Legian and Seminyak, and right on the beach. The pool and bar were great during the afternoons.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
877,Exceeded expectations,50,April 2013,"This is my first Trip Advisor review but I made a note when i got back that I had to do it, as this place really did impress. Its been 15 years since I've been in Bali and i knew i wanted to be far away from Kuta, but not too far away that we couldn't get from A to B on a scooter or in cab.
We chose Pelangi because of its location and price, and also that it was overlooking the beach- plus the pool looked pretty amazing (but they always do in the photos!)
We arrived late at night and the staff were great- quick check in, bags taken, cool drink, great service. Very relieved when we got to our room that it was aircon, and the bed/bathroom and everything was super clean. Beautiful king sized comfy bed.
In the morning we walked out to look around and almost fell over- the view of the pool and beach was just breathtaking. Beautiful traditional balinese architecture too. The buffet breaky was great, something for everyone, and gorgeous way to start your day eating on the deck overlooking the waves breaking. We only had dinner there one night, but the food was very good quality.
It was just a really lovely oasis that was aesthetically perfect and quite incredible for the price, it's close to the beach and shops too.
The staff truly outdid themselves and are beautifully mannered and so friendly- it was a reminder of what proper hospitality is supposed to be! I'd have no problems recommending this to all friends and family (as fussy as they are).
We will be back!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
878,"Well, it was my third stay there ...",40,April 2013,"I had enjoyed my previous stays, so booked in again. On checking in this time they acknowledged my previous stays and said they were pleased to see me back. Nice to be remembered. My birthday happened to fall during my stay and I was particularly touched to receive a happy birthday letter from the manager with a nice chocolate cake as a gift.
The staff are all very friendly and pleasant, at reception, housekeeping, restaurant and pool. The room was very comfortable. On one occasion the light in the bathroom needed replacing, and this was attended to very quickly.
Very little negative to say, except perhaps the food at breakfast tended to get a little monotonous, the chicken sausages appeared every morning. But then I guess beef or pork would have religious implications. Also be warned that it is a long hike from the front entrance to the restaurant, pool and beach.
But a lovely hotel and I would be happy to return yet again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
879,Outstanding Service!,40,April 2013,"Upon arrival at the Pelangi, we were not quite sure what to make of it as it was our first trip to Bali. The room was clean but a bit musty, but we guessed that was to be expected in such a humid climate. However, after our second day our experience there kept getting better and better. The hotel is much lower key than many of the super-modern hotels in the tourist strip, and probably not suited to those wanting a 'plush' or luxury experience. However, the setting was just beautiful, the pool and POOL BAR were a real highlight - great cocktails! All hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant stay and were well looked after but staff in the pool bar in particular, were extremely helpful, giving good local info and advice. Our only disappointment (if you can call it that) was that the breakfast cooks could use a bit of training to cook their eggs better.... they tended to always be dry and overcooked, as was the bacon. All in all, it was a great stay though, and we will definitely go back there again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
880,An Oasis from the Chaos!,40,April 2013,"We were checked in elsewhere but after looking at our hotel (and I use the term loosely) we headed for The Pelangi and checked it out! After a trip to Reception for room rates we headed to the nearest free WiFi and booked our room for many dollars less via the Internet and Agoda! The hotel is large and located on the beach. Our room opens onto the garden and is clean and bright with a huge bed.. A great pool with sunken bar, buffet breakfast and close proximity to many restaurants, makes for a great spot to stay. The hotel food for lunch and dinner is just ok but everything else counteracts that!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
881,Nice Hotel - Beautiful Position and vey friendly staff.,30,April 2013,"Have just returned from a 10 night stay at the Pelangi Bali Hotel.

Overall for the price it was pretty good.

1. Room was spacious, clean, ground floor opening on to a garden walkway. Very old TV and no DVD player which was a shame. Our airconditioning was not functioning as well as the one in the childrens room but was ok. The King size bed was extremely comfortable.

2. Pool was excellent plenty of chairs and umbrellas, clean and well positioned with a view of the beach and ocean. A swim up bar was good, but the bar staff could have been more proactactive in offering refreshments to those sitting around the pool.

3. Breakfast was good with a reasonable variety of food. Great Egg station. The fresh fruit was limited and the same each day. The pastries were not heated and not very palatable. For some reason the staff on duty for breakfast were not very attentive with offering tea and coffee or clearing used plates and cutlery - could have been a lot better.

4. Restaurant was average and not that cheap. Everything tasted the same. Many options outside the hotel though were great.

5. Spa - average - much better value and skill on the beach for $5 an hour! Or in day spas for about $9 an hour.

6. Gym - was terrible - electroninc equipment not connected to electricity - dirty, broken equipment - carpet filthy and bikes were not to be used by anyone over 70 kilos??!!
Better not to offer the facility at all.

All in all though a nice place to stay - handy to shops and restaurants, felt very safe there and was quiet and relaxing.

Thanks for a lovely holiday.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
882,Great pool,40,April 2013,"We wanted to stay somewhere close-ish to the airport before departing home and a friend recommended the Pelangi Bali Resort. The best thing about the hotel is that is sits just across from the beach. You can see the sea from the viewing section at the front of the hotel, and you can get a sea glimpse from almost anywhere in the great pool. The hotel restaurant is next to the pool and they played great music. I felt like we were at someones house, relaxing by/swimming in the pool. The rooms are simple and adequate. For $100 including breakfast for 2 and taxes, right on the beach, I felt that it was good value. We had a late flight, so stayed for an extra half day until 6pm ($50). We didn't actually leave the hotel until 8pm and the staff were really wonderful accomodating our needs. They allowed us to keep our valuables in the safety deposit box and let us use the pool and internet until we actually left. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are just wanting to chill out, swim and relax by the pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
883,Overpriced but OK hotel in good location,30,March 2013,"This hotel was in a good location right on the beach and close to shops in Seminyak. And fairly quiet. We took advantage of the shuttle to go into Kuta which was a very nice option. Taxi back cost around 30,000RP to 45,000Rp depending on traffic.

The room was comfortable and quiet. However for $100 USD a night, it seemed overpriced compared to other places we stayed in Bali and it needs some care----I regret not taking photos of the bathroom. The shower curtain looked old and worn out, and the bath towels and bath mats also looked old and worn. The shower water pressure was also a bit on the weak side.
Bathroom floor didn't seem very clean. It was definitely not worth the money and you are paying for the good location. Good selection of TV channels if you want to relax in the room.

The breakfast buffet was ok....there was an egg station hidden around the end where you can order eggs cooked as you like.

Didn't like the pool being right next to the restaurant/cafe. No privacy while swimming at all. Great location though to walk along the beach and close to many little cafes along the beach to enjoy a drink and watch the sunset.

Service--service at the reception desk seemed average, if not just ok. I called to book the room by phone and had to call again(48 hours later) when they hadn't sent any confirmation to my email like they said they would the same day. They also refused to call a regular taxi service for us (other hotels have always been happy to call the regular local taxis at no charge). They said they only allow hotel guests to use their private taxi car service(double the price of regular taxis) or we can walk to the street to get our own taxis! (You need to take care to get the proper drivers who use the meter--Blue Bird group taxis are good) Every time we returned to the hotel by regular city taxis we could enter the hotel without any problems though.

They did let us store our bags since we had a late flight. After our check out at noon, we left our bags and then we were able to use a complimentary room (for 15 minutes) to change/freshen up before we left for the airport.

Not sure I would stay here again--I think there are better value places for the money so I would look to stay elsewhere next trip.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
884,Great hotel,50,April 2013,"Just returned from 13 nights at the Pelangi. Fabulous location just across from the beach and easy walk to restaurants and shops. The pool is beautiful with plenty of sun lounges available.
We stayed in inter-connecting superior rooms which were clean and quite spacious. Personally l would recommend the ground floor as the balconies on the superior rooms upstairs are tiny. Breakfast was plentiful, although was little variety each day. The staff and service is exceptional. Would definitely stay at the Pelangi again, loved it!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
885,Good Hotel in a good location.,50,March 2013,"The Pelangi Bali may not be the best available in Seminyak for the price, but it is good enough to suit most people. The location is good, on the beach, not too far away from the main street. Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, but the hotel food is nice too, though a little expensive. The pool is great, with a good view of the beach. The Deluxe rooms are nice, the Superior ones are average and do not have good views. Try to stay close to the pool/restaurant if possible. The staff is attentive and nice. I would stay here again. The free wifi is convenient.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
886,Exceptional Hospitality,40,April 2013,"Just spent 10 nights at the Pelangi.. Excellent location easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and straight out to the beach.. Staff and customer service are exceptional so friendly and helpful.. Rooms are very clean and the pool is beautiful. Gardens and design are truely tropical Balinese. The pool area could have more umbrellas, shade in the pool bar.The communal areas require more fans, stairways and reception area.Good value for money, safe and trustworthy staff.. Restaurant food very good..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
887,Fantastic location but could use a spring clean,30,April 2013,"Just stayed 10 nights until 06 April 2013
good points: amazing location across from beach and within easy walking distance of shops, beautiful infinity pool, friendly and helpful, and trustworthy staff, clean rooms, all with balconies, lovely gardens and architecture makes most of position
not so good: communal areas have not been cleaned in a long time - e.g. staircases full of dust, dirt and cobwebs, interior corridors dirty and dark; breakfast, although good, is the same every day and they do not refill once food gets low",Pelangi Bali Hotel
888,Great Hotel,50,April 2013,"We have just stayed 5 nights at the Pelangi, the staff were wonderful and friendly the pool was fantastic, the room was clean. They gave us a birthday letter each and left birthday cake in the room. The breakfast was very good. We enjoyed our stay their and will definately stay again. Thank you everyone there",Pelangi Bali Hotel
889,Great location but could use a refurb,30,April 2013,"We stayed here for 6 nights in 2013. The room was clean, bed very comfortable, staff v. friendly & helpful, pool was a great size... but would agree with previous reviews that the hotel is quite dated and could use a bit of modernising. The housekeeping staff are also keen to get into your room in the morning and we were woken up before 9am on a couple of occasions so make sure you put the 'do not disturb' sign on your door if you want a lie in!

I think the best thing was the pool & the location - access directly to the beach (right next to La Plancha, Gado Gado and other great beach bars). There are so many places to eat just a few mins walk away. If you stay here make sure you venture out for dinner!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
890,CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!,50,March 2013,"beautiful place, beautiful features, beautiful food and beautiful people. made my stay so comfortable and enjoyable, always willing to help and always have a smile on their face, i will defiantly be staying there when i go back, we stayed for 11 days and it felt like home, the breakfast was incrediable also, huge variety",Pelangi Bali Hotel
891,Just OK,30,March 2013,"I stayed two nights towards the end of March. From the reviews read, my expectations were a bit higher. I stayed in a Deluxe. The room is standard, but roomy. The bathroom was two star at most. Towels were clean but slightly stained (all of them).
The breakfast was OK.
Wifi is very weak.
The pool is indeed lovely and direct access to the beach is great. This was one of the main reasons I chose the hotel. There is a very small path separating the hotel and beach which is used by both people for a stroll but also by motorbikes so don't expect complete quiet if you are lounging at the hotel pool and choose a chair overlooking the beach.
If you choose the beach, be prepared to pay a little bit to rent a lounge chair and umbrella (as it is not a part of the hotel).
Location is very convenient - within walking distance from shops and other restaurants. As others pointed out, the rooftop bar/ restaurant was closed (unfortunately).
Overall the stay was OK. I would probably choose a different location if I returned.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
892,Brilliant hotel!,50,March 2013,"Stayed here for 7 nights at the beginning of March.
The welcome was brilliant, staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive.
The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Room service was the full restaurant menu and was always quick to arrive.
The hotel is in a brilliant location - on the beach but set back from the main road and hustle and bustle of Seminyak. Was in a great location for tours to - every time we got picked up it didn't take long to get anywhere.
I would however recommend using a spa outside the hotel for better value for money.

Will definitely be back!
Travelled with my mother.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
893,Wonderful Experience but beware,50,March 2013,"Loved this hotel, and will now make it our Bali home for the future - have stayed in 6 other hotels over the last few years.
Staff very friendly - most in Bali hotels are - but the staff here were excellent. The food was above average for this type of hotel and reasonably priced. The pool was brilliant and the pool bar superb. Always choice of where to lounge - they could do with a few more umbrellas.
However our initial room (121) had a strong mouldy smell. We asked to change and this was done with no fuss at all. Room was perfect with very small balcony.
Met many people who were regulars here - one couple x15 times - not surprised.
Location is perfect - on the beach with sea breeze all day cooling the pool area. Close to many beach shack restaurants, and a short walk into Seminyak shops and supermarkets.
Amazing value for money - look no further.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
894,As pleasant as ever.,40,February 2013,"Our return to the Pelangi was up to our expectations.
The welcome was warm and friendly. Even the pool man greeted us with ""Welcome home""
How good is that.
The new drapes and chairs and coffee table gave the room a fresh lift.
The breakfast was as enjoyable as ever, this includes both food and service.
We enjoyed our time in and around the pool relaxing and enjoying the fresh fruit juices and view of the beach.
The proximity to the beach and the local Warungs/cafes that provide food, drink and entertainment is a real bonus.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
895,Decent hotel in lovely Bali,40,February 2013,We stayed at the Pelangi Bali Hotel for three nights. Hotel is a bit dated. Staff was as always in Bali very Nice and helpful. Breakfast is a bit limited but what you need. The pool is clean and Nice view over the sea.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
896,Helpful staff in Seminak,40,January 2013,staff was very nice and helpful. lockers in front of hotel so make sure that if you don't want to leave valuables at the front desk you bring a suitecase lock. Pool is beautiful and great for sunsets. Room is clean enough. Hotel is situated right off the main street. was very easy to book tours.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
897,Awesome amazing pool.,40,February 2013,Just had five nights here. Wonderful experience friendly staff. 50% off all Spa treatment great deal. The pool is clean cool and Amazing. Breakfast included sweet gotta love the egg station Pouched eggs to perfection. All in all a nothing to complain about. Sun is shining weather is sweet.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
898,9 nights at Pelangi,40,January 2013,"Just got back from a 9 night stay at the Pelangi. As with other TA reviews, yes the hotel is slightly worn however I cannot fault the wonderful service (staff always smiling, nice greetings). The pool is fine overlooking the beach. The rooms are standard however were always clean & neat. The location is great also. At the back of the hotel is the beach with a variety of bars & places to eat. There are also plenty of shops & restaurants within walking distance. The free shuttle to Kuta is also great. The tour desk at the front is fine & reasonably priced for your tours to Ubud etc....Breakfast was ok & not much variety. We had a massage there (50% off) & that was wonderful. Yes you can get cheaper massages however they were very professional & it was very good. Overall, it was a wonderful experience & would probably go back there for the hospitality & location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
899,Dissapointing,30,January 2013,"Stayed here for 9 nights jan 13

The hotel is quite dated, food ordinary, the rooftop terrace is not opened anymore so no sunset drinks : (

Pool is ok but pool bar very old and understocked

Front of hotel is on a dingy little backstreet , quite scary to walk out at night as its pitch black and always groups of local males hanging around the streets ready to harrass you",Pelangi Bali Hotel
900,"Great staff, great pool, great location",40,January 2013,"My family of 2 adults and 2 teenage children just spent 8 days at the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak and like the other recent positve reviews we found the Pelangi to be a great value hotel in an excellent location with lovely and helpful staff. The breakfasts are OK with a selection of hot food, cereals, bread, fresh fruit and egg station. The pool side snacks were great but we found it better to eat dinner out at some of the fabulous restaurants in Seminyak and the money you save staying at the Pelangi means you can eat out well. The Pelangi pool is a very good pool and being a beachside location means you can flit between the pool and the beach, though this time of year the Seminyak beach is not very clean. The swim up pool bar is a treat and the sea view is its own special attraction. We had 2 interconnecting rooms between the 4 of us which was only the standard room but they were spacious and clean if a little dated. The rooms were quiet and had working aircon and great water pressure in the shower. Housekeeping was done every day and nothing seemed a hassle for the staff. They would book whatever restaurants we wanted to go to and were helpful in giving local advice and tours. We had a late flight back home but not only did we have use of the resort facilities including luggage storage after check-out but best of all they gave us the use of a hospitality room with towels and toiletries for an hour before leaving for the airport to shower and freshen up in. The in house Siloan spa was great but the gym was just OK, pretty basic really. If you are after a good beachside hotel with a nice pool and really good customer service then the Pelangi is a great option.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
901,"On the beach with amazing sea-front view, a good all-round hotel, slightly well-worn",40,January 2013,"Perhaps slightly well-worn but still a very good hotel in a great location on the beach-front, close to the main shops. Staff service is very good in our opinion; we requested the bedroom floor be mopped due to sand and it was done immediately. They were also very helpful in all other matters, so no complaints at all.
The pool was just perfect, and breakfast a real treat (try the Egg Station where they cook it fresh to your needs) - the buffet choice was also very good.
The hotel restaurant is okay though not particularly great - best try the outside restaurants that are very close by. See my pics - the location is the best feature, sea views just amazing.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
902,Great Hotel,50,January 2013,"My husband and I have stayed at the Pelangi three times now - we love it! On our most recent trip we took some family along who had never been to Bali before. The Pelangi was a great place for them as first-timers. It is clean and comfortable and very good value for the price. It's in a great spot, located right on Seminyak beach, with lots of shopping and great restaurants nearby. The swimming pool and swim-up bar are fantastic. Breakfast is great and the food in the restaurant is delicious. What really makes the Pelangi a great place to stay is the lovely staff. They are just so friendly and welcoming and make you feel right at home. I was unwell for a day during our stay and the care and concern the staff showed me was wonderful. I recommend the Pelangi to all my friends and family who visit Bali and I'm sure we will return many more times.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
903,"Nice hotel, good value",40,January 2013,"Stayed here for three nights and had a pleasant experience - the design is in quite a traditional balinese architecture which is quite nice if you're not into the generic 'contemporary' chain hotels. Set in a cozy area in Seminyak with access to the beach and virtually just behind the one of the nicest beach side bar in the area.

The staff are very friendly but my advice is never take any advice from the taxi/transport counter. I'm Indonesian therefore I know how much a cab ride should cost, but they provide uncompetitive tourist price and for some odd reason you cannot hire a normal cab into the hotel lobby.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay but I think I might be able to find somewhere nicer in the area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
904,Great resort with fabulous pool,50,January 2013,Stayed here with six friend and we all loved it....great pool and great rooms. Buffet breakfast every morning looking out to the beach..beautiful... Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Bali and the staff are so friendly. Would defiantly stay here again next time so close to the beach and beach bean bag bars.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
905,Builders are in!,30,January 2013,"Staying at the moment and its ok,rooms are a little musty which is not unusual in humid bali.Next door the builders have moved in and are demolishing a huge complex with 2 rock hammers on excavators which go all day,breakfast is same same.pool is good,very close to beach but for the money could probably get something nicer especially as there does not seem to be many tourists around.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
906,Not too bad.. Average,40,December 2012,"Stayed there for 3 nights in Dec.. Hotel is ok, looks a bit run down. They could do more to improve the look of it. Breakfast is pretty average, not many choices and its the same good everyday. Egg station is great. Staff were very helpful and friendly... The food at the restaurant is pretty average.. Overall not a bad place but will prob stay somewhere else my next visit.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
907,Great Stay at The Pelangi!,50,December 2012,"We spent 10 nights at the Pelangi hotel in December and had a wonderful time. We are a young couple and are both students who dont really live the high life so we found this hotel everything we needed and more. The hotel is quite traditionally Balinese which I loved. If you want a modern hotel don't stay here- I think if you are travellling to Bali it is best to have the whole experience which the Pelangi offers. We stayed in a superior room which was a nice size and clean. The rooms have a great air conditioner I slept like a baby each night. Beds are quite hard, I still slept fine. Staff were always friendly and would always try to accommodate any needs we had. They always greet you with a lovely smile! Breakfast was included each day, it was always enjoyable enough, nothing amazing. Food includes an egg station, bacon, juice, cereals, sausage, potato and nasi goreng. Lunch and dinner menu was quite nice, we often got room service (the pelangi beef burger is a delicious snack). The highlight of the hotel is the pool and beach front location. The pool was always perfect temperature and there was always plenty of sun beds to enjoy a cocktail overlooking the beach. The hotel is also very close to shops and restaurants in both Legian and Seminyak. It is by no means a 5 star resort, however for roughly $95 Australian Dollars a night I don't know what more you could expect. Great value for money! Would stay here again for sure.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
908,Disappointing,20,December 2012,"Staff attitude and lack of understanding (couldn't understand diet coke, he had to bring a menu and we had to point to it) do nothing to help this dated hotel. Compared to when we stayed here last time, things have gone downhill. Besides staff issues we experienced. The level of cleanliness is worse. Gray towels and sheets and stained bathtub. If we were able to change our flights we were willing to leave. On the us side the pool and view of the ocean from the pool and pool area are wonderful. No need for a renovation simply an Improvement in staff and cleanliness.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
909,Why even bother,20,December 2012,"Came here 4 years ago. Wasn't too bad. Disappointed I came back. Rooms very tired. Staff couldn't care less. They dont have the same customary care factor. Wifi, while nice to have, is extremely slow and does not work on most occasions. Towels/linen not clean. Breakfast is a joke. Ate out every morning. Had lunch once. Yuk! Walk along the beach to gado gado or the little huts.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
910,Great location & Value,40,December 2012,"I was very skeptic when booking this hotel. We wanted to have beach access hotel and great location. The price seems good for the Christmas holiday season. I guess my expectation was not too high so my experience turn out pretty good. The room is very clean, staff was helpful. The pool is nice. we love the deck with lounge chairs area over looking the beach. Breakfast was not too great but love to sit at the restaurant with ocean view for breakfas, for the price we paid, can't complaint too much.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
911,Good value and location.,40,November 2012,"Good value for $100/night in room 113. Location is right on the beach and you get breakfast daily. The rooms could use a little updating; the pink in the room was a turnoff initially, but I was able to overlook after a while.

Major drawback is the WiFi in the rooms - inconsistent service. And, there was only one outlet in the room to be used and they did not provide an adapter like other hotels I have been at. Best WiFi reception is at the restaurant, the pool and the lobby. Be prepared - the WiFi is kind of slow.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
912,Great Place,40,November 2012,"I signed up to this site just to write a review. I read so many of the reviews on here just before I left, and after reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried. But after staying at the Palangi and making my own informed decision I have to say that there is nothing to worry about. The hotel is an older style Balinese hotel, but Its still great, If your looking for something modern then perhaps its not the place for you, But if your a big fan of the beach, great customer service, a clean room, brilliant pool and fantastic day spa then this place is the go!! The day spa was soo good we went 2 times during our stay. The breakfast buffet has a big selection of every kind of egg at the egg station, the best bacon, pancakes, french toast, pastries, toast, veggies, fruit, ceral and either rice or noodles. Not to mention tea, coffee and juice. So if thats not enough of a breakfast selection then I have no idea what is. The other bonus is there are some cool bars on the beach where you can chill at night, sitting on a bean bag and watching the waves come in. The hotel is a close walk to cocoon beach club and the main shopping strip. I recommend this hotel for sure and would most certainly stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
913,What a disappointment,10,November 2012,We (1 couple 1 single) (2 rooms) booked in for 3 nights but did not bother to unpack our bags. The foyer was impressive but stiffling hot. A long walk along a corridor led to our rooms. Although clean and all facilities being provided we were not impressed. The balcony was so small that you could not sit outside. It felt oppressive. When we decided to book out the staff were most helpful and even recommended other accommodation.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
914,Wonderful Trip,40,February 2012,"First visit to Bali and my wife and I are very pleased with Pelangi Resort. The greeting was very nice simple and friendly. The rooms are nice spacious and clean. The Hotel is located on the beach and features a nice selection of restaurants and bars. A good stroll towards the main shopping area of Seminyak for souvenirs, restaurants and spas.

The restaurant breakfast selection had a good variety and featured some local dishes as well. The service was warm and always very helpful suggesting places to visit.

we will be staying here again when we return to Bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
915,Excellent value for money,40,October 2012,"Just stayed here again for the 8th time,and just as good as ever !
This hotel is excellent value for money. with clean and comfortable rooms
( not luxurious, but not luxurious prices either)
The staff are the best i have ever met , and the breakfast buffet is absolutely superb",Pelangi Bali Hotel
916,Good value beachfront hotel in seminyak,40,April 2012,"Have stayed at the pelangi twice & both times were enjoyable. Sure it's a little dated as people have noted but who cares.

Location is great to restuarants, nightlife, shops, spas & the 'bean bag' bars on the beach in the evenings are right at your door step but the noise does not filter through to the hotel.

Rooms are sufficient and buffet breakfast has pretty much anything you need.

The pool area can get a little busy at times & hopefully there isn't any large loud groups who 'take over' the entire pool area & pool bar. It really is unpleasant when a big group of people disrespect other guests & we witnessed people smoking in the pool & taking their glass bottles in the pool & yes they did break. Staff should really be more strict on these type of guests. In saying this I only witnessed this on one of my stays & the pool staff are friendly. The pool aea can also be very relaxing & enjoyable & is a great spot to watch the sunset.

I would return again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
917,Pelangi was Great,50,November 2012,"Just back from 10 days stay at the Pelangi Bali Hotel.
After reading very mixed reviews,I was a little apprehensive.
However , on arrival, we were met with a beautiful cool drink & a very refreshing cold towel while we went through the check in process,which was quick & the reception staff very informative & pleasant.
The hotel was lovely right from the first sight, upon entering the driveway on arrival,through to the lobby. Beautiful Balinese statues & water features made it all seem like an oasis after battling the Bali traffic. Also very clean, the staff very welcoming .
A wonderful man by the name of Wynum took our suitcases & us to our room,which was a deluxe twin.
The room was spacious,clean & a lovely balcony with a view over the pool.
At first I thought this will be noisy,but no, once the balcony door was shut,seemed to block out any noise.
Pelangi is in a perfect spot right on the beach with many beach restaurants & bars right outside the property. We loved the bean bags on the beach & the live music that seemed to be on every night.
The food was great & very reasonable in price & once again the staff left us wanting for nothing.
All staff were happy & loved to have a little chat & never forgot your name.
Our room was cleaned & fresh towels supplied every day along with 3 bottles of water free of charge.
Housekeeping did such a good job.
The tour desk in the lobby was also very good,always asking how we enjoyed whatever tour we had booked upon our return.
The pool was amazing as well.
Buffet breakfast was really nice,egg station had the best omelette's & a good variety of other foods.
My only little gripe,was that breakfast was not included on checkout day,as checkout time is 12pm (lunch time ) it would have been nice to have it included on the last day.
All in all, we loved our stay at the Pelangi & would absolutely stay there again & again ....

Well done Pelangi & all the staff.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
918,Cheap with a view,40,November 2012,"Stayed at the Pelangi for 4 nights rooms were a little dated, need a lot of care, but the pool area and the beach makes up for it. great restaurants, bars along the beach and you must have a Massage by Ruty on the beach for around $8.00 for a full body massage. another let down was a lack of poolside service which was disappointing, and Housekeeping could be a little more thorough with replenishing amenities. I would only stay there again for the. Beach and a Magnificent Sunset.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
919,Happy Traveller,50,November 2012,"We stayed at the Pelangi for ten days returning 12th of November 2012. On arrival we were met by very friendly and professional staff. The rooms were of a good standard, clean and larger than we expected, Beautiful clean white sheets on the bed everyday. Fantastic location, little Duff, Duff bean bag bars on the beach, wonderful pool, we spent most evenings swimmiing and watching the sun go down. Eat street in Seminyak (Oberoi Street) was only a few minutes away or $1.00 by Bali Taxi. All of the staff at Pelangi were exceptional, extremely friendly and efficient. Legian (the best shopping) is a short walk along the beach or somewhat longer journey by taxi. We would definitely return to Pelangi - just wish we had found it sooner, we have been to Bali more than 20 times (lost count) and were really surprised with the standard. Well done Pelangi, see you again soon.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
920,OVERALL NOT BAD,40,November 2012,"We have just spent 4 nights here, and picked this hotel after staying at the Pelangi in Langkawi which I have to say we preferred out of the two.

The good things about this particular hotel are as follows:-

Great pool.

Right onto the beach so great to watch the sun go down.

Room service was very good and any food ordered from the in room dining menu was delivered hot and very quickly.

Very friendly staff.

The not so good things:-

Lots of mosquitoes especially in the bedroom, so would suggest you take some spray for the room to help eliminate that problem.

We had room 310 which was very large however there was only one small air con unit which really struggled to keep the room cool enough, maybe if a fan was fitted above the bed that would help.

Only six hangers were provided, so I would suggest that you pack a few more if you are going to stay than longer than a few nights.

We had a very large bed which would have been really comfortable, however it was two singles pushed together so there was a ridge between the two of them and a dip which we keep falling into the whole time.

The breakfast for us was a real disappointment.

All the food was buffet style, so food that was supposed to be hot was cold, and alto there was an egg station, after two mornings of eggs tasting 'off' we gave up having them. Also the tea was so weak it could hardly get out of the pot, and the coffee so strong you could stand your spoon up in it.

The whole breakfast experience is as other reviewers have said very uninspiring, which is such a shame because as I mentioned above, the room and bar food was very good and very nicely presented. If we were to stay here again, we would not pay for breakfast to be included but would wonder up the road to Cocoon.

The other disapointing thing is as the hotel has a wonderful pool and overlooks the beach, its such a shame that the bedrooms do not, and all the balconies face onto one and other so you get very little privacy and no view whatsoever.

None of these issue's would be deal breakers or put us off staying again, as overall we had a good time, but we would choose a smaller room so its more comfortable regarding the AC and forget about having brekafast there.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
921,Much better than expected,40,September 2012,"The Pelangi is in a great location, close to shops, bars and some great little restaurants, the Crystal Palace being one of our favourites. We were there for six nights and found the staff really friendly and accommodating. The room was a standard, all we wanted as we did not spend much time in there during the day. Despite some reviews the room was spotless and cleaned thoroughly every day. The bed was comfortable and the balcony small, but big enough to enjoy. The gardens are lovely and immaculate and the view from the dining/breakfast area fantastic. Breakfast was fine, nothing fancy but the girls on the egg bar made a great omelet. We did not have any other meals there as there are so many other options around. the wonderful Chez Gado Gado is a very quick quick stroll just up the road.
I recommend the Pelangi, there are more glamorous hotels but this hotel offers value for money, and we had a great time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
922,Good 3 star hotel in great location,30,October 2012,"I found the Pelangi Hotel to be in a great location right opposite the many little beach bars, walking distance to shops and restaurants and with beachfront access.
I did find that the beds were way too hard for me, however my friends found them just fine so that is of course a personal thing. The rooms are spacious although a little tired looking and they could use a refurb. The upstairs room balcony is really small and there is nowhere to sit. The downstairs rooms don't have any verandah as such but most people just put their chairs on the garden however there is no privacy when doing that.
The swim up pool bar was just a lovely spot for afternoon drinks and was never too busy or rowdy.
Rudi in their Spa gives the absolute most amazing deep tissue massage I have ever had.
In general the staff were friendly and professional. The restaurant staff could use a smile more!
Over all I would recommend this hotel as a good 3 star hotel and reasonable value for money. I also stayed at the Jayakarta on this trip and would definitely recommend the Pelangi over that similar standard hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
923,Well located and value for money,40,October 2012,"My husband and I have recently returned from a 10 night stay at the Pelangi Hotel. It is the typical older style Bali resort which we prefer,very clean, great pool, and the staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in the deluxe room which was clean, huge and very comfortable, cable TV, air con, safety deposit box and sitting area. I think it was definitely worth the extra cost, however I did see the standard room and it would be ample size for two people. The location is excellent, right on the beach and walking distance to great shopping and eateries. The warungs outside the resort on the beach are excellent, great food and very cheap. The only negative aspect of our stay was the breakfast. Not the usual spread of fare and variety that you expect in resorts and we found it to be a bit bland and boring. However given all the positive things, the breakfast would not be a deal breaker for us, cheap and yummy food can be found close by if you prefer. Would definitely stay again and would have no hesitation in taking our kids there as well.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
924,Right on the beach,40,November 2012,"Rooms are well sized, clean and tidy. Cable TV, no safety box in our room. Buffet breakfast included (was fine but not inspiring), nice pool and the restaurant/Pool area exit directly onto the beach. At the $100 per night we paid it was good value for money for the area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
925,A Great place to stay and Great Location for the price,40,October 2012,"We stayed at the Pelangi from 6-13 October. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this hotel was. Our room (111) was perfect for us, on the ground floor, just the standard room but big enough for 2 people, I am glad I didn’t pay the extra money for a deluxe room we were only in it to sleep. We did have a clothesline over the bath which was handy. It was amazingly quiet in the room we couldn’t hear anyone in the rooms beside us, a first for us in Bali. No there isn’t a safe in the room but they have security boxes in reception. We found wifi didn’t always work in our room, but it did in the restaurant, but no big deal for us. The staff were very, very friendly, the breakfast was more than adequate, I can’t understand people who complain about a buffet breakfast, what do they eat at home? There bacon was the best I have ever had, they chopped it up into small pieces and it wasn’t all crispy like most hotels in Bali The pool was clean and they have a lot of pool beds so there was always enough to go around. They also didn’t play loud raucous music around the pool, it was easy listening music a bit of a change from the hotel we stayed in last year. We loved the location, looking out to the ocean at breakfast and lying around the pool was so relaxing. The little restaurants on the beach were so cheap for an evening meal, we didn’t spend much more than $12 for the two of us. There was also a choice of a bit more up market restaurants along the beach front further down and they were excellent as well and still not expensive compared to eating out in Sydney. We have been to Bali many times and we really liked this hotel and would definitely return. We could not find one thing to complain about with this hotel. The only thing I would complain about was the group of young Australians who got drunk at happy hour in the pool and were yelling and making a complete nuisance of themselves and then let off firecrackers in the corridors outside the rooms. Sometimes I am ashamed to be Australian in Bali. Fortunately the security put a stop to their misbehavior before bedtime. Fortunately we left the next day so didn’t have to put up with them for very long. The people who say a hotel is tired in Bali just don’t understand how hard it is to maintain a place in such tropical conditions. I don’t go to pick fault with a room, I go to have a relaxing holiday",Pelangi Bali Hotel
926,beautiful place!,50,December 2011,"Stayed at the Pelangi for a friends wedding and had a great stay.
The rooms were clean and tidy, the breakfast buffet was delicious and the pool was majestic if you went for a swim at sunset.
The only complain i would have is be very careful using their electrical appliances - my friend nearly electrocuted himself using the iron they lent us - after that i wasn't game enough to use the hair dryer.
But all in all the service and hotel amenities are fantastic.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
927,Experienced traveller recommends,40,October 2012,"Bali is a mixture of the old and the new. Nothing perfect, nothing horrible.
Reception staff were efficient and friendly, the guy on the travel desk was polite as hell but spoke monkey English and I'm quick to be critical. Late October, the heat was 41C (105F), max. humidity built up before the rains arrive. Deadly.
So to walk 1000 paces to an ATM was horrible.Air conditioned cab to shops or markets at Kuta , Legian etc $4.00 , cab to ATM $2.00. It was smarter to take ALL cash to Bali and leave stash in the hotel strong room. No safe in room is no biggy.Aircon in room quiet and cold, magnificent.
No drawers in room wardrobes is big downer. Old Bali had no drawers. Dang. Shelving in my view is crap. My wife didn't mind so....whatever. But it does reflect the old-fashioned character of the resort. I'm quick to not like OLD, not like TIRED, quick to look for RUN DOWN but this is OK.
Cheap (Superior Grade) room No. 116 was very big, shaded, bed comfy, no noise and just the right distance from the pool (which is adjacent the beach at the rear of the property). The dining room is adjacent the pool/beach at the rear. All very lovely. And clean.All very clean.
Beachfront Warung restaurants are same price as hotel ($50.00 dinner for two) and are grunge
character, may as well eat at the Resort which, by the way, has plenty of variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Other reviewers said no variety must be VERY picky.
No good markets within walking distance is a downer. We like to shop in markets but cabs are SO cheap!!.
So, nothing perfect, nothing horrible , we had a VERY good time and everyone we met at the Resort were satisfied that they had no complaints/ in fact had good time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
928,Not to be recommended,20,October 2012,"Lukewarm reception,very average room,1.5 M2 balcony.
Good breakfast,nice pool and view.
Beach very average and full of noise on the small road boarding it.
Back to Sanur next time.
Been 9 times in Bali;certainly the worst hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
929,Exceptional location,40,September 2012,"My family and I stayed at Pelangi for twelve nights. All I can say about it is how fantastic the location is. Near great main streets and right on the beautiful Seminyak beach , with great beach bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is quite dated but is very clean and nice, with an exceptional pool. If location is important and your on a budget, I recommend it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
930,Relaxing stay at the Pelangi,40,May 2012,"This review is a long time coming - I have only just joined up as a member. We stayed at the Pelangi in May 2011.
We chose the hotel due to its good location and great price (I think we paid AU $900.00 for ten nights). It was the first time I had booked a hotel myself, rather than through a travel agent but it was all ok (I booked through Expedia).
The rooms were clean and a decent size and in my opinion, good value, especially at $90.00 per night. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were out and about a lot.
The breakfasts were fine and I loved the pool - being able to swim in the pool whilst looking at the ocean was amazing. When we first arrived I was a bit concerned about how many sunbeds there were but we never had an issue getting them when we were at the pool.
All up, I found the hotel to be good value at $90.00 per night. For that price in Melbourne you can barely stay at a backpackers.
Other notes - the small hut restaurant on the beach in front of the hotel served amazing food - especially Nasi Goreng - and even better cocktails - I had quite a headache one morning!!
Bali Spa on the road leading to the hotel was also great - a bit more expensive than most for massages but a really lovely, upmarket, relaxing experience. Even my husband had a massage there. Ultimo restaurant in Seminyak's 'eat street' was amazing (Italian food).
Also, if you do any white water rafting/horseriding etc, book with one of the guys in the small stalls out on the road - you can bargain with them much more than the people who sit at desks in the hotels.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
931,Will definitely return!,40,September 2012,"We stayed here for a week in September for our honeymoon and had the most excellent time. Rooms were clean, staff were excellent and the facilities were absolutely fantastic. Everything is in walking distance from you, shopping, eating out (great little place close by called delicious onion is unreal) and there was plenty if surf spots close by. Yes there are better places to stay in the Seminyak area, but this place definitely is the best value for money!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
932,Very happy with our stay,40,September 2012,"I recently stay at the Pelangi with a group of 23 , from 14th Sept til 29th sept 2012.
i'll start with the bad points , if you book 9 months inadvance you would think all the rooms should be close together ,, ( although some of our tribe left after 9 days , they were more than willing to change our other guess next to us ) .
Floors should be mopped everyday , not swept , and finally , there was no safe in the room.
Now the good points , lovely pool, swim up bar , great staff, best pool and veiw of the ocean i've seen here, especially at dusk . Great breakfast .
So overall i'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 .
Would stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
933,Recent Pelangi stay,30,September 2012,"Only spent 1 night here but was disappointed on a few levels. Staff were friendly and attentive but many areas of the hotel are looking tired and the cleanliness of our bathroom as well as communal restroom areas was not quite up to scratch.

Well located on the beach in a nice part of Seminyak, plenty of other options available.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
934,Mixed reviews all lead to a positive stay. :-)),40,July 2012,"Before going to stay atPelangi i read so many mixed reviews. I just wish that hotel management would comment here to help solve some of their feedback
We stayed and in our party we had four rooms three of our rooms were exactly as requested ground floor and close to the pool. Ine room we had nit specified where location was to be but it was fine on 2nd floor Rooms were spotless as were all public areas of the hotel. Staff absolutely beautiful and would go out of their way to help fullfill allrequests. Pool was spotlessly clean.
We found breakfast became a little boring but we did stay two weeks so sometimes this happens. Just more variety of fruits, grainy bread etc would of been nice as breaky is quite expensive for bali.
All room service etc was fine.
Location was perfect for us as each time we return to Bali we try and get a little further away from the complete hussel n bussel of central Kuta. Plenty of great little places to eat close by. Bean bag bars right out front. Easy to get a bluebird taxi just down the lane way near to Breezes Hotel. Walk easily to Carla spa, Bali spa etc.
Surf out the front or a massage on the beach.
I read the rooms were small but to be honest i found them fine. I guess if you want to sit outside you just have a small area but we were hardly in or near our rooms for long.
Happy to answer any queries about this hotel but i think it was value for money and have no hesitation in recommending it to others. Safe travels all :-)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
935,First time in Bali,40,September 2012,"Tried the Pelangi to see what Bali is like. Stayed in September in a standard room on the ground floor (no view). Room was small, but adequate and a/c works well. Large hard bed. We didn't get much noise from neighbours or plumbing. There is no lift. Cleaning could have been better, but was OK.

The best features of the hotel are the pool and beach frontage - beach was clean while we were there and there were no bad smells. Very friendly staff and you can't help getting to know other guests, so a good atmosphere. Breakfast overlooking the pool and beach is great, but no variety in choice so boring after a week. Didn't try the hotel restaurant for dinner, and not many others did either. Some good food outlets nearby on the beach and Chez Gado Gado nearby, plus the usual masseurs and hawkers. Shops are 5-10 minutes away. The hotel shuttle took us in to Kuta and walking back on the beach took an hour.

Guests ranged from young families to older couples, with one large group arriving just as we left (thankfully) and mostly Aussie. Good value, especially if you don't need the extras that other hotels offer, but might try a better room next time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
936,Back to Legian next time...,30,August 2012,"We stayed a week in August at Pelangi after just over a week at Tuban. Normally we stay in the Legian area, but decided to explore a bit this time.

We stayed in a deluxe room, upstairs (305). When we checked in, our room wasn't ready, so we were put into a super-deluxe until later that evening when our room became available. Basically the deluxe and super deluxe are the same-same, but different(!): same floor area, however the super deluxe has a corner spa and slightly better furnishings. For the money, I would stick with the deluxe.

The Pelangi is a small, functional hotel. I would consider it 3 star, not 4. The rooms are spacious, clean and well serviced, with nice linen (so often in Bali we find the white towels are grey...), and everything worked well (appliances/air-con/hot water). Breakfast was very average compared with last place we stayed. For us, Pelangi lacked personality, especially at reception. Don't get me wrong, the service is efficient. The staff were nice, without being personal/friendly/engaging. I wonder whether this is a hotel management policy?

The big attraction for us about Pelangi was the beach-front location (during the day). I loved being able to see the surf from the balcony in the morning and watching the lads clean the pool and get it ready for the day. The beach-front is lined with quaint warungs that are great for lunch and reasonably priced. Having said that, the beach front location also became a massive negative at night-time: the same quaint warungs become noisy clubs trying to out-doof-doof one another. The noise is incoherent and incredibly loud - it felt like a night-club was right outside our door... when we mentioned it to reception, they agreed it was very loud and that we had no chance of getting any sleep until midnight (when the warungs closed) and hoped that there would be 'regulations' soon banning the warungs from playing the loud noise... they did not apologise and were unable to change our room as they were fully booked. According to others staying at Pelangi, you cant hear this noise downstairs or closer to reception. I wouldn't have stayed here if I'd known about the noise...

Pros - beach-front location, very clean
Cons - impersonal, the night club doof-doof from the beach front warungs at night.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
937,Palangi Bali,30,September 2012,"I stayed here for a few days.
This was rated 4 star but defintaley was more like 3 star..
Rooms were clean but small..
Location was ok however the beach area is smelly and dirty. It was tucked away in a side street about 5-10 min walk into the main strip of cafes..
It was value for money based on the fact it is beachfront.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
938,great friendly relaxed atmosphere in an amazing setting,50,September 2012,"we have stayed at the pelangi 3 times now and we call it our second home, its clean and comfortable and affordable, the staff are so helpful and friendly, the pool with swim up bar over looking the ocean is its best attribute, it's certainly not the most up market hotel around but its a very traditional type therefore the guests are very relaxed with a friendly atmosphere , each time we have spent time at pelangi we have made some wonderful friends. we would never consider staying anywhere else in bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
939,Fabulous !!!,50,September 2012,"My 5th time in Bali. My 4th time at The PELANGI. Would not stay anywhere else but here. I have my birthday celebration here last night. What a fabulous night. The hotel put on a beautiful cocktail party for me , left me a surprise cake in my room fridge & made everyone have a fantastic night. The staff here are my Bali family. The PELANGI is close to everything - restaurants, shops....would not stay anywhere else
THANK YOU PELANGI XXXXX",Pelangi Bali Hotel
940,NICE HOTEL,50,August 2012,"Maantaaaap bro,nice swimming pool,nice beach,nice room with bathtub,nice view,nice location...nice everything",Pelangi Bali Hotel
941,Will Be Back For Sure! Karen and Steve.,50,August 2012,"We have just come back from spending 10.5 days at the Pelangi. The location is the best, right on the beach and we dined a few nights and found the food very nice and reasonable. Rooms were clean and Deluxe very spacious. Rooms were cleaned and stocked up every day. Staff were very friendly and fantastic, nothing too much. Great security in the hotel as well. The hotel is a traditional Balinese hotel which adds to the character. I didn't find it old at all, we are in Bali so what do people expect. If you want to be a snob and have a luxurious hotel, well go to one then. This hotel has everything you need, swim up bar and beautiful pool, great staff, beachfront location, great food, clean rooms and night time dining as well as Balinese dancers on certain night and a band playing another night. Fantastic eateries along the beach and if you want a massage look for Sumi straight out the front as well as Lina for a foot massage and Lisa to do your nails, hair and paint toenails. Also free shuttle bus to Kuta 3 times a day. Seminyak shops are just around the corner and if you get a chance, hire one of the scooters out the front for $5.00 for 24hrs.
Overall we loved the hotel, the people and location and hope to be back very soon
Thank you Pelangi Hotel for a wonderful stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
942,Another wonderful stay at Pelangi Bali!,50,August 2012,"We have stayed at Pelangi Bali many times now and it never disappoints. The staff are really friendly, the location can't be beat and the rooms are bright and clean. We are looking forward already to our next visit!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
943,Excellent stay in Seminyak,50,June 2012,"Booked this last minute through a travel agent and I was pleasantly surprised, this modern hotel is right on Seminyak beach with a large well designed swimming pool (with swim up bar) and modern clean average sized rooms. Lots of restaurants within an easy walk and there are great beach shacks serving up cocktails on beanbags in the evening just outside the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful at check in/out. I enjoyed my stay and will return.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
944,We will be back,50,August 2012,"Just got back from 5 days at Pelangi with only good things to say about this Hotel. Great location clean rooms and super friendly staff. The location of this hotel makes for a perfect stay in Seminyak, step out front the hotel and you are right on the beach with everything on offer in the way of food and drink, if you want to venture futher afield most main attractions/shopping are just a short cab ride or walk. Breakfast was great with all the usual on offer and no skimping on the assortment. Free wifi in the room and around the pool area a bonus. For what you are paying you get a great hotel in a great location all round its great value for money! Pool is just the right size and split into two zones so kids are kept at bay whilst those looking for a kiddie free holiday can get some space at the poolside bar or down the deep end. The1 hour unused towel removal system means no mad rush in the moring to try and find a spot so we had no worries getting a pool side lounge at anytime of day. We will be back for sure!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
945,Always a great stay!,50,July 2012,"I have stayed at the Pelangi in Seminyak now, many times and it is impossible to get fed up with the hotel. The staff make a very pleasant and warm atmosphere, the food is always brilliant, I cannot recommend the restaurant highly enough! The rooms are spacious and clean and the location is out of the heart of the tourist area, but still only a short cab ride from the hustle and bustle. It is child friendly, gender friendly, nationality friendly and orientation friendly. For a high class resort as a home away from home, I cannot say enough good things about it. The swim up bar is a good place to meet people and have a few whilst luxuriating in one of the cleanest and best maintained pools in Bali. Nothing is too much trouble and I will continue to support this hotel. There are newer, bigger and flasher residences around the area, but the Pelangi delivers excellent bang for your buck!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
946,Great time at the Pelangi,40,July 2012,"My husband, two teenage children, and another family, stayed at the Pelangi for 7 nights. After being a little concerned about reading some earlier comments, we were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived. We found the superior rooms clean and more spacious than we thought. The location is 5 star- close to great resturants down the road, shopping and of course the beach, we had nights sitting in bean bags on the beach, drinking cocktails watching the sun set. The pool and Resturant have a great few of the surf. Staff were very friendly and helpful- although the guy on the tour desk was hard to understand. Breakfast was great - the egg station was a real hit with us-We also ate dinner at the Resturant 2 nights and didn't find it as expensive as we thought avg 55,000 per meal. We were entertained by the band, who were happy to play any requests. Sure a refurbishment is probably due soon but you would be going to get anything that is better vale for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
947,'Old Style Bali' in a great location.,40,July 2012,"My wife and I stayed at the Pelangi for 7 nights in July and loved it. It was our second stay here and the staff are fantastic -most of them remembered us (including our names and room No.) from the previous trip last September.
Sure the place is not exactly 5 star but if you are looking for a bit of 'old style' Bali in a great location the Pelangi is hard to beat. Right on the beach and a relaxed walking distance to a variety of great resturants on the beach at the end of Double 6 Road - or just a bit further on to the Legion markets. We will certaily be back to see our friends at the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
948,perfect spot,40,July 2012,"yep rooms are a bit small and dated ,but the position on the beach with the warungs and night time entertainment more than make up for it. Would recommend it to anyone ... {my massage on the beach was a nightmare 100,000 rp agreed upon soon turned into a scream fest. would recommend massage up the street for 60,000 rp per hour no arguments }",Pelangi Bali Hotel
949,Great location and great service...but take care with the tour desk operator,40,July 2012,"The Pelangi is a basic 3 star hotel but what it has in its favour is its beach front location, great pool and outstanding customer service, you cant fault it. Yes the hotel is probably ready for a refurb, but what matters most to me is a good bed, hot and strong shower, clean facilities and safe environments.....Pelangi ticks all these boxes. The pool is lovley if you dont want to brave the surf, the buffet breakfast has a good range of options to meet most peoples needs and you can eat as much as you like, you can stay quite happily in the hotel complex and be very comfortable or you can venture out to the beach from the pool and have beach bars, and beach massages aplenty to choose from. If you are booking with the tour desk at the front of the hotel foyer be sure to check once you have agreed a price for a private driver how much is actually going to the private driver. We agreed 400,000 rupiah for five hours, all the tour desk operator did was make a 30 second phone call to call up the excellent driver and for this he took 200,000 rupiah.....not fair. We were astounded at this greedyness given the driver takes all the costs and risks with providing a superb air conditioned, comfortable minibus to take us through the demanding Bali traffic, its his livelihood on the line and at the very least he should have been given 375,000 rupiah. Not cool tour desk, be fair or you wont get repeat business. Our driver custom-made our day tour to what we wanted to see and not the general run of the mill tourist spots, he was just great. I will post a separate post promoting his services so you can book direct and ensure he gets the money he works hard for.
Overall, its a great location, clean, great gardens and the staff do an excellent job.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
950,Great location and lovely staff,50,July 2012,"My partner spent 7 nights in this hotel and loved it. Room was a bit small but who spends lots of time in their room? Best location and great breakfasts. Beautiful staff, would not hesitate in returning to Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
951,My 10 days of paradise...July 2012,50,July 2012,"Unbelievable high end service ! Every hotel employee only asked my name once and they NEVER forgot it ! Made us feel special. From the amazing spa to the incredible pool, outstanding restaurant, and the very best location for the beach, shopping, dining, bar hopping, sight seeing or just sitting on the pool deck watching the tide roll in. I'd give Pelangi Bali Hotel 10 stars if we could...thank you so much for making our once in a lifetime vacation such a memorable one! So many smiling employees but Tu Tute, in the bar and restaurant area went out of his way to give us the time of our lives ! My two sons and I will never forget you all !",Pelangi Bali Hotel
952,Great value,40,July 2012,"We have just returned from Pelangi where we spent a week with our teenage children and another family. Read negative reviews on your site prior and were quite apprehensive as to condition of Hotel, Pleased to say we found our 4 Superior rooms very clean, staff most helpful and friendly, pool excellent, food very good and absolutely fabulous beachfront location. Would recommend definately. Happened to be my 50th whilst there and staff were beautiful and keen to help at all times. Also felt very safe. This is not 5 star but absolute value for money. Lorraine.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
953,Great location but very tired,30,July 2012,"We stayed at the Pelangi while attending a friend's wedding, and must admit that for the price, we were quite disappointed by how tired the hotel was. Old linen, lumpy pillows, very rundown bathroom with a slight lingering smell. The pool is nice but the area around the pool could do with an update. The breakfast is absolutely appalling, obviously hasn't been reviewed/updated in many many years. Hotel would be okay if you get a good deal and you're in a big group as it's well situated on the beach, - but for a romantic getaway or something extra special, look elsewhere.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
954,Right on the beach!,40,June 2012,Nice clean rooms. Hotel even has a gym with weights for those inclined..great for my 19 year old son. Lovely swimming pool with plenty of sun on it and the beach is a step outside. Get a great massage off the ladies on the beach straight outside the hotel. Hire a boogie board or surf board. Really good fun. Go the the beach at night when they bring in the sunbeds and put out the bean bags and beautiful umberellas all lit up. There is a lot of entertainment going on up and down the beach. Get a cab to Ku De Ta..expensive..but it is such a pretty place..must check out the toilets! Amazing art work on the walls on the way in. Food heaven. Really relaxing end to our holiday. Would definitely stay here again.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
955,Pretty okay,30,June 2012,"We stayed at this note during our stay in Seminyak, the hotel's location is perfect as you are right on the beach and fun places are a small taxi ride away.

Situated in the 70 euro price range, this hotel was pretty okay but not special either. While in general in Indonesia if you pay about 80 - 100 per night you get absolute super quality.

The rooms were clean but nothing special. Hotel breakfast was very good, with a nice location overlooking the pool and more importantly the beach. The pool was filled with autralian 40-50 year olds getting their big bodies drunk in the pool from 11 o'clock onwards. I guess there are a few groups of people who go here every year. There is a gym in the hotel but that was really outdated and the aircon did not really work, which makes a workout in Indonesia pretty much impossible, at least for me.

All in all, I think you can better spend the 10 euro a night extra and get something really fancy.

The service was very good though, people were really, really friendly and helpful. As anywhere in Indonesia I guess.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
956,Fantastic location,40,November 2011,"Great location, friendly staff, rooms a little old but nice pool and outdoor area!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
957,Excellent Value and great beachfront location,50,July 2012,"We had a great stay at the Pelangi for 10 days, the staff are so welcoming and friendly. Our room was always clean, a/c worked well and free wifi was a bonus!! The pool area was really nice and overlooks the beach, we could always get a sun lounge. The gardens are very well maintained, drinks by the pool aren't so cheap but I guess tha'ts most hotels. The location is terrific, step straight onto beach where there's heaps of restaurants, live music and beanbags on beach at night. Look for Sumi for a $6 hour long massage,she was great!! The resort has a free shuttle bus into Kuta every day which we used to go shopping. Any time you ask the staff questions they are so helpful, my daughter got sick there and within 2 minutes of calling reception they were at our room with fresh towels for her. I would definitely stay here again, agree with other reviewers it is a 3 star hotel doesn't pretend to be 5 star.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
958,Friendly staff yet again but hotel needs another refresh.,40,June 2012,"This was our 2nd visit to the Pelangi in just under 2 years...yes I will agree with a previous reviewer and say that the hotel lacks a little atmosphere like funky music at the pool bar overridden by balinese music from the restaurant..but compared to many of the other hotels you get what you pay for and the location on the beach was a highlight for us. This was our 7th visit to Bali and we did find overall no matter where you go the prices have definitely gone up..this hotel is let's not forget 3 star..however if we had any requests they were met straight away.I have stayed at many a 5 star hotel for my work and I am a bit of a 5 star girl but the price of accomodation in Bali is getting rediculous so the Pelangi worked for us again this time for us. Also expect 3 star and i guess you will not be too disappointed.....

Again we had a super deluxe room and two single rollaways were provided at no extra cost for my 2 kids...there are no hidden charges in night rates as all taxes are included. A plus!

I was disappointed the sunset terrace was not open for dinner as we spent a few nights here on our last visit. I also agree management need to keep up with the reviews on this site. The staff always greeted us at breakfast and front reception loved to come out from the desk to play with my daughter..the Grandmas hotel up the road has a fabulous day spa..I have to say that the locals and a lovely guy Ormond who loves my kids made me come back to this hotel but I will say I think I may save a little harder and try 4 star next time for that little bit of extra wow...",Pelangi Bali Hotel
959,Just like coming home!,50,July 2012,"After 20 days travelling through Sumatra and Java the Pelangi was indeed a site for sore eyes. We had stayed here about 18 months ago and to our great surprise many of the staff remembered us and we got a very hearty welcome. We were amazed that after a year and a half and countless guests that they could still offer such a personal and friendly service. If Bali is the friendliest island in the world, then the Pelangi is the friendliest hotel in Bali.

Aside from the wonderfully personal service, this is a great hotel. Clean, well appointed rooms, prompt service, great facilities, amazing location, good food- you couldn't want for more.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
960,"Great Pool, Cocktails, Food & close to everything!",40,June 2012,"In my opinion Pelangi's location definately makes it worth staying there! There is a private beach entrance, a bin tang supermarket just up the road a bit, close to Seminyak Square (A little too far to walk - Might as well ctach a taxi for $3 or $4 AUD) Also across the road to the front of the hotel is a taxi service. Reasonable and easy to haggle with if you want to.
We had a standard room. It was a decent size for us. We didnt spend a HUGE amount of time in there. However we had not terrace or balcony. Only a back door which led out to a garden walk way. He had to move two single beds together - i dont know if this is every standard room bed style or if you need to specially request double beds. The walls were also very thin. At times it was annoying, but you could live with it. On the last couple of days the bathroom smelt awful - i think it was the plumbing.
The Pool is AMAZING. We loved being there. The swim up bar definately made our holiday as well. Good prices and friendly staff. We also order bar snacks which were so cheap and great. we had a meal there on BBQ buffet night - AWESOME food!
The beach entrance made our holiday. there was no busy walk to reach the beach and you coudl come and go as you please. There are SOO many bars and resturants up the beach if you want ot find something just go via the beach.
Their sunset terrace is never open. apparently only open for functions. but you are still able to go upstairs and take photos or view the susnet.
Buffet breakfast was nice we ate there nrealy every morning. Egg station was great!
Spa wayyy too expensive for Bali. But maybe that's just my opinion. No safe's in room but they have a safe room by the 24 hour reception which was very secure.
To use their computer and internet was expensive.
I woudl stay there again just because of their excellent location, but woul upgrade our room.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
961,Pelangi Management should really get on here to respond to some of these reviews.,40,July 2011,"We are a group heading to Pelangi in a weeks time as always i keep an eye on reviews before i book and then the lead up to arrival. Pelangi would have to have the most mixed reviews ive ever read. If only Management would respond to some of these, it could possibly make things a whole lot clearer.
Well will give my review once we are there. :-)). Please note to apply this post i have given a 4 star to all questions as we actually have not stayed as yet",Pelangi Bali Hotel
962,Best hotel value in Seminyak,50,May 2012,"One of the few hotels that are ""right on"" the beach (no road to cross) with exceptional friendly staff throughout the resort. The infinity pool is maintained to a high standard as are the grounds and rooms. The hotel is centrally located to a terrific range of restaurants & shops.

963,"""Wooooooooooooo Do NOT go in there"" !",10,June 2012,"by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

I will put this in dot form to make it easier to read:

1. Walking to our Seperior room. The rails on the steep stair cases were too unstable to hold on to. If you are needing the rails for support to walk up and down stairs, forget it as they would probably collaspse and are extremley dangerous.

2. Requested a room with Twin Beds. Was given a room with one bed.

3. Room was absolutely filthy. Dirty floors, dirty bath, used tampon in the tiolet.

4. The bathroom smelt very strongly of sewrage. Foul.

5. Restraunt is VERY expensive in comparison to most in Bali. $5 for a coke.

6. The pool closed at 7pm even though we were told over the phone before booking that it closed at 11pm. What a joke.

7. When we checked out I advised of the filthy condition of the room, they didnt even apologise.

Will not return EVER !",Pelangi Bali Hotel
964,absolutely disgusting,10,June 2012,"this hotel ruined my birthday as we had spent the three days before in saba in a beautiful villa where we made friends with all the staff they made us feel like royalty, they drove us anywhere and nothing was a trouble, we understood that a hotel would be much more different so when we checked in we thought at first it wasnt too bad, got to our room after several flights of stairs and a long walk down the tunnel of doom, got into our room and it was putried. we asked for twin beds got one. the room smelt like the sewerage and the bathroom was absolutely gross, we washed our feet and by the time we walked from the bathroom to the bed our feet were black, there were no bottle openers in the room so we couldnt even drink the complimentry water as it needed a bottle opener, the website said pool bar was open til eleven but at 7pm we were not allowed in. on check out we got no assistance and had to lug our bags down three flights of stair. the rooms there are absolutely dirty and gross. The food is expensive we ordered potato wedges and for 100 000rupiah got 5 wedges thats it. i wouldnt even recommend this to my my enemies and certainly dont feel safe in this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
965,theres nothing to fault at the pelangi,50,June 2012,"Just returned from 10 days at the pelangi and could'nt find any faults the rooms are a good size and cleaned every day fresh bedding and towels water in your room every day there are always sun beds available and pool towels provided the breakfast was ok always found something to eat the station was ok
The hotel is right on the beach just outside the hotel you will find sumi doing massages only cost 50.000 rupiah for over a hour i went three times it was,so relaxing
There are plenty bars n resturants just a short walk we went to cocoon for cocktails but found it quite pricey being from england we thought 28 english pounds was,a lot for four cocktails wen we can four at home for half the price but were on holiday and they were lovely so try n not think about the price n just enjoy your selfs
Went to waterbom park its a brill day out even if you dont ave kids like us but we ad a great time
If you want a nice resturant in a lovely setting try poppies in kuta you wont be disapointed

970,"Don't ask for them to organise a taxi when you leave, it won't happen!",30,May 2012,"Stayed at Pelangi for 5 days, hotel was bigger than I thought, pool was gorgeous and overlooked the beach, bintangs were expensive - cheaper to go to all the cool little beach bar/restaurants just outside dotted along the beach.

Staff were friendly, and we basically only slept there, when we went to leave the guy at the transport/taxi desk wouldn't organise a taxi, said we had to wander out on the street with our cases and get our own. After just staying at the Puri Raja where they raced out to the street to flag us a taxi while we waited with suitcases, this small detail has put us off staying at Pelangi again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
971,Great location on the beach at Seminyak,40,May 2012,"Positives:
1. Location - Pelangi is well located on the beach at Seminyak. Walk out of the front of the resort and you are on the beach. It is also enjoyable to eat breakfast looking over the seaside and watching the sunsets over the water.

Pelangi is a short walk from local restaurants, shops and the Bintang supermarket.

2. Pool - Pelangi has a superb pool with a swim-up bar.

3. Value - Very clean and comfortable accommodation. We found our room to be very quiet too.

4. Friendly and attentive staff. Overall, the service is very good.

Where it could be improved:

1. Extend wireless internet access to rooms. At time of writing, wireless internet access is only available at the restaurant and around the pool area. While this is sufficient for most needs, I would prefer to leave my computer in my room.

Breakfast was very nice and included fruit juices, tea and coffee, breakfast cereals and muesli, local and international breakfast options. I enjoyed the omelets cooked freshly to order.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised. Pelangi exceeded my expectations, probably because I was not expecting this level of quality for the price.

If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and want a good value for money hotel with an A1 position, then I have no hesitation in recommending the Pelangi Bali Hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
972,Great return stay,40,May 2012,"The service is always friendly, welcoming and we were made felt special each day. We stayed 2 weeks and wish it had of been longer. Hello to Wayan at the front desk, always had a smile and greeted us each day. The only thing that lets Pelangi down is the restaurant, there are so many better places to eat just near by and cheaper also.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
973,Good Value - Basic Clean Room - Excellent Location Hotel,40,March 2012,"For the price this hotel is good value. It is a 3* hotel in an excellent location - it is on the beach at Seminyak. It provides clean basic accomodation for around $100 (AUD) within very easy reach (walking or short taxi ride) of excellent shopping, recreation (ie the beach), restaurants, etc. The staff are fine. This is a 3* hotel - it does not pretend to be 5* hotel. There is no safety deposit box in the room (its at reception), it is a simple breakfast which may be fine but if you want something a little bit better for $5 walk down to Zanzibar on the beach a few hundred meters away. The bathroom is one with a shower screen which will drive you crazy after a while,
This hotel (room) was good value - it was clean and in a good location - I would stay there again !",Pelangi Bali Hotel
974,Beachfront bliss,40,May 2012,"The service here is so friendly, helpful and welcoming, it was sad to say goodbye to them! The beachfront location was perfect for us, and the 10 minute walk to the main street was interesting and easy.There are lots of restaurants, bars and shops very nearby, and a free shuttle or cheap taxi ride will get you to the main street if you want. We were a group of 3 in the suite - which was gorgeous.It has 2 huge rooms,a large balcony overlooking the pool and beach and was very clean and well designed.The toiletries were pretty average, and at $300 /night it's a bit overpriced for Bali, but it was a great holiday.I'll go back for sure. Some of the rooms up near reception are a long stroll to the pool and the action, which some guests might find annoying - request a pool end room if you want",Pelangi Bali Hotel
975,Pros & Cos,40,December 2011,"I travelled to Bali recently with my partner and stayed her for 6 nights.

Pros:

- Seminyak as a great location as it was out of the hustle and bustle of Kuta.
- Great waves for surfing
- One Free massage at resort
- Could watch sunset from pool
- Room very clean. Cleaners came each morning.
- Atms and supermarket close by ( with cheap beer and chocolate)
*** BIGGEST PLUS: when you walk out of the resort onto the beach just slightly to the right is an elderly women named Rosa who gives the most amazing massages! I payed I think $3 for half an hour for a full body massage! I went back everyday and sometimes twice a day! I ended up tipping her a lot she was so good! If i ever went back to bali I would go back to her.

Cons:
- American buffet breakfast looked great but tasted terriable.
- Booked white rafting at tour manager at hotel. We thought we had a great deal but then found out from other people we met on the day they had payed $10 cheaper. You just have to talk the tour man down.
- I tryed a lot of the mixed alcoholic drinks at the pool bar and didnt like any of them they must use cheap versions of vodka ect. However bintang makes up for it.

If i went back to Bali i would try somewhere different but cant complain of the accomodation",Pelangi Bali Hotel
976,"Relaxing, sensational beachfront location",50,May 2012,"Great reception at check in. Perfectly cleaned comfortable spacious room. Like most reviews here, no safe deposit box in room, but 24hr access at foyer. The view from the restaurant and pool area is amazing. Soooooo relaxing to see the activities on the beach from the pool lounge. Fabulous massages right on beach. Drinks in hotel a little pricey. Happy hour 4pm to 6pm, 30%off. Don't go past the Chiringuito restaurant directly out on the front. Fabulous service, recommend the tuna steak, best ever. All the staff are extremely helpful and so friendly at the hotel. Treat yourself to the honeymoon spa, it's amazing! Night life along the strip is great, if you are looking for a great fun night you can't go past the gay bars! Great staff, very friendly, great music and so much fun. We loved it so much we have booked to go again in October.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
977,Fantastic Experience!,50,March 2012,"We love this hotel. We stayed for a week in March, best time of the year, not to busy! We were met at the airport and taken to the hotel where our check in was quick and easy. Our hotel room was really nice with al;l that you need to be able to enjoy your stay. Staff were friendly and would go out of their way to assist you. The pool area is great and we really loved the pool area with the in pool bar, cocktails also were fantastic. The hotel grounds are well kept and the gardens are lovely. Highly recommend the Pelangi to all travellers. We will be going back next year!!!!
Some of the review photos are very outdated as the Pelangi has been renovated.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
978,Great hotel for those wishing amenities over price,40,May 2012,"There is nothing bad to say about this hotel. The price is a little expensive compared to some of the surrounding budget hotels, but you get what you pay for...

The hotel had a great pool and beach access. The staff was pleasant, friendly and available at all hours of the night. Check in/ Check out was a breeze, and the concierge was a terrific help with all of our needs... I think this hotel is best for those looking for a relaxed atmosphere and don't mind paying slightly more for quality.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
979,Nice hotel on the beach,40,May 2012,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our 4 day, 3 nights stay at the Pelangi Hotel in Bali. We were promptly picked up at the airport by a friendly driver, and had a quick an efficient check-in.

The hotel itself was nice and cozy, with comfortable beds and plenty of space in our standard room. I really liked the hotel pool, as well as the buffet breakfast that was served at their restaurant overlooking the beach.

The hotel staff was pleasant and helped us with a smile at all hours of the day/night - even when we came back really late in the morning; they were prompt in giving us our hotel key.

The only inconvenience was that the rooms were not equipped with safe deposit boxes. So we had to place our valuables in a room with lockers next to the reception area - which had it's own manual system with two keys.

The location of the hotel was excellent. The hotel overlooks the beach and we could walk around Seminyak to all the clubs in the area (we were surprised that we were 10 mins away from the salsa clubs that we loved!) - including a 15-min walk away to Ku De Ta.

The hotel was a little pricey - we could've gotten much cheaper hotels in the area.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
980,Great bali holiday,50,April 2012,"Everything a hotel should be. Excellent staff, comfortable rooms, great pool and breakfast. Easy access to beach and a short walk to shops and resturants. Best kept secret in bali",Pelangi Bali Hotel
981,"""Great hotel will stay there again""",50,May 2012,"Amazing location right on the beach. The hotel staff are very friendly and the rooms are very clean. The hotel provides a free shuttle into Kuta at 9am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm and 5pm. Food was amazing and the drinks are reasonably priced. Breakfast was included with my accomodation and the resturant looks out over the ocean. The hotel staff also gave great tips regarding changing money - BMC highly recommended and to use the Bluebird taxi's. The hotel pool and swim up bar is extremely clean with plenty of lounges around the pool.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
982,Great hotel,50,April 2012,"Had a wonderful experience here after leaving Kuta in search of a better Bali experience. Amazing location (right on the beach), although you do need a cab to get into the restaurant/shopping area of Seminyak). Rooms very clean and service was SO GREAT. The staff there is amazingly friendly and for that reason I felt like I was staying at a 5 star hotel. Pool area is very nice and overall I would say great value for money. Also, great buffet breakfast.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
983,"Great value for money, if travelling solo stay closer to the restaurant strip",40,May 2012,"I was travelling with family and chose this hotel because it was right on the beach and was reasonably priced. The hotel is great value for money in terms of accommodation incl breakfast, the pool is great, the drinks were reasonably priced, and if you go out to the beach and turn left you can get to a mini mart and some restaurants easily. It's about 1km to the right along the beach to ku de ta - too far to walk in the heat through the streets (about 3kms via road) Food and services were quite expensive through the hotel, better to eat out for lunch and dinner. And contact a local laundry to get washing done for about 10% of the cost at the hotel. We used Aryas laundry who did pick up and drop off to hotel. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. If I was travelling alone I would have preferred to be closer to the main restaurant, bar and shopping area, but if in a group, this location is fine. Swim up bar in the pool is great for hot afternoons. Local tip: in case you get sick, you can buy antibiotics without a prescription from most chemists.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
984,Seminyak,30,March 2012,"Traveling as a couple, we stayed here in the first few days. This hotel was chosen for the excellent location, over the beach.
The staff is very helpful, the breakfast reasonable, fair room and bathroom, although everything shows its age. Anyway, for this price and location its a very good value.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
985,"Friendly, value for money, on the beach and close to shops and bars",40,April 2012,"In the past I've stayed in 5 star hotels in Bali but we got a cheap deal and decided why not. The rooms were clean, air-conditioning set to the perfect temperature and any time we ordered room service/a bucket of ice it arrived promptly. It is right on the beach and a close walk to many bars and restaurants. The breakfast was fine, it could be improved by varying the hot dishes daily.
The staff were really lovely and extremely helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
986,Family friendly Hotel,30,March 2012,"I stayed with a group of adults recently. The majority of our group are seasoned Bali visitors. The hotel has a wonderful location. Not too far to the the local restaurants and markets.The pool is fab, although it would benefit from some shade sails over the pool itself. Rooms are comfortable, and well presented. Would have liked a safe in my room instead of a safety deposit box at reception. All the staff a wonderful, and happy to assist with any request. Because we were all adults we enjoyed the entertainment at the local nightclubs (Bottom's Up, etc) but be warned these are filled with cross-dressers and gays, all very loverly people and up for a good in-offesive time.There floor show's are truly amazing.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
987,Better Than Expected,40,March 2012,"We stayed 6 nights in March 2012. Pleasantly surprised as it was better than we anticipated. We would normally stay in a higher rated hotel but got a ridiculously cheap package and were prepared to compromise but it proved to be very good. Right on the beach with restaurants, massages and tour operators within one minute of the hotel. A short walk to a supermarket for supplies 'tho a slightly longer walk to the main street of Seminyak. Good, cheap shopping along the way and a bit further to Bintang Supermarketwhich has everything you require including great prices on souvenirs. Staff were very nice and helpful at all times and breakfast quite good. If you are on a budget don't hesitate to stay here.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
988,Absoulute Bliss,40,April 2012,"Dont go past staying at the Pelangi. I stayed in the Deluxe Room 301 over Easter and was pleasantly suprised, my friends called it the Presidential Suite as it was clean, modern and big. The hotel is located on the beach which is ideal for morning walks down the beach, many great restuarants and eateries and lots and lots of culture not to mention stalkers, but hey thats Bali. Pelangi is also located close to Seminyak with just a short walk around the corner. Lots and lots of fine resturants, boutiques and things to do.
I would definately stay at the Pelangi again and again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
989,Ok for a stopover,30,April 2012,"We used this hotel as a stopover for 2 nights. We organised an airport pickup which was awesome, our first time to Bali and just as we come out of the airport there is a friendly guy dressed in fluoresecent yellow uniform holding up my name. We were happy to have this friendly greeting and an airconditioned vehicle to take us to the hotel at a pricey cost of us$25. our room was on the same floor as reception, however i think it is level 2 because you need to go downstairs in order to get to the pool area. if i had a choice i would choose to stay the same level as the pool and closer to the pool. the hotel is a bit strange in that the rooms are in a long long long corridor so kind of feels like you're walking down a jail thing. The room itself is adequate. not great looking but comfortable. if you don't quite get the toilet flusher thing perfectly right, it keeps filling water until you move the thing to the right position which i never got the hang of. the first night we got there we decided to eat at the completely empty hotel restaurant which had small meals at big prices. The only time you see lots of people there is breakfast time, which of course is inclusive. The most interesting thing at breakfast time was the kids cereal which looks like tiny tiny choc chip cookies. The coffee was good. The downer was that the wifi was only free in the restaurant, if you want to use it in the room, it costs extra. The pool is quite nice. Instead of having operating in room safes, guests need to store valuables in lockers next to the lobby office - very secure lockers each requiring 2 keys to open and signatures everytime it is opened. however... if you lose the key for the locker, there is a large fee of over uS$100. needless to say, i went swimming with my key attached to my bracelet as i was too scared to leave it with my towel. They close the pool at a certain time of night as well (for chemical treatment or something). The reception was quite helpful, some staff friendlier than others though. The short walk to the main road is a bit dodgy at night though as it is dark, some section without footpath, so wouldn't like to have cars not being able to see you, however it is a short walk.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
990,2nd visit - will stay again,40,April 2012,"I first stayed at the Pelangi in March 2010 and enjoyed my stay so much that when my latest Bali trip came around with my mum we decided to stay there again. I find the location very convenient (central to both Legian and nth Seminyak) - it is an easy walk up to the Bintang Supermarket or Double Six Rd.

The hotel is a little on the older side but I think that adds to its charm. The staff are all lovely, a special shout out to Wayan at the concierge desk. He was incredibly friendly and helpful, calling down to our room each day to see what our plans were for the day and to offer his assistance should we need it. The staff always have a smile on there face and a big ""hello"" or ""good morning"".

The breakfast isn't overly exciting, but was adequate enough for us. There are plenty of places close by should you wish to venture out for breakfast.

We stayed in the standard room and it was fine for two people. Beds were comfy, air con worked well (actually a little too well sometimes) and the bathroom includes a shower and bath. I think if you tried to squeeze more than 2 adults into the room then it might be a bit squishy, but for 2 there is more than enough room.

My favourite part of the hotel is the pool and its view out onto the beach. Watching the sunset from the swim up bar is just perfect. One thing I would like to see addressed is not allowing people to claim a pool lounge without actually using it. On numerous occassions we would go down to the pool to find towels, books and sarongs on sun lounges but there was no-one in sight. One morning I even watched a couple come out of there room still in there pyjamas, grab two towels from the pile, put them on two sunlounges under the shade, then skip back to there room. If you're not going to use that lounge straight away then IMHO you shouldn't be able to claim it. The pool attendants should occassionally throughout the day do a round up of rogue towels on sun lounges that arent occupied.

Overall, we loved our stay at the Pelangi, it is more of a traditional older style Balinese hotel (if you're looking for 5 star modern style, this isnt the place for you). We will certainly stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
991,Location!,40,April 2012,"We did a bit of research, and this being our first time to Bali, we where a bit put off by the negative comments, however, we plunged in.
1. Pick up at the airport. Bloody marvellous idea. I emailed them prior to our visit and confirmed the price, $50 return. Just to have someone waiting with a sign with our name on in the organised chaos of the arrivals area was worth its weight in gold.
2. Check-in and room. Guava juice and a cold towel!! Brilliant. So friendly and helpful, we where escorted to 309, a Superior Deluxe, again I upgraded direct by email. Big room, a bit musty, but what do expect in a tropical country. Massive comfy bed, great soft pillows and little touches like the frangipani flowers on the bed. Only down was the light outside the front door is on all night, I asked reception to sort it for the next night and it was no trouble, and unplug the fridge if you are a light sleeper! Slept really well with the muffled thud of the surf in the near distance.
3. Breakfast. This was included and the mrs got into the Mee Goreng! Remember that the bread here is much sweeter, do toast is a bit weird. Great selection of hot and cold, the egg station is genious. We didn't dine in other than that as the local options where cheaper and more fun to try out.
4. Pool and bar. Opens at 1100. We swam up a couple of times. Had a great chat about temples and the offerings we had seen on a walk, about the thunderstorms, earthquakes in fact anything. They were so friendly and helpful, time can get away though keep an eye out for sunset about 6ish every night. Happy hour 1600-1800. 30% off cocktails.
5. Generally. Pretty good. Walk to reception less than 5 mins. Seminyak village 10. Legian by beach 20. Great staff, great service. We will book here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
992,Pelangi Hotel - Adequate,30,January 2012,"Stayed at the Pelangi in Jan, 2012. Location pretty good, but to go to any of the busy nightclubs in Legion or shopping in Kuta, be prepared for major traffic delays and $$ taxi costs. Around the hotel, there is a strip of gay nightclubs. kind of seedy. Also went to Gado Gado and Potato Head, but it was pouring rain, so could not really sit in the nice areas. Hotel room was just adequate.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
993,"Great location, but once you enter the hotel feels cheap",20,February 2012,"I opted for this hotel because of it's convenient location. Much to our disappointment when we arrived a little early at the hotel to check in with our reservations, they were not able to take us in until the 2 pm check-in time. We were hot and tired already from waiting, and got pretty irritated when we were then asked to wait longer until 2:30. After some protest and discussion with the manager, they upgraded one of our two rooms so that we could all check in right away. The hotel has a strange layout, walking a long dark hallway also used by the service staff to get to the rooms closer to the beach. The dining area and poolside had a lot of concrete, and things felt just a little tacky. The guests by the poolside too had a large boom box going full volume with pop/rock music, which recalled spring break college partying. Not exactly what we were looking for in a relaxing Bali vacation. The capper was the breakfast buffet which was mostly finished when we arrived, and felt like college dining in the messiness and carelessness of presentation. This is not how I want to spend a vacation in Bali where hospitality and care are such a great tradition.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
994,Second time stay with Pelangi,50,March 2012,"It was so great to have staying there for the second time with our family and friends who came for our wedding.
The hotel staff prepared a fruit basket in our room for our second visiting, it was indeed a surprise, and we have decided to stay there for the 3rd time probably few months later.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
995,Going back to Pelangi,40,April 2011,"I stayed at the Pelangi with my husband and 2 teenage children. Our room was clean and comfortable, all the staff were helpful and friendly. Pool is great. Loved the breakfast each day. Restaurant was fine and there is lots of great places to eat close by. We loved Pelangi and I am returning there in May with my daughter, sister and niece. Great location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
996,Beach hotel with fantastic staff,40,March 2012,"Stayed at the Pelangi 6 nights and had a fantastic time! The pool is set overlooking the beach and has a pool bar (happy hour from 4pm). The staff a very friendly and helpful, which made our trip much more adventurous. A 5-10 min walk along the beach is Ku De Ta and numerous restaurants and night life. The rooms are nice and clean, however a little outdated in terms of paint and furniture. I would definitely visit again due to staff friendliness and location on the beach front!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
997,"""Quiet Place with nice swimming pool facing the beach""",30,April 2011,"We travelled to Bali in April 2011 with one toddler. I would say Seminyak is nice place, not so crowded compare to Kuta. The beach is just behind the hotel, but the environment is not very clean, can see alot rubbish.

The room is nice and clean, have small balcony but we hardly open the door. The bathroom have bathtub which my kid love it.

Breakfast wise is just fine. It's located near the swimming pool and the beach. Very nice view while having the breakfast.

Love the swimming pool which facing the beach, so you can enjoy the beach while swimming. And my kid love it too!

However, this hotel is located abit further from outlets or restaurants near Seminyak, and difficult to get taxi there. We need to walk abit further to get a taxi as the hotel does not allow taxi stop near the hotel.

Will be back to Bali, but will do search another hotel at Seminyak but near to outlets and restaurants.

Overall we enjoyed Bali so much! :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel

1000,"Friendly staff, clean, good food",40,March 2012,"After our previous accommodation arrangements fell through upon arrival to Bali we opted for the Pelangi after visiting one of the accommodation booking offices.
This is a good 3 star hotel, I wouldn't say it was a 4 star to be honest, but it is clean, The staff are really nice and friendly and the Spa is highly recommended. Seminyak is not somewhere we would go to again but if it is your thing I suggest you stay here if you want a good quality low cost hotel.
Rooms are a bit basic but pool recently renovated and is really nice. Backs onto the beach - the beach is horrible so don't bother - very dirty and the back alley outside the hotel is not the safest to be honest but cannot fault this hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1001,dont stay in room 307,30,February 2012,"we upgraded to a Super Deluxe Room for an 18 day stay...but what a disappointment we arrived at approx 10pm and was booked in with speedy, friendly service the room was a bit dark and smelled a bit but you have to expect the smell some times in Bali when we got to bed we kept hearing a noise and discovered they have a water pump running up the wall by the head board and every 25 seconds it would go of, at 2am we went to see the night manager to get another room but was told nothing available and they sent the maintenance man who tried to tell us it was the air con unit then he left, at 5am went back to the manager a different one who gave us a standard room so we could have a sleep,after advising if nothing was going to be done we wanted a refund, later that day they found us another room same type as what we had paid for. (still very dark and very small balcony 2 chair job)
we were disappointed in the managers attitude as i am sure we are not the 1st to complain about the noise and treated us like we were fools.
The staff on a hole are very pleasant and friendly .
the breakfast got a bit boring as it was the same thing every day.
We will not be staying at this hotel again as there where other hotels in the area same price and lots nicer.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1002,Value!!,40,March 2012,Great hotel for money. Beach at the back door step and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay there again!,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1003,Our Pelangi Stay,30,March 2012,"We stayed at the Pelangi from 3 - 10 March as a 50th wedding anniversary to ourselves. Check in/check out was quick and easy. There was a beautiful bowl of flowers in our room with a congratulatory note. Thank you Pelangi for that - it was a lovely thought. Our room 206 was good - very clean and large enough. Bathroom very clean too. Only complaint I had is that there isn't any cupboard or drawers in the bathroom and very little bench space so no place to leave toiletries. Complementary toiletries were basic. Also not keen on overhead showers because the baths are quite deep but that is in most places. Also only extremely shallow drawers in room. There was a cupboard with hanging space and 3 shelves, Bedside cabinet on one side of the bed only. The bed was large but was 2 smaller beds pushed together. Mini bar was reasonably priced. Airconditioning was excellent. We were upstairs and had a balcony but this was very small and didn't have any furniture out there. Our room faced other rooms so we didn't have our curtains open whilst in the room at all. The staff were very friendly and cleaned our room and changed linen daily. Towels were not too bad but no face washers. To get to the restaurant was ok except when it rained. There was no overhead protection and no umbrellas for guests use. Breakfast was quite good although on some days the fruit wasn't very ripe. You can have eggs done however you like them at the egg station which was just outside the open restaurant. On rainy days it was closed but the restaurant kitchen cooked the eggs. We ate in the restaurant for dinner for the first 3 nights but for me the food was very bland and tough, however my husband liked his meals. There is a bar at the front of the hotel but it was very hot in there so it was empty most of the time. Cocktail hour was 4 - 5 every day with a 30% reduction. The pool area was lovely with plenty of beds around the pool but not much shade. You could ask for an umbrella though. There were no upright chairs or small tables in the pool area. The outlook from the pool and restaurant was great looking out over the ocean. We didn't see any sunsets because it was overcast every day. There were steps going down to the beach giving easy access. We didn't eat at any of the beach beanbag restaurants because they didn't appeal to us at all. We didn't like the way motor bikes and scooters had access to the path along the beach making it feel quite dangerous. The reception staff were helpful - we had a safety deposit box at reception because there wasn't one in our room but it was always accessible. It is cheaper to walk out in the street for taxi's. The first day we got the hotel to book a taxi for us to Kuta. It cost approx equivalent of AU$10. Next time we went outside the hotel and it cost approx equivalent of AU$2.50. Bluebird taxis are the cheapest.
The room is definately a 3 star but the pool area a little higher with staff friendliness higher still. Overall we enjoyed our stay but would be reluctant to book again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1004,Totally regretted choosing Pelangi,10,February 2012,"Me and my partner chose the Pelangi as our honeymoon retreat. i had specifically told them that i was coming there for my honeymoon. when we entered the room...all there was was a measly looking petal on the bed. nothing else! we were taken aback as we had expected the usual honeymoon preps. upon checkout, i brought this up to the front office but all they could do was to point the blame at each other. i did not receive a sincere apology from anyone. instead i was asked to pay for a coke that i took from the minibar. the rooms at the hotel are pretty outdated and for the price you pay...there are def better options out there. the only positive thing is that you get access to the beach. i have some friends going to bali next month and i have strongly discouraged them from choosing the Pelangi. if u expect modern looking rooms and to be pampered by the staff...then this hotel is a big no no.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1005,"Great location, great service, good value hotel",40,August 2011,"Stayed in the hotel for 5 nights, great staff, very clean, great value and great location.

Pool area is great with parts of it shaded strategically in the heat of the day.

Rooms clean and comfortable, great value for money.

Located on the beachfront with sensational restaurants within 5 mins. Suggest breakfast at the hotel and dinner out

All in all great place to stay, staff very attentive with nothing to much trouble",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1006,Our 11 night stay at Pelangi hotel,50,February 2012,"We Stayed at the Pelangi Hotel from 20 February. I did lots of research online and chose the Pelangi for three reasons.
1. Absolute Beachfront position
2. Affordable
3. Seminyak (Hopefully quieter)

I disregarded all the bad reviews and I am glad that I did. I gave The Pelangi an excellent rating because it delivered exactly what we were looking for. I really doubt you can beat the Pelangi for price when you consider that it has one of the best positions on the beach and is absolute beachfront. If we still had young children I would probably have chosen a resort but the Pelangi is great for us as a couple. I can't understand why people say the superior room is too small. It was plenty big enough for us and we didn't spend much time in it anyway. If the curtains are open you can see into the rooms opposite but I'm wondering why you would go to Bali if you are going to spend the day in your room! They do have satellite TV channels and the aircon was excellent. The room and the linen were spotless and cleaned very well everyday. We never heard a sound at night during the whole 10 days.. the walls are solid concrete not thin as someone else suggested. There was plenty of choice for breakfast...not 5 star but still good. The Pelangi has the most beautiful sparkling pool and a great swim up cocktail bar. The staff are all really lovely and friendly. We enjoyed the little restaurants on the beach and being able to sit on the bean bags and listen to live music at night. We managed to walk everywhere from the Pelangi. We walked to Kuta and back more than once but there is a complimentary shuttle to Kuta. People talk about the hotel being down a dark alley but that is an exaggeration. It took us 2 minutes to walk to the road with all the restaurants and I always felt safe even when walking by myself. It takes about 10 minutes until you reach legian along the beachfront. We did not eat at the Pelangi so can't comment on the meals. To be truthful we did not find the decor very appealing and found it much more fun to try all the little restaurants in town. There are so many lovely, reasonable little restaurants within a few minutes walk. Lucky Day was one of our favourite... food is superb...especially the Nasi Rames and the black rice pudding. I was worried with my choice of hotel before I stayed because of some of the reviews but we will stay there again. My only problem which would not prevent me from staying again, is that there is not enough shade. Ideally I would like more trees but it would be difficult because the hotel is on a long thin plot. The Spa is good if you want to pay for it... a completely different experience from the massages on the beach. I recommend Rusty if you need a beach massage. We used the security boxes in the lobby and had no problems at all. You would probably be better to change your money either at the hotel or there is a good moneychanger next to the Bingtang supermarket. We tried one down in Seminyak Road with a high rate and we somehow managed to lose USD60. Obviously very clever magicians! If you want more luxury for the same price I am sure you could get it in Nusa Dua but we love the area and the easy accessibility to everything. We look forward to our next stay at the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1007,good location,40,February 2012,"The Pelangi is situated in a lovely spot in Seminyak, nice walk to Legian along the beach, and far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be relaxing.
Wouldn't recommend eating there but the staff were very friendly and helpful. Is typical of the old rooms in Bali but that is part of the Bali charm.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1008,Better then i Thought..,40,March 2012,"Ok we read all the reviews.. and we got here on Wed nite 29th feb,, still here till the 10th March,, we are in the standed room,, so no balcona, but we dont spend much time there anyway,, after staying at the Aston last time in Nusa dua,, its a big change,, just the one pool.. very closed in walks going to to the front or back,, breakfast is pretty much like most hotels not fantastic,, not shocking. are finding some great places to eat & will pass them on soon. the room we are in 113 as like the other standed rooms.. is ok size a/c is very good,, but we like to have a fan going to move the air around and they dont have celing fans and you cant get a ground standing one off them. No bigger,, staff are loverly. Keep in mind this is a older hotel and is one of the oldest if not the oldest in this area,, before the others went up. Have had a couple of snacks here but was not that good,, so we eat out.. One place we found which is great is the Italian place about a 5/7min walk. go out to beach turn left go up to first main st walk past the rd works,, and its on your right on the corner,, yum yum,, also the supper place at the Antaran hotel,, its a fancy hotel and you do pay a bit more,, but you can just go up for tappers & a cocktail ect,, the veiw is fantastic.. and worth a trip too,..anyway this Hotel is not really set up for kids,, not that we have any but there is not that much for them to do compared to the modern Hotels.. Hope this helps anyone coming here..",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1009,Not nice at all,20,November 2011,"We stayed here for 1 week in November
We found the room was damp/dark and we could not open our curtains/blinds because we literally could like straight into someone elses room and visa versa.
Pool was nice
Restaurant was ok.
Room was disgraceful
We stayed at the Nikko Resort in Nusa Dua which cost the same as this hotel and the quality and difference was ridiculous.
I would give the Nikko 5 stars
This 2 Stars.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1010,Nice but old,30,November 2011,"I stayed in this hotel for my honeymoon. I booked the superior type and it took a 3 minute walk to get to our room from the front desk. There’s nothing special about the room, also it’s very dark. The wall is thin, we can hear other guests talk, so we can’t sleep until they stop talking, about 3am. However, staffs were very helpful and friendly, breakfast was good, room was clean, and the beach located right behind the restaurant. Reasonable price consider to the location, service, and good breakfast",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1011,Our stay at the Pelangi Bali Hotel,40,November 2011,"The hotel Pelangi pronounced (purr lang ghee) is very good and I'd stay there again tomorrow. Your taxi/driver, (we had a hotel transfer arranged and I think it is included in the room cost) will park at the top of a driveway and here you will get out and be taken to the reception which is just inside and to the right. There is also a bar here too but we never had a drink here. The hotel is built in two wings running from the road to the beach and is narrow.
Our room, 306 was down the hallway on the right. It was at the very far end and is the last room on this wing. It over looks the pool from a small balcony outside the front door. and from here you can just see the restaurant where you will have your breakfast.
Inside our room was a little lounge setting and to the right was the king bed. to the right is a small room which has a cupboard, dressing table and a place for your suitcase. The safe is in the cupboard. Ours was a deluxe room by the way. The is a mini bar and TV with lots of channels plus a sliding door that leads to a small balcony. Straight across you can see the other wing which looks to have larger rooms than the one we had.

The room was cleaned each day but at differing times. The air con was on all the time and is nice and cold. The bathroom was HUGE. and has a toilet, shower, separate bath and sink. So if there were two of you one could shower in the bath and one could use the shower. The water was a little hit and miss in regard to temp and pressure. But still very good.

Leaving our room you walk back toward reception but take a flight of stairs down and once at the ground you walk to the right which will take you to the very nice and quite large pool. The restaurant is just around to the right. You will have tickets to hand over to get your meal which is buffet style, There is a chose of different Indonesian style foods plus bacon, sausages and other items. They have a staple set of food that did does not change but then change a few of the items to give you a range.
There is fresh fruit, coffee, toast and really quite a lot to eat. As you stand facing the ocean which you can get to through a gate just past the pool and down a couple of steps, is the egg station, any style you like and cooked very well.

If you walk out of the hotel through this back gate you are on a path that runs along the beach. At the moment (2012) there are small warungs and bars here but I believe they are to be moved and they should not have been built so close to the water.
Walking to the left takes you to Cocoon and then on to Melasti Street and then on to Kuta.

To leave your hotel you walk out of your room past reception, down a flight of stairs, past security and your on the small road out the front of the hotel to the right is a dead end but to the left it is only a short walk to Jalan Dhyana Pura, Once you get here, left takes you to the beach and to the right take you shopping our to a lot of restaurants. The is also a very good money changer on the right hand side inside a small but well stocked supermarket.

Selamat sukses

1012,Ok hotel for few nights,30,January 2012,"Stayed with my husband and 5 year old son for 4 nights. Weidn't expect much because we had read all the reviews and our hopes weren't up. We were quite positively surprised, the room was ok, clean, of course smelled a little bit of mould but we exactly weren't much in that room. The bed was big and comfy, the AC worked well. At first when we arrived they gave us the room with 2 beds and when we asked extra bed for our son they said they'll charge 60USd per day for it. We said that we don't pay that kind of money and asked for a room with a king bed, we thought that we'll sleep together in one bed for one night and then change the hotel. For our surprise the room with the king bed they gave us, had already extra bed in it and we didn't have pay for it. The breakfast in the restaurant was ok but once we ordered some salads for lunch and they were terrible. We ate on the beach at the warung Chirinquito at the right side from the hotel beach exit.They had excellent food and we even managed to talk them to sell us a bottle of local wine for 150000 (it was 240 inthe menu). The local wine appared to be quite good :) We didn't go much outside of the hotel by foot, we had our own driver who picked us up from the hotel and we drove around to the temples and markets etc. During our stay in the end of Jan.2012 the beach was extremely dirty, compared to this, the beach in Sanur was like paradise.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1013,lovely pool,40,January 2012,"Stayed here for 2 nights and found it to be a very nice 3 star hotel. The pool was very nice, warm and clean, the pool bar attendant very helpful and chatty and made a fuss of my 7 year old daughter. Access to the beach was very easy, beaches not being my thing I won't comment on that. The restaurant was clean, staff helfpul and the outlook over the beach and pool was very nice. As it was rainy season when I stayed there it rained very heavily one morning and as the restaurant doesn't have glass in the windows only rattan blinds, the wind and rain were blowing in and creating a bit of a hazard although a staff member was there trying in vain to keep the area clear as much as he could, not his fault - it was an immense downpour. Well done for trying.
This property is very long and narrow which at the end of a long, hot, humid day was annoying in that I had to walk what I considered too far just to get to my room, a minor problem though. Also, as it is on 2 levels with the pool at ground level I felt a lift would be a welcome addition to get to my room on the top level. It is hard when you are trying to carry towels, and all the other stuff my daughter wanted in the pool to climb stairs with wet feet.
The hotel itself is situated at down an alley at the end of the main shopping street in Seminyak, about 200 meteres or so to the shops and restaurants themselves, this makes for a very quiet hotel and for the duration of my visit I did not hear a sound which is important to me.
The best indictment I can give the Pelangi is this... I would stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1014,Not worth it,20,October 2011,"Just reading some of the reviews about the Pelangi and want to add some of our experience. We have been to Bali a couple of times and try to stay in different hotels as much as possible to have different experiences. Never had any problems and we are not fussy, just want a clean room, bit of privacy and a really nice swimming pool.
Our experience of the Pelangi was a dark, narrow corridor with old watermarks on the wall, leading to the rooms, linen had lots of marks on it, curtains old and weary, balcony so small, two cairs can nearly fit on both.Also you can see from bedroom window into other people's room and they into yours.
Apart of the above, staff at entrance very friendly, but staff in rest of hotel seems not trained very well, throw linen on floor in corridor etc.
The swimming pool is very nice but only a few chairs around it, the other around the corner, out of sight of the pool and very little or no shade.
Expensive internet ( even in Bali standards) in hotel lobby, but free wi fi at pool area.
We did not stay for the time booked and did not think the hotel deserve it's star rating.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1015,MyVacation,30,February 2012,"I stay at early February 2012. The view was so great but the beach was so dirty and dog was everywhere. Food was bad.... Room was just average and the bed was smelly.. the corridor was so long and no lift. Maybe because it just 2 floor. the road toward the hotel was so dark and you may not feel safe to walk alone. the good point is the place is relaxing, good staff and great pool... can get better with money you spend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1016,Loved our first experience of Bali at the Pelangi!,50,January 2012,"My husband and I stayed with two other couples at the Pelangi for 7 nights. We had the best time ever!! We stayed in a superior room which was big enough for us. However my brother stayed in the deluxe room overlooking the pool which was very nice. Bigger and had it's own safety deposit box. However, the little amount of time we spent in the room, it didn't make a difference.
The staff were excellent. They remembered our names, especially the ones working at the pool bar ;) as we spent a lot of time there. The 'lime crush' was amazing!! But it is hard to beat the good ol' Bintang.
We would defiantly stay at the Pelangi again. The rooms were clean, breakfast was awesome and you can't beat the view. Loved the relaxed atmosphere.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1017,Location...check. Price....check. Staff...check.,50,January 2012,"I can not fault this place. It is in a perfect location. Sea view from the restaurant and pool is pretty intoxicating. Rooms were clean, quiet and the beds were great. Airco worked perfectly and everything was well organised. Were on first name basis with most of the staff after a couple of days. They were incredibly helpful but at the same time disarmingly informal. This made for a very relaxing stay. Breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, but certainly nothing to complain about either. Internet access cost 50000 on the hotel's computers. That got you 60min and you had to use it in one sitting. They have free wifi in the restaurant, so it is our fault for not being armed with our own laptop / tablet. Won't hesitate to book again for our next trip to Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1018,Large hotel/damp room,40,January 2012,"we finished our Bali travels with 4 nights @the Pelangi. The rooms were fine however floor was wet when we arrived & the room always seemed damp. However we still enjoyed our stay with ample selection for breakfast, nice view from the pool & breakfast area. Staff were friendly & we used the shuttle bus to Kuta a couple of times.

Arranged a tour to Ulawati /Jambaran bay which was good value",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1019,Great location !!,40,January 2012,We enjoyed our 4 night stay here. The breakfast were great with a good selection. The rooms were clean but damp (I think it was the aircons). The staff were very good at their jobs & fast to serve you. The pool was wonderful as was the swim up bar & the Bailey's Comet cocktails that they make was fabulous. A lot of Aussies were staying there & we met some nice people. They have a curtousy bus which runs into Kuta every 2 hours & u get your own way home. Blue Bird taxis are the best ones to use as they have meters in them. It is situated right on the beach & the view from the pool & restaurant is of the bech & the sun sets are great.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1020,Perfect Pelangi - great price and even greater location!,50,June 2011,"We have stayed at the Pelangi Hotel three times in the past 4 years and each experience has been fantastic and keeps on getting better. Not only do the staff ensure you have a memorable experience but you are made to feel a part of the Pelangi family. The price and location of the hotel attracted us in the first place but another hidden treasure in this hotel is the pool overlooking Seminyak beach. Did I mention the amazing breakfast? You sit in the restaurant having breakfast whilst looking out to sea, watching the locals take their morning dip, tourists having an early morning surf or a walk along the beach. Another perfect day in paradise. We will be returning to the Pelangi next year for my 50th birthday, not that we need an excuse to return and as usual we will be greeted by the beautiful staff who are now more like family. I can't recommend this hotel enough!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1021,Reasonable hotel,40,January 2012,"Stayed in Pelangi for 2 nights and eventhough it was fully booked, we hardly see a crowd & it was pretty very quiet. Enjoyed the view for breakfast with the front sea view & the lovely swimming pool beside the restaurant. The breakfast was good. The rooms were clean but have a dull outlook maybe they should have brighter lightings especially the walkway to the rooms. We were disappointed with one of the 3 rooms we booked had a very strong cigarette odour so we managed to change it. We had dinner outside the hotel which was reasonable & tasty but forgot the name and after that 6 of us had a foot massage at one the spas along the road with RP55,000 per hr. per person. Another disappointment was the guy at the concierge counter promised us a van for 6 of us with 5 luggage bags for RP50,000 to another nearby location but he was not around when one of his staff turned up with a van not big enough to put all of us in! Had paid him earlier but luckily after making so much fuss, we were refunded & managed to get two taxis with the price around RP30,000 for our 30 mins trip!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1022,Great location on the Beach,40,January 2012,"I have been to Bali a few times but this was our first visit to Seminyak and we Stayed for 2 nights at this Hotel it was a pleasant and relaxing experience. The area is alot quieter than the Kuta/Legion area which at the best of times is chaos. The room was spacious with private clean bathroom facilies and air conditioning. Balcony was very small so if you like to sit outside its a bit cramped. Like most Bali 3 star properties that have been around for a few years hotel rooms tend to be in need of a bit of maintenance/paint, towels and bed linen have seen better days and are a bit worn but this is part of the Balinese hotel experience. You get what you pay for, if your wanting 4/5 star accommodation but on a budget price dream on. Also depending where your room is you could have quiet a long walk from the reception area. Like most of the older style hotels there is always alot of stairs. So if your visiting with children, or people who need assistance to walk request a ground floor room through your travel agent. We were greeted by Friendly and helpful staff a cool hand towel and welcome drink. Fantastic pool area with a swim up bar and a plentiful buffet breakfast in the morning. Being so close to the beach you can walk through the hotel grounds and visit the many little restaurants and shops along the beach front. Also the main street with more shopping/restaurants etc is less than 5 minutes walk. Seminyak is more upmarket so the shopping tends to be more boutique/fashion and prices reflect this. If you have small children apart from the kids pool area there are no other children activities such as a kids club. In the hotel lobby there is a desk where you can organise tours etc and also a trip to the spa is worthwhile. While staying at the Pelangi I was given a voucher for 2 free 15 minute back massages which was lovely. Hotel spa prices are always more expensive than out on the street as government tax is always added on, but the difference is staff that work in the hotel spas have been trained professionally at college in the art of massage and aromatherapy. We enjoyed our experience at the Pelangi, definately worth visiting.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1023,Good for the price,30,January 2012,"This was our 3rd stay at the Pelangi, but the last time we stayed was '05. It was interesting to see how far north the Seminyak action has moved in 7 years. The Pelangi used to be one of the more northern placed hotels in Seminyak, but now there is so much more up around the Oberoi in the way of hotels and restaurants.
The good- the staff are really lovely and can't do enough to help. A lot remembered us from our last visit in '05 which was fun. The pool is teriffic, and if you have a toddler you'll be very happy with the shallow section as it is quite large and really keeps them happy. The superior room is fine size wise, even with a rollaway in it. Heaps of cable channels, and if you get a ground floor room you have a little area rather than a smallish balcony with the upstairs rooms.
The bad- the food (esp breakfast) could and should be much better. They are not as well priced as some of the restaurants outside that are really good like Lucky Day. Breakfast got pretty boring after day 4 and had limited choice. Anything we ordered for lunch by the pool was just average, even Balinese dishes. However they make good cocktails!
Might sound petty- but towels and bed linen looked tired and were often stained. It's not a $20 a night backpackers- I think they could spring for some new manchester.

Overall- best price you will find if you want to be in Seminyak and have a nice pool and friendly staff. Be aware if you are wanting to go to restaurants like La Lucciola, Sarong, Chandi, Potato Head that these are a short taxi ride away rather than quick walking distance. Having said that, you are probably looking at tripling the cost of your per night stay if you want to be further north.
Would we stay there again- no. 3rd time was it for us, time to find new digs.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1024,Happy with the Pelangi Hotel,40,December 2011,"We stayed at the Pelangi for our first holiday to Bali. It had everything we needed. The hotel and restaurant staff were always pleasant and happy for a chat. The room was clean and spacious. The restaurant provided a good variety at breakfast (the pancakes were a favourite) and we had dinner which was very good and also ordered room service. Tried out the Spa however found others outside which were cheaper but have no other complaint. The hotel has an entrance straight onto the beach to which there were a number of places to eat. The taxi service and free shuttle bus to Kuta were all appreciated. The hotel also in walking distance to shops and a convenience store. Spent a lot of time in the pool so found that really good.
Only had a couple of little complaints overall such as not getting the best sleep in the bed and they would forget to provide us with clean towels once they have taken our dirty ones. As we were on the ground floor it also a bit noisy from the room above. So nothing that would stop us going there again.
I would happily recommend to friends and family.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1025,Great Job Pelangi.,50,January 2012,"Although our holiday got off to a bit of a shaky start, as we got stranded at the airport, as there was a bit of confusion re our transport, The Pelangi could not appologise enough and made sure that they arranged transport back to the airport instead, which was not on our agenda.

This trip we downgraded our room to a superior room, Whislt these rooms are ok, if it fits your budget, I definantly recomend the upgrade. The upgraded rooms which are around us$40 extra per night are a great step ahead of the standard room.

The room we had is in a bit of need of a bit of TLC and a lick of paint, however having said that the painters and decorators are about 5 rooms up the corridoor, so I am sure once they get down to this room it will have a nice fresh look and smell again.

The staff are exactly what you expect in Bali, they are ALL very attentive and helpfull. Within 2 days it seems everybody knows your name and what you like.

Over all, there are fancier resorts around, but for value for money, and for a genuine Bali experience the Pelangi is a wonderful place to stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1026,Couldn't get much better,50,February 2011,"We booked this hotel for our first trip to Bali and we will definitely return.

Pelangi is located on the beach in Seminyak. It's far enough from Kuta to relax yet central enough to see the best of Bali.

The rooms are well appointed and clean, the facilities are top notch and the location is perfect but by far the best asset is the wonderful staff. We were well cared for by Tari, Mei and Ady amongst others. They advised us on sights to see and were very helpful in providing conversational practice in Indonesian though all staff spoke English beautifully. These wonderful people really made our holiday and were accommodating to our every request.

The only thing to be faulted is the Western food on the menu tasted a bit odd, though I think this problem is not unique to the Pelangi or Bali for that matter. The traditional meals are much better.

Book in at the Pelangi. You won't be disappointed.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1027,effort plus,40,December 2011,"We spent Xmas and new year here and it was great, the hotel staff were so pleasant and welcoming.
The superior room we stayed in was fantastic, very spacious, massive bed and the best nights we have slept in a hotel bed for ages.
The food we had from the room service menu was brilliant, succulent tender steak and lamb chops were cooked perfectly.
The new years eve entertainment and food was awesome, these people went to so much effort to make it special. The entertaiment was Balinese dancers, a female singer, drinking games(skulling Bintang)and had several give away prizes.
The food was a buffet catering for at least 200 guests, and food consisting of balinese and western cuisines.
Many thanks to Agus, Netri and Moody ( the pool and restaurant crew) who were very friendly and we think went the extra yard to make us welcome.

Well worth the stay",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1028,Perfect Pelangi,50,December 2011,"We had a wonderful stay at the Pelangi! I am a VERY particular person, especially when I'm travelling and I must have spent hours and hours researching where to stay and what the Pelangi was like. I went for the Deluxe room and was really glad I did. We stayed upstairs because I had seen downstairs rooms have no privacy if you want to sit outside your room. Compared with the Superior rooms, the Deluxe were much nicer. Lots of space and a big balcony. It was nice to sit out there and look at down towards the pool and beach. Every worry I had was met with reassurance from the staff, before and during our stay. The pool area was lovely, the water was not too cold which was important to me! We enjoyed the cocktails at the pool bar and ordered the calamari and onion rings, both good. There were always lounges and if you ask the staff they will put up umbrellas for you if it was not shaded. We had drinks and satay sticks in the sunset bar, very nice. Brekky was good - egg station, Western items, Asian items, pancakes, fruit etc I was glad there wasn't too much to eat as I really enjoyed going down to the beach and having lunch at the little cafes right out front. In the afternoon they pulled out the beanbags onto the sand and had little lights up, it was fantastic and we must have tried every beanbag bar! There was a Spanish place that did great tapas, most had woodfire pizza ovens, yummy Balinese food and The Champlung was my favourite for ambience, service and cocktails. If you went out the front of the hotel (where reception is) and turned right there was a little internet place that charged I think 3000 Rup for 15 mins. And if you went out front and turned left and then right and walked up the street a bit to the massage spas you will find the best one ""Carla Spa"", lovely staff, good price and cool, cool air con. At the pool end of the hotel- walk out to the right along the beach and eventually you will get to Ku De Ta and a bit further on, La Luciola (a bit of a trek). Go left and you head towards Legian. On the beach at the hotel you can get a massage by the sea and there are hawkers selling their wares, If you go left and walk up the path (not far, 5 mins) you will come to Cocoon (same owners as Ku De Ta). It was fantastic in the evening, delicious cocktails and tapas on the lounges by their pool. Then further up the street was Lanai which I really liked for its cleanliness, and mix of Balinese and Western food. We had a fabulous trip and want to thank the staff at the Pelangi for looking after us so well during our stay - The Flanagans from Perth",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1029,"Pelangi Hotel- Fantastic, amazing location & Cheap!",50,October 2011,"My cousin & I stayed here in the Deluxe suite. we paid $80 per night, and we absolutely loved it. I couldn't complain about any of it.

The location was terrific! Right on the beach and walking distance to alot of little bars. The staff were also very friendly, would always laugh & greet us when we'd arrive home from drinking at 7am in the morning !

Going back in July and I will definitely be staying here again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1030,It's what you get for 3 star price,30,December 2011,"Not the biggest fan of the hotel, but it is value for money if you are on a budget. Possibly could have liked it a whole lot more if the rooms weren't painted coral/salmon colour. The layout is fine and not on a massive block so easy to get around. The best thing about this place is the fact it is on the beach and walking and eating on the beach in the evening is beautiful. Agree with the reviews regarding food, it's pretty terrible with the exception of breaky. If you stay here don't have high expectations and eat on the beach or surrounds. Enjoy the beach!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1031,Very Peaceful,40,October 2011,"we spent 8 nights, the rooms are size of normal hotel accommadation , they are very clean with friendly helpful staff. The pool, gardens, cockatail and happy hour are great. we enjoyed our stay at Pelangi and have since met others that have stayed there as well and also enjoyed it. The pool looks over the beach but no-one walking past can see you. (so you dont get hassled to buy).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1032,Would definitely recommend this hotel,50,December 2011,"We spent last week at this hotel with friends who had been there before and recommended it and we were not disappointed. It is well priced and all of the staff were extremely accommodating. I had a special birthday there, so we were able to organise a champagne breakfast, using the champagne we had bought with us, and just had to pay a minimal corkage fee. A beautiful birthday cake was also left in the room. There were no problems with noise either, unlike reports we had from fellow tourists at some of the hotels in Legian, but I don't know whether this may have changed as many more tourists were arriving as we were leaving. The rooms were also very clean and comfortable, but the highlights are the great setting for the pool and sun lounges, as well as the restaurant and rooftop bar. There are fabulous views of the beach and ocean which is right at your doorstep, but, because of the raised elevation above beach level, there is no intrusion from outside whatsoever. At the same time, once you walk down the steps to the beach you immediately have access to numerous bars and cafes and you can walk all the way to Kuta along the pathway - you just need to be wary of the numerous motorbikes using this as well, especially the ones ridden by Westerners.
We would definitely stay there again. It is not 5 Star, but it is an extremely pleasant environment.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1033,"Friendly staff, great location!",40,December 2011,"I stayed in Pelangi Bai Hotel over Christmas. The staff were very friendly and provided prompt service. My friend who did the reservation also requested for airport pickup to and from the hotel. However this was not confirmed as we realised that the hotel did not ask for our flight number, so we thought perhaps the hotel did not arrange for it after all.

We had a nice surprise when we arrived at Depensar airport, when we saw a man holding up a sign with my friend's name. We were relieved as it was dark and we wanted to get to our hotel as soon as possible. The friendly man chatted with us along the way.

Over the 4 days, the hotel staff always greeted us and made us feel very welcome in the hotel. The breakfast is average, but I enjoyed the eggs station very much as we could have any type of eggs we wanted, be it scrambled, sunny side up or an omelette. The buffet stayed pretty much the same throughout the 4 days. It could use a bit of variety. Breakfast was made enjoyable with a great view of the sea from the restaurant.

The hotel is right on the beach so we had no problem heading to the shore. At night, the beach had a few bars that we can go to. On the first night, however, an experience in one of the bars almost spoiled the vacation. We headed to the beach on the first night by way of the pool, and on the right there is a bar that had a predominantly white tourists. We stopped by and before we could get a drink, a few drunk, white men(we think Australian) approached us and asked us where we are from. Upon hearing our asian country, one of them made a very racist remark and action, and we immediately walked away from this racist a-hole and his friends. How dare these people display racism in an asian country! One hopes he gets into a lot of trouble with the locals some day with his racist attitude. What a horrible experience on the first night. However we met other white tourists over the next days who were friendly.

The vendors on the beach did annoy us to some extent. They constantly tried to make small talk and then proceeded to hawk their wares. So us, being all girls, were always weary of them whenever they started to make small talk.

The hotel itself is decent for its amazing location affordable price, however we did see some ants, a spider in the toilet(that the staff was very nice to help us get rid of) and a baby roach in our room. I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget. However we will probably be getting a nicer hotel or a villa to fully enjoy the Bali experience.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1034,Can't wait to go back!,50,December 2011,"Absolutely loved the pelangi hotel! Like others we were a bit worried with some of the reviews but the place was so clean and rooms were well air-conditioned. Buffet was great, i had stayed at the Bali Garden in kuta last year and i often wouldnt eat the breakfast but i made sure i was up every morning at the pelangi with pancakes, danishes, egg station, cereals, fruit salads sausages, bacon and some indonesian food what more could you want?

The cocktails were yummy! with 30% off from 4-6pm and the view was amazing from the pool bar and resturant.

The staff were amazing! Made great friends that always remembered your name and always offered to help.

Yes it is a budget hotel but i think it has everything you need, we had the superior room and it was fine! we didnt spend much time in the room anyway because it was cool outside by the pool having the beach right there.

Free shuttle bus to kuta was very helpful and we will definately return there again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1035,Good value for money,40,December 2011,"Had read some negative reports on TA regarding this hotel however we had stayed at Pelangi before and choose to stay again. Again, clean rooms, nice staff, and good food. A real tell tale is the chats you have with other customers around the pool. Plenty good feedback. ""Agus"" works in the bar and restaurant and nothing was too much effort for him nor any of the staff really. Key staff will quickly learn your name and check on you in an uninvasive manner to ensure you have a drink, check how your day was, recommend tours or day trips. We were referred on to Jimbaran Bay for a seafood meal on the beach at sunset. Free pick up and drop off, a really memorable night. There is also an awsome little warung/beach bar about 100mts off the back of the resort where you can sit on beanbags in the sand and drink cocktails until midnight under low light umbrellas with glowing tables. Hotel has good vibe, friendly staff, surf beach, good overall location just a short walk into town. I would recommend as a 3 to 3 1/2 star resort. Given very little is what you might expect in Bali, this resort is reliable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1036,Would stay again,40,September 2011,"Was a bit worried before we left having read some of the reviews on here,however, was plenty suprised. The rooms were clean, food was beautiful and had great service. Overall was really impressed with what we got for how cheap it was.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1037,Continues to please.,50,November 2011,"This was our 4th stay at the Pelangi and again was most enjoyable. The staff as always were polite and cheerful, nothing was too much trouble. The gardens continue to evolve and are looking spectacular. The location right on the beach, near to the Warungs with their tasty cheap meals and cheerful live music in the evening is a real plus. The free shuttle to Kuta is great and you can be dropped of anywhere along the way. We always enjoy our brekfast sitting and admiring the view of the beach. Other reviewers comment that the breakfast is not varied enough. We travel a fair amount and have not stayed anywhere that serves a bigger choice, I do wonder what they eat at home.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1038,"Great Hotel, Great Price & Great Location!!",50,November 2011,"We have just got back from a 5 night stay at The Pelangi and it was wonderful!! It's not a 5 star resort but it is clean, comfortable and the staff are so friendly. If we had any requests they were attended to straight away. The pool is beautiful. We saw a couple of other hotel pools and while they may be larger; the Pelangi's pool sparkled. It is in a great location set on the beach, many great restaurants and shops nearby without the noise of Kuta & Legian. We stayed in the superior room... yes, it is much smaller than the deluxe, but it is clean and comfortable (the bathrooms are fine). We will stay there again for sure.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1039,Comfortable Hotel for budget price,40,November 2011,"This was my second time at Pelangi Hotel. This hotel is clean and neat, and great value for money. My first trip was with a large group of friends (we were all in Bali for a wedding) and it was a perfect base for us all. This time I stayed with my Husband and we probably wouldn't stay again as a couple. The rooms are comfortable but pretty basic, maybe not the kind of place you would want to stay for a romantic getaway. The pool area is lovely and well maintained. It has a swim-up bar with very friendly staff. Tip - Don't use the toilets at the pool area, they are pretty run down and a bit dirty! The location is great, right on the beach. In the 3 years since I last stayed at the Pelangi and the beach has been cleaned up a lot and the hawkers that harrassed us on our last trip are now nowhere to be seen. It is an easy walk into Seminyak's shopping presinct and it is always easy to grab a taxi to get to the restaurants and bars of Seminyak. Having said all that, I don't think you could find a better place for the price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1040,good value on the beach,40,August 2011,"For a place right on the beach, this hotel represents good, basic value. Our room ( a standard) was spacious and clean. The pool was large, well located and spotless, with a convenient swim-up bar. Pool staff were most friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellant, if you get there early. Plenty of restaurants and activities close by. Front desk staff were efficient, if not the most friendly we have encountered. We have stayed at quite a few places in Kuta, Legian and Seminyak, and this hotel offered the best value and location of all.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1041,Fantastic hotel for a budget price,40,August 2011,"We stayed for a week in August and I was slightly hesistant when booking based on all the bad reviews. Our room was great, really large (we did book one of the larger rooms). Rooms were cleaned every day, staff were really friendly & helpful. We booked this hotel knowing it was not one of the best as we didn't want to spend a fortune on accomodation. For approx $110 a night I can't fault the rooms or service. Breakfast was not amazing but it did the job. If you're looking for a good hotel and you're on a budget I would stay here. BUT make sure you book a better room than the standard (we showered in one the standard rooms as we had already checked out and they were tiny and bathrooms terrible).",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1042,Average Hotel,30,December 2010,"Average room, small bathroom. Staff were very friendly, pool area small not very pleasant to lay out. Cocktails from Pool bar were disgusting. Buffett breakfast was nothing special. No safe in room which was annoying as I had just gotten enagaged and did not wish to wear my new ring swimming. We also never received our bond back. Would not stay here again, Friends of ours were at the Padma and I must say I was very envious of them considering our hotel was nothing special.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1043,Average hotel with small pool area.,30,December 2010,"This hotel is definitely an average 3 star hotel. Rooms are basic,pool area small, one plus is the hotel is on the beach. Food average, a bit out of the way.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1044,Best holiday ever.,50,October 2011,"This has to be the best place to stay.The rooms were clean & spotless every day.The location was perfect not to far to walk to shops and resturants.The staff were helpful and polite.The breakfast was good every day.Could not fault on minute of our stay, would go back again & again.Thanks again to all the staff for a fantastic 12 days of pure BLISS.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1045,"Amazing staff, wonderful stay.",50,October 2011,"Cannot fault the Pelangi. A fantastic hotel with a stunning pool, clean rooms and wonderful staff.

Beautiful beach with a breathtaking sunset.

Highly recommended!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1046,My first and last hotel on Bali,50,May 2011,I loved the Pelangi! It was right on the beach. I spent a month on Bali and this was by far the best hotel i visited. I loved lazying in the pool and looking at the beach/sunset. The folks running the place were all very nice and remembered me when i returned after my month long trip around Bali. The brunch every morning was great to wake up to. The town is right out your door and very walkable. I will stay here again. My room got so cold (on purpose because that's how I like it) i used a blanket. The Pelangi was able to cool me down with my AC and pool during my very hot stay on Bali. The Balinese are what makes Bali the nicest place i've visited yet all over the world.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1047,Loved the Pelangi,50,October 2011,"We stayed in a Deluxe Spa Room, the room was spacious and well maintained. The linen changed daily and the bathroom was clean and ample toiletries provided. The room was at the end of the corridor but no pool noise was evident due to the lush, well maintained garden in between. Our breakfasts were of a good standard and some items changed daily. The egg station girls were busy and friendly. The staff at the hotel are great, from the front desk all the way through the ranks. The pool is great and the swim up bar is a nice touch. Walk down to the beach and enjoy the beach warungs, wow, they are so cool. Crystal Palace and La Plancha were our favorites and sunsets on a bean bag sipping a cocktail were memorable. We enjoyed the location of the Pelangi for the beach strip scene but if its street action you crave, a taxi anywhere is cheap. The hotel represents good value in an expensive area, it is not as manic or glossy as some of the other large hotels can be, we thought the hotel has class but not overdone. We would stay here again as we loved the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1048,Great start & stop location for exploring Bali,40,October 2011,"Honestly i can not understand the mediocre reviews this hotel has received so far.

Me and fiancee stayed here at the beginning and end of our stay and we were very happy. The rooms are good size, clean etc The pool area is excellent and the ocean view great. Staff were very friendly and helpful. To us this was a very good value for money hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1049,"Quiet spot, nice pool, value for money.",30,October 2011,"Good:
-pool
-location (quiet area of seminyak, but would be long walk without scooter)
-close to beach (and is a good part of seminyak - nice and quiet)

Bad:
-breakfast is basic and not that good
-expensive to hire DVD player (100k per night)
-no free wifi in rooms (only at restaurant)
-no safe deposit box in room
-room service food quality

Overall it is probably what you should expect for the price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1050,Really couldn't find any negatives.,50,October 2011,"As it was our first time in Bali we only stayed 6 nights but soon wished we'd booked for a whole lot longer. The hotel is in a great location on the beach and easily accessible for all the ""Bean Bag Bars"" on the beach. The welcome was warm and friendly, we were greeted with ""Cocktails"" and bags acrried to our room. We had a fairly standard room which adjoining the kids room. There was no great frills but it was comfortable and clean with air-con, a mini bar and TV. The pool area was delightful with enough beds, the staff (thankfully) cleared towels off sun beds if they'd been unattended for more than an hour by the inconsiderate gits who ""booked"" them before brekkie and weren't seen for hours.
Brekkie was included and perfectly acceptable and plentiful.
The swim-up bar was a popular place and well priced with our kids making full use of booking their Mocktails to the room, which at $3 each wasn't really an issue, and they loved it.
It was a $1 Taxi ride (including a tip) to all the shops and restaurants in Seminyak so the ""not being in the middle of things"" argument doesn't really hold any water. Fact is, if you are ""in the middle of things"" then you are a $1 Taxi ride from the beach. Them's the breaks!
We will probably stay here again but if this very high standard is achieveable at the lower end of the market then I'm wondering just what it's like in a pricier place. Or do we just stay with what we know?
The upstairs restaurant was pretty ordinary and when we ate there we were the only ones there, which is unfortunate but not entirely surprising as the wealth of eating options nearby is vast. It's still an excellent hotel and this review isn't for the restaurant, so five stars from me.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1051,We would like to stay with Pelangi again,50,October 2011,"My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights, things were perfect and the staff there had hid a small free of charge birthday cake for my husband which makes him totally surprised.
The location is good as we both prefer to have somewhere quiet, you can find lots of local shops, bars and eating places within walking distance.
The swimming pool is clean and the hotel itself is link directly to the beach.
It was a great experience with Pelangi in Bali, and we would like to stay there again next time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1052,"Clean, Tidy and Friendly",30,August 2011,"I travelled in August 2011 with 3 friends to Bali. We were recommended the Pelangi as a quieter, friendly and more personal hotel. We were not disappointed. We booked adjoining standard (?) rooms and they were clean and spacious enough for the price. They opened out to a beautiful garden area where we could sit in the evenings. Breakfast selection was varied and all tasted very nice. The staff were all friendly and always helpful. Free wifi in the restaurant, safety deposit boxes in the office only, but you could access them any time. Food in the restaurant was really well priced and plenty of 'western' options. Not sure if suitable for children as no playground or large grassy areas but is right on the beach. Just on the beach outside the hotel are several warungs where you can get cocktails, dinner and entertainment for pretty cheap. I really loved the hotel and the atmosphere but (the only down side) is that you can't walk to many markets or restaurants - there are a few but to get the eat street or more shopping you need a cab. Only about $4 (aus) to get to Kuta and they are just out the front of the hotel or walk to the corner. A mini mart is only 5 minutes walk and you can get everything there - including money changing.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1053,You get what you pay for!,30,October 2011,"Yeah in a word dissapointing. I'm from the Blue Mountains of Sydney and I wasn't impressed!!

Pros:
*It's cheap $80-$110 per night
*Pool is clean
*Staff are very friendly
*Showers are hot

Cons:
*Not near anything
*Breakfast Buffet is awful, bacon soggy, toast dry, butter rank, fruit tasteless, not enough choices
*There are not enough pool chairs to go around
*The cocktails are tasteless
*the rooms are rundown we were in #126

We actually booked out early and moved to the Padma where we stayed for our honeymoon.

We have learned our lesson, the Padma will be our only choice from now on",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1054,First Bali Family Holiday - Not the last!,50,September 2011,"We had never been to Bali before and went on the recommendation of friends of ours who had just come back. We have 3 kids ranging from 8 - 14yrs. From the moment we arrived we knew we had made a great choice staying at The Pelangi! Staff are sooo freindly and helpfull. Accommodation was great, connecting rooms are available on request. The pool is gorgeous and the kids and ourselves loved the pool bar! The beach is literally out the back of the hotel and it's only a short walk along the beach path to Legion/Kuta for all your Bali shopping needs. Seminyak is ok for shopping a little more expensive thou. Overall it really was the BEST holiday we have had as a family. Thanks to all staff there, we will be back!:)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1055,Not value for money,30,September 2011,"This was our last place for stay on our first recent trip to Bali. We had a superior room with a spa, I could have blown harder bubbles in a bathtub than what the spa offered! The positives to this resort would only have to be the good sized room, the wonderful staff and the close proximity to Seminyak and the beach. Apart from this there is no gardens to relax in, the long corridors to the rooms are dark and dinghy, the food (apart from the Pelangi burger) is quite average and there is no entertainment on offer. We found we headed to the beach of an evening to listen to some wonderful music. I would only probably recommend this hotel if you were not intending to stay in your room for too long.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1056,Step from the Hotel onto the sand,40,September 2011,"This was our second stay at Pelangi with our teenage sons.The rooms are clean and comfortable with plenty of space for the short time that we spent there.Breakfast is served over looking the beach and has a reasonable variety of food.The pool is great to relax and read a book at any time during the day the swim up bar makes ordering a drink easy. The staff are friendly and eager to help make your stay comfortable.The Pelangi has a relaxed Balinese feel.
The hotel provides a free shuttle into Kuta but Seminyak offers many great restaurants with good shopping all a short stroll from the Pelangi but a much quieter location.
The beach huts offer great value meals and drinks and the local beach sellers are a warm group of people ready to give you a great value massage pedicure or manicure.Excellent location for a Bali Sunset and a Bintang on the beach.Hotel value good considering its location as more expensive properties usually have this type of beach access.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1057,Pelangi,30,August 2011,"Couldn't agree more with ""Longmarch"" London re breakfast. We found the hotel in need of an upgrade as looking very worn, especially bathrooms.No in room safe which I would think would be a basic requirement. Having said that, on a positive note, the staff were very nice and it is in a good location.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1058,Good hotel and great staff - shame about breakfast,40,August 2011,"Just returned from Bali and stayed at the Pelangi.

We had a ""superior"" room which was in very good condition and had been partly refurbished (new sink and toilet in the bathroom, great shower too). The room was thoroughly cleaned each day and new sheets and towels provided every day.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and could not do enough for you.

The pool was very good (towels are provided) and you could relax there all day or step down from the poolside area to the beach.

The only downside was the breakfast - coffee was like tar,hot food was cold and tasteless, egg station and toast were fine.

Food and drink in the hotel was quite expensive but only relatively so and if you did not want to have a drink in the hotel you could step down to one of the beach bars.

Restaurants and other bars are a short walk up and down the beach or a bit further back to the main road - but cabs are very cheap (ensure you have the meter running or don't get in).

All in all a good hotel to stay in.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1059,"Not too fancy but fabulous location, great pool and friendly staff",40,July 2011,"We usually try to break up our Bali holidays by staying in two places, one flash and the other a cheaper option.
This time we had two nights at the Pelangi Bali Hotel in a Deluxe Room. With more space than a Standard room and a better shower and bathroom for only a few dollars more this is the option to go with if you can afford it. That's not to say the standard rooms aren't good - all the rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. A free buffet breakfast is served every morning in the open air restaurant overlooking the beach and swimming pool. While you have to pay for in room wi fi, you can access it free in the restaurant and by the pool.

The Pelangi is well located right on the beach with a fantastic swimming pool that has a swim up bar. The hotel is five minutes walk along the beach from Double Six and Cocoon and only two doors away from the newly refurbished GadoGado Restaurant. On the beach outside there are a few warungs where you can get great cheap food and bintang beer which is a perfect place to watch the sun go down.

With a very friendly staff and now offering a courtesy room where you can shower after you've checked out and waiting for a later flight - I'd recommend the Pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1060,"Great location, nice hotel.",30,July 2011,"We stayed at The Pelangi for two weeks during the July school holidays. It's a nice hotel in a fantastic location (love walking along the beach strip). Shops may not be right on the doorstep but only a short ride away. The breakfast needs an overhaul and most of us stopped eating there after the first week (egg station needs to work on their poached eggs, although i'm told the omlette's were great). It was better to walk to MUGSHOT coffee and have a great ""flat white"". The rooms are clean and were kept very neat and tidy by the staff. Yes, they could do with some fresh paint, but we didn't spend our days in the room, so it wasn't an issue. There was plently of room around the pool even though it was peak season. Never had a problem getting a sunlounge. Overall, this is an average hotel on the beach, clean, tidy and nice staff, but we would stay somewhere else next time. Ps the cats and dogs in the lane next door took turns in their nightly chorus - disturbing alot of sleep.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1061,would never stay here again,20,June 2011,I would just like to warn people of this hotel .we felt it was very basic with not much to offer.unless you enjoy rats running around your room all night and staff coming to your room moving everything around to tell you they can't see them well der! have been to Bali 4 times so many better places to stay.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1062,A terrific time again,50,May 2011,"We were welcomed to Room 301 and the stay for 2 weeks was wonderful. Meals, staff and the hotel courtesy van were all really good. It was also nice to see Rudi - one of the beach hawkers again too.
Thanks Pelangi.

1063,Fantastic Stay!,40,October 2010,"We stayed at the Pelangi Hotel in October with some friends of ours (2 seperate rooms). I found the hotel to be beautiful! Great, friendly service from the staff! The breakfast each morning was amazing - I loved having the choice of their traditional breakfast (noodles were the best!) and a more ""normal"" breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, etc. We only ate at the hotel restaurant once, the dinner meals werent that great, but with so many restaurants to pick from just a short walk down the road - even if the meals were fantastc we probably would have picked different places to eat each night anyway. I had a facial and a massage at the spa - and really enjoyed both! The prices are cheap and its very easy to ring ahead and book from your room.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1064,Loved it so much we came back the same week,50,June 2011,We stayed at the Pelangi for the first half of our holiday and then went to East Bali. 2 days after leaving we regretted it and emailed the Pelangi asking to come back. Even though they were booked out they did a bit of shuffling for us and we stayed there for the rest of our holiday.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1065,Great location. Great staff. Great time!,50,May 2011,"The pelangi was a fantastic hotel. Unfortuinetely we were only there for 3nights but next time we would love to stay longer. Out the front of the hotel you had to walk a bit to get to the clubs/bars and shopping district, however by walking along the beach we thought you see a lot more and gets you there faster. Can't wait to rerturn. Staff are very plesant and the roof top restaurant was fantastic. Plus there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1066,Average hotel. location a little out of the way.,30,June 2011,"This hotel was quite nice. Clean. Not really set up for children. Guests consisted mostly of couples and groups of friends. Staff were friendly but not overly. Food was very mediocre. Most people went to other restaurants to eat. Be aware that this Hotel is in a cul-de-sac. So is a little further to get to from main shopping areas. in saying that taxis are very cheap. Not really very close to main shopping areas which are in Legion (Padma st and melasti st). Also Kuta has alot of shopping. Breakfast was quite good, in that it was close to the beach.
Spa here also very mediocre service.
All in all average to good hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1067,Great location,40,April 2011,"Stayed in a superior room (King room with a combined living area and balcony). We paid the extra after being told by travel agent the bigger rooms are better. After staying and seeing inside the standard rooms (they just don't have a living area), I would have been happy to save the money and stay in one of the standard rooms. The hotel is a little dated, but still very comfortable & clean. Nice pool with swim-up bar & overlooks the beach. Only ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast, which was always good. The grounds are a bit lacking - no lush gardens & tropical plants like so many places in Bali. The hotel is within walking distance to all the nice beach restaurants in Legian near double six road & ""eat street"" in Seminyak in the other direction, good shopping close by. There was a little bar on the beach on our walks up to Legian called White Palace which had great happy hour and yummy cocktails. Ruty down at the beach right in front of the hotel was a lovely lady doing massage - my husband visited her every day! Overall, the location is great and the hotel is 3 star - I would be more than happy to stay here again, but would only be prepared to pay up to $100 per night for a standard room. It isn't worth any more than that. I wouldn't book a bigger room again as we didn't need the extra space and didn't use the lounge room at all. When booking a room, ask for one closest to the beach end, otherwise you will have to walk for ages to get to breakfast/beach/pool. Also, there are no lifts (which is pretty standard for older Bali hotels) so if you don't like stairs, ask for ground floor.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1068,A Great place to stay,50,June 2011,"This is our third stay at the Pelangi and was as good as ever. The staff always have a smile and greeting, are always willing to help. Any problems are attended to straight away. Breakfast overlooking the beach is a terrific way to start any day. We enjoyed our morning stroll along the beach and lunches at the small beach restaurants. The Pelangi's location in Seminyak gives easy access to many local restaurants, our favourite would be the Delicious Onion. The Hotel runs 5 free shuttles to Kuta each day and will drop you of any where along the way, very handy. Will definately stay again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1069,Looked great ..was great !!,40,May 2011,"We were greeted by the friendly efficient and helpful staff , and nothing was ever a problem for them during our whole stay. There was always a smile and a hello, loved the location, the restaurant had a nice view of the ocean. The meals we had, could not be faulted and we tried breakfast lunch and dinner meals ( we did eat out of the hotel also quite often ). The hotel is not new but very clean, we and our friends would gladly stay there again. Our thanks to the staff who made our first experience of Bali a pleasant and momerable one.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1070,"Great location - good value for money, friendly staff",40,May 2011,"I stayed here for a week with a friend - because it is a smaller hotel there is a lovely friendly feeling to the place the staff remember your name and say hello. The pool area is lovely and it has direct access to the beach, the breakfast smorgasboard was lovely and one of the highlights of the day was sitting down to a gorgeous breakfast while watching the waves crash down on the beach no more that 100 metres away. One of the more reasonably priced hotels in Seminyak the rooms are a looking a little tired but are very clean and the staff turn up very promptly if there are any additional items required . It was my birthday while I was there and the manager sent a lovely cake to my room with a birthday message from the hotel, a nice touch. We thoroughlyenjoyed our time here and would definetly go back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1071,"good price for location, but not much else.",30,May 2011,"Stayed here because the reviews werent horrible and it was one ofthe more fairly priced hotels that was on the beach. That being said, i was given a room the farthest from the beach possible, making it a trek downstairs and then all the way down the hotel past the beach and restaurant, and then across the sidewalk.

the rooms: clean and had a balcony which was nicde, but rooms were at least 30 yrs old and needed to be refurbished or something. There was EXCESSIVE wildlife living in the room with me. Upon arrival I found a spide the size of my head on the ceiling (house maintance took care of it quickly). Geckos and mosquitos were also plentiful. I had trouble sleeping the last night because i only heard geckos scuffling around all night in the room.

No in room wifi. Wifi is only available at the outdoor restaurant. Prepare to be eaten by mosquitos if eating here.

The employees were all relatively friendly and smiling. Service was always quick, rooms were always very clean.

Dont expect convenient stores nearby. Takes a long walk through sidewalkless areas with no lighting. From the beach side there are however a number of cafes and restaurants in the area.

Beach outside
is overrun by locals on the weekends. Like literally every inch of the beach, so dont expect privacy or a relaxing time.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1072,"Great, Seminyak Beachfront location",50,April 2011,"I have just returned from Bali and during our time there, we spent 4 nights at the Pelangi in Seminyak. We chose the Pelangi beacuse of the beachfront location and we could not of been happier. It was great to walk down to the beach for a quick swim before breakfast in the wonderfully warm (around 28C) ocean. We also loved that the beach here is not quite as busy as the beaches to the South, but there are still several great cafes and restaurants within a couple of minutes walk. It is also just a 10 minute walk along the beach to Legian if you are looking for some more dining or shopping options. We were with a group of 7 and we booked 4 rooms. All rooms were clean and comfortable, but they were a little small. This was not really a problem though as we only used them for sleeping and storing our gear. One concern though was the lack of an in-room safe. We chose to leave valuables at reception on a couple of occassions, but would of preferred a safe. The pool was great, but as in all the resorts the food and drink prices were a little high and you'll find it much cheaper to eat and drink at the local cafes and bars. We did however have dinner in the open air, upstairs restaurant (which overlooks the pool and the beach) on 1 of the nights and even though we were the only guests eating there at that time, the food was very good. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and maintained the cleanliness of the hotel very well. If you are looking for an an affordable hotel that is clean, comfortable and friendly, then the Pelangi would be hard to beat. When you add the fantastic location then Pelangi is exceptional value. When staying in Seminyak again, I will not hesitate to book at the Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1073,"Excellent Hotel, great location and value",40,March 2011,"We enjoyed a week in the middle of March staying at the Pelangi in a Deluxe Room. The Pelangi Hotel was the best value on the beach and in Seminyak that we could find with much research on Trip Advisor. We were more than happy with our choice. the staff were wonderful, very friendly and helpful. The breakfast which was included was excellent with plenty of choice and the omelettes from the egg station were fantastic. Our room was spacious and very clean with a very comfortable bed and nice little balcony. The pool was beautiful with plenty of deck chairs for everyone and just a few steps down to the beach. We ate at the restaurant (the same one as we ate breakfast in) a few times at night if we didn't feel like going out to dinner, it was always very nice and it was wonderful sitting there watching the sunset. We recommend the Pelangi Hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1074,"Beautiful pool, great service!!!",40,August 2010,"This is in a great location on the beach and has the most beautiful pool overlooking the ocean. Brekky was included in our stay and was amazing mmmm yum! We got up early each morning and had brekky overlooking the pool and ocean, absolute bliss! This is very much a hotel style resort, rooms all in a line and on top of each other but still nice. Our standard room was very good and clean but would prefer more of an outdoor area, we only had a small one which didnt really count. The location is great as you can walk along the front of the beach to all the restaurants in Legian which I loved. I would recommend this hotel!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1075,great stay,40,March 2011,"we had a lovely garden room with a small view of the ocean. This hotel is very reasonable priced. Breakfast is included. It is located right on the beach and we found the staff very accommodating to all our requests. Massages on the beach are very cheap, cost us about $6.00. A short walk via the beach towards Kuta and there are a number of excellent restaurants. In all a great stay.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1076,"great value for money, will go again",40,March 2011,"It has been a long time since I was in Bali and have noticed a lot of changes. This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Although I agree it is in need of a bit of a spruce up in some areas it has so much going for it with a great location, very friendly efficient staff, great ocean views from the poolside and icy cold beer from the pool bar. I mixed with a lot of other guests during my 7 day stay and all were very happy to be there. I think it is a very sensibly priced hotel in am extremely good location. I intend to not leave it so long before my next visit to Bali and YES I will stay at the Pelangi again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1077,good location but very average hotel,30,March 2011,"This hotel offers good location (beachfront) but rooms are very dated. We booked three rooms and one of the rooms had a damp and mouldy smell. It was so bad my daughter and her boyfriend could not stay in there. They were shown two other rooms that were in the same state before being given a room that had no smell. The room are very dated and need a good coat of paint to freshen them up. The beds are not very comfortable and neither are the pillows. The breakfast staff had no personality whatsoever the the customer service was very poor. The staff at reception were the same. In saying this the pool staff, the grounds staff and porters were all very friendly and provided service with a smile. A warning to all people that consider staying here - do not leave any money or valuables in your room. My daughter had 700,000 rupiahs go missing from her room whilst eating breakfast. Management were trying to blame the money exchange people but no money had been changed for a couple of days. My daughter knows exactly how much money she had in her purse. There was no offer of compensation and i am still waiting a reply from them with regards to 'their investigation'.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1078,Our home away from home,50,February 2011,"We have stayed at the Pelangi in Bali for about 10 years. During that time the hotel was closed for major renovations to the dining area, and pool area. The rooms were updated and painted. the beds are new, comfortable, clean. the room service is impeccable.
A lot of the staff have been there since we first started coming and certainly appear to like their positions within the hotel. Everyone is friendly and helpful. the inifinity pool is great, love swimming up to the end where you can just stare at the Indian ocean. Gus, Murdi and their wonderful colleagues are so helpful. It;'s a great location to walk along the beach to heaps of great restaurants, including a new beach bar with bean bags on the beach and great blues music. We used the free shuttle everyday to take us out to where we wanted to shop then made our way back ourselves. My friend and I will be back, can highly recommend this hotel.

1079,Very good value for money at Pelangi,40,January 2011,"I stayed at Pelangi Bali Hotel for eight nights in the middle of January 2011. It is not the newest or the flashest on offer, but the facilities and grounds are extremely well maintained and the condition of everything at Pelangi is very good. Without a doubt good staff are one of the most essential assets of any business, and the staff at Pelangi Bali are polite, well groomed, helpful and conscientious. Despite having a bad dose of ""Bali belly"", my stay at Pelangi was thoroughly enjoyable. I'd happily stay there again - if only it wasn't in Bali!
If I have any criticism of the hotel it would be that they have no in-room safe, and no free in-room wi-fi. If you want in-room wi-fi you have to pay extra, although there is free wi-fi in the restaurant.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1080,"Great hotel, best location",40,December 2010,"We had our daughters wedding at the sunset bar, it was great with the help of Anik from Pelangi Hotel who organised us to have Ms Putu from Bali Rani Weddings. It met all our expectations for a very good price. The staff are great, we had 4 rooms, 2 superior and 2 deluxe 305 & 306 all were good but if you have 3 people deluxe has plenty of room. There are great restaurants within 10 min walk, plenty of spa places to choose from within 10 min walk as well. Spa Bali had the best massarges by far and had 40% discount so were not to much dearer than Carla spa. The breakfast were good, omolete with the lot is great. The pool is fantastic plenty of room for everyone, my older children and young grandchildren and my mother all enjoyed the stay. The 60 channels on TV were not too bad either. Only complaint is people set off fireworks every night along the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1081,"Great Staff, Great Location.",30,November 2010,"Have recently spent seven days at the Pelangi, and absolutely loved it.
The staff were extremely helpful, and always very happy. The swimming pool was of ample size for the guests staying there (occupancy approx 75% full), and with the infinity edge on the pool, made the view to the ocean very nice. Breakfasts were plentiful, and although nearly the same food was repeated daily, there was enough of a choice to keep us satisfied. We did not eat any other meals at the restaurant, except for an impromptu thunderstorm that ""trapped"" us in, where we had just a club sandwich - Fairly pricey though.
We had no problems with the sun lounges around the pool, as I had read that other people on TA had said the lounges were being ""reserved"" with towels early, and nobody using them until later in the day. We found that many people were stepping on to the beach and hiring the beach lounges for the day for a minimal fee.
The location of the Pelangi was perfect for us. It is very quiet, and it is right on the beach which is a great plus for me, and our daily beach walks, but it is not that far out from the hustle and bustle of Kuta.
We often found ourselves sitting on the beach in the late afternoons having sunset drinks with the locals, or even a snack at ""Juice Shack"" out the front, which was delicious and cheap.
The shopping around Pelangi is fairly quiet, although we much preferred a trip down to the markets in Jalan Malasti, at Legian.
The room we had was not as ""elegant"" as I thought it would be, but at the end of the day, we really only got changed and slept in there. As read before on TA, the towels and sheets could do with being renewed, but they were clean, just old. The rooms could do with a bit of a renovation and paint job, but it did the job for us.
We found it a very pleasant holiday, and a great place to stay, and felt very safe there.
No hesitation returning to The Pelangi.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1082,A wonderful haven away from the busy street,40,November 2010,"Great location away in a side street off busy Legian Street. Rooms need a coat of paint but more importantly the air conditioning worked perfectly as it was very hot and humid. Rooms were good size with tv, table and chairs, good wardrobe space, own bathroom and outside area to have a drink outside if you want to. Pool and surrounding areas are lovely which leads straight down to the beach. Food was more than adequate. We only had breakfast and desserts there as plenty of restaurants nearby. We hired a car and driver in the side street from the hotel to take us to sight seeing spots away from the shopping areas. Great spot for kids.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1083,"Clean, comfortable and awesome location",40,October 2010,"I was very apprehensive about staying here. It was my second trip to Bali (last stay was at the beautiful Padma in Legian) and I had read very mixed reviews about the place. My partner and I paid $90US a night for the superior room. Ok so the walls could do with an update from the peach colour, but the rooms were very clean, bathroom was modern, staff were friendly and rooms cleaned daily.

There was no sound of traffic from the hotel, it was right on the beach and just a few minutes walk from shops.

There were a few interesting combinations for the inclusive American Breakfast, but they did a great Omelette!

I wasn't expecting much of this hotel, so it well and truly exceeded my expectations!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1084,"great location, great value",40,November 2010,"i've just stayed at the pelangi for 4 nights on a mini break with a friend. I found the hotel really clean and comfortable, and was pleasently surprised as it was reasonably cheap. The rooms are basic, but clean, great showers, the pool area is the highlight of the hotel. Views of the beach can be seen from the sun deck,and the swim up bar is fab!
Its in a great location, just step out of the hotel onto the beach and into some great little beach shack bars and restaurants!
I would recommend this hotel, maybe not the best for kids, but definately for a getaway with a mate or partner!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1085,Average,30,October 2010,"If you are expecting big things, you will be disappointed. This is an extremely average hotel at best.
The rooms had no soundproofing whatsoever and we could hear EVERYTHING coming from the next rooms.
Breakfast is acceptable but dinner - DON'T DO IT. Eating at the hotel restaurant was the worst meal we had. I was part of a group of 8 and we all agreed it was extremely poor.
Location wasn't TOO bad - definitely quiet and a short stroll to a variety of shops and restaurants, although at night there was no lighting along the walkways which made it quite hard.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel, there are better options with better value for money.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1086,Bali or costa del..?,30,October 2010,"I am not sure about the last review as it bears no resemblance to the hotel we stayed in last Friday night (29th Oct)

As the last few reviews have pointed out the disadvantages of the place are that it is full of package tourists and was a very average experience as a result.

Front entrance is not huge but they have a ramp for taxi to drive up, first thing I found off-putting since it is not really necessary and does nothing for your first impression of the place.
Hotel lobby -huge wasted space so lobby/spa/shop areas deserted of people.
Rooms - ok, bed ok, very small balcony. Decor average.
There are 2 very long parallel corridors with rooms off that. Little Balinese flavour particularly, or architecture , so not sure what last reviewer meant ('Wonderful Experience"")
Pool is at back of hotel and is raised, so you are at eye-level with bathers as you walk the path through the pool/sunloungers area (also raised level and packed in side by side) to the beach.

When we stayed there were many package tourists and the pool (from about 4pm as it was a 'Cocktail night') had groups of them drinking lager with glass bottle in hand. The pool was lit later on, so the cocktail evening (Buy 2 get one Free) carried on after dark with club music in the pool (not sure if that is also what the last reviewer means by 'quiet')
This did not disturb sleep or go on too late but created a pool atmosphere which was not attractive so we (myself and my 10y old daughter) had a quick dip (she wanted to swim in the pool) but then went to the beach to avoid the drinkers/non-swimmers in the pool.

Stepping out onto the beach you will encounter beach vendors who approach you constantly (whether reading/sunbathing or changing your clothes by the sunbed, this is a bit annoying) but beach was preferable.
I heard a young Aussie woman from the hotel shout angrily at a woman who had asked her 'Want massage?"" and told her 'No, no, Go Away!!"" . Understandable but did not add to the atmosphere around the beach exit where there are a lot of locals hanging around and people offering massage etc (however no obvious massage hut or prices displayed)

Breakfast at the restaurant was good (nice croissants/big variety- coffee so-so) You will need to avoid the smokers yourself.

Beach was nice, with waves, but this hotel + area not representative of Bali, you could be anywhere.
I would not recommend it to friends and would not have booked it if I had known type of hotel it was. I was going on the reviews before the last few were added, which are more accurate.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1087,Wonderful experience,50,October 2010,"Just wanted to tell people thinking of travelling to Bali and maybe say in an older age group over 40's who want a quieter but enjoyable experience - the Palangi hotel is for you. Wonderful service - beautiful balinese style layout rather than a modern hotel (which you could find anywhere. The standard room is very clean attended to daily, superb food, restaurants and great location right at the beach front so you can choose from beach or pool, but beach is stunning, can hire a lounge chair at $6 a day - worth it. Breakfasts have a large range of choices, and good entertainment for dinner. In walking distance to a great range of shops and restaurants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1088,Mid-range package-tour hotel in tourist enclave - fair if that's what you want,20,October 2010,"Let's be clear: this is a package tour hotel in what is really now part of the ever growing tourist enclave. As a package-tour hotel it is not bad: medium range, acceptable service, close to the beach, large pool, close enough to Kuta, next door to a lively (and noisy) beach club. If you are looking for a no-frill, clean, medium-range package-tour hotel with a large swimming pool in that location, then this hotel is quite ok. I cannot really fault it on these premises,

Now if you are looking for a more relaxed hotel, with a different kind of clientele, then look somewhere else. There are a few hotels in that price range in that area that may be suitable, but really your best options is to go further away from Kuta.
Or better, if your intention is to spend a week or more in that part of the Island, just rent a house (a bit further north again), even a simple one.

Now going back to the hotel let me just highlight a few points that may be expected from a package-tour hotel but that may be disturbing if you are expecting something else:
- The land plot is very narrow (20 meters) and very long (200 meters). It is mostly all built up with two very long hotel wings, a small intermediate green space, a badly designed clutter of a winding swimming pool, a restaurant and some long-chair terraces facing the beach.
- The gym ('health centre') is a joke: one lonely low-quality bike that is crumbling, two old weight machines in a dire need of maintenance, one modern running machine (with a 'maximum 100kg sign' on it, required indeed given some of the specimens around the swimming pool) and a set of free weights. For a hotel to claim that this is a gym is just false advertisement.
- The restaurant is offering a safe and overpriced list of Western food with hardly any concession to local food. Very limited choice of Balinese food (if any). Indonesian food is summed up in few fried items (Nasi Goreng). Local food at fair prices is available not that far from the hotel.
- The service is OK to good. Some employees do try genuinely to be pleasant. My only criticism here is that the front desk will try to debit one night from your card when you register (real debit, not just the usual card swipe). If you don't like paying before seeing the goods, then just say no.
- The breakfast is nice and may be the most relaxing time at the restaurant.

Now about the location:
- The beach in Seminyak is nice. Nice waves, nice sand. If you go to the north coast instead, Lovina would have much cheaper and relaxed hotels, but the beach there is not always good for swimming.
- The back street immediately around the hotel are not very nice. Noisy, polluted. Actually just a bit more north (Peti Terengi, Seminyak Square) the situation is already much better.
- If your objective is to really see what Bali is like, do not just stay in Kuta/Seminyak by all means. That part has its charms for sure (mostly the beach), but there is a lot more to see also in Ubud, the lakes and uplands, the north coast, the coast around Tabanan, etc.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1089,my bathroom is bigger,10,October 2010,"Yuk yuk yuk. Never again.
I was dissappointed when I saw the the size of our room. The 2 of us didn't fit on the verandah! But when I saw a friends room(s) at the Melasti Hotel down the raod and heard they were paying less for 2 rooms plus their bathroom was bigger than our whole room I knew it was a rip off.! We had organised for a 3rd bed to be brought in as a friend was to join us and quickly realised it wouldn't fit, but they were gunna make it happen! Yep , now we were paying $120 (Aus) a nite. Forget it. When I spoke to Management, they're generous solution was.... for an extra $50 (US) a nite, they'll upgrade us.

On a positive note, the pool was nice, the breakie was OK.
The fact you can't get a taxi to come into the Hotel, becaouse of some deal with the local Transport Mafia, is ridiculas. I got soaked in the rain several times, walking the 250 meteres up the road, were the taxis can wait.

Never ever eva agin.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1090,"Nice Hotel, shame about the area",30,October 2010,"I thought the Pelangi was a very reasonable hotel for the price, the rooms were very clean and the staff very friendly and a great pool, the only downside being the towels, which were supposed to be white, but were more a greyish brown!
Breakfast was a little repetitive, but what there was was very good. The bar was a bit of a rip off, charging 38,000 for a Bintang when it was as little as 18,000 outside.
The front of the hotel is on a road that is not much more than a dirt track and it is a bit of a walk before reaching any shops, etc. The back of the hotel goes out onto the beach and the path to the right leads to a number of very good restaraunts, however stretches of this are very poorly lit.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1091,A bit disappointing,30,October 2010,"Whilst staff were friendly, the hotel did not meet my idea of the hotel. The room was very ordinary, and we had a number of issues with leaking air conditioning, and toilet problems. The door was constantly getting locked and the key difficult to turn. I became aware having been locked out how easy it was for staff to break in through the porch door which was a little disturbing. Above all, no matter how good a deal they give you DO NOT use the hotel spa. I used Carla down the road which did great massages but decided to treat family to a hotel pedicure and manicure thinking it would be more hygeinic and more luxurious. They used the same tools for all family members without cleaning them and the room had no air conditioning. So we paid double for a hot pedicure that was substandard. If you hate stairs do not stay here..my mum could not cope with the huge staircases. Pool and pool bar looks a lot bigger in pics",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1092,"Sensational location, did the job",30,September 2010,"We just returned from the Pelangi and as veterans of Bali and Asia, found this property to be about right for Aussie families and young couples in the 3 to 3.5 star range. Rooms were basic but clean and tidy with usual amenities. Breakfast was fine and good choice of foods. Location on Seminyak beach is a winner with good beach huts for cheap eats and beers close by. 20min walk on the beach to Kuta. Good choice of restaurants near the hotel.
Staff are young an usually very attentive - thumbs up for their friendliness. It's a long and narrow property which limits the size of the pool but the kids coped as did we! Unfortunately, the sunworshippers get out early and towels on the lounges by 7.00am was very annoying. Too many Aussies on holiday packages in large groups but clearly, that's where the property is pitched. Staff HAVE TO ban people from drinking bottles of beer all round the pool. Has a small gym with only one running machine....time your visit!

General feeling is the mob would return to this property but it is starting to age and look a little tardy. Needs a refurb in areas but otherwise....very good.",Pelangi Bali Hotel

1094,Perfect Location,40,September 2010,"This hotel is perfectly located right on the beach, and a few minutes walk to a variety of bars/restaurants. On arrival check in went smoothly, we had booked four superior rooms (9 family members). All rooms were located on 2nd floor and were all next to each other, very handy. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

If required the bedding would be changed each day, and fresh towels were available each day, and a bottle of water per person was also left in the room each day.
We had had requested three single beds in our room, and although the third was a ""put me up bed"" it was ok. we only had six clothes hangers, but a quick call to reception provided us with extra ones.

Breakfast was sufficient,and the Egg Station, provided freshly made omlettes, boiled, scrambled, fried or poached eggs on request.

*BEWARE* - My sister had her handbag snatched out of her hand, whils't walking along the main road, by a moped pillion passenger. The police informed her that there are gangs coming over from Java, who are carrying out the crimes.
After immediatley returning back to hotel, the hotel manager and a member of staff kindly drove my sister and brother to the police station to report the incident.

One of the best eating places we found was "" Lucky Days"" great food, although it did close at 11pm.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1095,Perfect Pelangi!!!!!!,50,September 2010,"I stayed for 10 nights with my 2 girlfriends in september. As a frequent traveller to Thailand I was a bit sceptical. I could not have been more wrong. I an now completely in love with Bali. The pelangi exceeded all my expectations. Perfectly positioned on Seminyak beach, literally 10 steps until you reach the sand, what better place to watch the sunset each day. Set off by a cold Bintang provided by Froggy, who runs the drinks stand out the front!. At night the resort was perfectly quiet. Close enough to shop in Legain and Kuta, but far enough to be pin drop quiet for sleeping. We stayed in a superior room which was pretty good as we had 3 of us in it, I managed to look inside a deluxe room which looked bigger. In my opinion the one to go for. The Balinese people are lovely and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was pretty good, other reviewers had whined about the lack of choice, but we had no concerns in this area. At times the egg station was overcome with orders, and with a casual fllick of the wrist, all the eggs were binned, and the orders started again. This was hysterical to watch. Organised chaos I would say, but with a good result. I can't wait to take my family back to Bali and especially the Pelangi. The problem now being that it is so popular, I might have to wait a few extra months. Not too worry as all good things come to those who wait!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1096,Nice,40,September 2010,"Location awesome. Stayed 3 nights at the start of our 2 week holiday. We had a super deluxe room, one of four in the hotel. It was a decent size for our 2 small children and closer to the pool.The breakfast was great. Previous reviews had me worried but overall it was clean and tidy hotel and reasonably priced. I have stayed in lots of hotels for my work and although this place is definately not 5 star it is comfortable and you do get what you pay for. The beach warungs out the front on the beach were good value for money and the mie goring noodles delicious.around the pool your typical sun lounge poachers lay towels down and do not show up for hours after to claim their spots, be careful as I found these type are
quite rude and will tell you if you have stole there lounge even if there towel has mysteriously disappeared. Overall we were more than happy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel

Not enough deckchairs, pool bar was nice if you could get a seat. Breakfast fantastic,can't fault it. Good location! The sunset restaurant was nice but never anybody there, meals/drinks expensive, shame as the restaurant is beautful! was a nasty in our room, like it needed a good airing and a good paint. We were on the ground floor in a superior room, id say average.. Buy your own drinks and place in the fridge. You get 1 bottle of water free pp a day.

1101,You get what you pay for....,10,August 2010,"We did book this hotel with location and budget in mind. Location was great, hotel was not! Two of our three rooms were not available until 7pm at night when check in is 2pm! The manager was awful and woke me up at 11.37pm at night trying to give me cocktails!! Talk about invading the privacy and safety of your own room!!! The noise from the corridors was unbearable and the doors were hung so badly that if you leant to the side you could see straight into the rooms. This place is dated and could do with a refurbishment desparately. As a result of this holiday, I need to remember....if it is not nicer that your home, don't go!! And, you get what you pay for!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1102,Only got location going for it really.,30,August 2010,"Only stayed 2 nights. Chose this hotel just because of the location and it definately ticked that box. Biggest let down was the room. Avoid room 227 as it has bed bugs. My daughter woke up in the night covered in them and thought she had cut herself when she saw all the blood from the squashed ones! Hotel didnt seem too bothered about it and just sent a guy with some bug spray before finding her a new room. Breakfast adequate, service OK and pool clean. Our first trip to Bali and have to say Seminyak not our sort of place although watching the waves with a cocktail was nice.
Went on to Sanur.....just lovely.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1103,Nice location - long and narrow property makes for good excise from lobby to the pool!,30,August 2009,"Standard property with basic but neat and tidy rooms. They could benifit from a refurbishment as interior dark and peach paint on walls not my cup of tea. The shape of the property makes commuting from the lobby to the pool a LOOONG walk.. get up early to reserve your pool lounge to as the die hards throw there towel on the 'prime position' pool lounges before they even have breakfast! Great access to the beach and the local Drinks guy just out of the hotel on the beach is wonderful! (Daywah is his name :) - lovely guy, as are the people that give massages and sell the trinkets.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1104,"Great position on beach, could not fault",40,July 2010,"Have just returned from Pelangi looked at negative reviews but we were pleasantly surprised. We had superior room 219, it was clean with plenty of room and a small balcony with table and 2 chairs. Staff were so friendly, never walked past without greeting you with sincerity. The street is a little dark at night but so is the beach walkway to Legian, we, (2 middle-aged ladies) never felt scared. I took a small torch which was handy at night although not really necessary. The breakfast was adequate, we had ommlettes and poached eggs with bacon most days as well as fresh fruit. We never left hungry and all people we spoke to staying there were very happy with Pelangi. I checked out other rooms there, deluxe and suite were beautiful, The pool was lovely with the beach a few metres away. Swim up bar was good, we ordered lunch around the pool which was reasonably priced and convenient. I guess some peoples expectations are different but I have stayed at lots of 5 star hotels in Australia for work and while it is not 5 star would not hesitate to stay at Pelangi again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1105,Brilliant. Wonderful Service. Fantastic Meals. Very Clean.,50,July 2010,"The staff are amazing. You can't walk past anyone without receiving a smile and a Good Morning, Afternoon, etc. Nothing was too much trouble.

The meals were lovely. Breakfast has everthing you could hope for and more!

Our rooms were cleaned everyday and were fantastic. The only negative I could say is that the towels are old. Very clean, but old.
I would recomend the Pelangi to anyone. It is close to a supermarket for basics, and a mini market around the corner where you can buy just about anything!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1106,Paradise in paradise,50,March 2010,"I have been to Pelangi many times and have seen many changes.The staff are very friendly and helpful and always give a big welcome when we come back. Booking is easy and the reception staff are always accomodating. The hotel is near to all attractions but far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet. The noise at night is usually from the guests who forget that some people like to sleep. I won't mention the Aus word. A short walk out of the front of the hotel will take you to many restaurants and bars and shops. A short taxi ride, will take you any where you want to go. It's still cheaper than hiring a car and safer. Seminyak is rapidly developing and new roads appearing but take your time and do some poeple watching. The frequent ceremonies and Balanese culture are amazing. Go for a holiday, go for a rest, go for a total change of life, and go to Pelangi,one of the best.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1107,Very disappointing,20,June 2010,"I can't believe the Pelangi hotel is rated 3-31/2 stars, in our opinion it should rate no more than 2. Although the rooms seemed bright on arrival, the hotel is very dark and tired, and on closer inspection lacks attention to detail such as mould around the bath and electric sockets hanging from the wall showing bare wires. It's front entrance joins the back streets of seminyak and we definitely wouldn't feel safe venturing that way at night time. Walking on the beach path at the back of the hotel wasn't much better. The only pros was their sunset terrace restaurant at night which served good food, and the friendly staff, which is more than we could say for the American buffet breakfast which was terrible. The check-in was professional enough and the staff endeavoured to please, but needless to say we checked out after 1 night. The website photos does the hotel justice, because it's definitely not what it looks like in the photos.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1108,terrible-you dont get what you pay for,10,June 2010,"this hotel is supposedly 3-31/2 stars.In my opinion it would be lucky to rate 2.It is old and wornout with 3 rooms that i tried stinking of mould! It is basically in the back streets of seminyak with the beach area a poor cousin to legian, tuban etc.One of the few good points is that the staff endeavour to please but you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear.Price wise, i have stayed at 5star resorts for not much more than what this dump wants.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1109,Great hotel for the price!,40,June 2010,"Stayed at the Pelangi for 6 nights with my other half last week.

The hotel itself was lovely, we stayed in a superior room, which was nice, air-con worked well and room was exceptionally clean. Even though the room was basic it worked really well for a Bali holiday as all you tend to do is sleep there!

The pool was great, swim up bar was a bit expensive so we bought our own Bintangs down from our room. Watching the sun set from the pool was great though.

The upstairs restraunt was divine, definately worth the extra money, gorgeous view even once the sun had gone down. Breakfast was fine, same things every morning but it was all nice.

Beware of Kelly and her friends down on the beach as they try to charge 850,000 Rp for getting your nails done and they will constantly hassle you anytime you walk onto the beach.

There is also a little hut cafe right infront of the Pelangi on the beach with cheap cocktails and yummy food, you can also see all the planes land there!

The internet is quite expensive but there is a lovely restraunt across the road with yummy spring rolls and free wi-fi. The safe deposit boxes in reception are very secure, something that I was very sceptical about.

The real downside of the Pelangi is the road that it is on doesnt allow empty taxi's down it. Hailing a taxi on the main road is easy but trying to catch a taxi to the airport proved difficult as we would have to lugg our luggage to the taxi rank. We ended up booking a driver through the tour man in reception costing 80,000Rp not heaps but still a bit of a pain!

A word of advice in general with taxis is to only catch the blue bird taxis. ( they are the light blue corolla looking ones) as they wont rip you off.

We walked to Kuta everday, only about a 1/2 hour walk.

Would definately stay at the Pelangi again, shame it isn't a bit closer to the legian strip.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1110,Top location solid 3-4 star hotel,40,June 2010,If beachside location is a priority at an excellent price then this is your seminyak hotel of choice. We had room 601 deluxe room on ground floor with a small outside area to sit. The room was very spacious and clean. Very comfortable large bed. Staff as always in Bali extremely nice. Breakfast a very average buffet we gave up after 3 mornings and ate out instead. Pool area nice and you can sit and enjoy the sunset from within hotel grounds or a one the small warungs in front of the hotel on the beach. All in all if you are not very fussy and are happy with a bog standard 3-4 star hotel then this is your place.,Pelangi Bali Hotel
1111,Great Hotel - Will Recommend to all,40,June 2010,"I booked this hotel on the internet in January and spent 5 months reading the mixed reviews and was looking forward to seeing for myself. I would now recommend this Hotel to anyone - Staff are brilliant, friendly and helpful and always considerate. We made sure we went for the deluxe room and were absolutely delighted - located closer to the back of the Hotel and pool, the room was great and the aircon a lovely cool change from the steamy nights.
Breakfast was good - not over the top - brilliant Omelettes and nice crispy bacon.
For the price and the more quiet location in Seminyak I would say the Pelangi Bali Hotel made our first visit to Bali for my wife's 40th absolutely memorable.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1112,Non Secure Hotel,10,May 2010,"An appealing sight is the Guards on the front Gate whom are there to protect the patrons of this hotel.
However, rarely did they do their job efficiently IE check handbags or shopping upon return to the hotel.
The Front Lobby is OPEN to the PUBLIC 24/7
Which is of great concern due to The robbery which took place in our Lobby on the 1st night that we were there !!!!
3 young Aussies were held up at knife point and ROBBED. I spoke with these people hours after the crime!
The Hotel naturally denied this claim saying that the robbery took place on the street in front of our Hotel Guarded Entrance !! Were the Guards ASLEEP lol don't think so.
A very unsafe feeling stayed with us for the duration of our stay we were politely warned by MANAGEMENT to mind our own business and that we were mislead by the Victims!
What an International joke. If you are foolish enough to stay there,
be on guard 24/7 plus its the only Hotel beach that allows HAWKERS to invade our beach time so you cannot use the beach !!! A guard is on the gateway to the beach he's quite friendly with the cunning persistant 21 Hawkers who STUNG me and all in all Hotel rating 2/5 as we could lock our room ! oh and a Bell hop had the hots for me he Kept ringing my room to see what I was up to........................",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1113,"Ideal, in every way!",50,May 2010,"stayed only 4 nights and 5 days but wouldn't hesitate staying there again. the location was right off Seminyak beach and close to Seminyak ""village"", everything... shopping, restaurants = warung's, etc, was all in walking distance. eating at the hotel, we were provided with delicious meals and excellent, 5 star service. the staff was on top of everything and always with the trademark Balinese smiles and friendliness. swim-up bar in the infinity edge swimming pool, wonderful decor, location, great service and delicious food, made our stay the highlight of our visit to Bali. we enjoyed especially finding the local restaurants with delicious local fare at unbelievable prices! as surfers though, we'd probably hire a local guide our next visit to find better surf. overall, i would not hesitate in the least, to recommend this wonderful resort to anyone!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1114,Disappointing,20,May 2010,"Overall the rooms were fairly clean, however ""well used"" and in real need of a facelift. The fridge was noisy and constantly woke me up, along with my friends staying in seperate rooms, it also failed to keep anything cold. The shower curtain was filty and had what looked like dried shaving cream and whiskers caked on it. The bathroom products were like dishwashing liquid and towels a disgrace-small., grey and stained, as opposed to fluffhy, white and crisp white! The wardrobes really need replacing, or lining at the very least. One of the light globes was blown and hadn't been replaced. I was also placed in a smoking room, when I specifically booked non-smoking, there was an ashtray and matches on the coffee table. There was also a suspicious white stain on the seat of one of the room's cane chairs, which I don't even want to think which bodily fluid it came from. There were no bin liners in the bins, which were filthy black. Thankfully it was a gir's trip away and not a romantic interlude with my husband I was looking for. On the plus side, plenty of TV channels, clean windows, and I must commend how quiet the hotel was at night. Lots of other Aussies were staying at the time of our visit and all commented how disappointed they were with the property. Breakfast really below standard. Coffee terrible and we smelt the bacon getting cooked each night around 11pm at night for the following morning service. Newly renovated rooftop is quite nice, but the cocktails were very average. Nice pool however, however not recommended for older people, as the steps are few and very deep and slippery and the pool is quite hard to get in and out of! Used spa on 3 occassions and very disappointed. During the facial the operator stopped to gossip to her colleague in the next room about 7 times, interupting the treatment. Similar experiences also for my mates. Horrible products also that really did nothing for my skin.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1115,Mugged!!!,10,May 2010,"What a disappointment of a hotel.
For what you pay the facilities are severly lacking!
However this is insignificant in comparison in that we were mugged/robbed at the entrance of the hotel while the security guard chatted to our assialants.
Do they have an agreement with the local thugs??
DO NOT STAY AT THE PELANGI!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1116,Nice place but not for the price,30,April 2010,"We needed to escape from Kuta so we picked the first hotel with a clean pool. As far as that goes, we did pretty good. The rooms were quite nice and spacious and the bathroom was very clean, and the hotel was located on a more quiet part of the beach right on the boardwalk. And best of all, the pool was sparkling clean! The downsides of this hotel were that it took a bit to get to, the distance from the lobby to the pool/beach was probably 1500 ft, you had to run the air conditioning on high all night or it would leak on the floor, the beds were old and lumpy, and worst of all was that even paying $150 night you couldn't escape the touts because the STAFF tried to sell you trips and transport! Absolutely annoying!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1117,Beach front,30,May 2010,"this was my 13th time to Bali and my husband and i were travelling with our 15 month old baby girl and my brother and sis in law with their two kids who were 4 and 2 1/2 and my mum and day (first timers to Bali). My hubby and I found the amount of stairs (everywhere to the lobby, to the pool, to the restaurant, to the beach) riduculous and a little hard to negotiate at times (as did some of the other guests with bad knees etc). the rooms were clean but basic. We had an interchanging room which was good value for money and ideal with kids. the gardens were nicely maintained but i have seen better in bali. the pool was nice and over looked the beach and had a swim up bar. the staff were friendly and accommodating. I had never stayed in this area and to be honest I felt like it was a cab ride away from everywhere. there are some nice restaruants a litttle ruther along (heading twoards the bungy) and if you cut through the jakarayata hotel there are some cheap eats and some limited shopping and little spas. i liked the pelangi but don't think that i would stay there agin.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1118,Very Pleasant Hotel - great pool and value for the money,50,May 2010,"We spent 6 relaxing nights and it was not long enough. The location is good, close to restaurants and shops and with a lovely walk along the beach past other resorts and more restaurants.
Our room was 'super delux' near the pool which we enjoyed and the room was large and comfortable. Bathroom very nice, also large.
The buffet breakfast had many choices in the pleasant open air restaurant overlooking the pool and towards the beach.
The staff were helpful and friendly and we were very appreciative of the use of a room for 30 mins before we left to catch a late night flight. - 7 hours after we had checked out..
We will look forward to returning in the future.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1119,A great hotel for what you pay with a great pool,40,March 2010,"I enjoyed the Pelangi, it's only a short walk to some nice restaurants and shops in Seminyak. While it's certainly not the flashiest hotel I've ever stayed in, it's great value for money, the staff were wonderful and the pool was great.
We stayed on the ground level so it was a short walk from our room to the pool. We spoke to other guests who all seemed to be enjoying their stay.
On the down side the breakfast was very dissapointing and they couldn't make a decent cocktail to save their lives.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1120,Best holiday ever!!,50,April 2010,"We stayed at the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak for 2 weeks from the 16th April. The wife and I found both the hotel and staff an absolute joy. The hotel is amazing with beautiful pool/pool bar and restaurant. The hotel is right on a beautiful beach and you are a short walk from Seminyak town (restaurants/bars/shops). You are also a short (very cheap) cab ride from Legian and Kuta. We hired a driver for the whole day for about £25 who drove us all around the island (Ubud, Ula Watuh, Jimeran etc).

Special thanks to Gday who looked after us really well throughout the trip.

We will be back in September/October for another 2 weeks.

1121,First Timer in Bali,50,April 2010,"My adult daughters & I just spent 10 days in Bali and stayed at the Palangi on the recommendation of a work collegue. The hotel is in quiet Seminyak on the beach. The rooms were spacious we had the Superior rooms which were an indulgence. The facilities are first class, the staff extremely first class the only negative and only a small negative was the food. Breakfast was great - eggs to order and everything else you could want was there. We ate in all the areas available and was disappointed with the standard of the main courses - something that we made the management aware of. But we did find a great restaurantt in the main street owned by Aussies - MeNu - 5* for them. When we return to Bali I would certainly stay at the Pelangi again and again and again!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1122,GOOD VALUE AND SERVICE FOR MONEY,40,April 2010,"my husband and i stayed at the Pelangi for 4 days , it was our first trip to Bali and wanted somewhere a little quieter then Kuta location was great , nice little boutique type shops locally and some great local restaurants the ultimo in seminyak is a must Excellent value and a great atmosphere , the hotel staff were really great and very helpful in all areas ,one slight issue don't order a cab though the hotel take a short walk to the end of the road and hail a light blue metered cab we ordered one from hotel and paid 50 thousand rupee to go a 10 min ride , the return cab fare when we hailed a cab was 12 thousand !!!! The hotel was clean but basic every thing you needed but no extras , the restaurant was nice , food was great , check out the sunset from the roof top bar , they were also very accommodating as we had the dreadful midnight flight and check out was noon !! we went and did more shopping !! then returned and were given a courtesy room to shower etc before we left which was great , we also got hotel transfers which were reasonable price and worth doing , i would stay again if wanting a short well priced break , also check out the Bali Spa a 5 min walk from hotel they do great specials and it was 90 thousand for 1 hour massage ( 1/2 price ) hope this is helpful .",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1123,Slightly Above Average,30,April 2010,"Checked in late at 7pm. Front desk staffs were friendly. Unfortunately, we were given a room with faulty air conditioner and unclear TV display due to loosen TV antenna connection. Thank god the maintenance service is prompt in resolving the problems. Due to long wait, we pushed for a room change due to unresolved issues and were given another room without the troubling problems.

The room generally is clean, but our feet felt uneasy with the sticky floor. No room slippers and hair dryer were provided, and were only available upon request, which is not up to standard. However, I was excited to find out about the number of TV channels the hotel offers, it is 60 !!!

The beach front location is another hot selling point. Restaurants overlooking the Seminyak beach is a good place for viewing sunset. Breakfast is served at open air restaurant facing both pool and beach. Cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food were not very pleasant. Flies were disturbing our breakfast and I saw many ants on the table serving juices. Besides, we saw another customer complaining about the food cleanliness as well.

The swimming pool water has a very strong chlorine odor. Therefore, we decided to go for beach walk than swimming. Access to Seminyak beach (less crowded vs. Kuta or Legian beach) is seamless with a staircase leads us to the beautiful beach with strong waves which is ideal for surfing. The landscaping of walkway from rooms to restaurants is a true reflection of Balinese design, interesting!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1124,NO WAY!,10,December 2009,"Would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone, staff treated myself and friends horribly ( I was evan assaulted by the manager ). We arrived at 2 pm and our room was not available until 8.30pm. Hotel was dirty and food we ate there was terrible.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1125,Loved this Hotel,50,March 2010,"We arrived at the Pelangi did look too bad, they were extremely courteous, friendly and efficient the service was great no waiting around check in took only about 5minutes. Everything that you needed to know to make your stay pleasant was explained to you or was in writing in your room. We were shown to our deluxe room which was extremely spacious 63sq air conditioning was silent, bathroom was very nice with a very large spa bath with a nice leather head rest. Room contained a safe lounge,fridge, arm chair and LCD TV, Balcony the beds were comfy and the pillows were just right. Breakfast was good no great huge buffet but it was adequate.Staff were extremely helpful especially Wayan and called you by your name, lots of Aussies there everything was close by nice cafes, good shopping and the Spa Bali was recommended.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1126,We'll be back!,50,March 2010,"What a great place to stay! Can't fault the friendly service, nothing was too much trouble, food was great, breakfast was different each morning and was more than enough to keep you going while sitting in the beautiful pool sipping cocktails and drinking bintang at the swim up bar! And what a pool! Perfect. OK, the room was a standard Bali hotel room but very adequate for our needs though we will upgrade to a deluxe room next time. We needed a little maintenance job done and it was fixed within 15 minutes of being reported, can't fault that! The hotel is close enough to everything without being in the middle of it, very quiet, no motorbikes or cars nearby, only the sound of the surf...yep, we'll definitely be back.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1127,Great Location and friendly staff,40,March 2010,"Recently stayed 6 nights at Pelangi Resort , had a lovely time and the staff where very friendly and helpfull. The location is good if you want a more relaxed holiday and dont want the hassles of Kuta. Ther where some very good retuarants within walking distance, in particular ""Noodles"" in Double Six street. Very good selection and great value for money.
At the hotel the room was spacious and comfortable. The bed was firm enough with out the board stiffness you seem to get in a lot of places these days in Asia.
The hot water was plentifull at any time of day and the Aircon worked well.
This is not five star but very good value for money. The only small complaint was the food in the hotel at breakfast was a bit limited and boring.
My wife is already planning on going back with the daughters for a girls week.
Certainly would recomend for a v alue for money holiday.
Last tip, the taxi fare in the metered taxi's is only about 22000 Rupiah from the far end of Kuta to the hotel. Watch out for the others who will try and get a lot more from you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1128,Great place to stay,50,March 2010,"We have traveled throughout Asia and definitely enjoyed our stay here. Close to main beaches, yet just out of reach of the main strip, with its' late night partying and drinking. A great place for families as well as couples, like ourselves. Pool was lovely, and with proximity to the beach we loved it. We also appreciated the room decor, and layout. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone, dollar for dollar it was a great place. Only drawback was that the breakfast buffet could use a little more variety. However, that was the only improvement we could comment on, everything else was perfect.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1129,Excellent mid-range value,40,March 2010,"Hotel is well located, close to shops and restaurants and also right on the beach. Staff were helpful and polite. The swimming pool is a lovely place to relax and the swim-up bar fixes great cocktails. The rooms aren't fancy but clean and comfortable. We thought it was good value for money and would definitely stay here again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1130,Loved the pool above ground,30,March 2010,"first things first, when you arrive at the airport, go to the taxi counter (turn right when you exit from the arrival terminal). it charges 60,000 rupiah to seminyak. don't get ripped off by the other taxi poachers like we were...

hotel need some upgrading, our standard room had old basic furniture. bathroom was old too. but overall, it was alright.

the pool was above ground and had a nice curling design which gave the beach chairs around it some privacy. pool faced the beach and you could basically relax in the pool while watching the gigantic waves. The only restaurant, Rama, also faced the pool and the beach. It was fantastic waking up and having breakfast in the open-air restaurant facing the beach and feeling the warm sea breeze. Only downside was that the variety of food was not that fantastic. The sunset terrace was also a great quiet place to view the sunset.

Service was wonderful. Every staff would greet you with a smile everywhere we went.

If you want a quiet place to stay with authentic indonesian flavour and not too far from town (Kata beach), this is one hotel I would recommend.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1131,Another great holiday,50,March 2010,"Have just returned from staying at the Pelangi again. We had a wonderful time. The staff were terrific, the food great, and even the weather was perfect considering it was the wet season.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1132,Just a beautiful place to relax and get away from the hassle.,40,March 2010,"Congratulation's Pelangi staff you have been first class. From my special requests before arriving to the final good byes we could not have asked for more.
Great Superior room on the ground, so cool of course with air-con.
Great breakfast.
Great pool with swim up bar.
Magnificent sunset views looking down onto the beach.
Very secure so no outside hassle from vendors
As always extremely welcoming staff no matter what you request is.
Suits those who want to just kick back. So if you want to make alot of noise at night and be a nuisance to everyone during the day. THIS IS NOT YOUR HOTEL
We will be definitely back",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1133,Great location and value,40,March 2010,"Pelangi ticked all the boxes for a family with teenagers-
Beachfront location, pool and restaurant overlooking the beach, frinedly staff, touch of luxury when entering the foyer, spacious and clean room/bathroom, quick walk or taxi to shopping/restuarants.
Criticisms are small- buffet style breakfast OK not great, balconies from rooms miniscule. Corridors outside rooms magnify the noise of late night revellers returning to their rooms.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1134,location perfect,50,February 2010,"This hotel is lovely, right on then beach. The location of the restaurant and roof diner have million dollar views. The pool is warm and also views the ocean.
The food is standard, rooms are standard as well. If you are going for just a basic one, get the second floor as the will have a private balcony to sit on. The main floor rooms have doors that open up to the walkway . The employees are polite and friendly. Then hotel is clean and well run.

Laundry is very expensive. You can go outside on the main street and have your laundry done for much less. There is a tour co. outside the hotel. We used kanti and he was prompt friendly and much less than the tour co. in the hotel.
For massages etc. the girls on the main,street, just past Breezes near the internet and convenience store are excellent and very cheap.(much less than hotel) All of the extra services that the hotel provides are expensive and a short walk away everything is available for much less.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1135,terima kasih banyak Pelangi Hotel,40,February 2010,"Stayed @ the Pelangi for 5 nights with a group of mates from work - 6 of us in all. We had an excellent time, spent a lot of time in the fantastic pool keeping the bar staff fairly busy!! The staff were awesome & service was always delivered with a smile.
Rooms were as good as you'll get for this price in Seminyak - clean, quite & cool. A lot less hassles as you walk out onto the street & a fairly quiet beach compared to Legian.
Thanks Pelangi (& guests!!) for a great stay, & terima kasih for accomodating six not-so-quiet, bintang loving boys from Perth - we'll see you again next year.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1136,Beautiful hotel,40,February 2010,"Have just returned from staying at the pelangi bali The hotel itself was beautiful very clean with lovely friendly staff. We stayed in the delux room and our friends stayed in the super delux only difference was they had a spa bath. We were on the ground floor near the pool little verandah to sit out on beautiful cared for gardens.
The rooms were very large with a king bed and table 2 chairs and a 2 seater sofa so plenty of room the standard rooms were a bit smaller but still nice.
the rooms were made up every morning while we were at breakfast, 2 bottles of water everyday.
The breakfasts were nice nothing special but everything you need changed each day. all the staff were lovely, check in was a breeze everything was ready for us only took a few minutes.
The pool was very nice overlooked the beach and was very deep just sit and watch the ocean, swim up bar was great. for a few cocktails.
over all had a great stay and would recommed to any one the location it's self was perfect far enough away from kuta walking disstance from legian and great restaurants we went to lanni zanzabar and the one next door all great also ultimo in semenyak square was amazing and so cheap the tableclothes were changed after each group left it was very busy people waiting to go in so either book or be there before 7 anyway great place",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1137,Loved it!,50,June 2009,"My boyfriend and i went away with 10 other members of his close and extended family. my boyfriend and i are 20 and the rest were all above 50 years old and everyone loved this place. We stayed in a pretty average room which we didnt think much of when we arrived but we learned to love and appreciate it when we came back from long days to a clean room, made bed, fresh towels and air con going all day.... we would go to the wondeful buffet breakfast each morning, we were greeted so kindly by the housekeeping staff in the corridoors and when we returned a mere 40 minutes later, our room was fresh and clean.

The hotel location was great because u could sit in the pool and watch the beach and the hotels high pool walls blocked out the locals trying to sell you things. But even if they caught your eye it was good to have a laugh. I liked the location because it wasn't as busy and not as many tourists as kuta and still wasnt far to walk to the shops. every night we would walk about 300m down the beach to double 6 street and find a restaraunt. they were pretty much all decent but one we found ourselves at about 80 per cent of the time was a place called ""ristorante italiano' or something like the, next to zanzi bar. it was nice because it was all open with lovely big trees with fairy lights and the food was 5 star!

we also found ourselves in the hottest part of the day sitting around the swim up bar at pelangi which was so convinient and lovely to meet other travlleres. cheap cocktails and drinks too of course. All the staff were lovely and friendly, they all remember your name and have a joke and a laugh with you and basically kiss your feet ... we had such a good experience in bali because of this hotel and all the lovely people. I would say though, beware, there is 1 downside!!!......... you will want to come back EVERY year!!!!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel

The hotel was well positioned near everything we wanted, but it was quiet and relaxing. The staff were amazing and helped with everything from money problems, tours, health issues and gave excellent service everytime. The food in the restaurant was very good, the menu varied and able not expensive. The view was great and we preferred to eat in and enjoy the sea breeze rather than face the challenges of the street after a days sightseeing.

Was recommended by a friend who stayed last year before the renovations & she joved it then. Even better now. We booked superior room which was great but upgraded to delux for 10 days as a treat (extra $50 au per night) was worth it. Upstairs is better, great view of pool & ocean & bigger balconys. Room 304, 305 or 306 the best. This is our third trip & will stay at Pelangi from now on. Its not the sofitel but it was perfect for us, small & personal, the right price & right on the beach. Lots of friendly aussies there also.Book at least 3 months ahead for good rooms. Already booked out Sept 2010. Bring on next Nov.....",Pelangi Bali Hotel

I have travelled to Bali 5 times. Our visit before this most recent one was in June 2009- Pelangi was renovating and not all facilities were available so we decided to try the The Breezes across the road... its awful, and Pelangi offers you alot more for your dollar.
The Pelangi really is excellent value first and foremost. We stayed in a superior (standard room) for the first 2 nights and then moved to a super deluxe room (as they were all booked out for the first 2 nights) both rooms were great and excellent value for what they were. The super deluxe rooms are great- huge (53sqm) with an excellent jacuzzi, a flat screen tv with too many channels (my other half spent a fair bit of time in front of the tv) and a couch in the room. The air-con is good (but not big enough for the room) we ended up buying a couple of fans and giving them to the staff at the end of our stay- there was little air circulating (without opening the doors) and the rooms upstairs get a bit hot, but we didnt spend all that much time in the room anyway as we were busy sight seeing etc. The pool area is great- a nice bar etc and it all over looks the beach- a plus as I didnt want to swim in the beach (places down the road pump their raw sewerage out to sea...) and the new restaurant area is lovely. The former reviewers are right- the food is below average, but who wants to eat at a hotel when there are so many restaurants to choose from nearby... The location is EXCELLENT... out of the way off Dhyna Pura, only a short walk (2 mins literally) to the road where the taxi drivers hang out and not an awful walk (as suggested by another reviewer) The staff at the resort are BRILLIANT and made our stay. Novi and Sri in the front office are awesome- full of great advise with excellent English. Even the bell boys and security were lovely and all of them endeavoured to help me improve my Bahasa Indonesian by teaching me new words every day. Previous reviews have said that the staff weren't friendly- they are generally shy people however if you make the effort to talk to them and get to know them they are just wonderful- we even had one of the recepionists playing pranks on us by the end of our stay! Breakfast got a bit tired after a while but we didnt care- its cheap enough to go down the road for lunch. Overall this place is brilliant, the staff are attentive and friendly, the rooms are a clean, cool haven from the hustle and bustle and heat and the pool and gardens are nicely maintained. A couple of good places to eat (within a 20,000 Rp taxi ride) are Bragas (on Jalan Oberoi in Seminyak Square) and Indo-National (for more Western food which my partner loved!) on Jalan Padma- Indo-National is owned by an aussie couple and the food is very cheap and everything is incredibly hygenic... and no govt or service tax! oh, and 20% off Bali Moon cocktails every day... for something a bit further afield (and for something authentically Balinese) try Bumbu Bali in Nusa Dua... arguably the best restaurant on the island and the food is AMAZING- I did their cooking class too and loved it! (about 30 mins in a taxi and approx 95,000 Rp fare) A couple of eating spots to avoid: Delicious Onion around the corner from the hotel (we both got very very sick with Bali Belly) and Warung Bonita (very over priced, noisy 'house music', inattentive lousy service and cruddy food- the bill was insulting)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1148,This was a real let down,20,October 2009,"I have been to Bali many times and decided to stay here on the recommendation of a friend.
The hotel itself is nice but the standard rooms are build extremely close to one another and the balconies are a joke. I stayed in a deluxe and the room was fantastic.
Staff were not as friendly as other hotels.
Location is great if you do not intend to leave the hotel but it is not the best. To leave you have to walk a little way - not that far but it is not a nice walk. The Seabreeeze on the corner is better placed.
I have never had a bad meal anywhere in Bali, restaurant, warung, beach etc until the Pelangi....I attempted to have 3 meals there and each time kicked myself. McDonalds is better than the what they dished up and don't get me started on the breakfast!

I wouldn't stay here again or recommend this to anyone.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1149,Great Hotel and Perfect Location,40,July 2009,"The Pelangi has an unbeatable location right on the beach in Seminyak and there is a good sized pool area looking onto the beach.

Our room was a good size and done out very tastefully which a decent bathroom and small balcony.

Breakfast was included and was ok, although there were very limited non-meat options.

The staff were helpful but not obtrusive.

I'd definitely stay here if returning to Bali as Seminyak is a wonderful area with upteen good bars and restaurants, plus excellent shopping opportunities.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1150,Good all rounder for those who want a great pool and location on a budget,40,October 2009,"Stayed here for 4 nights and everything was brilliant. Location, pool, rooms-all clean with the mod cons you could expect. For the price its brilliant. Just dont eat at the hotel restaurant. the huts on the beach serve free calamari for about $2 AUD. All round good place to stay",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1151,Good Value,30,August 2009,"We did not mind being within spitting distance of the other wing's balconies across from our room (we hardly spent any time in the room anyway). The pool area was great, but people were allowed to ""reserve"" the lounge chairs and keep them for the entire day even if they were gone for hours - so there was never enough chairs to go around. Breakfast was average but you get to eat in front of the beach - which is fantastic. Dinner, however, should definitely be done elsewhere. Our room was clean but we passed by many rooms with piles of beer bottles ""arranged"" near their patios for days. (Could be an Aussie tradition?) The staff were all very courteous and helpful, and they helped us arrange our trip to Munduk. What you can't beat is the location right on the beach. Never mind the hawkers, just go out, turn right, and keep on walking. Chances are you will find a stretch of sand all to yourself.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1152,Pretty average,20,August 2009,"The Pelangi isn't that bad but for the price we paid it was pretty average. I've been to Bali many times over the years and for me It felt like one step up from a hostel but at hotel prices I expected just a little bit more. The pool area feels like its been squeezed into the space left over between the hotel and the restaurant, the breakfast was nothing to write home about and the rooms feel a bit dumpy. We were only there for two nights so I guess it wasn't so bad the location isn't bad and the staff are ok but I definitely wouldn't want to make it a big part of my full bali holiday experience. I know you can get more paradise at better rates elsewhere.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1153,The Bestest Holiday Ever,40,August 2009,"Our first trip to Bali with another family of 4. The location of the Pelangi is gr8, 5 minutes to Seminyak for eats and shopping, leisurely stroll to Legian along the promenade right opposite the beach. The boys (14) enjoyed the ocean and were able to hire boogie boards & surfboards right out side the hotel. The locals were wonderful and invited the lads to a game of beach soccer on the sunday. Breakfast/buffet was served at the hotel's terrace restaurant each morning, my favourite time of the day, overlooking the beach and listening to the waves pounding the shore. All the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for guests. We chose the Superior Delux room which was well worth the extra, 63sqrm,spacious, extremely clean and well maintained. In fact we slept like babies on the very comfy king size bed and the best pillows ever, (we bought 2 to bring home) This could have easily fitted up to 2 extra beds if required. The boys shared a standard room interconnecting to our friends who had a 3rd bed which was a bit snug. We hired a 7 seater taxi from [--] and Wayan Kanta could not have been more helpful in taking us to the sights and local knowledge for those special shopping items, Highly Recommended. The Cin Cin and Bestest Cafe both 5 minutes away were by far the best value restaurants serving fresh hot food at very competitive prices. No one got a bad tummy. Sunset was a popular time to have a Bintang at one of the Beach Bars just down the hotel steps (about half the price). Horse riding along the beach was a favourite of 11 year old Sarah together with the hair braiding, manicure & pedicure. I indulged myself in a Balinese massage, body scrub, yoghurt moisture & flower bath 2 1/2 hours all for$25 AUS. Rutti on the beach gave a beautiful massage for $8 AUS. We lived like kings for a week and shall return next year. Would not recommend for anyone wanting a big resort hotel with lots of activities.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1154,Would stay again,50,July 2009,"This was our first visit to Bali and having heard of the constant haranguing by hawkers, we chose to stay in Seminyak because it was reputedly quieter and more upmarket than Kuta .
We chose the Pelangi Bali because it was on the beach and very very affordable for a family of 5 whose only need was a swimming pool and a comfortable bed.
Good choice.
Although nowhere near as impressive as many of the Seminyak Hotels like the Sofitel or the Samaya the Pelangi Bali does have charm and authenticness and the most happy, smiley, friendly staff. They make you feel welcome and at home and that is the key to staying in a hotel on holiday.
The pool is lovely and because it is not a big hotel, the pool was never too busy or too crowded to get a lie low. It has a cute swim up bar with friendly, chatty bar service. Drinks are very reasonably priced for a hotel.
The breakfast buffet which was included in our tariff of $54 per person per day was very adequate. We have eaten at better and bigger and more varied buffets but for breakfast, it was more than satisfactory. Except for the coffee. But people, like ourselves, who like one very good cup of coffee in the morning, rarely find you can get a good cup of coffee at a buffet breakfast.
The room was big and comfortable enough with a king size bed, a couple of chairs and table for either inside or balcony use, a smallish, non-plasma TV with 60 channels , about of them being movie channels and an adequate but smallish bathroom. The water pressure was strong and the water hot and that made up for having to shower in the bath tub, one of my pet hates.
Hanging space was adequate enough – how many clothes do you really need for Bali?
No safe in the room was a little inconvenient although there was a safety deposit box at reception.
And even when we were no longer guests, they were great. As we had a late plane home, they gave us an hour’s use of a complimentary room so that we could shave and shower and get dressed for the plane.
Wonderful, warm service in a comfortable beach side hotel.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1155,"On beach, affordable, mixed bag",30,July 2009,"We just stayed three nights. High season, so we paid 130 / night for a deluxe. Big room, fine, good location - and waterfront in this part of Bali is expensive. Still, for the price, we were only whelmed. Pluses - location, pool bar is nice after a long day of shopping or surfing. Negatives - a bit dumpy in that part of Seminyak, near to Legian, hotel a bit run down, and price hard to justify in high season, and breakfast buffet very mediocre (don't pay the $15 per person if it is not included in your rate). Here you are really one of the mainly Australian masses. You might find a better deal at a better hotel online - next time we will plan ahead.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1156,Enjoyed our time and would stay again at the Pelangi.,40,June 2009,"My husband and I have just returned from 2 weeks at the Pelangi Hotel. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The pool area is very nice but the Hotel is not really set up for families or young children as there are no garden areas. The meals at the hotel are really good but you will have to pay a 21% tax on everything. Drinks are rather expensive and the supermarket prices are much cheaper. Look out for the money changers in Bali they are mainly crooks, the ones with the higher rate will rip you off even though you will not see them do it ,stick to the ones that will give you a receipt and recount your money every time. The linen and towels could do with a revamp at the hotel but overall we would stay at this hotel again as it is not as big as a lot of the others and a lot quieter. It is in a good position for the local restaurants and shopping is not too far to walk.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1157,A mixed bag!,20,August 2008,"Been to Bali heaps of times but never stayed at Seminyak. Stayed at Pelangi with my husband and adult daughter in August.
Lobby and what little grounds there are very lovely - pool area a bit small - didn't like the tiered deck chair area. Didn't like the fact that everyone walking past the restaurant to the beach passed the pool at chest level - felt a bit odd. Even though we had a superior room - do not try to put 3 people in one - far too small. Unfortunately they did not have any other rooms available. There are two wings to the hotel and the balconies face each other across a central (not very wide) courtyard. So no chance of any privacy on your balcony - you can hear every conversation going!! The balcony was only bit enough for one chair - the ones on the ground floor were just a small landing with some steps.

The staff were great and helpful and very attentive but the rooms are just a bit too small to warrant a return visit, sorry Pelangi. Also found with the increased taxi drivers in Kuta/Legian area not being local (ie from Denpasar) - they didn't know where the hotel was which made things tricky late at night!!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1158,Great hotel for the price that you pay. Hospitable and lovely staff.,50,October 2008,"This was our 2nd stay at the Pelangi hotel. We needed a place that would have many rooms available for our friends traveling to our wedding in Bali (at a different location). The staff at the sales office were so helpful and offered competitive group rates. We all had an excellent stay there. Everyone on staff was extremely hospitable, friendly, and nice. They were interested in getting to know all our guests to ensure that they had a nice stay. The spa at the hotel was also quite amazing. For really good rates, one can get many wonderful treatments, such as massages or facials. Pelangi Hotel is very affordable and for the price that you pay you certainly can't beat the beachfront location, the close proximity to restaurants/bars in the area, the wonderful staff, the breakfast buffet, and the excellent spa. Thank you, Pelangi!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1159,Nice place,40,September 2008,"I think it is a nice place. It is close to Kuta/Legian but not as busy. It has all the shops but is a little bit less comercialised than Kuta/Legian.

Hotel is on the beach which makes such a difference. We liked the way it is located right on the beach. What's more for your sunbed you can observe local hookers. There are nice beach 'restaurants' just few steps from the hotel. Further down there are few more proper places to eat (There is a sushi place - really good sushi, honestly. Worth trting, I was really surprised - RAINBOW ROLL was just FANTASTIC :) )

The hotel itself was really nice. It has this nice local look and feel. Rooms are nice and clean. Cant complain about anything.

The only issue that we had was lack of privacy. The hotel has two building just in front of each other. You can't simply go and sit on balcony without seeing people accross. The ground floor is even worse. It is not a big deal but i found it irritating that i could not open the curtains because of people on the otehr side.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1160,Early check-out,20,September 2008,"My wife and I were booked in to the Pelangi for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. We did as was suggested to us and ""sprung"" for the more expensive rooms. We shouldn't have wasted our money. While the room was large it was at the end of what must be one of the longest hallways in existence. The pool area is rundown and dirty and was the biggest let down of the hotel. The beach area is also filthy.
We decided to move to another hotel after the first night.
Whilst all hospitality staff in Bali are excellent, the front desk staff were not helpful or friendly especially when we checked out early, and wouldn't help us arrange transport to another hotel.
There are a lot of better places to stay in Bali for a similar price.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1161,First and Last Time at Pelangi,10,September 2008,"Stayed 12 nights at Pelangi from 1 Sept 08.We cut our stay short and moved to Kumala Pantai at Legian. Couldnt wait to get out of the Pelangi!!!Normally stay at Legian Beach area. First time stay in Seminyak, thought we'd try somewhere different. First impressions from a seasoned bali lover that hotel is very tired. We spoke to many other Aussies staying at the same time as us who were disappointed as well and even some who checked out the day after they arrived. Gardens and grounds are very dissappointing, not much greenery at all and poorly maintained. Hotel is full of large steps, not good for anyone with crook legs, feet etc. Stayed in their superior room. Room average, I would say 2 1/2 star, floors dirty, bathroom dirty, toothpaste leftovers all over wall, shower did not have hot water and lighting pathetic. No balcony on ground level as advertised. The 2 rows of rooms were built too close together allowing no privacy at all. On a positive the bed was comfy. half way through our stay a couple found a thief in their room who got away,management took no action which was very poor. spent rest of trip paranoid about having stuff stolen. Pool was good, with plenty of sunbaking chairs etc. Access to the beach was pathetic for a hotel and dangerous with 3 broken cement steps, no handrail.there were renovations being done to the beach access area but no attenpt made to make it safe for patrons to access beach. The beach was very dirty compared to Legian and needed a big clean up. Even the sand looked dirtier. Restaurant was OK, breakfasts would be the best meal of the day. When we booked out not even a thank you from the reception staff - very poor. As for the area, Seminyak was too isolated for us, always a cab ride to atleast Jl Legian for decent shopping.it can a hassle getting good taxis as they are all in cohoots with each other like the mafia to rip you off. We even had a bluebird taxi tell us to meet him at end of street so he wouldnt get seen by transport drivers near hotel. Shopping in Seminyak upmarket and swanky, but overpriced to buggery for what you receive, catering to europeans and japanese.

Summary: 2 1/2 star, very tired, isolated and over rated. Would not come here again",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1162,Quite and pleasant,40,July 2008,"Stayed for six days in early July coming from NZ's Winter. This is a clean and very tidy 4 star hotel in a relatively quite Legian/Seminyak location not to far from AJ Hackets. (Can't be heard though at night). The entrance is on a short cul de sac with no walk out restaurants, however at night step out onto the beach and walk 100m south toward Legian and you are into food heaven back up on the beach's linking road. Note the Pelangi is direct beach with no road in between and that's a bonus. Try Lanai's upstairs for class and great price. The Hotel pool and restaurant are on the beach so another bonus, and morning buffet breakfast is a smorgasbord of choice and eating out on the tiled exterior in the balmy Bali morning air. I booked directly with the hotel and avoided the touts. Our Super Delux room room was sizeable and included an extra bedroom space for a young one traveling with us. There is a hint of a new development occuring on the Northern side so check with the desk to see its progress. If its underway book the Southern block. At the moment it is just a hole in the ground but things move fast in Asia! The property is a long narrow double blocks (2 story) complex so try to get as close to the pool and beach (Rooms 300 plus). Touts on the beach are intense as anywhere in Bali. No problem. The pool is magnificent and quite a bonus. Surf infront is closeout material all the time and you need to walk 100 meters either way to get a rideable shoulder. Overall neat stay and would come back for the location and solitude.
Again nice place. Enjoy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1163,Happy until our room was robbed,20,May 2008,"I spent 7 nights at the Pelangi on honeymoon, and was having a great time there until one night our room was robbed while we were out. As we left our room I forgot to take my purse with me, which contained my credit card, safety deposit box key and the equivalent of £100 cash. This is the one and only time I have EVER left my purse behind,and was a complete and utter mistake. We were out of the room between 1630 and 2200, and during that time someone entered our room and took the money from my purse, leaving behind everything else. I only noticed the next morning when we were going out to get the money changed into rupiahs. Some laundry had been collected from our room during these hours. After searcing the room 3 times over (just in case), we alerted the manager straight away, who was very apologetic, and told us he would investigate. He later informed us that all staff had been searched and nothing had been found, but if the money was taken the night before when we were out then it would be long gone. To be fair, the manager did his best to help, he took us to the police station helped translate and fill in a police report. But we never saw our money again. It really put a massive downer on our honeymoon, and I spent the rest of the stay in tears. Although the manager insisted it had never happened before, the first thing reception tell you is to keep all valuables in the safety deposit boxes as they won't be responsible for anything going missing. It's also a bit suspicious that the one and only time we leave money in the room is the time it gets stolen.

If this hadn't happened, I would have given this hotel a good review, as we were enjoying our stay until this happened. Rooms are decent and clean, although the bathroom could do with a good clean in places. Pool area is nice, views from the restaurant are lovley and the location is good. It's just a shame it was ruined by thieves. If you do decide to stay here, keep everything in the safety box at reception, and don't make the mistake of forgetting your purse or wallet when you go out.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1164,Great Hotel for a great price,40,May 2008,"Our time spent at the pelangi bali hotel was so good that we stayed for an extra 3 days. The free breakfast was simple but pretty good and rotated throughout the week. The view from the restaurant was excellent, and I really enjoyed waking up to a cup of coffee while watching the surfers catch the 4-5 ft. waves directly in front of the hotel. The rooms were very large for the price and had a full suite of amenities. The bathroom was a little rusty but still quite adequate. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, and helped out with any possible request.

The only real problem I had with the hotel was the booking. I booked through their website, gave them my credit card info, and received a confirmation...then on my day of travel they abruptly canceled my reservation. I didn't find out until I was at the hotel. The hotel was very accommodating though, and gave me a room for around the same price as the internet special I wanted (~550000 Rp) despite not having a reservation when I showed up.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1165,simply the best,50,November 2007,"the rooms although small are good and cleaned daily.the pool cannot be faulted and the attendants are friendly. beach hawkers not a hassel as have stayed there many times and got to know them just a polite no then they leave you alone the most amazing massages by ruti on the beach. however be warned one of the porters is looking to finance a pig farm and gets to know you and then reels in for the money ask, this i found a little affronting and did not like.
breakfasts were good as you could eat as much as you liked and my husband had his fill most mornings. room upgrade for us was a god send as we both could have our space and sit on the balcony to have our evening drinks. nice and quiet and relaxing way to spend a holiday in bali will definately make it a base always. oh and when we had a problem the management sorted this out with us straight away and even offered us a complementary dinner for our trouble (which we declined) returning in 2008 cant wait.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1166,Hated this Hotel,10,January 2008,"My partner and I hated this hotel so much we only stayed one night instead of the 10 we'd booked. I'd booked a deluxe room and it was anything but. The room was extremely dark and you needed lights on during the day. We also found the room none-too-clean and the sheets were stained. The outside sitting area was tiny and there was absolutely no privacy whatever. The bathroom was also very dark with a lethal slippery floor. The inside sitting area, which makes the room ""deluxe"" would have been like sitting in a container; it was horrible. We found the general attitude of the staff to be unfriendly. This hotel has a restrictive cancellation policy and we had to pay for an extra night for leaving early but it was worth it to get out of there. Their on-line rates were $80 US; I later found a site quoting $66 US and they did honour that rate (although they then refused to do an airport pick-up) but in all honestly that is still way too much to pay for this third-rate properly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1167,Pelangi rocks!!!!,50,August 2007,"Anyone who's has any worries about staying at the pelangi, dont be worried at all.

The staff were really friendly and being a small hotel we got to befriend quite alot of them.

Rooms were clean and tidied everyday if you wish them to be, fresh water in rooms everyday. pool is beautiful and loved the pool bar also loved the fact that the pool overlooked the beach which was great for the sunsets.

Locals on the beach are really nice( after you get through all the you buy you buy). Cant think of a nicer place to stay that was within our budget. totally impressed!!! :)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1168,only stayed 19 hours,10,December 2007,"Arrived in Bali Airport at Dec 30 th 2007 and the Denpasar hotel agency i only findthe Pelangi hotel was the only hotel available for Dec 30 th or one nights and I could stay on if there schould be a cancellation on Dec 31 th.
On my arrival they told me that there was only 10 % change I could stay on , so i spent the rest of the afternoon going all the surrounding hotels who where all fully booked.
On Dec 31 th 2008 i they had good news that i could stay on, but on one condition.
I had to take part of the new year gala dinner for 650.000 Rp.
As i was one my own I had other plans for this big new years night I told him I would like to stay without taking part of the gala dinner.
They made a phonecal to there boss who passed on the message that of i join in for the gala or i had to leave ! !
So i left and lucky i find a much better place just next door without any gala dinner at all where i stayed on for another 5 nights.

And on new years eve it has been raining non-stop with strong winds from 11 PM til the early morning.So proberly not big fun for al these people sitting there in the storm to start 2008.

Other bad experience i had that they do not resect there breackfast serving / pool opening hours .
Cam at 9.30 AM and there was no more breackfast wat scould be served til 10 AM.

Pool schould be open til 8 PM and when i arrived just after 7 PM they told me : only 5 minutes sir !!

1169,Great Value!,40,October 2007,"My wife and I, as well as two of our friends just returned from a two week trip to Bali. We found the Pelangi on line and checked out reviews on trip advisor. Our agent had never put together a package with this hotel before, preferring to place people in the quieter Nusa Dua or Benoa areas. We were encouraged by the predominantly positive reviews and booked for the two weeks, at what we thought was a very good rate. It was as good as we had hoped! The place is very clean, the staff very friendly and attentive. Our room was on the second floor and as nice as you would expect a "" 3 star "" hotel to be. The air conditioning worked perfectly [ a must at these temperatures!] , and the room was cleaned daily and the towels and bedding changed daily if you wished. You can just have the bed remade and hang the towels to help reduce water consumption etc. an option that we chose immediately. There was a nice clean pool, plenty of towels, and loungers. Breakfasts were included and while not fantastic, there were lots to choose from and plenty of it. [ Sweet girls at the "" egg station "" ].The beach frontage is a bit busy with "" hawkers "" but they are not allowed past the front wall to the grounds. The surf is rather big and so it isn`t great for swimming here, so the pool is welcome. Seminyak is not as busy as Kuta but it is still too busy for many, so we chose to take a couple of 2 day trips to other areas. [ Got to see the real Bali that way! ]. There are plenty of restaurants to check out up the road behind the hotel as well as Gado Gado down the beach about 100 metres. [ excellent food and ambiance, especially at night. ] Lucky Day and Gateway to India were both good, as well as reasonably priced. [Even the warungs on the beach were ok] .We enjoyed our stay at the Pelangi, and would recommend it for those not expecting a 4 or 5 star experience. It was a great location and a bargain for the price!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1170,"Bad, bad, bad",10,October 2007,"My husband and I go to Bali yearly and have always stayed around the Kuta/Legian area so for a change we picked Seminyak this time. I picked the Pelangi based on the great reviews so I was really shocked when we got to our rooms after a night flight in from Singapore.

The long and dark corridor we were led down to our rooms resembled a jail with high-walls on one side. When our porter opened the door to our room, it smelled like mildew and when the air-con was turned on, the musty smell intensified. Who needs a large room when it smelled this bad. When I peeked into the bathroom, it made me really curl my toes as I walked in and saw mould in the corners. The ventilation fan made a funny noise and the towels were no longer white and was spotted with stains!

The bad experience continued the next morning. Construction nearby started banging away so we got up and went to breakfast. Even the great location and proximity to the beach did not help. Breakfast was nothing spectacular and in any case, you'll be too busy swatting flies. The pool which looked so good in pictures is really small and narrow with constantly had well-oiled folks contributing to the layer of grease on the surface. I sure did not want to get into that water.

We got the hell out of Pelangi and headed to another hotel to salvage our holiday. Mind you, I'm not a prissy traveller. I have no qualms about roughing it out and have paid USD18 a night for simpler accomodations in Bali that's more pleasant than here. What pisses me off is that I paid USD68 a night and it just ain't worth it.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1171,Good value hotel,30,October 2007,"Just back from 3 nights at the Pelangi. Got a good deal on a Superior double with breakfast. Met at the airport by friendly driver, smooth easy check in,welcome drink, cold refreshing towels, friendly smiley service in general.

Rooms are OK, good size, comfortable beds, everything worked.
Bathroom could have been a little nicer. eventho was clean..a little mould here and there, gave it a very slight grotty feeling. But hey, for the price and for the amount of time that you ACTUALLY are going to be in your hotel room in Bali, it's fine. I think it could be a really great hotel if they spent a little more time and effort upkeeping it. The grounds and gardens are generally nice enough.

Breakfast was disappointing, presentation and variety were sadly lacking. Staff a little lackadaisical tho polite. Nice view of the surf tho.

Pool looks almost as good as in the photos on the website. Had a lovely evening swim under the stars which was great.

If you want a 5 star luxurious stay, this aint it. There are heaps of villas for rent that will do the trick but the pelangi is good value for money,comfortable and is pretty well situated.

Getting a flight into Bali was difficult, with most of them sold out. our flight was packed...but once out and about in seminyak - it felt a little dead...heaps of great restaurants, shops and bars but all empty.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1172,Don't listen to the negative views about this hotel!,40,September 2007,"I stayed at the Pelangi Beach Hotel at the beginning of September and must say i am quite surprised by the negative comments posted on here. All i can say is the people posting them should maybe pay a little more next time and go five star!

This hotel is great for the money. The location is perfect, right on the beach with the most amazing sunset (please see picture attached).

The pool is lush, not that big but we always managed to get a sunbed and didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn to put a towel down.

The rooms are nice, ok not 5 star but you have everything you require (TV, Bath, Shower etc.) and they kind of have an authentic feel to them.

The food and drinks are reasonably priced.

Staff are very friendly and always happy to help.

My only fault is that we didn't get a welcome drink and hot towel like other guests when checking in.

This was my second time in Bali but my first time at the Pelangi and i would definately go back and stay at this hotel.

Please do not listen to the negatives, if you want a good location in a very reasonably priced THREE star hotel, then make this hotel your choice of residence during your stay in Bali.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1173,Better than most !!,40,September 2007,"Just back from our 11th trip to Bali but our first time at the Pelangi,and I must say I'm a little surprised by the recent negative reviews.Having stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels on the island the Pelangi has a lot going for it.We were in a super deluxe($64 through an internet site) and the room was very good,huge bathroom,seperate lounge,good size balcony and a large 6' bed.Proably not enough storage space for some but overall pretty good.Minor problem with the airconditioning was sorted out within the hour and the maintenance guys couldn't have been more helpfull.
Plenty of sunbeds were available despite some of the koreans or taiwanese thinking they should save 3 or 4 sunbeds just in case they fancied lying somewhere else later in the day.The beach location was fantastic and as for there being a lot of noise from the Bungy tower well we never heard it once and we were in the hotel at the same time as the reviewer who complained about it.
Loads of places to eat both on Jl Laksamana (a 5 minute $1 cab ride away) and on Jl Dhyanapura itself.The hotel is only 15 minutes walk down the beach to Ku De Ta and is only 5 minutes from Gado Gado.Maybe if you want burger and chips then this place is not for you but if you like good food you're in the right location.
As for the shopping,there are loads of individual clothes shops mainly for women on Jl Raya Seminyak and some of the funkiest furniture and lighting shops are in this part of Bali.
All in all this hotel is very good value in a great location and is a lot better than many on the island and is a world away from some of the overpriced rubbish we have to put up with in Europe.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1174,Rundown and packed but nice beach,10,September 2007,"We stayed with our daughter early September and were disappointed by the Pelangi.
The hotel is quite large and anonymous, I guess 100 rooms, and crammed on a small piece of real estate. Rooms are small, airless, dark, without a view, and located on an endless corrridor, Alcatraz style. We upgraded from our USD 90 room to the USD 240 suite which overlooks the pool and the sea, pricey but spacious with 2 bedrooms, a jaccuzzi and a large balcony.
The place is quite noisy. The neighboring bungee jump pumps out music all day, and at night you are treated to the sound of karaoke or other entertainment from the Pelangi or hotels next door.
The Pelangi is in a state of disrepair and neglect, with dead plants and broken plaster in many places.
On a positive note: The beach is great for a walk or a swim, and sunsets are beautiful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1175,Not all that impressive,20,August 2007,"Myself and 4 of my girl friends have just arrived home after having stayed at the Pelangi for a week. In all honesty, we weren't all that impressed with the place. Two of our group were in a twin share room upstairs from us but had to be moved after a couple of days coz the stench in their room was so bad and then the new room started to smell after a day of being in there too. The beds were far too firm for my liking, I think the pool lounges would have been more comfortable. The staff were very friendly and the daily breakfasts were nice. The hotel restaurant has a good selection on their menu and everything that we had was nice and not too expensive either. The hotel is quite large. so if your after a smaller more intimate place to stay, then the Pelangi is not for you. There are plenty of places to eat just down the road on Dhyana Pura but if it's shopping you're after, then you'll have to cab it everyday back to Legian or Kuta coz there really aren't too many bargains to be had around Seminyak. If u need a cab, go around the corner to Dhyana Pura and up a bit on the left hand side and you'll find some blue taxi's parked waiting and they have meters in them, so you'll get a better fare.
All in all, this was an 'okay' hotel but I probably wouldn't stay there again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1176,stay again,50,,"we could not fault this hotel,read the forums before booking avereraged it out, and stayed there,some of these people must have been jet lagged when staying, from some of the reviews",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1177,Step out to the beach!,40,May 2007,"We stayed at this hotel in May 2007. Room was clean - no issues. Loved the pool. Also, another plus is that we just stepped out onto the beach! Front desk and staff were efficient and friendly.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1178,Good choice for the Seminyak area,40,June 2007,"Pelangi is definite value for money. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff are very friendly and cheerful. The pool area is nice and bigger than a lot of pictures give it credit and there was always enough loungers to go round. Location wise it is right on the beach, and a good stretch of beach at that. That is it's real attraction for us. The beach at Kuta is nowhere near as nice. It's also a short walk along the beach to nice restaurants like Ku De Ta and plenty of others if you walk up the street into town. Breakfast was decent enough as well.

I know a lot of people are annoyed by them, but some of the hawkers near this place on the beach actually made our stay very enjoyable. Some can be annoying, but a firm no and they get the message. However, 3 really do stand out as very, very nice people. There is Dewa (pronounced Day wa) who is directly in front of the entrance to the beach (if a little to the left) and he sells much cheaper Bintang than the hotel. A real nice man if you want a chat as well and we used to watch the sunset while having a few of his beers. There is Sui Me who is a little more to the left and does a great massage for a very good price. Finally, there is a lad called Ben who rents out boogie boards and surf boards. He gives a 2 hour surf lesson as well, way cheaper than the big companies and I was actually surfing after that.

Overall, a great stay, without breaking the bank.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1179,Great Location,40,May 2007,"Staye here for 6 days paid $60 a night for a superior room. I would not pay any more than this. it was clean and comfortable, but needed airing it had a bit of a musty smell with it. The room was not very bright inside as all the rooms look onto each other.

The pool area is very squashed with sun bed which could do with replacing. More maintance in this area is needed.The pool itself is nice.

The staff are very pleasant. The lobby area is very clean.

Very close to Ku De Ta. The best place to eat was the Warrison although you have too book . we had some great meals in Bali. We never ate at the hotel.

We were hardly ever at the hotel since we were at wedding celebrations most days. So the pool area never bothered us. This would not be my choice of place to spend a week at, but saying that others are very happy with the standard of the accomodation as they have weddings at the hotel.

Visited the Istana Villa in Uluwatu this was amazing. Also spent time at the Conrad hotel in Nusadua which is very nice and you could get a double room for £70 inc. breakfast. Which I thought was good value.

Yes I would tell people about this hotel because of its location but I would check out the Resor first as they have some good deals including airport transfer if you contact them directly.

If changing currency in Bali take largerdenominations you get a better rate of exchange.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1180,Excellent value,50,May 2007,"Came here for our honeymoon, stayed for 10 days then 2 days at Alila Ubud. The rooms aren't great but we only slept there & spent most of our days in the pool or sightseeing. Breakfast was included and it was delicious. As soon as you walk in you can feel the Balinese ambiance, with traditional music played in throughout the hallways & restaurant.
The best thing is the pool, it was a great place to spend the hot days & sun bathe. The food & drinks were cheap too thanks to the exchange rate.
The other good thing is that the hotel backs right on the beach, you can spend endless afternoons watching the sunset. Don't try swimming in the beach though, there's so much rubbish that collects overnight, the locals have to sweep the sand each morning.
The minuses are the hagglers , but when you think about it, they're trying to make a living. just make sure that you don't get conned with their prices & bargain.
The location is pretty good, you can walk along the beach to Seminyak restaurants. If you want to go shopping or to the restaurants in Kuta, it's around 7 minutes by taxi
We would certainly go back there for sure & recommend it highly for the price you pay",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1181,great pool area,40,April 2007,"love the location of this hotel just far enough away from the hustle & bustle kuta.breakfast included a bit average but some great restaurants in the area.view from dining area is lovely.pool area with swim up bar is great & clean.we prefer a ground floor room as balconies very small.
rooms not large but big comfy beds & plenty of hotwater.very clean.
staff friendly & helpful.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1182,Great Hotel - Great Prices,50,May 2007,"On our first trip to Bali we stayed at two hotels, one in Sanur and this one in Seminyak. This was by far the better hotel and was significantly cheaper.

We got the superior rooms but that wasn't really necessary. Its good if you have a group and want to congregate in the sitting rooms to plan your days, otherwise the regular rooms are just fine.

The pool was great and there are lots of places to sit around it that are far enough away to avoid the beach hawkers becoming a nuisance.

The staff here were very friendly and I found myself at ease here and felt really safe and secure. Its close to all the amenities but far enough away to just relax as well.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1183,Great find!,40,April 2007,"Booked the Pelangi with hotelsbali.com and got a great rate of USD$46 plus tax inclusive of breakfast for 2. Room on the ground floor facing garden. We could not fault the place considering the price we paid. The pool was great, breakfast on the beachfront, lovely Balinese people and smiles, nice walks along the beach and up on the street to explore. We went to the famed Kudeta one night for dinner and walked home on the beach lighted by moonlight. Very nice.

We also rented a car from one of the many car rental places along the street. It was offpeak so we took the cheapest car - Suzuki Katana 1000cc! which we were offered for 100,000 rp but we bargained to 70,000 per day for 2 days rental. It was good for exploring the area, Uluwatu and Sanur. We later traded it for a better car to take us around to Ubud which we know better.

Some warning: money changers. Those with amazing rates seem to have a system to make sure you leave with less money as they would definitely make a loss. We tried 4 or 5 and they all played the same game, usually with some ""friend"" next to them to distract you. In the end, we just withdrew from the many ATMs everywhere.

This is our second trip to Bali, first time on Seminyak.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1184,"""Loved the Pool""",40,March 2007,"We stayed at the Pelangi from 25/2-6/3. Would love to have stayed longer. Value for money is what this hotel is. We paid roughly $50 (aussie) for a deluxe room for 9 nights. Im sure the superior rm would have been fine although we hear otherwise. As stated in other reviews the hotel is in a great location. Not far to walk to night clubs or the beautiful Gado Gado restaraunt. Also a ten minute walk along the beach to the stunning Ku DeTa. This place is like being in another world at night. The hotel staff at the Pelangi were lovely. We had a lot of laughs with Dennix & Asra, we learn a lot about the Balinese (Hindu) culture. People on the beach can become a little annoying when you are trying to relax by the pool & they kepp yelling out ""you want massage, etc etc. You do get used to this. The only main downsides to this hotel are the buffet breakfast, the food wasnt that great & not much variety. Also the pool bar isnt always staffed and on a number of occassions we had to get up to order lunch drinks. Overall for what we paid we cannot complain",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1185,"Great Value, and excellent location",40,January 2007,"This hotel is really good value. We are a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids under 11) so we booked two adjoining standard rooms. The rooms were big, nice aircon and bathrooms, and good Satellite TV. The pool was excellent. The buffet breakfast that was included was good, and changed daily. The best thing was the price. I can't remember what currency I paid in now but I think it was $US and it worked out as only £48 for the two rooms inc breakfast per night. Another terrific advantage is its location. It's only 50 metres along the beach to Gado Gado, which is one of the best restaurAnts around. Only 15 mintes walk along the beach to Ku De Ta, which is one of my favourite restaurant/ bar/ clubs in the world. 20,000 rupiah would get a taxi into Kuta when we wanted to buy cheap DVDs and kids clothes. A 15 minute walk into Seminyak and we could buy stuff from the more upmarket shops. Oh and did I mention the hotel is right on the beach.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1186,Great Spot,40,January 2005,"Not one for booking online, but we booked through an agent for a birthday getaway. First property was terrible. After kicking up a song and dance they moved us here to the Pelangi. The position of the rooms don't get much sun, but they are very comfortable and you'll probably spend your time by the pool or beach. Hawkers will come trying to sell you stuff along the beach, but the hotel does try to steer them away.
A great relation, but not if you want peaceful and romance.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1187,Great location,40,August 2006,"Pelangi Bali hotel is in a great location - right on Seminyak Beach. It is only a 10-15 minute walk along the beach to the great restaurants on Seminyak beach. Great location to go for a beach swim and get a beautiful massage on the beach. The sun lounges ar ein prime position to enjoy the beach but without being hassled.

The rooms are very large with a good comfy bed. The bathroom was small, the shower head was great but it wasn't spotless. We had a ground floor room but some of the first story rooms had a balcony - perfect for a drink.

The downsides for this hotel was the pool was in the shade most of the day, the pool bar was never staffed and the breakfast was OK. The pool service and drinks wasn't great by Bali standards with beers 3x the normal Bali price.

Overall though it was great value for money and good for us as we don't laze at the hotel too much.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1188,Love the Pelangi Hotel,40,November 2006,"We just spent 12 days at the Pelangi and loved it. Best deal in Bali. Great loction and very friendly, accomdating staff. The restaurant was below par, but you are only a 1$ cab ride from restaruant row in Seminyak. If you like being in the middle of it all then this is the place. It is right on the beach, but only 2 rooms actually face the beach. The pool is on the beach which is were we hung out. Enjoy.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1189,fab hotel & staff!!!,40,August 2006,"I felt that I had to write a review after reading someone say the management were rude at the Pelangi. I spent two weeks with a girlfriend and we absolutely loved the hotel. When we were ripped off by money changers in the main street- (beware ONLY go to authorised money dealers!!!!) we went to reception to tell them about our ordeal and they immediatley called the Manager. He then got the hotel car and drove us to the shark and proceeded to get the 100$ back that we had been ripped off. The staff were fanastic but please don't take up the offer from a staff member to go to Jimbaran for dinner as it was very expensive. We really could not fault the room, the view from the breakfast table and the sunsets. For anyone who is thinking of going to Bali go it is amazing and the friendliest people you will meet. I sure you will fall in love like we have with the place. Will be back next year Lou & Tracey ( well travelled girls)",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1190,A very clean hotel with attentive welcoming staff,40,September 2006,"We initially booked the Pelangi for 2 nights following our long flight from the UK with a view to either spending another 7 days there or moving on. We decided to stay for 9 days at the Pelangi due to it's fabulous location directly onto Seminyak beach and because of the hotel facilites.

The hotel was friendly and the accommodation was spacious and clean. The hotel was undergoing some painting during our stay but this didn't affect us in the slightest (for those reading reports that it could do with a lick of paint!).

The infinity pool was lovely and clean albeit a bit of a perculiar shape. This is largely due to the hotel being fairly long and narrow, which does give it a bit of a cramped feel. Pool beds were very comfortable and there was always a fresh supply of pool towels.

We didn't eat our evening meals at the hotel but breakfast and lunch were fine (the milk at breakfast was especially lovely).

We agree that the internet prices are a bit high but that's only to be expected from a 3* hotel I guess.

The hotel wasn't particularly busy and thus lacked a bit of atmesphere, but this was true of Seminyak in general. For those sports/film fans out there, the big screen in the lobby bar was very useful. Customers regularly watched their own choice of films and the staff were very accommodating of choice of channels, etc.

The staff were very friendly, witty and charming and this added to our reasons for staying.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Pelangi and we think it was excellent value for money (459K IDR - about £26 GBP including breakfast per night). Negotiate your rates. Highly recommended!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1191,"great holiday, excellent staff,wonderful location.",40,October 2006,"Could not ask for a better location. Situated right on the beach. Watch the waves as you are having a great breakfast or happy hour drinks at sunset. Staff were very courteous and friendly. Rooms were kept clean. Loved the bathrooms, particularly shower. Beach access to great restaurants and cafes situated further up the beach, either way. Easy, beach walk to Kuta and Discovery Plaza Shopping Centre (if a little more adventurous). Look forward to a return visit. But watch out for the tour guide operator near front reception (looks and acts friendly but you will pay double). Best to ring tour operators yourself.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1192,Not too bad... but abit over-rated,20,August 2006,"My wife and myself stayed for 3 nights. The beach-front pool was fantastic - in fact it's the only highlight about the place. The service at the reception was poor and the staff were not attentive. Breakfast spread was okay. The most ridiculous thing is the internet charges at the hotel - they charged 15,000Rp per min. In the other 2 hotels that we stayed in Kuta and Ubud, they only charged 3,000Rp per min. Furthermore, when we went out to the internet cafe to check their rates, it was only 3,000Rp per min. When i asked the reception if they had charged wrongly, she simply told me off and said that i can walk all the way out to the internet cafe if it's too expensive. Overall, i feel that it is over-rated.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1193,Bad choices spoil the holiday,10,January 2006,"The Pelangi Hotel has got extremely rude chovinistic management, so no girls should choose it as their destination in Bali. Our stay at the Pelangi was an absolute nightmare and I would recommend to avoid it at all costs!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1194,Best location in Seminyak,30,July 2006,"Pelangi will be the answer to semi budget travellers like me.Great location,with walking distance to shopping areas,great restaurant like warung made(must go!great food ,great atmosphere ,great price,best food like banana pancake,steam fish meal with rice,nasi goreng).Beach front hotel with pool facing the sea....nice....Walking on the beach, right to the ever famous restaurant gado gado facing the sea(jus few steps away,but not cheap though 150k rupiah for main course),to the left(most popular R&B clubs like deja vu and sixty six(bungee jump club by the beach).

The downsides are,the room is jus yr normal hotel room with bad choice of colour scheme...make the hotel looks old,the shower is nothing great and small.The breakfast is quite average...(Santika and Alam Shanti are grrreat).

Anyway,for the price of US 46 nett w breakfast,with great staffs around,u cant doubt the value of this hotel.Though,it doesnt give u a ""wow factor"" and a memorable stay,however,with its great location and price... it will sum up as a good deal in Seminyak area!",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1195,"Well run hotel, good location, good value",40,April 2006,"My Family really enjoyed staying at Pelangi. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, everything worked well, the pool was well maintained, the staff professional... All this for a good price. This is obviously a well run hotel and a good value. I especially appreciated the fact that the staff did not try to sell us transport, or tours, or what every like the other hotels in Bali invariably did. But to keep things in perspective, this is still a humble hotel. Small and on a quiet backstreet -- perfect for some people but not for others. Also, while the breakfast was fine, the simple meal we ordered for lunch was kinda lousy. We would come back again.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1196,Pelangi is Great!,40,December 2005,"Pelangi Bali is a fantastic hotel. We stayed there over christmas for $45 (US) per night. The large rooms are very clean and comfortable, with marble bathrooms. Rooms on teh 2nd floor have decks, which is nice. THe restauarant is great - very cheap and in a beautiful setting. The hotel pool is terrific. Keep in mind that the Pelangi is in Seminyak (next beach over from Kuta), so to get to the main nightlife scene, you need to take a 2.00 (US) cab. This was just fine with me and my husband - we like to go out, but not every night, and we much preferred staying in tranquil, clean Seminyak than in crowded Kuta.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1197,"Great service, clean hotel",40,,"We arrived in Bali 2 1/2 days after the Bombing and had considered cancelling. We are so glad that we didn't. I had heard mixed reports about this hotel and was a little worried that it wouldn't be nice. Our fears were short lived. We arrived to a lovely cool, refreshing drink, the check in took about 10 minutes, and then the porter took our bags to our room. Ground floor room 110. This is a superiour room which we found more than generous. From the wardrobe space to the huge bed, coldest fridge, bath and seperate shower to the TV, sitting area and outdoor sitting area, the room certainly didn't disappoint. We eventually upgraded after 1 week to a deluxe room (303) which was our 1st choice but they had been fully booked at the time. This contains a sitting room with TV and fridge, bedroom with TV, bedside tables, wardrobe and shelves, huge bathroom with seperate bath, pebbled shower, toilet and vanity. Both the sitting room and bedroom have their own A/C system. The pool is huge with childrens area (.80 mtre) to the pool bar and the main pool which is over 2 mtrs in depth. You can swim to the end of the pool and watch the surf crashing over Seminyak Beach.
The restaurant is lovely, relaxed and has fixed priced meals everynight or you can order A la Carte. The only down fall is that the pool bar was only open for the 1st 3 days after our arrival then you had to order thru the restaurant. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a well deserved break.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1198,A 3* gem of a hotel with 5* service,50,July 2005,"I have just returned from a 14 night stay at the Pelangi and couldnt wait to tell every body all about it.!!

The hotel is located in seminyak directly on the beach and i have to say you couldnt ask for a more perfect spot! Its located just a few minutes walk away from the bars and restaurants in seminyak, its only a 2 minute walk from Gado-GAdo ( a fabulous restaurant) in one direction along the beach and 2 minutes walk from the trenty double 6 bar and Paparazzi lounge in the other.

The hotel itslf is relatively small. We had a deluxe room (306) which had excellent views over the pool and the sea from the balocny. The room was clean and the beds changes every day. The hotel could do with a lick of paint in places but its something that is easilly overlooked due to all the positives this hotel has. The room has 2 air con units, a mini bar, a hair dryer, 24hr room service, a spaceous bathroom with an unusual shower, and a balcony.

The pool is just gorgeous and so so clean. There are pool attendants on from 8 until 8.30 that will provode you with towels and umbrella. The pool comes alive at dusk as the lights come on ( watch out for the mozziers at this time) making it perfect for an early evening swim. The pool is raised and looks like it goes on forever as it blends with the sea when you sit in certain places. Alternatively you can sit in front of the wall by the beach and gaze out to sea watching the surfers and other antics. There is a pool bar to save you going to the main bar in the rama restaurant.

The rama restaurant is situated next to the pool and provides adequate buffet breakfast in the morning. It also has a good menu offering east and west food at very reasonable prices for lunch and dinner. The hotel also put on entertainement most evenings if you dont wish to venture out. We could eat most afternoons for less that £5 at the hotel.

The spa is wonderful and very reasonably priced also, they are very professional and offer a wide range of treatments.

There is a bus that goes into Kuta every day 5 times a day, you have to make your own way back though which isnt a problem as taxis are inexpensive.

The staff at the pelangi really make this hotel what it is. Every mornig i was greeted with countless good mornings and how are you's. They will go out of there way to make sure you have everything you need. It was my birthday while i was there and they sent me a beautiful birthday cake up to the room. They make the effort to get to know you and are genuinely interested in their guests.

I really cant knock this hotel, it far exceeded our expectations and we will definatly be returning in the future. As long as you arent expectig 5* accomodation in a massive complex that you never have to leave i promise this a hotel will not dissapoint you.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1199,Great location + Great hotel = Great Holiday!,40,May 2005,"We had a great stay at the Pelangi Hotel. My cousin and I went together for a budget holiday. We made our initial choice of the Pelangi because we did not want to stay in Kuta, but also not be so far away, that we were out of the action all together. The free shuttle to Kuta also appealed, as did the free breakfast and that the hotel is situated on the beach.

On arrival the staff were friendly and helpful, and check in was easy. Our room was very nice, aircon, clean, nicely presented. Mini Bar if you want it, we took all the mini bar supplies out of the fridge and then stocked it with bottles of water we bought at a mini supermarket just up the road, and some Bintang also! There is a satellite TV, which has several movie and music channels which we often had on!

The hotel also supply two bottles of water to the room every day, and there is also a kettle, and tea and coffee supplies. (Though we bought our own coffee and whitener as there are only enough supplies for one coffee and tea and one whitener sachet per person a day)

The bathroom was adequate, it has a shower and separate bath (which has a shower head in it as well!) And don't miss the clothes line that pulls out from the wall over the bath - very handy!!

Our room was on the first floor, and we had a small balcony. The ground floor rooms have a door to the communal walkway which is beautifully landscaped, and they have their own little area of lawn where many guests move the table and chairs from the room, to, and sit and enjoy a cuppa, or a good book. I think I would have prefered a ground floor room. Everyone we met on the ground floor would have prefered the balcony!! So if you have a preference, request it when booking.

The Pelangi is a two story hotel. You enter the hotel on the first floor, and then access the ground floor rooms as you leave the lobby area. There are stairs to access at the entrance, and also to access the ground floor. I did not notice a lift, and if anyone considering staying here have problems climbing stairs I would suggest you consider contacting the hotel direct to find out.

I did email the hotel before our stay, and they were very prompt in their reply, with all the information I requested.

The grounds are lovely, the hotel is on a remarkably narrow strip of land, but this honestly does not impact on your stay, they have used the land very wisely. I say this as the review in the Lonely Planet guide say the site feels cramped. I really did not feel this, and would not rule out staying in this hotel just for that reason.

The pool is beautiful, and always very clean. And here is my main criticism of this hotel - they close the pool at 8.30pm and do not open it again until morning. This was frustrating, as on many occasions we would have liked a quick swim on our return at night, and we were not able to. Anyone who knows the heat and humidity of Bali, would appreciate the desire to have a swim at any time! Something to remember - the pool bar have a buy 2 get one free deal for bintang and cocktails - don't forget to get your free one!! We got the large bottle of Bintang between us, and shared the 3 bottles. Good Value.

Breakfast was nice, lots of fresh fruit, hot serves - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages (they were a little dodgy!) plenty of toast croissants and sweet pastries. And a plentiful supply of Vegemite!!

The restaurant is beautifully situated overlooking the pool and beach, and we even saw a Wedding being set up one night, which was beautifully decorated (the staff worked on it nearly all day for the sunset wedding) This didn't interfere with our stay at all, and while I did not see the ceremony, I imagine it was very beautiful, and would recommend it to anyone considering getting married there.

There are many great restaurants all within walking distance. I recommend Gado Gado ( about a 50 metre walk down the beach from the hotel) Great cocktails, good selection of Australian wines, food very good, and excellent service. Ku De Ta is also very good. These are more upmarket, so will cost a little more, but compared to what you spend at home for the same, they are still a bargain. Up the road is Benny's - some nights they have a display of Balinese dancing, and at the end even get some of the guests to get up and dance so find out which nights tey are on before you go!

Other good eateries include Santa Fe, C'bo (V. good pizza) The Bush Telegraph - all very good. The Bush Telegraph had a very good band on Saturday night - recommend+++ There are sooo many wine bars and many look empty most of the time - they do not really get going until 11-12pm.

Double Six nightclub is about a 100 metre walk down the beach it costs 50,00Rp to get in, we went one night simply for the pool!! Music was disappointing, mostly techno, but we had our own fun in the pool, and at 2am on Saturday nights they open the Bungy Jumping tower that is over the pool for anyone who is game! One woman did take the plunge, and we swam in the pool underneath her as she plumetted towards us!! A very fun, unique experience!!

Overall a great stay. The age group is mostly 25+ and families which is great, no young rowdy crowds like you get in Kuta.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
1200,Friendly co-operative staff great position,40,March 2005,"The Pelangi Bali Hotel Spa is well located in Seminyak. The hotel is quite new and offers a very good standard of accommodation bordering onto the beach. The swimming pool is excellent always clean and of course at an excellent temperature. The Hotel restaurant is very conveniently located adjacent to the pool and facing onto the ocean giving glorious views. There is a spa and sauna but these are unfortunately at an extra charge to guests. Our suggestion would be to offer guests say x number of free passes depending on length of stay. The included breakfast was quite good with a variety of fresh fruit and cooked foods. Other meals at the restauarant were inexpensive and well presented. The hotel staff were always courteous, welcoming and eager to help in any way. They worked well together and were obviously keen to present the hotel well. Music accompaniment to the evening meals and singers added to the cheerful atmosphere that pervaded the hotel. Many guests had been to the hotel previously and had returnd for the fourth or fifth time. We walked home from Kuta along the beach on two occasions in forty minutes having travelled in by the free shuttle bus. Taxis were easy to get and cheap. Nearby restaurants were great including Lemongrass, Benny's and Casa Padma's Drops. Unfortunately, We were not able to receive a late check out to 6pm as this would have been helpful as our night flight did not leave until 10.30pm We look forward to returning to Pelangi Bali Hotle in the very near future.",Pelangi Bali Hotel
