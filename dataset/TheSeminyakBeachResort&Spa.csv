61,An honest review,30,April 2023,"Rooms were nice however encountered more bugs in the rooms here than in our Ubud stay. Some rooms offer a nice easy access from the balcony door which was very useful to get to breakfast the beach and pool. Pool area was nice and a lovely place to watch the sunset, not often too busy therefore always found some deck chairs and table to sit at, where they provide towels. Prices of the pool bar food was extortionate therefore try and eat local. Rosalita Mexican restaurant was great, along with Grill'd.
Location of the hotel was great, local to Seminyak Village. Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay. Unfortunately we were not made aware of some of the facilities at the resort until our last day, such as a Jacuzzi/sauna in the spa. Some restaurants on the resort, was very confusing as to where we could eat, minus breakfast
The beaches here are unfortunately riddled with rubbish therefore we stayed mainly in the resort pool on a chilled day.
Not a lot to do in Seminyak, a week was too long for us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The hotel Is immaculate, rooms are beautiful, food is great- especially breakfast, pool is spectacular! Perfect sunsets right on the beach from the infinity pool. I own a lodge in the USA and I wanted to tell management /GM -Ratheesh Raj my thoughts. Even though extremely busy, he took the time for me and was so gracious about my compliments and truly cared about what I was going through. He gave me his direct line incase I needed anything while traveling in Bali. At the end of my trip I did not like the hotel I was staying at in Sanur so I messaged Ratheesh about availability for my last 2 days in Bali. They were fully booked one of the nights so he put me on the top of the priority list for cancellations and was able to accommodate me for my last 2 days in Bali. The only room available was the most amazing room I have ever stayed in. A villa with private pool beach front. When I arrived all the staff new my name welcomed me back and took care of me like family!! I plan on coming back to Bali and this establishment next year and every year I can.

193,Perfect end to our amazing Bali Honeymoon!,50,March 2023,"We had an amazing time during our honeymoon here. The staff are all incredibly kind and helpful, going over and above for every guest to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Room:
We had a Beach facing hot tub room that was beautiful, big windows and a balcony facing the ocean. You can hear the waves from your bedroom every night and it‚Äôs really nice to watch the sunset from either the poolside bar or your private balcony.

The rooms were generously sized with great air conditioning, plus minibar and plenty of bottled water for the bathroom plus bedsides. The lighting is also great, really sets the tone of the room with the lamps and mood lighting. The beds also have multi-country adapters by the side of the bed which is helpful, plus in the bathroom under the main mirror.

The bed is a great size, super comfy large pillows and well dressed every day by our great housekeeper Adi. As we were on our honeymoon we were given a flower bath in the room, plus multiple very cute little towel animals daily. Really added a lovely touch to our experience.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Food:
For breakfast the restaurant offers a wide array of food, a wide spread of European, American, Indonesian and Indian food all round. From fresh fruit and granola, pastries, Balinese sweets, hot food such as sausages, bacon, hash browns, Indian curries, Balinese dishes like Noodles and rice too. The buffet also features a fresh pancake, waffle and egg station for perfectly made eggs delivered to your table. We tried both Fried and Poached eggs during our stay which were perfect every time.

Having a wide choice of teas and coffees at the restaurant was also a nice touch as we were pretty tired of the instant coffee we‚Äôd had elsewhere on the island.

Every morning we were greeted by the lovely restaurant team who remembered the finer details such as our names, room numbers, drink preferences and egg options. Really makes the place feel like home when staff are so attentive to your needs and remember your face.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Pool area:
Finally, the bar service by the pool is second to none with attentive staff waiting to take your order. The cocktails and drinks are all great, many frozen options too and iced coffees for the morning pick-me-ups.

The pool side food is equally good, a touch more expensive than going elsewhere outside of the resort but worth it for the convenience of staying by the pool all day to watch the sunset.

The pool area itself is beautiful, clean and located perfectly over the beach for many amazing sunsets and beach watching. Every time you visit you are given clean, fresh white towels for the sun loungers. There are many around the main infinity pool that also have parasols (given that it‚Äôs not too windy) - The pool atmosphere is quiet and relaxed which some background music.

There is beach access and external showers at the poolside so you can run down to the beach and swim in the sea with a short 60 second run from your lounger to the waves.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Location:
Located just north of Seminyak Beach on Google Maps, the hotel is very close to great local spots like:
- Seminyak Flea Market (5 min walk)
- Sea Circus (5 min walk)
- Motel Mexicola (10 min walk)
- Multiple minimarts all over the street

259,Fantastic Staff. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,50,February 2023,"This was my second stay at this beautiful resort. I was sceptical at first when i entered the hotel. Reception decor was simple and understated, very much unlike other 5 star seafront properties in Bali.

However the exceptional staff made all the difference. Their warm and welcoming smiles that greeted us every step of the way throughout our stay there made us feel so welcomed.

Special thanks to Ema for her fantastic service and her warm smile to make every guest feel special and welcomed. She displayed a genuineness about her and was very knowlegeable. She was always ready to help and gave us information on places we wanted to visit. She made it a point to check if she was not sure and followed up the next day to check on our experience.
Her fellow colleagues Akram and Arif also deserve a special mention as they took the effort to know our names and warmly greeted us always with a bright smile that was ever so pleasing.
The staff at the restaurants namely Budi, Dedy, Indah, Epi, Budi, Meila and Trisnata were a fantastic team. Their service and smiles were impeccable and made our dining experience so enjoyable.
We thoroughly enjoyed the food from the Sanje restaurant and found the quality of food to be very good though we wished there was a little bit more variety in the selection. The zuchinni pasta and the lamb chops and mahi mahi fish were out of this world!
The rooms were clean and spacious decently equipped with amenities. I must applaud the room service team. Service which was quick and efficient.

Just a note to add, we wish the breakfast dishes could vary a little more as we noticed the same dishes were being rotated even during our 2nd stay at the hotel.

Overall we had a fantastic stay at this hotel and we will certainly come back to stay again. Kudos to the fantastic staff who made our stay so fun and memorable. They made all the difference.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

300,A blissful experience,50,March 2023,"My wife and I stayed here for 10 days. We have had the most beautiful time. Made so by not just the idyllic setting but by the welcoming smiles and hospitality shown by every member of staff. The hotel is set facing the sea, with an infinity pool that drifts into the ocean and sets the stage for glorious sunsets enjoyed with happy hour cocktails. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair, from staples to perfect poached eggs, dreamy pastries and gorgeous coffee. The rooms are elegant modern contemporary style; ours had a lovely patio set facing manicured gardens with gazebo lounges. With the room curtains drawn the comfortable bed enabled us to catch up on months of missed sleep as the AC kept the room at a perfect temperature. The bathroom delivered further excellence from a feature roll top bath to a spacious shower. Our room was routinely and pristinely cleaned and made up wonderfully well. As an avid gym goer, the gym has a more than adequate fit up. Few hotels have all the gym kit of professional gyms, and this is no exception, but there was more than adequate weight, dumbbells, bench and a few machines for any holiday training I needed to work off the excess of cocktails and dinners out! The hotel‚Äôs location also sets an easy point for trips out, whether snorkelling with the manta off Nusa Penida or visiting waterfalls and monkeys in Ubud. The guest relations team helped us organise our trips and keep everything simple.

Overall this was a perfect 10 days for my wife and I to spend time together and retrench after some tough months at home dealing with health matters. A big thank you to all the team at the hotel for making our time with you special.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The room - gorgeous, spotlessly clean, the cleaning staff do a great job, everything replenished daily.

Security staff also very helpful with directions & stopping the traffic (üòÉ) as you cross from one building to another - it‚Äôs the small things.

Pool area is stunning, fabulous beach location - but the pools are fabulous, the infinity pool especially. The first day I arrived, I came from the entrance furthest away from the towel collection point. I was approached by the life guard (It was maybe obvious I was new to the hotel) he asked me to pick a bed and told me he would arrange some towels) - again nice touch and great teamwork in looking after guests, I‚Äôve been at hotels where you are sent to the waiting staff - nice of the life guard to assist in this way.

All pool waiting staff attentive and courteous - we ordered several times - all occasions followed up swiftly and correct. This is hard to do in heat & dealing with many patrons.

Now to the star of the show, the breakfast crew - the most outstanding teamwork here, it was ran on all 3 days like a military operation. Everything replenished, guidance on how to tackle some of the exotic fruits, nothing to much trouble and literally everything on offer from, bespoke coffees and pressed juices, Italian food, Indonesian, healthy, continental, Indian, egg station - literally everything. On one of the days there was a guy, I didn‚Äôt get his name (3rd march) who was managing back orders for eggs and bespoke dishes, he Apologised for the delay ( it was only 10mins) and took our order, simple but genius ( this does not always happen in 5 star hotels, the poor omelette people can be left sweating, cooking and trying to manage all of the orders ). The guy doing this task, his English is particularly good and he was so courteous in checking our orders were correct (I‚Äôm very picky!!!) - everyday in fact he came back to check my picky orders were done correctly - I hate ordering breakfast normally (again because I‚Äôm picky) ‚Ä¶. I was nice to be able to enjoy it. He was the star of the show for me.

All in all, whoever runs this hotel & the teams responsible for the sections should be very proud. It‚Äôs hard to get everything right all of the time - highly recommend, a hotel that works as a team, our stay was a joy!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
309,Best luxe resort in Bali,50,March 2023,"TLDR: Overall FABULOUS experience with Seminyak Hotel.

Safety: before entering the hotel you are greeted by pleasant security guards and a security check is done, making you immediately feel safe in the environment. Please note, staff somehow remember your face and therefore do not repeatedly ask [if you are a guest] every time you enter the resort. Instead you are greeted with a warm ""hello ma'am, sir, how's your day?""

Staff: Cannot emphasise on how wonderful ALL staff are from the time you ate greeted upon arrival. Ogi at at reception was friendly and informative and made you feel right at home. Everyone is smiling at all times and happy to assist in any way they can.

Facilities: facilities were excellent. The whole resort was ""instagrammable"" & cleanliness is impeccable. My favourite feature was the pool overlooking the beach which was made more relaxing by attentive pool staff providing pool side service of drinks and food at affordable prices.

Experience: On arrival, you are provided with welcome drinks, ours was iced ginger juice, so refreshing. Reception then gave a run through of our booking, confirming if we booked 2 single beds (after noticing we were a couple). Upon realising this mistake, the resort fixed the booking with no hesitation & provided us with a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The resort was also aware that we had a late departure & assured us we were welcome to store our luggage and use the amenities, even after check out at 12. Unfortunately they were not able to accommodate late check out due to high occupancy rate (that's how popular they are!) otherwise, they would have totally let us stay in.

Raj, ( General Manager ) is impressive, pleasant and professional and this is replicated to his staff. Thanks, Raj and team for an overall beautiful experience and time spent at the Seminyak Resort. Looking forward to coming back.

It was my birthday during our stay and the staff helped my friend plan and set up a surprise for me to make it special - thank you!

The rooms are spacious and have everything you‚Äôd need. The infinity pool, cocktails and restaurant/food are amazing. The Balinese food in particular.

The only slight downside was we booked what was described as a beach room but the view is actually of the gardens with the ocean in the background, we were under the impression we‚Äôd be right on the beach. However the amazing experience overall meant this didn‚Äôt really matter and it was only a short walk to the beach and a great sunset view from there too.

402,Good but not outstanding,40,January 2023,I find all the reviews of this resort to be rather glossy and don't really share the true experience. Whilst our stay here was good it certainly wasn't outstanding. We stayed across the road in the garden rooms and found them to be a little noisey. You do have to cross a road and walk down the street a bit to get to the main resort. The resort feels a little dated and lifeless. A lot of their facilities are (permanently I think) closed. They only serve food and drinks from the poolside bar menu even at their nighttime restaurant. The food is ok but nothing special. Buffet breakfast has a decent selection and is good. Great location for Seminyak and all it's restaurants. (may I suggest Mauri) The two best things about this resort are the incredible pool and the absolutely outstanding staff. The service would have to be the best I have encountered anywhere. So there you go! There is the review I wish I had seen before going to the resort,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

443,A property that feels slightly dated but ticks all the boxes,30,January 2023,"This hotel is just fine. A kind of ho-hum beach resort that delivers more or less what you'd expect. When I visited it wasn't overcrowded, which was nice. If there were large crowds here it would be a lot less pleasant. It is directly on the beach with an area to swim, and two pools, and a nice garden with lots of areas to lounge around, and an in-pool swim-up bar. Definitely has that ""resort"" feel.

The rooms are fine but without any truly special design features. Like a lot of the hotel, the decor feels a bit dated.

The hotel seemed a bit understaffed as check in took 25+ minutes, since there was only one desk attendant trying to deal with 3 different groups checking in. Not great.

The location is fine. You can walk easily around Seminyak including up to Petitenget.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The room, facilities and the location were all exactly what we had seen in reviews, and even better in person! We received a lot of help from the staff in planning the rest of our honeymoon. We were so pleased especially with Akram from the customer relations department who went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of. The manager Raj and Putu were also very friendly and professional. We were also offered a complimentary photography session. We had so much doing this with Yoga from Photo Leisure who listened to our requests and made it a fun experience! One of our highlights was the breakfast buffet, which was well staffed, clean and tasty! We also loved the Infinity Beach Club (pool area) which has beach front views and a relaxing vibe. Make sure to attend the Balinese dinner nights on Wednesdays for a real cultural experience!

538,"Good location, clean nice hotel are the advantages.",40,December 2022,"Stayed there for 3 nights in Dec. Had booked the hotel basis the reviews, would say it didn‚Äôt disappoint us. The room was clean, though it offers only partial view of the sea (no rooms offer view of the sea). The sit out is spacious, has enough and more green spaces. The location is fabulous so much so that we could walk to/fro Seminyak main market/road couple of times in a day. This was a big advantage with a small baby with us.

However, the breakfast spread is fairly limited, as compared to some other hotels with similar pricing across southeast Asia. Secondly, because of greenery, mosquitos are a big nuisance there despite using the lotion/ sprays. Our 10 month old daughter had 3-4 bites on her face itself. In fact hotel should spray mosquito repellant regularly as per me, but it isn‚Äôt the case. One has to ask for it.

The pool is beautiful, however be careful while getting in if taking the steps as the gap between last 2 steps is very big. It can be risky and there is no mention of it anywhere.

Overall, location is the biggest positive of the hotel. Would want to explore other properties next time rather than blindly going there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I felt so blessed to have stayed in a hotel like this. I have to specially mention Wayan, Trisna, Epi, Winda, Nadia, Erdin & Putu too. But all in all everyone looked after us so well.

The breakfast is incredible, you want for nothing. Anything you can imagine is available. This is enjoyed in Santan restaurant in the gardens.

Ricco in particular was extremely helpful. He paid for my transportation once when I didn‚Äôt have my money converted to Rupiah yet. I would have been stranded if it weren‚Äôt for him.

Wayan at the beach bar was also very kind. He offered a lot of perspective and clarity on things I had planned for my trip. He, like everyone else on staff, always made sure that I was taken care of.

The swimming pool become my most favorite place. The room makes you wanna stay all day in bed.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
759,Affordable Luxury on the beach,50,November 2022,"We had an ocean view pool villa.
The accomodation is huge (especially compared to our tiny apartment in Sydney)

We enjoyed the privacy of our own pool plus the ability to swim in the main pool.
The main pool is long but narrow parallel to the beach. You look over it from the villa so you feel really close to the beach and really private.

We would also like to try the apartments.

The breakfasts were very good - we eat a plant based diet and we‚Äôre very well catered for. The restaurant itself is lovely.

The staff throughout the resort were excellent.

Location wise we were right next door to KU DE TA and super close to other sunset bars, great restaurants and bars.

W will definitely come back again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
760,Seminyak beach resort & Spa hotel,50,November 2022,"The finest of the finest. Top class service. Super attentive. Me and my family had the pleasure of staying here 9 nights for our daughters 6th bday. Seminyak beach resort hotel had made it an unforgettable memory. Staff had taken time out of their busy schedule to surprise my daughter with a bday cake and presenting her with gift goodie bags. My daughter was so happy.

Later for dinner, once again bringing bday cake and surprising her again. Truly an unforgettable experience.

To top it off they offered us late check out which helps us lots due to a late flight.

I will 100% recommend friends and family to visit Seminyak beach resort.

The deco, infinity pool, staff, manager, EVERYONE. I would like to take this opportunity to say a big THANK YOU.

Bali holiday has been an unforgettable memory",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
761,Fabulous,50,November 2022,"We spent nine nights at The Seminyak Resort for my daughter's birthday, and to summarise, our visit was faultless. The service and hospitality was exceptional from right through to check-out.

The hotel is in good proximity to stalls, malls, eateries and flea markets. Ample taxis available via reception or simply flag down on road side.

On the morning of my daughter's birthday, the staff surprised us with a cake and a goodie bag for her. This was completely unexpected and we are eternally grateful to The Seminyak for making this occasion so memorable for her.

The hotel itself is well maintained, from the manicured gardens to the two infinity pools with a fantastic view of the ocean. There are loungers and beds in close proximity to the ocean for a relaxing experience all round. The breakfast area is of a good size with a decent selection of food. Again, it's the service that stands out as the staff are prompt with seating, and come round often to ask if we need anything else.

We also noticed that general manager is often on site, greeting and talking to guests. As we had an evening flight, we really appreciate the courtesy to be offered a late check-out on the basis we had two young children with us. We didn't ask, but it's these little gestures that really do make all the difference.

If you're looking to stay in the Seminyak area, I would highly recommend this hotel. Keep up the good work!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

770,Wonderful experience...,50,November 2022,"I had not been back to Bali in 12 years and wanted to stay on the beach. The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa did not disappoint. I booked a garden room across the road in another building with a pool. The room was huge, the bathroom was gorgeous. The aircon was just right not too loud as it was on all the time. The room was immaculate and so quiet, one morning I didn't wake until 9.30am.
It took 1 minute to walk to breakfast which was fantastic, the best Cappuccino ever!The food offering was exactly what you would expect from a first class hotel. The staff were amazing everyone said Hello and can they help wth anything.
The pool area was my favourite spot, great lounges, not too crowded I had a double lounge available every-time I went for a swim. The infinity pool is huge and looks directly onto the beach and the sensational view. The staff by the pool were exceptional. If you are a couple or a group of friends or families with children this resort would be very suitable to stay. Everyone of the guests were respectful of not making too much noise in the pool it had a very chilled relaxed atmosphere. I left TSBRS to head to Gili T for 4 nights and had not made arrangements for my last 2 nights back into Bali before flying home. My experience at TSBRS was so good I rebooked for those 2 nights. I would highly recommend TSBR and the staff for a truly wonderful Balinese experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Words don‚Äôt do our experience justice. Thank you for the most wonderful and unforgettable stay!

Three years ago we got engaged on the beach while staying in the hotel, so we went back for our honeymoon.

The staff did everything to make our second stay even more memorable than the first one!

The check in was warm and welcoming and we were flooded with joy and happiness. Our room was decorated on honey moon style and we had our first flower bath!!

The GM Ratheesh Raj introduced himself and ensured personally that we had everything we did not even know we could have :-)) thank you! Mr. Raj is also very present in the hotel and attends to the guests himself. We were impressed.

Everyone knew us by name, we never experienced this level of service anywhere else before. I used to work in the 5 star hospitality industry and I was blown away.

Especially, we want to thank Wayan from the Infinity Beach Club and Sanje Restaurant, who attended our first year wedding anniversary and made sure it was more than perfect! Perfect drinks, perfect service, perfect chats. All smiles every second and pure happiness with the most attentive and humble service. Thank you Wayan! We are forever grateful.

We also want to point out Soni, who attended to us everyday and provided impeccable service with a radiant smile you could see below the mask ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Also Ferdy, thank you for all the experience and knowledge you shared with us and the wonderful farewell, we had in the Infinity Beach Club. It took us by surprise and we are so grateful!
There are also two more wonderful people from Infinity Bach Club we would like to say thank you again and apologize for not remembering the names properly - THANK YOU ü§ç

At breakfast, we want to thank Lia, Theo and Wayan for the most relaxing Starts into the day.

Also housekeeping was so discrete and always to the point.

811,Worst Service and Reaction to Medical Incidents BE WARE!!! Book Elsewhere.,10,October 2022,"Book elsewhere. Unethical, no training for incident management, honey moon horror story.

While the staff were polite during our day stay. On the 2nd last day, I tripped on a stair in hotel grounds and severally sprained my ankle.

When I fell, I was not able to stand back up, and felt faint. A hotel guard came to me and told me I needed to move on and walk across the street (as I was staying in the garden rooms across the road). I explained that I had had just tripped and hurt my ankle and couldn't stand He said I could wait their for 1 minute. At which time I passed out to pain and shock sprawled on the concrete ground. I awoke some time later still with no assistance, but the the guard hovering over me asking me to now move. Still dazed, and in pain, I picked up what I had dropped around me, including camera gear, and wallet (my bank card conveniently has not been seen since passing out). and hobbled to the hotel room, painfully aware I would not get any assistance despite repeatedly telling the guard I was staying in the resort and needing assistance. He kept telling me I need to return to my room.

I hobbled across the road, on an increasingly swelling ankle. Barely able to make it up the gutter and then up the stairs in the lobby of the Garden rooms. The person on the reception desks asked if I was ok, and I replied no and I had tripped and hurt my ankle. No offer for any first aid was given. And I requested for Ice to the room to which I continued to hobble un assisted. Starting to realise that no help would be coming and despite the rating of this resort, the star for First Aid training or medical assistance was not one they posses.

Getting in the room, and elevating my leg, I waited for over 30 mins for any ice to arrive. On arrival the staff continued to knock at the door, despite me calling out very loudly to enter as I couldn't stand on my foot. I ended up having to stand again on my foot and get the door. Again the staff looked at me and left the Ice and I asked for help. They said OK and I asked for a compression badinage and said ok, and left me to stumble around to get a towel, wet it and left me to walk back to the bed and I contacted my wife.

She returned, and asked reception again for first aid assistance. They returned with a first aid box another 30 mins later that only had a sling in it with some charcoal tablets and iodine liquid, despite a clear request for compression bandage which was either ignored or forgotten.

My wife was then forced to walk around Seminyak to 6 different chemists to find a compression bandage.

That Night we had room serivce twice, both times with staff recognising my injury but not doing anything about it.

I had Ice delivered 3 times that night as well to keep on it, each time staff avoiding to assist or ask any questions.

In the morning, I went to reception to ask for an incident report for my medical insurance. They directed me to the main reception across the road. To which I left an hour early than my wife to again, walk across the road and into the other lobby.

I asked for an incident report, and the Front office Manager came out and said they had known a guest had fallen but wasn't aware of the severaity.
I asked for the incident report, which they said they would give me if I signed a document, which they presented, with my Name, on it that said I release the Hotel of all fault.

I said I refuse to sign it and just need a document for medical insurance that repressed the truth of what happened, That I fell the previous day, and their cameras could see that.

Again, they returned with a document saying that I triped and that I would not hold them responsible for any further action.

Again I refused and asked just for a statement for my medical insurance. Later I found out, they were calling my wife while I was writing a statement, and asking her ""He fell in the street didn't he"" where was it? not in the hotel? "" Trying to get a dfferent version from her in the room. This was all the while, the guard who tried to make me walk after the injury came up to me and recognised me from the previous day and said oh Im sorry I though you were tired.

Needing to check out by then, the Manager assured I would have it before we left.
I was offered crutches which were too small for me, however I took the assistance as. this is the first time any care was given, and they then offered to use the ccuritsy electric buggy to take me back to my room to pack. Neither of which had ever been offered before and now only seem to be an option since requesting the incident report.

After packing, I again needed to request the documentation while we waited for a transfer. This time the document stated that immediately after I fell I was offered first aid by the guard and staff afterwards and was offered assistance for the next 24 hours until check out. Which was again, a complete fabrication of the fruth.
I spoke to the manager by phone this time, as she did not want to come to the garden rooms, and asked why she would lie on the documents, and she said she just filled out what she thought she needed too.

I am assuming that she may have been instructed to put comments in like this, as each time I asked for a statement they workers needed to leave and seemed to consult someone else.

In any case, my word of warning to anyone considering to stay here, Dont.

The area where I fell was within the area where the guard house is and they check vehicles, So I would be very surprised and even disappointed if there were no cameras there recording all day.

I truely believe that in a hospitality buisness its easy to provide good and satisfactory service when things are going well. However the real gauge is how you are treated when things dont go well.
In this case, it was sub standard, and un ethical. If I was not paying attention to the documents as others may not, who knows what would have happened with Medical insurance.

The outright lies and deception the hotel attempted really disappointment me despite the pleasant interaction up until then.

To top this all off this holiday was for our honey moon.

Thanks, but book elsewhere.

I asked for a contact at the hotel to talk to about my experience, however the only contact I could make was with the same manager who put forth fabricated statements. I will happliy discuss this incident further with he hotel if they wish. I have the staff names involved and copies of statements I filled out at the time which were handed in - I am doubtful those in charge of such a large establishment even know or even care this has happened.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

813,"Amazing place to stay right on the beach. Great people, food, gardens & sunset.",50,November 2022,"Amazing place to stay right on the beach.
Relax sit back with a drink & watch the sun set over the infinity pool.
But it‚Äôs not just the pool that is impressive, the amazing breakfast, the food, including the seafood BBQ under the stars on the beach front, but the staff who are all so polite & friendly.
It is obvious that they all love & appreciate their jobs.
The ethos of this resort is outstanding.
We have visited Bali many times & will pay the extra to enjoy another stay at this hotel.
No longer have to go to the over popular beach bars or bean bags to watch the sunset as you have your own outstanding private position right here.
A special mention to a few staff.
Retna at reception who always goes out of her way to say hello.
Wayan by the pool who is a delightful personable young man.
Loved our stay.
Thank you very much.

849,FIRST TIME BALI TRIP/FAMILY GET AWAY/OCEAN VIEW & BEACH ROOMS,50,October 2022,"From the moment we walked into the Seminyak Beach Resort we where treated in a way that we have not experienced anywhere in the world. From the room upgrade (garden room to beach room) to the free late check out (6.30pm) to the care given to my wife when she was badly sunburned, Retna ,Ricco and all the staff made our stay very memorable.
ROOMS- Ocean View room is massive, very clean serviced every day, room service for anything you may need, sunset views are amazing.
Beach Rooms are in a great location, just walk out your sliding door through your large patio area and you are at the pool /beach area.
MEALS- the buffet breakfast was excellent, egg/pancake chef , Indonesian dishes, fruit , breads , pastries etc set in a beautiful garden restaurant .
Infinity pool lunches where great, the beer bucket special and cocktails are very reasonably priced.
The Infinity pool has to be seen to believe, a 30 metre pool right on the beach.
STAFF- the staff make your stay very special, always willing to help you with kindness that we have not witnessed before. My wife had to much sun and was unwell, within 15 minutes a doctor was with her , the ongoing care given to her by Retna and the staff will never be forgotten.
LOCATION- prime location,10 minute walk to Eat Street and shopping.

Unfortunately I had to change the dates of my trip and let them know which I didn‚Äôt think would be a big deal as the website states 100% refund within three days of your reservation. I have been trying to get my refund now for over three weeks with no luck. I was just told by someone in the e-commerce department that I would not receive a refund until mid November. I‚Äôm trying to wrap my brain around the fact that it takes over six weeks to refund a one night stay? How is this even possible when they take the money out of your account immediately? This is not five star service in my opinion I have called the hotel several times which has cost me a fortune and international phone bills and sent unlimited emails only to where I get a response to be patient, I should‚Äôve just booked another hotel or booked through Expedia. I‚Äôm sure the refund process would‚Äôve been way easier to me. This is unacceptable so if you have to cancel the reservation, beware you will be pulling teeth to get your money back if at all.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The staff were absolutely amazing!

-I booked my stay the night before and called and requested a driver. Rupawan picked me up from the airport for a late flight on time with a sign and ensured I got settled into the hotel.
- Ogy welcomed me into the hotel and even upgraded my room for my birthday. He was so kind, attentive, and professional.
- Khrisna was masterful in organizing my amazing birthday floating breakfast in their beautiful beachfront pool full of my favorite foods.

Rupawan was also there to help and make my birthday wonderful.
- Rati was a phenomenal photographer and captured beautiful photos of me.
- Wayan provided excellent and prompt food service. He also made my reservation at the hotel for a beach-side seafood dinner with lobster, prawns, red snapper, lamb and other great dishes to eat.
- And the Spa experience was the best that I have had in my life! It is so beautiful and dreamy. Losi gave me the best massage of my life. She was kind and provided an outstanding, calm, soothing experience. Nita, the Spa Manager was so sweet, professional, and kind to me.

It‚Äôs very much close to the most happening street in seminyak and it adds to the value of the property as well.

What needs special mention was the hospitality of the staff! It was fantabulous throughout our stay and the way the staff greet and offer to help you wherever you go was just overwhelming.

Special mention to Miss. Desi at the front desk who made sure the check in check out process was hassle free. Also the general manager Mr. Raj and Mr. Deva were very friendly and helpful.

The restaurant staff were also very very polite and paid attention to all the guests‚Äô needs really well.

859,Remarcable experience !!! Best beachfront and sunset spot in Bali,50,October 2022,"We chose The Seminyak as one of our resorts during our Balu honeymoon. Tunred out to be a very inspired choice!!!
What stands out in this place is the warm home-like feeling that is being transmitted by the friendly staff.
Everything was exceptional!

The warm welcome of Desi at the front desk who made our early check-in possible and her woderful trainee Awan wich helped with our luggage and gave us a fast and concise introduction to our room and facilities.

The staff prepared an unexpected and wonderful surprise for our honeymoon. We LOVED it!!!

The infinity pool facing the Ocean is incredible, giving you what we think is the best seat for an amazing sunset. There is also good finger food available by the pool.

For our first dinner we booked a table in their restaurant. The place is not crowded and the experience of eating in the sounds of the crushing waves is a 5* all by itself.

Breakfast is very good, with alot of local and international dishes, covering all tastes.

What really came as a pleasant surprise during breakfast was the warm personal greeting that came from Mr. Raj, the hotels G.M. I think this gesture speaks for itself and comes to show the level of commitment and quality of services that is being achieved in this resort.

We just had to try out the Spa which again stands out as a 5* experience. Ms Ekanadi and her team are exceptional. We opted for a 90 minute Balinese couples massage which was performed by Tini & April in the most enjoyable and relaxing ways. Everyone staying here should try the Spa.

A late check-out was made possible by the kind Rista at the front desk.

To sum it up, The Seminyak has won a place in our hearts and will forever be part our our fond honeymoon memories.

Our sincere thanks to the whole team.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

871,Best Bali Holiday in 10 years!,50,September 2022,"My family and I had the pleasure of staying in The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa in Sept 2022 for the first time since the Covid restrictions opened up. We had been once at Christmas a few years ago and had a fantastic time so l when Bali opened up this was our first stop.

We were unable to stay in the main compound like last time due to a booking app problem so secured a room across the road. Initially having read some reviews I was worried if we had made a wrong decision, however the rooms offered greater privacy tucked out of the main resort. The room quality and cleanliness was excellent (thanks Ted and Edy Irawan!) plenty of room, balcony and shower and bath. The secret part‚Ä¶..It was amazing that these rooms were much better value than the main compound! If you are reading this have zero hesitations about getting a room here.

The service from when we arrived and throughout our stay to when we left was impeccable - all of the staff went out of their way to make us enjoy what was possibly our best experience on our many trips to Bali ever! (We have been to Bali at least 10 times over the years).

Thanks to Pak Raj the GM, who was around everyday and evening to greet guests and has made this hotel even better than before.

Putu - Staff Relations - my daughter‚Äôs favourite‚Ä¶.she loved making necklaces and baking cookies (fact- the lovely pasty chef who also met my girl once made about 1000 macaroons for a Christmas display‚Ä¶she may even do it again this year!)

Tika the front office manager - very on the ball no problem too big or too small. V professional. My wife‚Äôs favourite.

Dewa - the F&B director, very genuine guy, v helpful, a huge asset to the hotel.

You‚Äôre near Ku De Ta, La Lucciola, Potato Head which are a walk along the beach! You can walk to Seminyak Village. This place could not be better located.

Great memories for our kids that will last a lifetime. Thank you all at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. Thanks again. We‚Äôll be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
872,Good service,50,October 2022,"Mas Ricco is the best! The service is impeccable, friendly staff, awesome location, vacation vibes at its best! The rooms are nice and cozy, the lobby is luxurious, and the Resort itself is beautiful!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
873,A Stunning Hotel & Great Staff,50,October 2022,"My Wife Lorraine & myself recently visited
The resort.
A very easy check in we had a beautiful Ocean Villa
The Manager Raj introduced himself on our arrival
and was always available if needed.
The Staff make the place every member of staff
Continually smiling and asking of you are ok& they all seem to know your name we will certainly visit again.
The breakfast was a great choice great service and good food.
A mention for Putu she was very helpful and always available a very special mention must go to the star
Wayan at the pool bar this guy is a diamond and destined for much better things look after him
As he is the future of the Hotel and be careful that somebody does not lure him away from you
The front house manager was also a great help",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
874,Fabulous stay in this resort!,50,October 2022,"This is actually my 2nd stay here. While it is only 10mins walk to the buzzing center of semiyak, it retains its tranquility by the beach. You can easily lay by the infinity pool in the morning and head to the city for afternoon shopping, followed by a nice dinner. You get to have both the resort lifestyle as well as all the happenings by staying in the resort. Room is clean, service is great. Recommend to stay in the terrace room in the main building, villa even better",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
875,Amazing view and location at the Infinity beach club - tasteless and inferior food,40,October 2022,"When you've visited numerous beach clubs, seaside restaurants over the years it should come as no surprise that the majority of these restaurants live more on their location than their food quality, so sad but so true.

And the worst thing to witness is that it is so easy to lift the total experience to magnificent with just minor tweaks which even does not mean more cost in production of these fairly easy and standard courses that these restaurants most often offer.

Still restaurants all over the world fall Into the ""most customers dont care or complain"" trap, at least it seems so.

Shame on them, and shame on Infinity beach club. With a clear ""italian"" profile on their beach kitchen you must at a bare minimum be able to produce a decent pizza or simple staple pasta dishes.

Not even close - down right tasteless and inferior is the closest description I can come up with. I feel so sorry for the ever so service minded, lovely, helpful and always smiling staff rhat is put in front of such cooking.

The other dishes - if you prefer ""everything deep fried"", then go ahead. Otherwise focus your mandatory spend of IDR 500.000 per person to the drinking menu. Or wait till the main restaurant opens at 18:00 and hope that it is way better than Infinity.

I sincerely cross my fingers and hope for a positive change on the beach restaurant here, people will come running for a perfect pizza - even in pouring rain at this otherwise amazing place!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
876,Holiday,50,October 2022,"Nice hotel nice staff & very friendly

885,Honeymoon stay,40,September 2022,"We spent a week at this lovely hotel in September for our honeymoon, and just a few days before we arrived, the accommodation was cancelled due to a credit card failure (long story) and our room was no longer available. However, when we phoned the hotel, despite them being extremely busy, they spent a long time trying to find us rooms, and eventually, although we had to move rooms once, both were beautiful, clean and well equipped.
All the hotel staff were so helpful, cheerful and extremely helpful and accommodating, and any issues very quickly rectified.
The hotel is in a prime location right on the beach, and really close to some amazing bars and restaurants.
Staff are constantly on hand around the pool taking orders for drinks, fetching towels, and helping with everything, without being asked, and without being intrusive.
The sunsets whilst sat outside in the evening are absolutely stunning.
The general manager was visible every day, and extremely friendly and approachable (he even took a photo for us when he saw us struggling with a selfie!) .
All in all, a fabulous stay, but just a word of warning, if you stay in a garden villa, tread carefully around the various water features, it can get a bit slippy, and if you're a bit accident prone like us, it's easy to become complacent!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

We will definitely return on our next holiday to Bali. We hope to see Dwi again next year.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
897,Honeymoon - September 2022,50,September 2022,"We booked the Seminyak for a two week stay for our honeymoon and this place did not disappoint.

We were blown away by just how friendly every member of staff was. From the moment we arrived and greeted by the staff at reception we were made to feel like royalty.

This treatment continued throughout our stay at the hotel. From the staff at the restaurant in the mornings, to the staff by the pools, housekeeping staff, gardeners and security, every single person was just incredibly friendly and welcoming.

The hotel itself is just amazing. It's incredibly well maintained and clean. During our stay, there was a number of improvments being made to the hotel, however these were not intrusive and all the tradepeople were really lovely and accommodating. These minor improvements just show how committed they are to uphold their high standards. The rooms are incredible - they are immaculate and really well maintained. by the housekeeping staff.

In terms of food - the selection of foods at breakfast were brilliant, with a mixture of fruit and cereals to cooked breakfasts and local Balinese quisine. This quality stretched to their poolside menu - high quality foods for getting through the days on the sun loungers!

Location wise - the hotel is in the sweet spot. You are about a 10 minute walk from Seminyak Square which leads onto a strip of bars, restaurants and shops. You have places such as Moonlite and La Plancha also about 20 minutes walk and Finns Beach Club is about a 30 minute taxi ride. The hotel itself literally backs onto the beach which is great for any surfers or people wanting to go into the sea or a long beach walk along the beach.

All of the staff were amazing but just want to give a special mention to Wayan who became more of a friend during our stay. Always on hand to check in with both Laura and I and ensure we had everything we need. It was such a pleasure to meet him and all the staff at the hotel.

If you are looking for a hotel in Seminyak then this is by far the place to stay. We came away just wanted to rebook straight away! Loved every minute of our stay, thank you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
898,Perfect bali destination,50,August 2022,"It was a 2nd honeymoon, along with my mother who hadn't traveled since my father passed and the seminyak beach resort was the ideal spot to arrive at after a long plane and immigration ordeal. The resort is so conveniently placed on the beach with a infinity pool, great service from all the staff, in particular Suriadi, who found us everyday, welcomed us taking time to stop and chat, arranged beach chairs and saw to our needs. The staff sent us a special cake to our room and we're so attentive when I had a small accident, ensuring everything was OK. There was a beach club beside the resort and the market just around the corner with a great authentic money Changer and the town shops snd bars just 10mins walk away. Perfect. Thank you all to the seminyak beach resort, we will be back. You are wonderful people.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

900,Balinese charm and sophistication.,50,September 2022,"We stayed in one of Seminyak Beach Resort‚Äôs and Spa jacuzzi suites. The spacious suite offered old world charm and spectacular views of the iconic Bali beaches, beautifully manicured tropical gardens, entertainment, hospitality and shopping precinct.

We were greeted upon arrival with a traditional frangipani lei and our host took the time to get to know us individually as we checked in to ensure our stay was pleasurable. The resort staff , collectively provided an exceptional level of professional service and attention to detail in every aspect of their work. The usual Balinese charm, warmth and happiness was also offered generously to guests.

We greatly appreciated the staff at Seminyak Beach resort and Spa who along with the wider community and setting provided us an unforgettable and positive experience of Bali.

Of special mention, I would like to sincerely thank our breakfast host who provided exemplary and professional service as well as valuable insights into Balinese culture, language and cuisine. She is a rising star in Bali‚Äôs tourism industry and a wonderful representative of everything that is good about Bali. Her personal intelligence, personable nature and hopefulness for the future of the Balinese tourist industry inspired us to make a commitment to return to Bali.

As an Australian, I urge all Aussies to return to Bali and support the beautiful people of Bali and their tourist industry which is so important to their economy.

Thankyou , Trisna and the team at Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. We will be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
901,Honeymoon Bliss,50,September 2022,"Wow! We were absolutely blown away by the incredible staff and facilities at this resort. The breakfast buffet was the best I‚Äôve ever had.

904,"Great stay, even better staff",50,September 2022,"We have just stayed at this resort for 10 days and had a wonderful time. The hotel was lovely and most accommodating. The best part is the genuine friendliness and service of all the staff. The whole breakfast team and the pool team were brilliant. Wayan, Soni, Krishna and so many more went above and beyond. Thank you to the reception team who kindly extended our check out due to our late flight and the management staff particularly Raj who sorted any room issues we mentioned by the end of each day. Even the gardeners who worked tirelessly to keep the grounds pristine and would stop working as you walked past to turn, smile and wish you a good day.

Thank you Seminyak Hotel for providing us such a great holiday and we hope we can see you all again soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
905,Great experience.,50,August 2022,"We spent 17 days in August, and it was marvelous. The staff, the structure and the location were excellent. Welcoming staff, always ready to help you and very friendly. Our friend Rupawan helped us a lot in running the tours. The structure is beautiful and well mainteind and cleaned. SPA was great and very professional. Location just few steps from Semyniac senter, but very quiet. We were very satisfied.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
906,Disappointed - felt like a money grab in the end,10,September 2022,"Well I walked away feeling like I got fleeced which is never good. Last time we stayed at the W, which is way more expensive but I didn‚Äôt leave feeling like I did today.

Staff - 5/5 - so beautiful
Rooms - 4/5
Grounds - 4/5
Breakfast - 3/5
Food generally (around pool etc) - 1/5

So here‚Äôs why I felt like the whole place was a stitch up.

I don‚Äôt think IRD 61000 for a 250ml can of coke is ok when I bought one at the convenience store for 7500. (That‚Äôs a comment on how expensive everything is not just the coke.) So really expensive and not very good quality on the food and beverage.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ok to charge IRD 1.6M for a late checkout. I‚Äôve had early checkins and late checkouts all over the globe and never paid for the privilege.

And my biggest gripe is that we received a note two days before our holiday telling us the signature infinity pool was undergoing maintenance. So in 7 days not once was there available seating for us to sit and look over the infinity pool and over the ocean (didn‚Äôt really want to because it was a construction zone anyway). This was one of the main reasons we chose the resort. If I go to a fancy steak restaurant I expect there to be steak and some chicken as a substitute just wouldn‚Äôt be ok.
I do understand that maintenance is required but when your signature offering is out of action I think the management has an obligation to notify customers and let them decide if they still want to stay there or try somewhere else.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
907,"Exceptional Service, Exceptional Resort!!",50,September 2022,"Our stay at The Seminyak has exceeded all our expectations with the staffs quality of service. Since the first minute arriving we were welcomed with smiling staff who accommodated our every need and we have continued to receive this fantastic service throughout our stay. The facilities are second to none including beach side restaurants, swim up bars and beautiful pools all serviced by friendly staff. We were looked after at the pool by DENY who went above and beyond to cater to our every need. We will definitely be booking here again very soon!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
908,"Honeymoon, 30th Birthday, INCREDIBLE!!",50,September 2022,"Wonderful hotel with a great beach front location and superb staff. Everybody we met was so helpful and friendly - nothing was too much trouble and they really aced the 10-5 rule when it came to greeting everybody.

We stayed for our honeymoon and we were greeted with a lovely honeymoon cake and some really cute towel animals each day! Seems like a small thing, but we really loved it. Our Ocean View Jacuzzi Suite was absolutely spotless each day and all amenities were replenished daily with plenty of water too.

My wife also celebrated her 30th birthday on the trip - again she was greeted with a birthday cake at breakfast complete with song and everybody for the rest of our trip continued to wish her happy birthday and knew us by name.

The team at this hotel 100% make the stay exactly what you need it to be. Some facilities are undergoing refurbishment or maintenance work - it's a shame obviously as everybody wants to visit when the work is done but it happens and there's nothing that can be done about that - certainly nothing enough to complain about.

We would absolutely recommend this hotel to anybody staying in the area - and thank you so much to everybody there that made the stay so special - we loved it and will remember it fondly!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
909,Honeymoon and Birthday stay,50,September 2022,"After our wedding being postponed 3 times due to covid, we finally got to go on our long awaited honeymoon to Bali. We stayed here for 8 days after 4 days in Ubud and it has been unbelievable. The team in the hotel have been so friendly, inviting and have gone above and beyond for us to make our time feel very special.

The views from our Ocean Suite were breath taking, the food at breakfast was always fresh and tasty, the team are attentive, extremely friendly and hospitable. The facilities are spotless, there's always insence burning so everywhere smells lovely and we always had our towels shaped into animals which I personally loved. 5 star hotel, 5 star experience.

Thank you!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
910,beach resort,50,September 2022,"Lovely hotel with the traditional Bali hotel vibe. Great location on the beachfront. Very attentive staff that obviously enjoy their job which is always nice to experience.
Beachfront infinity pool, yes it is having some work done as mentioned in other reviews, but that is a good thing . This didn't impose any problem in this area as there are plenty of sun lounges and no noise. There is also another lagoon style pool on the beach so lots of options.
We had the bar b que on Saturday night at the beachfront area. It was fabulous. Live music, great food including seafood, lamp cutlets, beef, chicken, fresh salads and AMAZING patisserie selection .
Breakfast: really fresh and good selection. Jams, honey, bread all made on site. special order eggs available like eggs benedict with salmon etc, really good. It is definitely a high level of quality compared to other hotels I have stayed in. Fresh is fresh.
Rooms- everything functioned well including air conditioning and hot water , clean and secure. Location is good. Gardens are beautiful and well maintained , so beautiful. Thanks you to the staff and management for looking after us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
911,Be careful!,30,September 2022,"We booked an ocean front villa at this hotel a year ago when tourists were still not coming to Bali, we had a good price and took a chance that Bali would reopen by then. Our first week was in Ubud and then we were coming to this hotel for our second week. The price of the room had escalated considerably after we booked as tourists began to return. The day before we were due to arrive here while we were in Ubud the hotel messaged us stating that our room was no longer available due to a ‚Äòmaintenance issue‚Äô. They would not let us view the room and we knew they had sold our room for a much higher price. We were so angry as this holiday had been planned for so long and we were due to arrive in Seminyak the next day. After we asked to speak to the manager and a lot of messages we were eventually offered a suite for 4 nights and the villa for the last 3 nights, we agree as we didn‚Äôt really have a choice we were already here. When we checked in all villas were taken so it was pretty obvious our suspicions of the room being sold for a higher price was confirmed. When we checked in we were greeted by Tika Yuliantika who was lovely and was obviously put in a difficult position, she couldn‚Äôt apologise enough and offered us s complimentary romantic dinner as well as a spa treatment which was offered by the manager. She was messaging us to check everything was ok and went out of her way to help and sort out a beautiful romantic dinner for us, We did appreciate the compensation gifts offered but it did not take away the disappointment of not getting the room we booked for the week.
Also we were disappointed to find that the hotel wasn‚Äôt completely open when we arrived. The infinity pool area is under construction and parts of it are cordoned off. There is only one pool bar servicing the entire of the hotel. After returning one night at 10pm we asked where the cocktail bar was, only to be told it had not yet opened and the only bar in the hotel was the pool bar that shut at 10pm. There are only half a dozen chairs in this area so be prepared to sit on a sun bed for your evening drink. The spa is also closed for maintenance and has moved to a hotel room where they carry out the treatments. The massage we had was lovely but as it was just a room and not actually in the spa so you didn‚Äôt get the full experience.
The staff here are great which is why I gave the hotel 3 stars as they make it special.
We did have a nice week here despite the issues but if you book this hotel be prepared that if they can sell your room for a higher price they will and claim ‚Äòmaintenance issues‚Äô and also check that the hotel has been fully reopened. We arrived on the 13th September and had no idea about the closure of the cocktail bar , spa or the infinity pool work being carried out.
The best thing about the hotel is the location with plenty of bars, restaurants and shops close by, also a lovely beach stroll takes you to the vibrant beach bar La plancha amongst others.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
912,Special Holiday,40,September 2022,"Bali - 5/5

People - 5/5 - shoots outs for everyone without exception, but specially for Dwi, Putri, Rita (rrrrrrr‚Äôita) & Suastini who made our holiday very special.

Hotel - 3/5 - a bit dated but lovely grounds (subject to uninformed pool maintenance)

Food - breakfast was ok, but can‚Äôt even give 1/5 for the pool bar. It was awful. My tip is to stop trying to cook any food that you don‚Äôt understand the taste & texture off, still to Asian cuisine at least!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
913,5 star beach hotel and infinity pool,50,September 2022,"Fantastic stay in the jacuzzi beach suite,. Lovely view from 3rd floor. Must give a huge thank you to Wayon and Edi . The service was exceptional from both of them from the pool to the restaurant. The staff at breakfast were so friendly and welcoming. The staff is what makes this hotel 5* would definitely return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
914,Luxury hotel with 5 star service,50,September 2022,"We stayed here for 5 nights and cannot fault the room, service and food.
We stayed in an ocean suite room with jacuzzi. Please do note that any room on 2nd floor does not really give you ocean view. We moved to the 3rd floor which was better.
The room itself was very spacious, luxurious and well maintained.

Situated right on Seminyak Beach with lovely sunsets and a lovely infinity pool, can't go wrong if you want to chill and relax.

Location of the hotel is very central, most places walking distance. Situated right next to Ku de ta beach club.

Breakfast was plentiful, do ask for poached eggs, smashed avo, or eggs benedict/royal, its not advertised anywhere but they do offer this.

Spa not fully open yet, but plenty of spa options outside of hotel.

Gym is good and does the job.

We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment on food.

Would highly recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
915,Dinner at the SANJE restaurant,40,September 2022,"Very nice Italian restaurant with a wondeful view on the Seminyak beach. The food was well prepared and good. Our waiter DWI was very pleasant. He made good efforts to speak with us in French when he realized we were French, really a nice guy. I recommend the place it is worthwhile stopping there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
916,Almost Perfect - but a few tweaks needed,40,September 2022,"So the positives- location, rooms and the service are brilliant. The team at the hotel are professional and super friendly. Room was lovely and the location on the beach and in the heart of Seminyak without all the noise is fantastic.

And now the negatives - the lunch & dinner options were great however the breakfast included was one of the worst in all the hotels I have ever stayed in. Their cocktails were also dreadful - blue food colouring in one of them! The hotel I think is also trying to market itself as a ' ZEN Bali senses experience' especially if you watch the promo video but it is far from it. The thing is these things are easy to change - update your cocktail list to a classic menu, revamp your breakfast to a more current palate and think about your brand/image is now not when the hotel first opened - Remember this is a premium 5 star hotel with the associated price tag ! You need to have the food & beverage at the same level.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
917,One of the best resorts you'll find in Seminyak!,50,September 2022,"Incredible place!

Me and my fiance stayed here for three nights and we had the most incredible time. Everyone from the staff are super sweet, friendly and welcoming. The rooms are also in a very good standard and the hotel is very well managed. When we arrived all double bed rooms were already fully booked out but the reception staff sorted it out by giving us a free upgrade.

A special thanks to Budih, Arya and the rest of the staff who helped me out with organizing an unforgettable and beautiful proposal. You're the best. Thanks!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
918,Amazing Experience - Lovely Resort - Overall rating 10/10,50,September 2022,"The hotel provided free room upgrade (ocean view room), this is nearly 1000$ extra charges which was provided complimentary by the hotel. The front desk employee (Lina) did a great job for the entire stay.

The experience cant be described, the hotel is directly on the beach, lovely pool, room is clean, nice & large and the food is just amazing and with reasonable pricing.

I will definitely visit this luxurious hotel again. In my opinion it is the best hotel in the Seminyak area and among the best in Bali.

Visit this lovely resort and enjoy your stay",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
919,60th Birthday celebration,50,September 2022,"We are presently sitting in our ocean suite jacuzzi with just one hour until our taxi collects us to transfer to our next hotel.

Having spent 10 days here I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and would definitely advise anyone looking for a small piece of paradise to visit.

We have been looked after so well by all the staff and in particular Wayan, Budhi & Soni deserve a mention for going the extra mile to make our stay and my wife‚Äôs Birthday amazing.

We are now heading for the Merusaka hotel in Nusa Dua for the next 10 days and I can only hope it‚Äôs going to be as good (if not we will be back in about 2hours).

920,Truly Stunning Resort and Amazing 5 Star Service - Soni at the Infinity Pool!,50,August 2022,"We had the most amazing time here! Great location, beautiful resort, stunning Infinity pool over looking a fantastic beach and 5 star service (especially from Soni) at the Infinity Pool!

We stayed in an Ocean Beach Front Villa for 14 night with a private pool. The villa was beautiful having our own private pool was fantastic! The room was very clean and comfortable.

The resorts main Infinity pool was absolutely stunning! We loved the fact you could swim in the pool and watch the beautiful surf of the Indian Ocean. In the evening we would have cocktails and watch the stunning sunset.

There was one very special person who went out of his way during our stay Soni (who is incredibly lovely and is a credit to the resort) at the Infinity Beach pool. His hospitality was so warm, friendly, welcoming and always professional. He welcomed us by name everyday when we arrived at the pool and went out of his way with his service. He would be the first always to inform us of different entertainment evenings and events such as the Independence Day Evening where there was wonderful Indonesian foods and amazing balinese dancers/fire dancers and the Balinese buffet evening with traditional musicians. Really enjoyed these evenings. Lovely! Miss you Soni wish there were more people like you!

All staff at breakfast were lovely and friendly they catered for my gluten free dietary requirements which is always great! The table setting and open seating for breakfast was beautiful. We dined a couple of times in the Sanje Beach front restaurant and they do an amazing banana flour gluten free pizza which we came back for a couple of times.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Loved every minute of our stay here!

Thank you to the security staff and life guards especially Agung.

Thank you Seyminak sending much love and thanks from the Harrisonsüôèüèº

MISS YOU BALI - WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
921,Best Service - Wayan!,50,September 2022,"Superb stay. Rooms are clean and well serviced. We booked a beach view room which was lovely. Best breakfast with so many options. We slipped into our Bali routine of gym/exercise, breakfast, beach, dinner very easily. However the highlight of the stay has been the service provided by Wayan at the Infinity Pool. My goodness every hotel needs to figure out how to clone him 50 times over. Forever happy and extremely customer focused ensuring that you are receiving the best possible service/experience. He was the best!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

923,Destination hotel,50,September 2022,"Gorgeous hotel with incredible pools overlooking the beach. Generous room size and easy access to everything in Seminyak (though to be honest, the hotel is ample destination). Small suggestions to improve the experience - allow guests to run a tab and pay for all food/drinks at the end of the day. Also a hotel information folder for the room would have been helpful (inc pool opening times, spa treatments, restaurant info etc).
Lovely, genuine staff who all remembered my name (thanks Wayan!). Can‚Äôt wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
924,Beautiful hotel and incredible staff,50,September 2022,"We‚Äôve been staying here for my mum‚Äôs 60th birthday holiday and I cannot begin to explain how beautiful it is.

925,Authentic paradise,50,August 2022,"Loved our stay at The Seminyak Beach resort. Luxurious without being pompous. Excellent location, great facilities and lovely rooms but it is the staff that make this resort so special. Each and every staff member we encountered would take the time to greet you and engage in conversation. Putu the guest relations manager is the hotels biggest asset. A true gem.
The dining options while not at 100% operational were sufficient given the task of reopening after the Covid hiatus that has decimated this wonderful island paradise. Prices for in-house dining were reasonable given the star rating of the property. As with any property that is ocean front there are signs of west and tear but I much prefer this with the beautiful gardens and peaceful ambience over the concrete monstrosities and loud doof doof music that emanates from so many other beach front properties.
Just go. Spend your money and treat yourself to a stay in this lovely resort. Will definitely return",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
926,Great service,50,August 2022,"We prefer this resort every time we come to Bali; great location, clean beach, beautiful infinity pool, clean and well cared rooms, delicious cuisine and a wide variety for breakfast. Most importantly the staff is very professional, nice and helpful. I forgot my tablet computer in the room and wrote to them from the airport.

930,Honeymoon holiday,50,August 2022,"Beautiful hotel, pool literally on the beach with great views. Food is delicious and staff are friendly. The staff also very polite and looked after us. I have to say that the restaurant manager budhi was amazing, he truly looked after us and spent time with us getting to know me and my partner, he always asked us if we were ok and recommended drinks and food to try at the hotel. Budhi is by far the the best highlight of my week in seminyak hotel beach resort and spa and compliments the hotel very well. We will come back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

933,Review Seminyak Spa and Beech Hotel,50,August 2022,"This was our first trip to Bali and our delayed Honeymoon. Our experience at Seminyak Spa and Beach hotel was amazing .
We booked the garden room , Our room was very spacious and contained everything we needed . The cleanliness of the room was 5 star, bottles of water supplied daily . Rooms come with hairdryers /shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/ toothcare and a range of teas and coffee .Free standing bath and roomy shower. Plenty of storage . Free WI-FI
We had opted for Breakfast to be included in our package - which was buffet style . An excellent great range and variety of different cultural foods . Eggs and omelettes cooked to order .
We booked in for a couples massage at the SPA , the SPA is truly beautiful and staff extremely experienced.
The hotel has an infinity pool which overlooks the beautiful beach . We found our spot daily on our private sun-loungers near the sunken bar .
We we‚Äôre very lucky to celebrate Independence Day in Bali , the hotel provided entertainment with traditional Balinese dancers including a fire dance - this was truly spectacular - something we will never forget .
All the staff were amazing so friendly- nothing was too much trouble . Budhi ( restaurant manager )welcomed us every morning for breakfast and throughout the day around the pool - brilliant customer service.
It‚Äôs great to see the General Manager Raj being so hands on with the hotel. He was welcoming to guests , and was present in all areas overseeing the smooth running .

I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and will be returning .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
934,The Seminyak Beach Resort,50,August 2022,We had the best time at this resort. A great location to amazing restaurants. Plenty of shops and massages. The staff were wonderful and friendly and nothing was a bother. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was also great along with the BBQ dinner night they have on Saturdays. I highly recommend this resort. We were looked after very well by ADI and many other staff members,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
935,"Stunning setting for this hotel, service overall lacks",30,August 2022,"We stayed here for 5 nights. While I would recommend this hotel, there were a lot of flaws compared to the other places we stayed at in Bali. On the positive, the location of the hotel was great and the views from the infinity pool over the beach were stunning. Unfortunately we found several things not to our satisfaction. Firstly the room was not properly configured when we arrived. There were four of us (2 adults, 2 kids) and they had set up as a single king bed even though we had asked for 2 queens (and booked months ago). They did not have the two queens available but offered to put an extra bed in our room, at a charge! Needless to say I was not happy about that and they finally agreed not to charge. All this was a faff and should not have happened. Imagine if we had just arrived after a long flight (luckily we had not). The room was a bit on the small side and I just felt that the staff were not well trained overall. We wanted to sit down near the pool/bar area for some lunch after a long journey getting there, but there were no tables (there are very few tables!) and we were finally seated in a closed restaurant. We were then served food without cutlery or napkins. The staff seamed reluctant to use initiative or stray from the stated menus. The pool area was busy with outsiders (who can pay to use the pool area) so there was often no seating/beds for hotel guests. The housekeeping staff seemed unaware that there was 4 of us in the room and kept only leaving two towels (did they not see the fold out bed!!??). They seemed very tight on topping up any toiletries. My wife had to keep calling them to bring some cotton wool - each time they would only bring one packet. Surely they should be topping up the toiletries each day? There was fruit in the room - hooray. But we cut an apple open and the waste from that apple, including uneaten pieces was left on the counter day after day - did they think we were still going to eat a 3-day open apple? While we enjoyed our stay this was not a five star experience. And we paid top dollar.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
936,Great experience,40,August 2022,My husband and I stayed at the resort for 3 nights. We found the customer service fantastic and the room and surroundings relaxing and well-kempt. The ocean view from our room was great as well! If only the rates were slightly more affordable.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
937,Beautiful Stay,50,July 2022,"We stayed her in July with 2 adult boys 22/20. We had a fantastic experience and our first time in Bali. We had 2 rooms (Beach Rooms) and we had a glimpse of the ocean. However we could definitely hear the waves rolling in as that brings us so much joy. The rooms were nice and comfortable. The resort very well looked after.
All staff were so friendly and do speak English. Breakfast was great and in a beautiful open setting that can be closed if there is bad weather.
Great location and especially being right on the beach was fantastic. We were always welcomed with smiles. (We could possibly be remembered by most of the staff as the Shisha family LOL as Shisha was available at the resort)
We would recommend this hotel for families/couples/solo travellers. Loved it",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
938,Relaxing Week at Seminyak Beach Resort,40,July 2022,I have just returned from a week at the Seminyak Beach Resort. I travelled with my husband having booked originally 2 years ago in 2020. We stayed in the Ocean Beach Villa with a private pool. The room was beautiful and it was such a treat to hae our own pool. The private pool got the sun in the afternoon so we spent most mornings out by the main pool which was also very nice. Service was pretty good as was the food from the lunch menu. There didn't appear to be a dinner restaurant as such so we went out every evening into the town to eat. THere is also no real hotel bar apart from the beach front bar which never really had much atmosphere. Overall we had a nice trip and would definitely recommend.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

941,5 night stay,40,June 2022,"We booked this hotel through Luxury Escapes who we have been using for years and are great to deal with.This Hotel is very big and has nice surroundings ect.Breakfast was very ordinary in comparison to some hotels we have stayed in,in the same area.One thing I will advise any future people booking at this hotel that if are not in the main grounds as far as the rooms go and you are across the road in the standard rooms,you will feel very segregated,nice rooms but something to consider. We here on the top floor of this building and the lift was broken down the whole time we were there with no explanation at all from management.Not a great experience at all unfortunately.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

944,The highlight of our Bali trip & we got engaged!,50,May 2022,"From start to finish our experience at this hotel and resort was incredible, we had the pleasure of meeting the kindest and most helpful team of staff.

We also got engaged on our first evening at the hotel, with a huge thanks to Dewa (Food & Beverage Manager) who helped me to organise a romantic dinner with 6 courses and bubbles in their beautiful chapel in front of the ocean on the resort and the incredible rose petal decorations and candles and a photographer - it was so special!

We would also like to say a huge thanks to Khrisna one of the waiters for taking such good care of us and providing us with knowledge of Bali. Made at the Infinity Beach Club was also very friendly and took great care of us every time we visited (which was often). Thank you to Octa who greeted us and looked after us every breakfast time and Ekanadi at the spa in the hotel, she was very friendly and made our experience there very relaxing.

Overall the staff were phenomenal, we have never visited an establishment like it, the staff are what made the hotel even more amazing they couldn't do enough for us and we were made to feel so at home and we will be returning in the future! Thank you all!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

946,Honeymoon Stay - Beautiful Resort,50,April 2022,"We stayed at The Seminyak for a week for our honeymoon and it could not have been a better stay. We stayed in a beautiful ocean-side pool villa and the room did not disappoint - the staff even provided us a complimentary honeymoon cake. The pool and outdoor area are very spacious and the room is clean and updated.

The staff is friendly and always looking for a way to assist with a smile. The infinity pool overlooking the Indian Ocean is the nicest I have ever seen, with plenty of seating room. The food is good, but not an extensive menu, so we would recommend Seminyak and all of the food within a short walk.

The resort, location, and service make this a must stay and we cannot wait to return next time in Bali. Thank you Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
947,Oasis of serenity in lively Seminyak,50,April 2022,"We have seen this hotel for the first time, during our previous visit to Bali while walking at the beach. And thought to stay there next time, and it was a perfect decision.
We had a very pleasant and enjoyable stay at the hotel. We initially planned a 2 bedroom villa, but due to confusion with booking the hotel team offered us 2 villas (1-bedroom each). That was a great solution. The villas are beautiful, spacious and well equipped.
The hotel itself has a direct access to the main beach in Seminyak, with swimming pool and very nice restaurant on seaside.
The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, making the stay even better.
It‚Äôs a pity we stayed only 4 nights.
Definitely recommended for relaxing stay after activities around the area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

949,Excellent hotel but one reservation,50,May 2022,"Wow! Beautiful hotel with amazing service, the cleaning crew were actually the best I‚Äôve ever experienced, even if we left the room late we would get back to find that even my make up had been organised into military precision. The proximity to local bars markets etc was excellent. Breakfast was an adventure - there was so much choice and chefs on hand to fry eggs etc, coming home to normal breakfast time seems so dull! The manager was constantly visible, he was always getting to know the guests and on hand, great to see a manager who is so hands on. Only one negative - the pool bar prices were more expensive than being
In London!! I‚Äôve stayed in a Shangri La and food and drink were really reasonable but one vodka and sprite was around ¬£10, no cheaper local wines were available so 3 or 4 hours at the pool could cost between 50 -70 pounds- I felt we had already paid a premium to stay at the hotel but were paying again, apart from that I loved it and thank everyone at the hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
950,Paradise!,50,April 2022,"After two years without travelling, we have come back to Bali. The resort is excellent and the staff attentive and friendly. It is wonderful to see Bali recovering and to be reminded of the beauty of this paradise.

Our room is spacious and comfortable with wonderful air-conditioning. The pool is wonderful and all meals we have enjoyed have been great.

The position of the resort is excellent, close to shops, restaurants and bars.

This is a wonderful time to come to Bali, less crowds, lovely clean beaches and pure relaxation!

We will return to Sydney refreshed and relaxed and recharged.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Overall good",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
952,Hotel with worst experience while we're staying in Bali,10,April 2022,"First night our room got issue with the night-timing water heater. The second night also got the same problem. The engineer said, it might be due to many guests also use/ shower at the same time. At 11-12pm at nitee, every nite?? First day, they even told us, we wrongly use the shower faucet. At the end, they said they just got trouble with the heater at noon (even though it happened again on the second night). So many excuses. But yet, no good intention to solving the issue. Until after the second night, me and my husband decided to move out to different hotel, even though we alr fully paid for another night at this, The Seminyak Hotel.
While we checking out, the FO just offered us to move to another room. Just now! We alr got issue since the first day! And they only try to solve it on the time we checked out?? First night, the Engineer guy himself told us, they have checked other rooms also have same issue, means no different even we changed room.

While we waiting to check out, FO told us to wait for the staff to double checked the room. We waited quite awhile, then we asked to FO if it's done. Turned out, they made us waiting for their GM to come to the hotel.
We wanted to enjoy our last two days in Bali. That's why we moved out to different hotel asap. Yet still, made us wait and waste our time. At least they can tell us at the first place.
Fortunately, our next hotel was good, much better.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

954,Would be a great place to stay if a few details were sorted out,40,January 2022,I ordered a ‚Äúfree upgrade to sea view with jacuzzi‚Äù but on arrival was shown to a room which had no jacuzzi (I wouldn‚Äôt have minded had it not been promised). I complained and was told it was ‚Äúsubject to availability‚Äù which was not stated on the booking.com website and would anyway make the offer meaningless. After further complaint I was given a lively private villa with plunge pool (but no sea view). I then enjoyed the stay so would have given 5 stars but for this dishonest or incompetent sales process. The food was good except that the really delicious roast chicken I had on the first night was sold out the other times I tried to order it. But there are other excellent cafes and restaurants nearby like ku-de-ta and cafe Kim. Staff friendly and tried hard so the place just needs more attention to detail.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
955,THE RESORT BEST I'VE EVER STAYED IN SEMINYAK,50,November 2021,"I've heard rumours of how beautiful the resort but I never actually went. But, then I finally stayed in the ocean view suite room. My gosh. Amazing room with the view! You just want to spend all day long sitting on the balcony while listening to the ocean sound.

The room is luxurious and one of the best resorts I've ever stayed in Bali and the best resort I've stayed in Seminyak. Super duper close to the city as well. So you really get the best of both worlds. Luxurious private resort but yet it's in the Bali city.

Super recommended!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

959,Paradise in the heart of Seminyak,50,August 2020,"My first time staying in the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, very beautiful and centrally located in the heart of Seminyak. This area is so green, the landscape is perfect and peaceful.
By the time I arrived, I felt staying at home. The best decision for having a weekend break in the beach front villa. The villa is huge and beautiful, complete with safety & healthy kits ( on the table) I love the private pool overlooking green and beach. The bath room is with both shower and bathtub, very nice specially two nice batik kimonos are ready for us.
All staff are professional and very helpful, many times I asked a help for taking pictures. Super love the olympic size pool facing Seminyak beach, amazing. A perfect sunset spot as well.
Breakfast is plentiful...very happy tummy to enjoy various Western and Indonesian menus. I had option to have it at villa or in the restaurant,
Before breakfast I had opportunity to jog around the beach area and used fully equip gym. I felt so happy and healthy staying here. The best decision ever, most perfect vacation and experience I had. And the best sleeping quality, I really like the bed and the ocean wave therapy from the window.
Amazing how I slept like a baby, completely rest and relax here.
Next when coming back to Bali, without no doubt I will be back here and for sure,
this is highly recommended place to stay for enjoying Seminyak area.
Very close to everywhere we want to visit, just walking distance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
960,Best Hotel I have ever stayed at,50,September 2019,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is without a doubt my favourite Hotel till date. It was just the most perfect vacation I ever had. The hotel itself is beautiful and well maintained and the staff is unbelievably kind and welcoming.
I already look forward to my next stay there.
Would definetly recommend this place for couples and Honeymoon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
961,Best holiday we‚Äôve ever had,50,September 2019,"My husband and I stayed here for 10 nights. The hotel was beautiful and it was only at 60% capacity so wonderfully quiet. All the staff are lovely and friendly, the Balinese are some of the nicest people on earth. There are two restaurants to choose from, both amazing, one is over a koi carp pond and the other over looking the beach (which was amazing for sunsets). The breakfasts in the morning were so delicious, one had a buffet kind and the offer you order off a menu. Our room was lovely and spacious with a nice balcony, overlooking one of the pools and the bathroom was gorgeous with a huge bathtub. They offer many excursions at decent prices and the hotel is in a good area with hundreds of other restaurants and bars if you fancy a change. I could carry on as I love this hotel so much! I would always come back here if I am able to visit Bali again. A true 5 star hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
962,extremely awesomely goodly good,50,January 2020,it was very restring good informational knowledge. we went to the horse race and saw some donkeys painted as horses it was very good and awesome. we then ate some crickets and bats. we had an antidisestablishmentarianism kind of time.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
963,Best Honeymoon!,50,August 2019,"We stayed at the resort for 8 days for our honeymoon. It couldn‚Äôt have been better. These were the nicest and most friendly people/staff we have ever experienced. The grounds are beautiful, rooms clean, and they go out of their way to make sure you‚Äôre happy. Bottom line, highly recommend this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
964,Great Customer Service,50,April 2020,"Our trip was cancelled due to Covid-19. After some initial confusion regarding whether or not we would be entitled to a refund the senior management were excellant in assisting us through the process.

Not only did the resort director proactively contact me to inform me of the process but they kept me informed at every step of the way and ensured I received a full refund.

I can't thank the director a nd his team enough for their help and if this is the excellent level of customer service we received then I can only imagine that this must be a first class resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
965,Great hotel!,50,October 2019,"It was our 40th wedding anniversary and We booked a 3 centre holiday which included the first 6 nights here in Sea view suite, (this was our 4th trip to Bali)
The suite was beautiful with a luxurious bathroom, huge bed,beautiful bedding, balcony, mini bar and great choice of in-room tea and coffee.
The breakfast was the best I have ever experienced in any hotel, huge amount of choice, from healthy freshly squeezed juices and buffet to cooked to order a la carte all in a gorgeous restaurant surrounded by a Lilly pond. I knew the next 2 hotels we would be staying in would not be able to match up to this and I was right!
The gardens and pools areas are beautiful, lovely comfy sunbeds with thick mattresses on a wooden deck with infinity pool, bar and food service delivered to your sunbed and in the evening we witnessed the most spectacular sunsets. There is also another pool with a few 2 person day beds right on the edge of the pool, we didn't find this until our last day though.
If you want to walk into the town it's not far to walk and on the way there is a large market selling Balinese handicrafts, clothing, jewellery etc.
Plenty of Restaurant choice in the town and some nice shops. We got a taxi to Kuta one day, it's not that far away but took ages because of the horrendous amount of traffic on all the roads in Bali.
Staff were lovely, friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
966,Everything you would want and more,50,January 2020,"Luxury 5 star accommodation just a short step from the centre of Seminyak. You are a few steps from the main mall, and bar streets. Housed in two locations across the street. Quiet, modern , immaculate tendered gardens. Lovely pool area , nice bars , one poolside, one pool bar, and one in the main building that hosts free afternoon tea and cakes at 3pm every day. The welcome and the level of service is the best you would get in any hotel anywhere. Breakfast is served in two different restaurants, one is a buffet style and one on the beach is by order, both options have lots of options and the quality is very good. We ate evening meals on the beach restaurant two or three times, and the food is excellent, I plumped one night for the 1Kg Cowboy steak and was not dissapointed at all. Staff go above and beyond to answer any questions, arrange taxi's or trips or to arrange food to be delivered to the room, if they know one of you is not well. The level of care and attention is lovely. We witnessed two weddings at the hotel during our visit, in the stunning hotel beachside chapel, and witnessed the extremely high level of care and attention the hotel staff put into the wedding prep. The street immediately outside has a number of Supermarkets, restaurants and a local market. I would certainly reccommend Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa to anybody.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
967,Infernity to Indian Ocean,50,April 2019,"Superb located luxery hotel directly to the ocean. Very good service and kind staff.
Beutiful garden, infernity pool with nice bar. Restaurants with the most fantastic view.
Rooms are large and very well equiped.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
968,Best Resort Experience Ever!,50,February 2020,"Along with thousands of other people, we were unfortunately stuck in Bali on 24 March trying to get a re-entry visa back into Singapore where we reside. With borders shut, stress levels at max and Nyepi coming up, we decided to book into this hotel as we have previously stayed here and knew it was safe and also familiar. It‚Äôs a 5 star resort, the grounds are amazing, the pool is spectacular and the staff phenomenal. From the moment we arrived, Jean Paul the Resort Manager appeared to greet us at reception and was interested in our story and what we were actually doing in Bali as the island was deserted. We explained our predicament, and the kindness and empathy this gentleman showed us, is something we will remember for the rest of our lives. We were in limbo having to wait for a decision on our re-entry visa application and we were stressed and anxious. He could not do enough for us. He upgraded us to a spectacular ocean suite and from there things just got better. We were there for 3 days and there were other guests in the resort stuck in similar situations who literally could not get home. We did not leave the resort at all (due to Nyepi, plus everything is shut) and spent our days by the pool waiting for a response. Jean-Paul would come around and visit every couple of hours, ask if we had any updates and generally make sure we were ok. He constantly asked if we needed anything or if he could help in any way. During this time of madness, his calmness and compassion was what kept us sane. He did this with all the guests who were stuck and trying to get home. So Jean-Paul, we are fans of yours, we are fans of the hotel and we come to Bali 2 or 3 times a year and you now have 2 very loyal customers. We will not stay anywhere else. Now Head Chef Josh, exactly the same. Amongst all this madness, he made us feel relaxed, safe and took time out of his day to see how we were doing. Most importantly, Josh cooked us amazing food... As I said, we did not leave the resort and his food was spectacular. Everything was fresh tasting and light and delicious. We were in Bali for 3 weeks and definetely without a doubt the best food we had. Standout dishes were the bbq prawns, beef, the fish and for breakfast, you cannot go past the bubble and squeak. It was all amazing. So Josh, as soon as the world gets back to normality, we are coming back to Bali to have your seafood bbq extravaganza...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
969,Sublime,50,March 2020,"We cannot fault this resort hotel ! From start to end of our stay the facilities, the staff, the villa we stayed in ...everything was perfect and way beyond our already high expectations!
Congratulations to jean-Paul Slap and his first class team throughout the hotel, you made our stay truly relaxing and memorable in such luxurious surrounds.
If you‚Äôre thinking about what room, don‚Äôt hesitate and spoil yourself in the beach villas, pricey but I guarantee you will not regret a penny !!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
970,A Class Act!,50,March 2020,"We had made the mistake of booking a villa via Air BnB for a week near Seminyak Beach. The villa was just awful and we left after one night. My wife and I had been to Bali numerous times and I wanted to check out a few of the hotels on the beach in Seminyak and near La Luciola restaurant. The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa was the first we tried. We walked in and explained our situation to the desk clerk. While we were speaking with the clerk, one of the managers, Wayan, approached us and spoke with us. My wife and I were a bit stressed out as we were unsure whether Air BnB would assist us with a refund (and still trying to sort that out weeks later!) and that any alternative lodging would impact our travel budget. Wayan offered us a walk-in discount and showed us several rooms types/locations. We chose a Garden view room that also provided a peek of the surf. This was such a good decision to stay at The Seminyak! The room was spacious, well-appointed and comfortable. All sorts of wonderful amenities at The Seminyak; including a sumptuous breakfast and afternoon tea. The Infinity pool was just wonderful and provided plenty of lounges with umbrellas. The restaurants provided tasty Indonesian and Mediterranean cuisine. The staff at The Seminyak were top-notch! They were well-trained and engaging. Our stay at The Seminyak was blissful and we will return the next time we are in Bali. Perhaps a bit more expensive than some others, but we definitely received what we paid for. Terima Kasih!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
971,A great exclusive Retreat in Seminyak,50,March 2020,"This great property is part of the exclusive worldwide chain ‚ÄúSmall luxury hotels of the World‚Äù . The property is strategically located in the heart of Seminyak on one side and on the other side right on the beautiful sandy beach. This is a real boutique hotel with super personalized service starting from the welcome until you are checking out. The hosts knows your name and that makes the difference. We had a warm welcome by the Belgian Resort Manager Mr. Slap who was so courteous and also has upgraded our room to the wonderful ocean suite. He was always walking around making sure everything is in perfect condition. The room was huge with direct sea view and a nice jacuzzi with tv and a window overlooking the ocean . His and Hers wash basins are a great idea. Walk in wardrobe, great balcony with comfortable loungers. The spa is a must place to visit , with nice sauna and jacuzzi and also a great array of Balinese spa treatments. High tea is provided complimentary to All guests from 3 to 5 pm . Breakfast is served by the beach and at the main restaurant. By the beach is an ala carte menu with super yummy dishes, healthy bowls and smoothies.

972,"Awesome stay, beautiful resort, great food and a lovely team of staff",50,February 2020,"We stayed here for only one night, it was our third stay. Everything was fantastic. The service is great and the staff are so courteous and friendly. We drank aperitifs at the Klass & Brass whisky & wine bar and we dined at the hotel's Sanje Restaurant beside the beach, the ambience is romantic, the sea & coastline views are glorious, and the food was delicious. When the staff found out that we were celebrating my partner's birthday, they produced a cake from nowhere, brought it to our table and sang ""Happy Birthday"". In fact the location was so spectacular that we went back to Sanje for a fabulous a la carte breakfast in the morning. Of course one night isn't long enough, but we'll be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
973,Absolute paradise,50,February 2020,"Just returned home from a blissful week staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. What can I say, it was heaven on earth. Greeted on arrival with a flower garland and cocktail along with a lovely surprise that we had been upgraded to an ocean side room. The room itself is huge with the most comfortable bed and a beautiful terrace. All the staff were so lovely and welcoming, we were treated like VIPs. The food in the restaurant was delicious, particularly at breakfast where there was an amazing spread alongside a la carte menu selections - highly recommend the eggs benedict! Complimentary afternoon tea was a nice touch. The infinity pool overlooking the beach was just beautiful, particularly at sunset. We tried out the spa too and it was just a heavenly relaxing experience, yes it‚Äôs more expensive than the treatments offsite you can find but you get what you pay for! All in all an amazing week in the incredible island of Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
974,Lovely stay,50,February 2020,"I was stayed for 3 days. And it was awesome, I would thank to the concierge Arif he‚Äôs so helpful.

975,Big spacious villa,50,February 2020,"Service from check in to check out is really good.
Stayed in the villa facing the beach. Villa is big enough to have a party with outdoor dinning area. Pool is big. Good spacious room with twin sinks in the toilet and separate bathtub and shower.
Comes with breakfast, at either restaurants.
Had breakfast with beach view which is the best choice!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
976,A must stay whilst in bali,50,January 2020,"On first entering this hotel by car you are met by security to check your car very thorough but quick, once into reception we where treated bu staff giving us garlands and a red flowers for my wife as I informed them it was out 52nd wedding anniversary before arriving. We the had a very cool drink which was very welcoming. Once checked in we where shown our room which was very well laid our and plenty of space, a huge bathroom with glass window looking into the lounge, but can be closed off twitch a blind.
We had breakfast included and an extensive range of food to choose from whether it was a full cooked or just cold meats and cheese as well as cereal.
We did not bother to eat out instead we opted to eat in the hotel twice eating at the beech return to overlooking the sea what a romantic setting and the Greek fish and chips where excellent it was that good we had is twice. We celebrated new year with a buffet meal in the main restaurant a very good meal with all the trimmings and an added bonus was the loin dance display it really enhanced our dinning experience as well as good value for money.
The pool area was well laid out with a large infinity pool as well as a smaller pool with a swim up bar all very clean and well kept.
I cannot pick out one member of staff as all where polite and curteous, from the trainees
In the resturant to the experienced members all made us feel welcomed everybody we passed what ever their job spoke very impressed.
A nice touch was the management drinks for an hour to meet the senior team.
Would I come again like a shot.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
977,Luxurious resort,50,January 2020,"A luxurious resort with a fabulous infinity pool overlooking the Seminyak beach. We spent many hours just enjoying the pool and the view. The beach wing room was very comfortable and overlooked the central garden area. The bed was super comfortable, which of course is important! The staff were lovely, without exception. The buffet breakfast was great with a large selection of food, and also the a la carte menu at the beachside cafe. This cafe was open for breakfast and dinner (when it was not too windy) and was a fabulous spot to chill.
The Kahyangan Spa was a highlight of our visit, with the hot stone massage and the remedial massage both experienced.
The only disappointment of our visit to the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa was the restaurant‚Äôs nightly meals, with only a few people eating there each night.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
978,Excellent Hotel Seminyak - very few kids,50,February 2019,"Our second stay at this great hotel in Seminyak. Spacious rooms. Comfy beds. Fantastic linens. CLEAN air in the rooms, The hotel is in a great location in close proximity to spas and restaurants. Great staff. Amazing infinity pool. Will return again and again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
979,Wonderful base in Seminyak and for New Years Eve,50,December 2019,"This hotel is beautiful, we had a wonderful driver collect us from the airport and he gave us cold water and refreshing towels in the car which was lovely after an 18 hour journey from London! The hotel staff were amazing, really welcoming and they upgraded our room which was much appreciated as we never get complimentary upgrades! This was special as it was my husband's birthday soon too. The hotel and room was gorgeous, really spacious and the bathroom was lovely. The staff were so friendly and helpful, such brilliant service. The NYE party was fun, and the food was delicious! Great choice for dinner and breakfast was great, they catered to all dietary requirements for us and were so kind and caring. I recommend this hotel which is on the beach, has a fab pool and easy to walk into town. Thank you for an amazing first time in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
980,Utterly Phenomenal,50,January 2020,"As soon as we arrived, we were greeted with all-round smiles, welcome garlands and a beautifully decorated reception area. I was amazed that the check in process happened in the room we were staying in! And what a room it was. We booked the beach-view villa and it was incredible, I highly recommend staying in the villas rather than the normal hotel rooms. The villa is stunning, modern and spacious, with your own private infinity pool and butler service. Truly one of the best ""rooms"" I've had the privilege to stay in. Breakfast has a good spread and the two restaurants offer great food. Be sure to try the traditional nasi goreng or mie goreng dishes. We also attended the Fisherman's night, which had a great variety of grilled seafood. The hotel is smaller than others in Bali, but this just means that everything is a bit more personal, private and quiet, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Finally, the hospitality is the best that I have ever experienced from anywhere in the world. The staff are genuinely helpful, always smiling and looking for ways to make sure you are comfortable and happy. You would expect this from a 5 star hotel but they go above and beyond the call of duty. Truly exceptional.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
981,Not a 5-star resort,20,January 2020,"I won‚Äôt consider it as a 5 stars resort, when compare it with other 5 stars resorts that I have stayed before in Bali. I‚Äôll give it 3 or max 4 stars!

Staff are extremely nice and friendly and pool area is good. The afternoon tea is also very thoughtful.

Issues:
There are about 30 rooms across the road from the main building and our room happened to be there (5109), every time in order to get to the main building for breakfast, pool, beach, restaurants, etc, you need to cross a very busy road which is not acceptable. You can also use a golf cart which I have never heard of using them on public roads (anyhow I don‚Äôt believe safety is main priority there as even my desk lamp wire had doggy tape on it that is unacceptable by any developed countries standards)
Breakfast is very average and we didn‚Äôt enjoy the buffet area especially when flies are all over the place, couple of occasions we went to W hotel for breakfast.
Lobby area is like a 3-star hotel.
Our garden view room didn‚Äôt have any view really.
Hotel is located in an extremely busy area, traffic is extremely bad and walking also is very difficult due to many motor bikes driving on the sidewalk ! I personally prefer Nusa Dua better. Overall not value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
982,Seminyak hotel and Resort,50,January 2020,"What a stunning gorgeous resort.

983,excellent,50,December 2019,"beautiful stay for our 25th wedding anniversary. staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. pools, bars and restaurants were excellent. we stayed in the garden wing across the road and our room was lovely although smelt a bit mouldy the first couple of days. early December is a quiet time for them so we had many facilities to ourselves. priceless.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
984,Shocking,10,January 2020,"Walked in off the beach for New Year and paid $10 for a water. Almost collapsed at the price for 700ml of water which costs 20c in the mini market.

Atmosphere was shocking with one token drunk girl on the floor.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
985,Friendly and totally relaxing,50,July 2019,"Booked a last minute trip to Bali with partner and her 2 20yo children. Stayed in the resort annex across road from main resort and beach side pools. While it could have been nice to have been on main side it was just a 1 minute walk to resort. Cost of annex was significantly less. Rooms very well appointed (a/c, decent sized bathroom, safe, etc), cleaned daily w an early evening refresh. Food was of very high quality and varied. Two pools on the beach side and one at the annex. Cannot fault location and ambiance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
986,The best hotel so far,50,November 2019,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa was so far the best hotel I stayed at.

Starting from amazing breakfast with loads of choices for vegetarians and vegans. When I‚Äôm away I usually end up eating bread and cheese every day but here we had plenty of plant based delicious products like tofu or tempeh, fresh fruit and juices, delicious bread and cakes and jamu shots which were just amazing.
Swimming pool was always clean, towels were fresh and there was no trouble in finding free sun beds at any time of the day. Gym is very well equipped. Morning yoga class is great, the teacher (I think her name was Citra) was so much better than the one in my local yoga studio.
Our room was spacious and really nice. The air conditioning works without any problems, tv has loads of channels, the bathroom was very big and nice. The room service comes twice a day, so your room is constantly clean and tidy. I loved those little treats they‚Äôre leaving for you every evening.
The hotel staff is the best ever. Everyone is so polite and tries to help you with everything. They will order a taxi, bring the iron and even help you cross the street - everything with a big smile on.

From the negatives I would only say that the bar is rather expensive.
Also the spa treatments are definitely very dear, considering that you only have to walk 5 minutes down the road to get the same massage literally five times cheaper.

Overall I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place for couples on their honeymoon, it was great!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
987,Beyond Incredible: Honeymoon,50,December 2019,"This hotel is beyond amazing in every way. The service was incredible. We went on our honeymoon our villa hosts, Oka and Windu were there for everything we needed before we even asked for it. They couldn‚Äôt of been better. We had a dinner at the hotel and Dedi our waiter was amazing, so kind and friendly. These people go above and beyond to make sure that you have your best possible stay. Without them the hotel wouldn‚Äôt be what it is. I highly recommend staying at this hotel you will not regret it. We were terribly sad to leave this beautiful place filled with beautiful people. The best experience in the service industry I‚Äôve ever had!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was simply perfect.
Our ocean view suite was next level amazing!! The spa, amenities and cleanliness of the rooms each day was perfection!
We loved the infinity pool overlooks the beach and is a perfect spot to view the amazing sunsets!
They left a beautiful bouquet of red roses as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary which we though was such a nice touch.
Although everyone we met at the resort were super, our stand out guy was Dedi!!! Such a sweet heart who treated us so well and provided service like no other!
Thanks to all the staff at The Seminyak, we can‚Äôt wait to come back with the kids real soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I cant recommend this hotel highly enough",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

993,Great stay,50,December 2019,"Stayed at this hotel in May...we were not disappointed! Great rooms, lovely pools and right on the beach! We only ate in the hotel a few times, but what we had was excellent! Security crossed us over the road every morning...nothing was too much trouble!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
994,Blissful holiday,40,November 2019,"Have just come back from 8 days at the Seminyak Beach Resort. What can I say a beautiful resort. From check in to check out the staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful or happy, the smiling was infectious!

Having read previous reviews of the garden Vila‚Äôs I was apprehensive about what to expect. I shouldn‚Äôt have worried. Yes it‚Äôs not within the main hotel area but it‚Äôs less than 5 min walk to it where you can use all the facilities. For me the amount of time I spend in the room it really didn‚Äôt matter. The room was spacious and clean. We had a problem with the air conditioning not going below 23 degrees but eventually this was sorted but did take a couple of days.

Highlights of the resort:
- The breakfasts at both Santan (buffet) and Sanje (by the beach) were fantastic, particularly our morning juma shot!
- the staff by the infinity pool, regularly asked if you wanted a drink and cleaned your sunglasses. There is free fruit infused water dotted around the pools.
- the infinity pool just stunning with views of the beach
- close proximity to the main streets in Seminyak for bars and restaurants but still feeling like you‚Äôre in a quiet oasis
- the spa, I had a Balinese massage which was just wonderful

Improvements for the resort:
I can‚Äôt think of any!!

A wonderful place to rest and recharge",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
995,The best experience,50,November 2019,We came to this hotel for our honeymoon and we where not disappointed. Everything was perfect. The staff and service provided was amazing. The staff are ready to help with anything. Would definitely come back and would recommend it to anyone who is coming to Bali.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
996,A great beachfront resort,50,November 2019,"We knew we were in for a special treat from the moment we arrived, as we were welcomed by the staff who put frangipani bouquets around us. The foyer and reception are really beautiful but wait until you get to your room. Wow, it was so big, airy and clean and a wonderful sea view. There's a jacuzzi in the bathroom and had views of the ocean. Everything in the room was great except the placement of the light switches. Hunting out the correct switch was a daily frustration, especially at night time.
The pool (there are 2 pools but this was the big one) was the best thing. It's an infinity pool and it overlooks the beach, which was also a good and clean beach. The beach was very clean and patrolled by lifesavers. The pool beds are so comfortable and the drink service is very attentive.
We had 4 days there. It was just a relaxing holiday tp rcharge ourselves, and this was the perfect setting.
Breakfast was quite amazing. There is buffet style but not extensive like you find in the big 5-star hotels but was good. The healthy menu is also included and there's a good choice of eggs and fresh juices too.
Very highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
997,Got engaged here!,50,November 2019,"We stayed here 4 nights and was more than amazed about this hotel. We stayed at 4 different five stars hotels during our stay here and this was the best hotel we visited. I was so impressed by this hotel I decided to propose to my girlfriend at this hotel.

We stayed at the beach wing room. I would recommend staying on the main property as the lowest priced room is in a building across the road. Although you can use all the facilities in the main hotel on the beach, staying on the main property gave you that resort feeling. It is a medium sized hotel compared to other hotels but I believe this is what makes it better. The staff has the time to make each guest feel special rather than in a larger hotel where service sometimes gets lost.

I was highly impressed by the check in process. I studied hotel management and have very high standards when it comes to hotels as I notice every single detail. However, the check in process was text book perfect and made us feel immediately on holiday.

The rooms were very beautiful with a mix of modern Balinese. You could see they constantly renovate the rooms and keep them up to date. They were renovating the room next door but we did not notice a thing. But it was good to see they were maintaining the property. Additionally, room service was very clean. He even rolled up our cables, left beautiful towel designs, and hand written notes thanking us for our stay. A nice extra touch.

There are multiple restaurants on the property. But our favorite was the restaurant on the beach. We had breakfast and dinner here. I recommend the burrito for breakfast, best breakfast burrito I‚Äôve ever had. And 3 times a week they serve all you can eat BBQ seafood for dinner. This included lobsters, scallops, prawn, sushi, and many more. Absolutely amazing idea with a competitive price.

The pool is exactly what you look for in a beach hotel. Infinity pool right on the beach that just makes you want to stay at the hotel all day. They were also serving BBQ lunch throughout the day by the pool. What more can you want!

Shoutout to Lina, who served us during our candlelight dinner when I proposed to my girlfriend. She helped made the night perfect. Nonetheless, all the staff were very well trained and showed professionalism and service beyond that what you expect from a five star hotel.

My only critic would be the cocktails which could use some updating. The ingredients seemed a little watered down. I understand alcohol is very expensive in Indonesia but I think this could use some improvement. Other than that, I can only recommend this hotel. I have stayed at many of the beach front hotels in seminyak but this has been my best experience so far. A must book!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
998,An absolute recommendation,50,November 2019,"We had a fantastic and excellent 7-day stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort &Spa.
Very tasteful and stylish premises, beautiful gardens, the infinity pool area is absolutely unique, we will never forget the view from there, especially the sunsets.
Each and every single one working there was making his/her very best efforts to create an unforgettable experience for us, the Seminyak team easily accomplished that with us by their outstanding friendliness and support.
Further, food and beverage provides excellent variety and quality.
The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is an oasis of calmness, beauty and peace right in the middle of busy Seminyak village, we wholeheartedly recommend a stay there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
999,Honeymoon,50,October 2019,"We stayed here for 5 nights (Wed 2nd Oct to 7th Oct) for the first part of our honeymoon.

Our stay was exceptional. There are so many aspects that were great. The pool, the views, the cleanliness, the amazing massage, the drinks, the hotel itself and the amazing rooms. This was all made perfect by the fantastic staff. The welcoming smiles and ambience of this place is second to none. My partner and I felt so relaxed. The place also smells great!! This hotel was the closest thing to perfection for us and was the highlight of our honeymoon.

We stayed at the hanging gardens of Bali for a few nights before flying back (it was double the price) but not as good as The Seminyak.

Thank you for making our honeymoon so perfect and sorry we didn't review sooner!! We will definitely be back!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1000,All with a smile,50,November 2019,"I spent two nights on my own at the resort. Before arriving there was a complication with my reservation (my fault). The hotel staff kindly worked with me to re-arrange.
The grounds are perfect and luxurious. I found everything to be very clean. The beach and facilities were also excellent. While the food quality wasn‚Äôt quite gourmet it was all very good. You‚Äôre also located to one of the main strips in Seminyak so you can easily walk to decent food and bars.
I really enjoyed the Escape to Badung excursion with my wonderfully friendly guide Wira.
I also had a top notch massage before leaving.
While it is pricey it was worth it and I would definitely stay here again. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1001,What can I say ‚ù§,50,September 2019,"They say that it's not the place but the people....in thi hotel it's both. I have just been in heaven and met the most wonderful people at this fantastic Hotel. I cannot fault it.
Hope to be back next year x",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1002,disaster,10,November 2019,"my husband surprised me for our honeymoon to 5 nights in ubud bali which i loved. then another 5 nights in The Seminyak beach resort and spa villa. We arrived on sunday 3rd november, initially the villa was beautiful and they laid out roses on the bed and in the bath. It was truly romantic. We jumped into the bathtub and i saw alot of tiny ants scurrying along the edges. We immediately got out and to my horror i saw thousands of these ants crawling over my husbands back, we ran into the shower to wash these ants off. i called reception who sent someone down and we realised the all the flowers had bugs, in the bath and on the bed, even a caterpillar on my pillow. The employee called the manager and everyone was apologetic we were then moved to the villa with an ocean view. The employees sealed the bathroom garden doors with cellotape. In the morning we woke up to a few ants in the bathroom which you would expect being in a tropical country...

now the 5th november, my husband and i went to bed around 9, he flicked a massive ant off his arm, and we then decided to go out for stroll.
we came back and completely shattered at this point, we were to go sleep.
i went to the bathroom, i saw a couple of massive ants near the shower, again i didnt think much of it, till i had a closer look on the floor and there were hundreds of these massive ants walking around, on the floor, the sinks, the bath, our clothes, the walls, i ran into the bedroom to tell my husband and realised they are also in the bedroom on the floor and walls, i quickly took a video and called reception.
The employee came down and used a lavender bug spray which did nothing so he decided to kill them with his foot... there were a few on the bed which he had to flick off.
The manger came down and said we can move you to another villa. Now at this point being 2am im shattered, my husband is shattered, im cranky as hell, you wouldnt expect this in a 5 star villa, alot of money spent, i came to sleep with my husband not ants... I came to see the view... not ants.

I had a go at the manager and he called up other hotels who were fully booked, i say that loosely as i was not present during his phone calls. But what has boiled my blood was that they would not give us the money back for this horrible place, meaning the nights we would not be here would not be refunded and we would have to pay extra to move to another hotel. the cheek of it!

We ended up moving for the 3rd time to another villa to sleep,
The employees constantly fumigating the villa.
we got into the 3rd villa, i looked around to make sure it was safe to sleep in, then i saw a massive flying cockroach, i had to call reception for someone to get this thing out of the bathroom,

I stayed awake the whole night,

Problem was, the bugs were coming from the drain not the gardens, because the garden doors were all sealed and no crack left...

The manager has decided to give us complementary massages, which does not even come close to how badly this honeymoon that my husband planned for a year, was ruined!!!!

Now lets get onto the breakfast, for those who stay in the villa have breakfast at the ocean front, hardly anyone here, so you would expect service to be fast.
on 6th november the food and service was great
on 7th as i type this today, the service and quality was utterly poor, we took our seats, was asked for drinks, we ordered frappuccino and 3 fruit juices, 10 mins later we were given a cappuccino, this was then corrected, 5 mins later and asked what do we want to order.
Placed our orders, 5 mins later i asked for another frappuccino around 30 mins went by till we got our food. another 10 mins later we got the fruit juices.

we took a bite of the food and left, the cheek of the employee who asked me if i am going to wait for the frappuccino, i was waiting on it for ages, the fruit juices were so weak it was like a very diluted drink. so was the frappuccino didnt get the good coffee hit as i did yesterday....

i walked off back into the villa, to type this all out.

i cant wait to go home tomorrow.

now, the location is good, you have stunning views, the villa layout is lovely with the freezing cold pool....

but the service, the bug issues, i really dont recommend unless you like sleeping and showering with massive ants.

this 5 star villa needs to sort the issues out to allow their guests to enjoy the villa, this place is meant for relaxation, i most certainly felt on edge everyday, it is so upsetting, lack of sleep, lack of appetite, im looking forward to returning to london,

Thank you to this hotel villa for making me miserable",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1003,Amazing honeymoon at The Seminyak!,50,October 2019,My husband and I visited the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for our honeymoon and we had such an amazing experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. They made the effort to learn our names and even surprised me at breakfast on my birthday with a chocolate cake and a Happy Birthday song! The resort is gorgeous and we loved they infinity pool overlooking the beach! Would highly recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1004,Tammy Fisher,50,October 2019,"First time we have stayed at this resort. Totally recommend it. Great service from start to finish. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Clean, large rooms with wonderful views of the ocean. The infinity pool was just beautiful. This is our 4th time to the Seminyak area and we would certainly come back to this resort. üíï",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1005,Thank you!,40,October 2019,"I stayed at the garden wing, room is spa ious and even though it is just across the road from the main wing, you will still get full and warm welcome from all the hotel staff. Breakfast spread fantastic and yummy. They surprised me with a birthday cake left in my room. The staff even know it is my birthday. Memorable stay. Yoga in the morning before breakfast is a must join. Overall the service is excellent and the staff from Security, room service to those
Servers in the restaurants are all so friendly, helpful and always served with smile. Great place to stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1006,"Very, very good",50,October 2019,Really enjoyed our time in bustling Seminyak and the hotel was no exception. Excellent rooms and great service. The location is perfect. Thank you for having us and we will be sure to be back. Definitely recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1007,The perfect escape!!,50,October 2019,"My husband & I visited Bali immediately after a week in Singapore for a work conference. We chose to visit Bali on our way home to Sydney to take some time to relax & reconnect without the kids. We had been sceptical about coming to Bali however The Seminyak most certainly looked after our every need to ensure we made the most of our short kid free escape & left wanting more. Our personal villa hosts Ogy & Windn went above & beyond to take care of us during our stay. We experienced the romantic dinner, massages & stayed in the beach front villa - all exquisite!!
We are already planning when we can stop over in Bali again!! I couldn‚Äôt recommend the resort highly enough. Thank you for making our experience so memorable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1008,Best holiday ever,50,September 2019,"What can we say
From our very early morning arrival we where treat like royalty. From our welcome drink cool towel and fragrant flower chain. We were then taken to our room and everything we could use in the roo. Was explained to us.

Next day our breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic and so was every other days we had breakfast in there. The trainees did a fantastic job.

The breakfast on the edge of the beach is a great setting with fantastic views that will stay in our memories forever. A special mention to Miko I believe was his name whom took time to answer questions we had about the surrounding areas in view. Which we feel is fitting that staff can take the time out to do this. Please pass on our thanks to Miko in particular.

The pool area is clean and the staff are very friendly big thank you to the guys around the pool...lovely touch having our sun glasses cleaned. Lovely to have the frozen jelly, would be nice if it could be offered more often through the day.
Down side is the price of the drinks around the pool we tended to go out for something to eat and drink during the day due to that fact. However the food around the pool was lovely.

We were disappointed about the fisherman's supper I actually thought what we selected was what was being cooked and when it turned up it was over cooked. But we are not one for complaining.

The yoga on a morning is brilliant big thanks to the instructors pushed me further than I have ever been pushed very peaceful and relaxing.

The rooms were immaculate everyday and few little surprises made from towels.

The staff really can not do enough for you and are so so friendly from the security guards maintenance staff right up to management.

May thanks for a great holiday. We will be back may be next year.

1009,A beautiful start to our honeymoon,50,September 2019,"My husband and I stayed at this resort for a few nights during the beginning of our honeymoon. The property was peaceful and lovely -- and you'd never guess that busy Seminyak city was just outside the front gate! The grounds were so well-kept and the pools were beautiful. The staff was also very kind and accommodating. We felt extremely relaxed and pampered the whole time! We loved the free bicycles for guests, and the proximity to the local attractions (shopping, dining, nightlife!). The bed was also super comfortable and the room was spacious and nice. Thanks so much for a beautiful start to our honeymoon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1010,A most relaxing private villa stay,50,October 2019,We stayed at a private villa. With our own personal pool and villa hosts. The grounds are beautiful with easy access to the beach. Hospitality and service staff were top notch. We will be back for more I'm sure.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1011,Perfect 1st week of our Honeymoon,50,October 2019,"We stayed at this hotel for our first week of our Honeymoon, we booked via TUI , Multi centrer holiday - here first week and Maya Ubud for the 2nd week.

After a long flight from the UK, with delays we was greeted so very warmly at the Seminyak. Instantly we could see how friendly the staff were here. They couldn‚Äôt do any more for us :)

Our room was exceptional and we had a few gifts from the Hotel for our Honeymoon - flower bath, already filled up for us, kind mesaages in cards and a towel arrangement.

The bath in the room is amazing, so relaxing and such a great view from the window (our room was Suite with sea view, balcony and whirl pool bath). The room was incredibly spacious to with a large bed, his and her sinks, kitchen area - all that you can ask for in a 5 star hotel.

The breakfast at the buffet restaurant was very good , you can also order of the menu here too. There is a wide range of food and the quality and service never failed. You can also have breakfast at the Sanje restaurant on the beach. We paid for Bed and Breakfast only at the hotel and included at the Sanje is a smoothie, healthy breakfast bowl and a signature dish. A great place for breakfast if you want to sit and look out at the sea.

We stayed by the infinity pool when we spent our days there. There is a shallow part you can enter in to and also deeper parts. The views from the pool are stunning, it is a perfect infinity pool. All of the staff were incredibly attentive by the pool with taking your drinks or food orders which are reasonably priced. There is also a happy are 3 for 2 at 3pm. Often an acoustic player will play from 5pm too.

Dinner wise - we ate at the hotel a couple of times at the Sanje Restaurant where they host a Fishermans night Tues, Thurs and Sat. This 600k IDR per person which is around ¬£30 gbp each and with this you are receiving a glass of complimentary sangria (not quite like a Spanish Sangria though, I have to say!) and a great quality seafood buffet whereby you go to the counter and choose what fresh fish you would like (ie scallops, lobster, bream...) and the staff will then serve this to you - you can also have as many as you like.

On other nights we went out in Seminyak for dinner, This is just around the corner of the hotel. We was worried if it would be safe to go out and 100% it is. There are amazing restaurants that are too good to miss out on in Seminyak.

The spa is like a dream at this hotel , we had the heaven on earth treatment and it truly was what it said on the tin!

Overall this hotel has everything to offer for a 5 star hotel. It is quite small, which we like. The staff are soo friendly and go above and beyond for you. We would definitely come back!

Only things to note / recommend: if we did this again we would have rathered stayed in Ubud first then Seminyak as Ubud is very busy and it would have been better to have a packed week as our first week and then chilled in Seminyak the 2nd as most of the trips are near Ubud so you will find you are busier there.

If you have booked through TUI - it is incredibly difficult to find them once you come out the arrivals at Depansar. When you walk through to exit the airport you will see many people holiding signs up, keep your eyes peeled for one man holding a small TUI sign and your name, there is TUI desk there.

We booked one excursion through TUI and we couldn‚Äôt fault it! The guide was fantastic and the trip was good value for money.

Perfect 1st week of our Honeymoon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1012,"Great location, very good facilities, friendly staff",40,October 2019,"The location of this hotel is superb, close to the Kudeta Beach Club and at the quieter end of town, yet only a short walk from Seminyak Square and the livelier bars. We stayed in Garden Room (with no view) but it was comfortable and no issue accessing the main hotel, nor the pool. Lovely main pool with access to beach and amazing sunsets!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1013,Nice place,40,October 2019,"So the Garden Wing is actually a separate building across the road from the main hotel which was disappointing. There is no mention of that when you are booking the room.
Also I went in school holidays but there were no kids in the hotel except mine. That was also a let down.
As for the room it was clean, serviced daily with all the things you would expect from a resort.
The food and drink was average, and expensive but the staff were friendly.
The pool was the best part.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I thoroughly enjoyed my time by the beachfront pools, swimming, people watching, eating and drinking, sunsets.
The staff around the resort were all fantastic and their attention to detail and smiles was lovely. Our Villa staff Windu, Oka, Rocky and fellow members made our stay that little bit more special. The breakfast staff were kind and friendly and always looking after us with food intolerances.
Thank you all for a wonderful stay and hope to come again one day.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were made to feel welcome and special and individual. Everyone without exception made our stay memorable. The location, the gardens, the room and restaurants were first class. Stepping into the hotel from the busy streets seemed like stepping into another world - so tranquil.
We were very surprised and delighted to have been upgraded on arrival and the bouquet of flowers for our anniversary was just wonderful.
The staff were friendly, approachable and very keen to help in any situation. nothing was too much trouble for any of them.
Thank you all for a holiday we shall never forget.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1016,A truly wonderful stay,50,September 2019,"It was our first trip to Bali, we didn‚Äôt know what to expect. The Seminyak beach and spa resort warmly welcomed us from check in to check out and the resort exceeded our expectations. It was absolutely stunning with pools over looking the gorgeous beach and remarkable sunset. There were many places to eat, with breakfast and afternoon tea included, a spa and gym. You didn‚Äôt need to leave the resort. It had everything! However it was close to all of the markets, Boutique shops, restaurants and night life.

Although the resort itself was amazing the staff truly made our stay. Rupawan in particular who escorted us on one of our day trips and kindly carried and cared for us throughout the day.

We recommend this resort to our friends and family. Thank you for an unforgettable stay.

1017,Bliss,50,October 2019,"Felt like we‚Äôd arrived in heaven, the hotel grounds, pool areas and beach are exquisite. We were in the garden rooms which are across the road from the main hotel, the room was lovely, spacious with a huge bath, shower and dressing area, a large veranda and huge bed. The distance from the building to the main hotel was no more than you would walk in a large hotel, there was also a pool with bar and a reception in the building.
Breakfast was wonderful especially the Eggs Benedict, cooked to order, lush! They also had an array of Asian dishes which to a Scot seemed strange at breakfast.
The main pool area was sublime, plenty of loungers in the sun, covered beds on the greens and tables and chairs on the verandas. Steps took you down to the reserved beach with huge waves crashing on the shore, great for watching the surfers and of course getting exhilarated by the waves.
You quite often saw brides and grooms getting wedding videos shot in the grounds as it is such a dream place.
We had dinner one night, a fish bbq at the beach, you choose as much fish as you wish including lobster, crab, tuna, snapper, prawn and other varieties. The complimenting salads and veg were fresh and tasty. Great choice of desserts and excellent sangria.
Quite sad to leave.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1019,Honeymoon with a View,50,September 2019,"Our stay from beginning to end was nothing short of amazing, the entire hotel staff was attentive and courteous. Even the manager came to greet us before our departure. Highly recommended!!!! The beach was amazing, our room had a swimming pool! Overall just an amazing stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1020,Stunning pool & the best breakfast!,50,September 2019,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 5 nights in mid September 2019 and absolutely loved it!

There are a few highlights.

Firstly the amazing and huge main infinity pool...it's so spacious and tranquil, and the view of the waves crashing onto the beach below is wonderful. Service around the pool is attentive enough and they bring around treats during the course of the day.

Location is pretty much as good as it gets. Obviously it has a prime beachside location, and it is a nice bit of beach by Seminyak standards. It's 10 mins walk to eat street, 10 mins walk in the other direction to several of the current on trend restaurants and cafes, next door to Ku De Ta (but no noise), approx 10-15 mins walk along the beach in either direction to beach clubs and beach bars. Due to its location it also enjoys spectacular sunsets. I was surprised to see how clean the beaches were...I have visited Seminyak before in March and the beach was fairly awful and I know this is related to the rainy season and onshore winds at that time of year. I very much enjoyed early morning beach walks...it is 5km along the beach to the end at Kuta. The sand is mostly fairly hard packed so good for running too.

Breakfast...WOW! This is our new winner for the best breakfast award!You have 2 options for breakfast. In the main restaurant where you have a very extensive self service choice AND also can order from an a la carte menu. Or, you can eat at the beachside restaurant Sanje (from 8am)...where you can choose from a fresh juice, then smoothie bowl and then hot dish. They also provide a complimetary afternoon tea which to be honest very few guests seem to go to. It is all sweet fare, nothing savoury but it is a nice touch nonetheless.

Our room was a standard room, ground floor in the beach wing. It was fairly large although I couldn't say it was particularly luxurious. We had a large outdoor terrace with a day bed (for 1) and another chair...it wasn't the most welcoming set up, I feel they could do more with the space. Housekeeping was good and they'd bring around something tasty each night with turn down service.

Although I think the standard rooms are nothing special, I am fairly sure that we'll be back to once again enjoy all the other positives!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1021,NOT 5 star - sorry,30,September 2019,"Before booking the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, I spent a lot of time
researching which hotel would suit me best for 5 nights in Bali, I read a
load of glowing reviews about how amazing the service was and only read one
review where the poster said that this was NOT a 5-srtar hotel. Sadly, in
my experience I agree with this guy - this hotel does not deliver 5-star
service, the staff are very friendly and polite, just not well trained and
certainly not empowered to make any decisions.

Firstly the positives. The infinity pool and grounds of the hotel are
spectacular, it is really well located and I quite liked the room. The room
is a little tired but the size of the room and the amenities within are very
good. I encountered several issues during my stay which I'll highlight
below, you can then decide if all the gushing reviews are of merit.

I arrived at the hotel quite late in the evening and they asked for a credit
card. I explained I did not possess one but they could open a charge on my
debit card. It was explained to me that this could not happen, for reasons I
am still unclear on. Another member of staff came over and said that if I
could not give them a credit card I was to give them 5 million Rupei in
cash. (Around ¬£300.00 / $400.00) I said to make it easier simply to delete
the line of credit from my room and I would pay as I went - this led to a
third member of staff bartering with me about leaving 1 million in cash. I
was now getting irritated and told him to either check me in or cancel my
reservation and I would go to the hotel next door. I was eventually checked
in but do not know why they don't open a charge on my debit card, every
other hotel I stay in does so including the one I had just left in
Singapore. (which absolutely WAS 5-star). From that point onwards, the
staff practically chased me for payment whenever I ordered anything and they
even emptied my mini-bar. I had paid ¬£300.00 + per night (and it was paid
in advance) to stay here, did they really believe I would disappear for a
¬£3.00 bottle of beer from my mini-bar?

My 1st day at the hotel after the check-in debacle was also not good. I
went to the pool bar (sunk in to the pool) for lunch and some drinks, an
Australian woman came to the bar with her noisy and boisterous child. He
was standing on the actual bar and diving into the pool, no one said
anything but there is a time and a place for kids, and a bar setting isn't
one of them, I was disappointed that they allowed kids to sit at the bar.
(and to use it as a diving board) I removed myself from the bar and lay on a
lounger overlooking the Indian Ocean and was not asked once in 5 hours if I
wanted a drink. I asked for a towel which never arrived and a table in
front of me had dirty glasses on it for 5 hours. As did my side table with
my own empties which no one cleared. There were lots of staff, just not
doing their job. Oh, all the staff have walkie talkies which interrupt the
calm and serene vibe of the place.

As a VIP Expedia member one of my benefits is late check out, so I asked on
Thursday about this: once again the check-in-agent had to check with her
superior and then said I had to go back on Friday. I went back on Friday to
be told I could check out at 2, I asked for 2:30....and this became a bit of
a debacle too so I said ok, just make it 2:00 ! Half-an-hour was too much to
ask apparently?

The worst interaction with the staff came on my last afternoon at the pool.
I ordered a pizza and it was delivered, it was a 6 slice pizza. It tasted of
nothing. Like, nothing. I had 2 slices and the rest was sent back. The
server asked if it was ok and I told him it was not. When it came time to
settle up the pizza was on the bill, I told him that I did not expect a
pizza I didn't eat the majority of to be on the bill and once again he
called over his manager. This guy then starts arguing with me about how
much of the pizza I had eaten, I said to him that I was not going to
embarrass myself and to charge me for it. I also told him that his level of
service to me as a guest was terrible. I'd spent around $250.00 poolside on
cocktails and food throughout the week so I wasn't really fishing for a free
feed.

In fairness to the hotel, the service recovery was good. Eric the F&B
manager called me in my room to ask what was wrong with my pizza, I
explained it wasn't good and then told him of my interaction with the
manager at the pool. He was mortified (he was unaware of this encounter)
and invited me to dinner that night for free. As the food at the hotel was
so hit/miss and it was my last night I declined and went out for steak at
the fabulous Boy n Cow. Eric did refund my bill from that day at the pool
and the next day when I checked out the restaurant manager came to apologise
and gave me a complimentary lunch. (The lunch was excellent too!)

I've never stayed at a hotel before where I was so mistrusted as a guest and
for the 1st time ever I find myself in complete disagreement with the
majority of TripAdvisor reviews of this hotel. Normally I shrug off
negative reviews when they are so in the minority but I wholeheartedly agree
with these negative reviews that if you are used to a 5-star service / hotel
then the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is not for you. There is a culture of
mistrust, the staff are not empowered and overall whilst I loved the
location, the room and that incredible infinity pool, the rest of it spoiled
my vacation. As an aside I went for cocktails at The W one night after a
meal and the service was slick, on-point and professional. I would urge the
management team to spend a day and a night at The W and see how well trained
and slick front-of-house staff should be.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1023,Outstanding Honeymoon,50,September 2019,"Not sure where to start with this resort. It is amazing. From the moment we arrived we was welcomed with frangipani necklaces, cold drink and cold towel. The rooms are very big and well decorated with everything you will need for your stay and if there is anything else you need reception will bring to your room ie iron and ironing board. The grounds are very well kept and so clean as is the Infinity pool which has the most amazing views put across the ocean. The food and drinks are all at a high standard, we ordered cocktails and sangria by the pool everyday and the staff work tirelessly to make sure you have everything you need at all times. There is so many nice touches here as well, like they clean your sunglasses around the pool, bring complimentary frozen jellies, cakes and small sandwiches etc around at different points of the day as well. Arta who cleaned our room during our stay was so good. He would leave us little things each day like towel animals and notes wishing us a good day. Thanks Arta. The staff here are some of the best we have come across they are always smiling and checking you are ok, they always ask how you are and ask you about where you are from.

The hotel is in a great location as well with shops, restaurants, bars and mini marts all within 2 minutes walk either way and is right on the beach which is very handy for long walks down the beach which we did several times. Such a nice walk which ever way you decide to walk

Thanks for a memorable last part to our honeymoon. We will certainly be returning when we come back to Bali",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1024,Our honeymoon ‚ù§Ô∏è,50,September 2019,"I‚Äôve travelled to a lot of places and stayed in some amazing hotels but this is by far my favourite!

I have to start with the staff, they are so consistently polite, pleasant and welcoming in every department; housekeeping, reception, dinner, pool, etc. Thank you so much to Arta who kept our room clean during our stay, we loved coming back to the animal towels and cute little notes, it made our stay. Gita around the pool is kind and chatty! Also thank you to Murdika for cleaning our glasses around the pool, nice touch!

We stayed in the garden wing (I can‚Äôt understand why people moan about this) the room was huge, spacious and modern. Fresh fruit was left in the room and bottled water was replaced daily! The mini bar was well stocked and reasonably priced. We had gowns, slippers and lots of toiletries so don‚Äôt worry about running out of anything, this hotel thinks of everything so that you have the best stay. The beds are so comfy!! The garden wing rooms are located literally a 30 second walk from the main hotel, security are on both entrances morning & night and they help you cross the road. I‚Äôm not sure why other reviewers have made out they are super far away or bad in anyway. We had access to everything and didn‚Äôt feel we missed out at all.

The pool area is just stunning. Every day we managed to get sun loungers no matter what the time. The infinity pool over looks the beautiful sand and sea! The staff are constantly on hand if you need a drink or help with putting your umbrella up/down. They won‚Äôt even let you lay your own towels down! There is fruit flavoured ice cold water available all day, you must try the sangria it was our favourite poolside beverage!

THE BEST BREAKFAST! You can‚Äôt ask for more - everything to make a full English, Indonesian delights, fruits, yoghurts, cereals, croissants, cakes, pancakes, waffles and on top of all that an al carte menu to order from which included things like eggs benedict or smashed avacado on toast. We tried most dishes washed down with cappuccinos and fresh juices and was never disappointed.

We ate at the sanje restaurant for lunch one afternoon & enjoyed the beach view. I‚Äôd highly recommend the fish & chips with the ocean cocktail. We didn‚Äôt eat at either restaurants at night as we wanted to explore locally but we did order room service one night, who knew you could have kebabs and cocktails delivered to your door. Again, the food and drink was amazing. Worth every penny.

I loved the hotels little freebies, I can‚Äôt forget to mention - ice lolly‚Äôs around the pool mid morning, canap√©s given in the afternoon and a knock on your door around 7pm with chocolate treats and biscuits.

We had to check out at 12 but our departure wasn‚Äôt until 545, so that we could enjoy our last few hours properly the hotel allowed us to use the spa facilities to shower and provided toiletries/towels, we had access to our belongings to get ready for the airport properly, after seeing just the changing rooms in the spa I wish we‚Äôd have booked a treatment!

The hotel is in a great location, not far from the airport, next to a shopping centre, good bars & restaurants.

We loved seminyak, this was the third part of our honeymoon and the best. Thank you to this hotel for the most precious memories. We will be recommending this place to all our friends and family and will definitely return for one of our anniversaries.

1025,Beautiful Bali - 5 Star heaven,50,September 2019,"We visited the hotel with a group of friends and it was perfect. We had an ocean view suite as it was our belated honeymoon. The suite was beautiful, the bathroom was stunning with a sunken jacuzzi bath. Fresh fruit was brought to the suite daily. The breakfast is lovely with a choice of 2 restaurants to dine in. The beachfront was my favourite, fresh juices, fruit bliss bowls - like our a√ßai bowls in Australia. The breakfast menu had a large choice and there is a buffet breakfast also.

Poolside lunch menu was great, pizza was delicious and my husband enjoyed the other options, particularly the burger. I liked the vegan delight which was yummy.

The location is central and perfect to walk to Seminyak Square and the variety of bars and restaurants Seminyak has to offer.

The staff are attentive and smile and are friendly and warm. It‚Äôs such a wonderful hotel, 5 Star all the way and we will be back for sure. I couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough. The rest of our party agreed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1026,Absolutely amazing hotel!,50,September 2019,"I would say this is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in! From the minute you arrive you are made to feel so welcome, the staff can‚Äôt do enough for you. We stayed in the garden wing which is separate from the main hotel. Don‚Äôt be put off by that, it‚Äôs literally one minute walk and the rooms are the same so it‚Äôs worth paying a little less. On that note, the rooms are huge and beautifully done with great air con.
The breakfast is fantastic with lots of choice and the spa is well worth a visit.
Make sure to watch the sunset from the infinity pool, it‚Äôs absolutely stunning. Seminyak has some great restaurants, ask the hotel for recommendations, they didn‚Äôt disappoint!
We leave here in 2 days to end our trip in Ubud....I hope the hotel is as great as this place!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1027,Possibly the best hotel I've stayed in,50,September 2019,"This hotel has it all and I only spent two nights there which wasn't enough! The service was excellent, the pool area is stunning and the rooms were beautiful. Only a 10 minute walk into town where there are loads of bustling shops and restaurants/bars, but the hotel itself is tranquil and peaceful. The breakfasts are delicious and you can eat right on the beach front.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1028,Absolutely fantastic place,50,September 2019,"We spent 4 nights of our honeymoon here in one of the beach view pool villas. The villa was superb, and so was the Sanje restaurant right by the ocean where we enjoyed a number of meals & drinks. But the thing that really, really made the difference were the staff who looked after us. From Wyan the driver, to Rocky our villa host & the cleaning team that worked hard to make sure our villa was kept spotless & the mini-bar always full. We would go back in a heartbeat & could have happily stayed longer. Thank you to everyone at the Seminyak for making us feel so special & well looked after",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1029,Compliment,50,September 2019,"I would like to give special compliments to the Resort for being so welcoming and helpful. Special thanks to Rocky and Benny for being such hospitable hosts, for the cute set-ups in the rooms. We look forward to coming back to the villa after our long day out in Bali as they never fail to surprise and amaze us with special decor and complimentary biscuits. The service at the villa was impeccable and I would once again like to give my thanks, to the welcoming and friendly people at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.
I can‚Äôt wait to visit everyone again when I‚Äôm back in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1030,"Great hotel, superb service, outstanding beach front location",50,September 2019,"We stayed here for 8 nights in a suite ocean view room. On arrival the staff greeting & welcome was fantastic - very Balinese friendly. The reception staff are all very happy & knowledgable, a quick tour of the resort meant that our bags were in our room waiting for us.
The room was huge. Great view of the beach & sunset, with a good balcony & great shower. Even had a massive jacuzzi with a view. Point to note - these rooms face the ocean but back onto the road, so the very busy traffic can be heard. The waves drown out most of this though, and we were rarely woken.
The Sanje beach restaurant for breakfast & lunch is a stunning venue above the beach with excellent food & service.
The pool is also outstanding - the look, service & atmosphere all great. The pool team are to be commended - quick to layout towels, get drinks, food, clean your sunglasses....
Good breakfast, we never ate in the hotel for dinner but the menu looked good.
Location wise, the hotel is a 5 min walk to the Main Street in Seminyak, with lots of bars & restaurants & shops. The Ku De Ta beach club is next door and worth a dinner or lunch (expensive for Bali)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1031,warm welcome,40,September 2019,"first time stay at seminyak,warm welcome from the staff at front desk.the check in was very fast.the bellman was great person.he explain all the facility at hotel.the breakfast are great,the staff are friendly and polite.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1032,Only good things here,50,September 2019,"First trip to Bali and chose The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa based on location and other reviews. I can confirm without a doubt that choosing to stay here was the best decision. Location was an oasis away from the hustle and bustle but walking distance to all the hotspots. Facilities, cleanliness and the most accommodating staff I‚Äôve experienced on my travels so far. Special thanks to Ugus for the impeccable cleanliness he left our room in daily and Desi for accomodating our requests with the friendliest of smiles. Poolside service, afternoon tea and breakfast were occasions to look forward to thanks to the delicious food and friendliness of all staff. Highly highly recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1033,Wonderful...........,50,September 2019,"We stayed at this resort from 7th September 2019 to 12th September 2019 after 4 nights staying in Ubud at The Alila.

We booked an ocean view suite and were given suite 2312, the view from this room was good but I can see that in a few years time the view will be obscured by the growing palm trees.
We could not fault our room, clean, excellent amenities, loads of extras ( too many to mention) all of a quality that you would expect from this resort - first class!!
The breakfast is also first class, buffet style with specials to order at the table and these change daily, there‚Äôs an egg station so you can have freshly prepared eggs to your liking. The buffet has loads of choice to suit anyones taste or preference. Afternoon tea was included, 3pm to 5pm, we only had this once for no other reason than we were content by the pool or out on the beach the afternoon tea was what it says it is, tea of your choice ( or coffee) and sweet or savoury nibbles.
There are two pools an infinity pool that faces directly onto the beach, just beautiful and the Sanje pool, this is a smaller pool with a swim up bar,the pools are clean, drinks and food are available at both pools that are charged to your room. There is even a member of staff that comes around and offers to clean your sunglasses ( no charge) a very nice touch indeed.
The only slight negative about the location of the pool and sun bed location being so close to the beach that from time to time you can get pestered by beach traders walking up and down the beach trying to sell items to you, their friendly enough but can be a bit of a nuisance when trying to relax and sun bathe. Just a pleasant but firm ‚ÄúNo thank you‚Äù seems to move them on to the next guest.
The resort is centrally located, walk out the hotel (road side)turn left and a five minute walk you are at a flea market , local eating places were you can have cooking lessons (Balinese style) walk further along the road (10 mins) and you get to Seminyak village, stylish shopping and eateries.
Walk out the hotel and turn left and after about 10 minutes you will get to some great eating places / roof top bars (motel Mexicano is good but do book night before to avoid being disappointed) walk further past the temple on the left and after another 10 minutes you find Potato head - a sort of beach club ( look it up on trip advisor) worth a visit but do look out for a little sign on the road as it easily missed.
Walk out of the hotel onto the beach and turn right, after 15 mins you will find Mano‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a kind of beach club, go in your swimwear as there is a small pool, you can drink , eat & swim , leave the hotel onto the beach and turn left, walk for 15 to 20 minutes at you will find beach bars / casual eating places where you can get a coffee or something stronger if that your fancy and sit on the beach in a beanbag , very casual and laid back style

The staff are what makes the difference at this hotel, they always go ‚Äúabove & beyond‚Äù they are first class, every single member of staff that you pass greets you and enquires how your day is going, now my wife can talk for ever so we had to set off from our room half an hour earlier than we needed to as she would stop and talk to them all üòÇüòÇ

We have been to Bali twice now and stayed at four different hotels and we can safely say that this is the best hotel/resort that we have stayed in while at Bali from check in to check out and everything in between it really is worth every cent/ penny you spend on it
Hotels can be just ‚ÄúBricks, cement, fixtures & fittings‚Äù but this is much, much more it has a life and ambiance that stands it head and shoulders above the rest that is brought to life by the wonderful staff
Thank you to all the staff & management for creating such a wonderful environment

1035,Superb resort,50,September 2019,"Since 1988 my wife and I had stayed at practically all international ‚Äòbranded‚Äô resorts in bali.

This time i intentionally wanted to try something outside of my previous norm of looking for properties based on their internationally known name.

Thus the Seminyak.

Conclusion: it was a wonderful discovery.

About location, its one of the best. The property is so nice and well maintained. The staff are so friendly and yet professional at the same time. Obviously that reflects the success of the GM in running this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1036,Pure bliss,50,August 2019,"What a wonderful hotel and place this is, everyone is so friendly and cannot do enough for you as they want to make your stay as comfortable and relaxing as they can.
Set in beautiful grounds which are maintained to a high standard, the infinity pool is absolutely superb looking out to the sea. The rooms are fantastic, spotless and extremely comfortable. The buffet breakfast is fabulous, seriously if you moan at what is on offer then you seriously have an issue. The pool food, drinks and service is the best I have even had, I even had my sunglasses cleaned once a day, a refreshing ice lolly is also served to you which is a nice touch. The afternoon tea is very good as well and after a big breakfast and skipping lunch is just what was needed at that time, this is served between 3pm - 5pm, the cakes are very good and not the same day after day.
The location is excellent and within 5 mins walk of the main Seminyak drag or if you turn left out of the hotel and walk for another 5 mins you come to some more fantastic bars and restaurants which are really worth going to.
We didn't want to return home as we loved staying here and in Bali, so it won't be a surprise for you to hear that we would return to The Seminyak Beach resort in a heartbeat on our next trip to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1037,Amazing!,50,September 2019,Went back and forth about staying at the W Hotel Bali and Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa and ended up booking at W. What a mistake! Spent one night and W and realized it was not what we were looking for. Very commercial and busy. Checked out after one night and moved to Seminyak and OH BOY- should have been here from the start. From the time we drove in until the villa assistant saw us off. The experience was FIVE STAR. Every detail well thought out and service was amazing.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1038,Amazing,50,August 2019,"This place is absolutely beautiful. The pool is huge overlooking the ocean.

1039,Honeymoon,50,August 2019,"My wife and myself had an absolutely wonderful time in the resort. We stayed in an Oceans View Pool Villa in the time from 20.-28.8.19 and really enjoyed the great service, good breakfast buffet and delicious dinner events. The villas come with and exeptional good villa host service, greatings to Rocky, Windu, Ogy and team. They are extremely customer focused and did everything to make the stay even more comfortable and relaxed. In room service, also for cocktails is 24/7 and we were happy to take advantage of that. We would highly recommend this resort for couples seeking for the absolute best honeymoon experience, especially the villas, as they do include extra services. Looking forward to repeat this great experience hopefully soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Fantastic choice and quality. Will definitely return to the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa when next in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1041,Memorable stay,50,August 2019,"An incredible experience at The Seminyak. Probably the best staff we‚Äôve ever experienced. They are always smiling and friendly, you are made to feel so welcomed and not just a number like at many other hotels. The room was stunning and the hotel grounds are so well looked after. The beautiful infinity pool really made you feel like you are in paradise. Thanks again and we will most definitely return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1042,Wonderful stay,50,July 2019,"It was a stunning resort for us to stay and enjoy the friendly services. It is just next to the beach, such a wonderful location. We loved to watch the sunset from the pool and also stunning view from the room. Highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1043,Amazing setting and lovely rooms,50,August 2019,We enjoyed a relaxing stay in this idyllic location. The rooms were really high quality but would benefit from mosquito nets. The ocean view rooms are obscured by palms trees which is a shame. It would make a real difference for the grounds staff to keep on top of these. The pool bar was great including the great burgers and pizzas. We would definitely like to return. It is a fantastic location for a wedding.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1045,"The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa..
Simply sensational",50,August 2019,"My 4th visit to one of Bali's finest. Great value, exceptional staff, wonderful restaurants. First class pools in both Beach Wing and Garden Wing. Beautifully maintained gardens. Can't wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1046,Beautiful hotel,50,August 2019,"My husband and I recently spent a week here on the final leg of our honeymoon and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here at The Seminyak Beach Resort. We received a warm and friendly welcome and were given an unexpected upgrade on arrival from our garden wing room to the ocean wing, which was brilliant. Our room was spacious, clean and had all the amenities, as well as a lovely view overlooking the pool and a glimpse of the sea. If I was to visit again, I would definitely book a room in this block as the garden wing is across the road so I wouldn't want to have to come across to use the pool.

All the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, particularly those round the pool. The pool is the wow factor for this hotel - a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach. However, the music definitely needs sorting! We must have listened to a cover Adele album about 100 times through the week.

We actually found the beach surrounding our hotel to be one of the nicest spots along the coastline (we walked along in both directions and found other spots to be overcrowded or not as pretty but the area in front of the hotel is quiet and beautiful).

We enjoyed breakfast in the main restaurant each morning, which is buffet style with eggs to order. We did find service a little slow at breakfast, but I think this was due to the time when we went, as it was often at its busiest between 9 and 10. We also had food which you can order around the pool during the day. This was always great quality and really tasty.

The location of this hotel is brilliant. It is within walking distance the main street (5-15 minutes depending where you go), but is far enough way to not feel too in the midst of the business of it all. We also walked along the beach from Kuta one day (about 40 minutes) and it is only 10-20 minutes walk if you wanted to visit the beach clubs like Potato Head or Finn's.

I would say this hotel is ok in terms of value for money. During the day, we either had water (which is free) or Radlers so was relatively cheap anyway. However, they do have happy hour 3-5 but it is buy 2 get 1 free on about 3 cocktails. As much as I'm glad this isn't the kind of hotel where it's just unnecessary drinking, it would have been nice to have a few more offers to enjoy a few more cocktails in the afternoon, as otherwise they are quite expensive to have more than one or two.

Nonetheless, we felt completely relaxed and it was a perfect end to our honeymoon for chilling and enjoying the sunset every evening from the beautiful grounds. It was also nice to be able to use the spa facilities (jacuzzi and sauna) on our final evening as we had a late return flight and had already checked out, so this helped us chill out a bit before then. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1047,AMAZING!,50,March 2019,"Can't recommend this hotel enough to anyone staying in Seminyak.

We visited with our 2 year old in March this year for a week. We stayed in a garden view room right by the pool/restaurant end.

The service at this place is amazing, all the staff are so friendly and went above and beyond with our little girl too. She loved the freshly made smoothies at the pool bar every day!

The rooms are plentiful, good minibar selection and always kept spotless. The spa was lovely and the grounds were always well maintained.

Breakfast buffet selection was enormous with plenty of local cuisine.
The only time we ate dinner was the seafood night on the beach which was amazing. Great food and service at lunchtime on the beach restaurant too. We even took advantage of the afternoon tea one rainy afternoon!

Great location for restaurants and shops nearby all within walking distance of about 15 minutes. Recommend Bambou and Hotel Mexicola!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1048,MR JOJO,50,August 2019,"Wow!! What an awesome experience. It took me 17hours from the UK to get to Bali and I must say it was absolutely worth it. The Beach resort in Seminyak is beautiful and the breakfast is amazing. My stay here would not of been the same without great staff like Ogy, Rocky and Oka. They made me and my girlfriend feel so welcomed and really looked after us. For sure I‚Äôll be returning to Bali and for sure I‚Äôll be staying at the beach resort open villa. You have to pay the price to live the life!.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1049,One word - Perfect,50,August 2019,"We have just returned from a 7 day adult family holiday.
We had the loviest time staying at The Seminyak, from the moment we entered the resort we were made to feel special. Every day the staff would greet us with a warm smile and a lovely greeting.
The hotel is in a perfect position for all the best restaurants, with the traffic a nightmare we could easily walk to all the best places to eat and shop.
Breakfast every morning was a treat with a huge selection.
Poolside was fantastic too, the pool staff could not have been more helpful from laying out our towels, cleaning our sunglasses, putting our umbrellas up and down, supplying food and numerous beverages, all done with a huge smile.
We stayed in a beach side suite which was a great size and was also kept immaculate by the staff.
All in all we had a relaxing stay and felt totally spoilt the whole time.
We loved the included extras, from our daily breakfasts, our 1 hour Bali massage to our comp lunch at the Sanji restaurant.
We would all highly recommend it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1050,One to remember...,50,August 2019,"Spent 6 wonderful nights at this stunning hotel as part of our Honeymoon. We were greeted with a warm welcome from all the staff, a welcome drink, cool flannel and escorted to our room.

The room itself was large and luxurious. We had a flower bath, honeymoon cake, fruit display and towel art on arrival. We loved all the toiletries and especially the London aromatherapy associates shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. Coming from the UK we recognised this high quality brand used in many spas back home. We also enjoyed the nightly ring of the doorbell with a jar of something tasty (biscuits etc). Our only criticism of the room is that it could be on the dark side once the sun had set and additional lighting would be useful for getting ready. Would also be useful to have a socket on both sides of the bed.

The breakfast was a highlight of our stay, we particularly enjoyed Sanje restaurant by the sea with the choice of hot drinks, smoothie bowls, something cooked and a pastry. We always left full to the brim and the food was so fresh and delicious. The complimentary afternoon tea 3-5pm was also a nice touch. We tried the fisherman‚Äôs night dinner on the last evening, not big fish eaters but it was absolutely lovely and an experience in itself with the live singer and guitarist, the 5 star service and the unlimited tuna, lobster, scallops, prawns, squid etc.

The pools and gardens are all immaculate and reflect the 5stars it has been given.

Most of all we want to give recognition to all the staff in the hotel. Not a single member of staff did not say hello when walking past us. Everyone was so warm and friendly. The service they provided was second to none, staff even came around during the day asking you if they can clean your sunglasses!

Thank you so much to all the staff at The Seminyak Resort & Spa, we had an unforgettable holiday and we look forward to returning in the future!

the infinity pool area is fantastic but the rooms are dating staff are fantastic breakfast is great but restaurants need to update there menus otherwise a great location",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1052,Seminyak Hotel family holiday,40,July 2019,This hotel is definitely one of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. The hotel and grounds itself are beautiful and the service is fantastic. The only negative about this hotel is that it doesn‚Äôt have a kids club or any kids activities and the food by the pool is very average and quite expensive. I highly recommend doing the seafood dinner one night during sunset - it is beautiful and the food is great. The hotel is very close (walking distance) to most places which is great and you could walk to Seminyak square in 10 minutes. We would definitely stay there again for our next visit.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1053,Wow! Honeymoon of a lifetime,50,May 2019,"Where do I even start. This beautiful hotel was the last stop on our honeymoon. we travelled here from Ubud. On arrival we was greeted and welcomed by Rocky the villa host, he escorted us to the private air conditioned check in area which was fully loaded with soft & hot drinks, biscuits and other nibbles which he offered us. We was also provided with a welcome drink and a cold towel. We was presented with a garland of beautiful traditional flowers and some fresh water. When all the final details and payment was taken we was then taken to our villa where our luggage had already been taken for us. We was speechless on arrival to our villa. It was so clean & spacious. We was in villa 10, as soon as the door opened the sound of the pool and water feature grabs your attention, it‚Äôs such a private area that it felt cosy and romantic and it wasn‚Äôt overlooked by anyone. Inside the villa the bed was decorated beautifully which continued each day during our stay. The ceiling had traditional wood carvings. The bathroom was to die for and the bath was decorated in red roses in a shape of a heart. We was provided a special candle and some bath salts too. They provide you with some dressing gowns and special silk ones for villa use only. You also get a little bag and hat with a fan for use around the hotel. The villas are large and have ample room to do all that you need to during your stay. Each night we was offered turn down service and they provided us with beautiful treats each night such as a honeymoon cake, cookies etc. The hotel grounds are stunning. The infinity pool was our highlight of the hotel it‚Äôs right on the beach and is so beautiful. They also have a wedding venue at the hotel which is gorgeous. There are two restaurants, one on the beach which has a lighter menu and one indoors where you have breakfast which hosts a larger menu with more traditional Balinese food, both are must try‚Äôs! They host special food nights such as fisherman nights and bbqs. Highly recommend the fisherman‚Äôs night! We never used the pool with the swim up bar but it looked amazing. On the Thursday before we left they hosted a cocktail evening for guests within the villas curtesy of the manager which was a special touch, we all sat on the wedding venue garden and watched the sunset. It was a moment we will never forget. The hotel has a cocktail bar in the evening which is lovely and drinks are so nice. All the hotel staff are so welcoming and willing to help. We would 100% return to this resort. Thank you so much for making our honeymoon complete!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1054,Holiday of my Dreams a Must Visit,50,July 2019,"Wow, where do i begin. The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is a must stay if you are visiting Bali. My wife and i stayed here in July at one of their private villas. The memories that were made were extraordinary. The staff and the resort surprised us with its service and quality every day. Our holiday was for several weeks at several cities and resorts but we always go back and think about Bali and the seminyak beach resort and spa.

From the start the pickup from the airport with personalized service, refreshments, and snacks on our drive to the resort was a godsend after our long plane travel from the other side of the globe. Personalized service was given to us the whole week we were there from greeting us by name and knowing what we liked by the pool, in our villa, or even our snacks. Michael the resort manager greeted us and also invited us to a welcome cocktail hour. The resort itself is spectacular. I felt relaxed and comfortable, very safe, and the staff were amazing. I can not say enough about our butlers and the staff that took care of our villa. Ogy, Benny, and Rocky were so friendly and helped us everyday. Whether it was helping us out with transportation in town or to our day trips up to ubud. Ogy was wonderful and a great sense of humor as he assisted us on our day trip. It just made for amazing memories. Even our driver for the week Cadet was great as we had several day trips and transportation around bali. It's great that the resort keeps it consistent with who we interact with through the week as it provides a sense of ease, comfort, and service on knowing who we interact with.

The private villa was wonderful with the pool, and wonderful sized room. The main pool provides a great view of the ocean, beach, and surfers. Staff at the pool was great, always available for drink or food order. It was also a nice touch as attendants come buy to clean your sunglasses as well. Mine always needed a cleaning from the sand and sunscreen so it was a great perk. The restaurants here were also wonderful as the breakfast is top notch. Variety of local and western foods. Super fresh. Best coffee and omlettes on the island in my opinion. We also had a lovely private dinner at the chapel and it blew us away with the flowers, candles, and food. A must do with your loved one with the wonderful sunsets. Nice touches as well with the towel animals and tea during turndown in the villa and the wonderful afternoon tea at the bar. The spa session we had was also great. Wonderful environment and balinese massage with wonderful oils. With the holiday Galungan going on as well it was great to see all the decorations and festivities. The resort truely provides for the best holiday from start to finish. We felt pampered in a lap of luxury and were recharged afterwards but also didn't want to leave a sure sign of a great place. Even our departure was great with the management team making sure everything was seamless. It's really a great resort as it is centrally located and a easy drive to other parts of the island for day trips.

A must must must do. No need to research any further but just book here. We are already looking forward to going back here with our extended family.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1055,Fabulous 10 day Stay,50,July 2019,An absolutely beautiful Hotel. Have stayed at many 5 Star Hotels in Seminyak and this Hotel is one of the Best! Staff are wonderful and Always smiling and willing to help. The Beach Area Pool And Sanje Restaurant are magnificent. Having a choice of Breakfast Buffet or Sanje Restaurant is a wonderful idea.Location is excellent and service area for drinks and food at the Beach pool are also excellent. Could not fault this Hotel and look forward to another stay in the future at this Beautiful Hotel.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1056,"Beautiful place, the best hotel in Seminyak",50,November 2018,"Had an amazing stay at this beautiful hotel. The staff is always smiling and they will always greet you when u pass by(small gesture makes the difference). The massage service could be cheaper to attract more clients since the nearby massage houses(There are high quality ones nearby but i won't mention them) are nearly half the price. Would have gladly payed a reasonable price inside of the hotel. Other then that all facilities and amenities are amazing, room gets a quick clean during the evening so when u get back u have a goodnight snack and youre sheets ready to roll into bed:)
The security is always friendly and helpfull in checking the cab twice for no left behind belongings.
Very good job guys",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1057,"Great beach front location, great service!",50,July 2019,"Great beach front hotel with great beach, beautiful ground with garden and pounds. There are a lot of shops and restaurants within walking distance which is convenient.

I stayed at the new building across the street, rooms are spacious, bathroom has nice bathtub and shower. They offer plenty of bottle water every day which is nice.

Service is wonderful, everyone is always smiling and very friendly and helpful. Even security guards would directing traffic to help you across the street, need it or not.

Breakfast buffet is amazing, has everything you can think of, eggs, pastries, fresh fruits and juices, bacons, sausages, cold cuts.... western and local foods of all kinds.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1058,Peaceful & well located,40,July 2019,"This resort is located at a prime area of Seminyak, next to Oberoi and Ku De Ta. Plenty of food options and shops are steps from this property.

A couple of things here may enhance my future experience:
1. Room lights are too dim, no white light at all in room nor along the stairs.
2. Complimentary tea break a nice touch but all sweet items, no savoury selection at all.
3. Toilet bowl needs a good soak.
4. Hotel has green initiative requesting guests to hang up towel if we would like to continue using it, yet staff kept changing the room towels we hang then up.

However we enjoyed our stay in this hotel.
Very helpful and friendly staff. Makes you feel so welcome and taken care of.

We stayed at the beach wing beachfront property, road noise is minimal. Very beautiful landscape in the hotel too.

Room is pretty well maintained. Every night they even provide you with two cookies for turn down service.

Very clean and not too crowded pool. No noisy kids. Good breakfast selection to cater to different crowd/culture.

Choose this hotel if you like peaceful and convenience in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1059,Nice Hotel in Seminyak,40,July 2019,"This hotel has very well-trained and friendly staff. The pools by the beach are very nice with one being a bit longer if you want exercise. I stayed in a Garden Wing room which I discovered is across the road and about 60 meters down the road. The room was very nice and well-maintained but it meant a bit of a trek to the dining room and pool (there is a small pool near these rooms). I felt the price charged for this location was a little high, and perhaps there is better value for money elsewhere in this area, so only rated the hotel a ""4"".",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1060,5 star luxury ocean front resort with 5 star service,50,July 2019,"We could not praise enough of The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The location is strategic in seminyak of both worlds. Serene by the beach yet minutes away to shops, restaurants and bars. Check in was seamless, greeted by the Marcom Manager, Ingrid who was so friendly, bubbly and pleasant. She shared with us of all the facilities enthusiastically. We were so impressed. The ocean front suite we had was fabulous , the view is to die for, the bed is so comfy that we could not leave the suite and decided to indulge in the jacuzzi and sipping our favourite TWG tea. Breakfast was cool, we love the breakfast by the beach at their restaurant called Sanje, ala carte, fresh and the view again of the beach was very therapeutic. The staff across the board from security to reception, from waitress to the managers are all so courteous and helpful. This property definitely stole our hearts and we would come back for more. Highy recommended !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1061,"Great Service, Generous Ocean View Suite, Good Vibes",50,July 2019,"Stayed for two nights at the Ocean View Suite of The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa and we were so stunned. Everything here was so exceeding expectation. We were greeted by friendly faces, at arrival were given flower leis and check in was so efficient. The Marcom Manager Ingrid met us on arrival and introduced herself so gracefully. We were escorted to our Ocean View Suite and beyond our expectation, the size is generous, the bathtub cum Jacuzzi is so cool and the ocean view of course is stunning. Everything in the suite is superb, the comfortable king size bed, our favourite TWG tea selection is there too, the double vanities, the balcony with view to die for. We did not want to leave our suite and mostly just indulged in the suite , sat at the balcony, sipped our tea and soaked in the oversize Jacuzzi , a complete indulgence. We got a chance to try the Spa and again , the greetings, the staff , the manager they were all so courteous and professional. Explained it well on the pre treatment and the treatment was so relaxing !. Breakfast was big time for people like us. So we tried first breakfast at their Santan main Resaurant and the spread was just amazing, from artisanal breads to live cooking Chef making our Omelette to our liking. The main selection were just a lot and the variety was sooo good, must say we had a real power breakfast here. The next day we slowed down and had the breakfast at their restaurant by the beach called Sanje and it was an ala carte, equally good and fresh and of course the beach view is a plus. Another cool facility in the resort that dazzled us is their infinity pool which was so huge with infinite view of the ocean, swimming here was so therapeutic and relaxing. We were even thinking of coming back to The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa next year before even checking out. This property will stay in our mind and become our top list and would not hesitate to recommend The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa to our friends and families.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1062,Love this resort,50,July 2019,"We did a lot of research and are thrilled we chose this resort.

Erik, the food and music manager, was excellent and very attentive to our needs. He truly cared that we have a great time in every way.

Gita and his team were always friendly and provided the best service. They always have a smile on their face and you can tell it‚Äôs genuine.

Thank you! A+",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1065,"10/10 - Amazing resort with great food, spa, employers, service and cocktails!",50,June 2019,"My girlfriend and I were staying at the beachwingrooms. First of all it was super clean with outstanding service. Rooms were perfect with everything you needed, and if you needed anything else you could just ask if you saw an employe or call the reception. We tried all the restaurants and was also recommended a few restaurants and places to go outside of the resort. Dede the cocktail mixer/bartender made some seriously great drinks for us and kept us happy all the time. I recommend him for the great service he provided and superb drinks! Another employee from the resort named Gita was always there when we needed help. He also recommended us a great restaurant Merah Putih which we ended up going to twice because of the amazing food. I would recommend anyone to go here and have a relaxing sensation with good food, spa, small gym and outstanding service. Again a special thanks to Dede and Gita for beyond 5-star service!

Thanks again for the amazing stay!

1066,We are already dreaming of coming back!,50,June 2019,"A superb hotel with ideal location, wonderful rooms and amazing infinity pool. My wife and I stayed 4 nights with our daughter and we all had an excellent stay. Generously appointed and sized rooms with a wonderful view of the beach and lovely hotel gardens. Rooms are super quiet and we never really heard other guests. The hotel gardens are lush and beautifully maintained with the highlight being the awesome beach front infinity pool which is gorgeous (we think one of the best hotel pools we have seen). Being more of a couples hotel than a family resort the pool was quiet and relaxing. The hotel service was outstanding and friendly (special mention to Dasi!) The only (minor) downsides was the food and drink. The buffet breakfast being was a little uninspiring (Avoid the poached eggs - totally overcooked). Having said that the beach-side breakfast was delightful. Morning coffee from the beach bar was the equivalent quality of a Melbourne coffee but for some reason it was not replicated at the buffet. Pool-side drink prices were horrendous and the pool-side food was hit & miss. Luckily the hotel is close by to some great restaurants so we relaxed at the hotel and ate elsewhere. Ultimately a hotel is judged by ""would you come back?"" Absolutely!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1067,Amazing photo session!!!!,50,July 2019,We were staying in The Seminyak resort for our honeymoon and got an amazing photo session. We wanted to have a final memory of our time in Bali and we loved the photos what we received! Great work. Very professional. Would recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I highly recommend the Resort and Spa and we are looking forward to our next stay here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1069,Wonderful Honeymoon Stay!,50,June 2019,"This resort is beautiful! My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and we were greeted with such kindness! Our room was very spacious and had a great view of the ocean! The staff even prepared our bathtub with flowers which added to the romantic vibe! The hotel is right on the beach, and has an infinity pool that is directly overlooking the sand and the ocean, which you definitely can't beat! Breakfast is served in the morning and they offer buffet style or a la carte. The resort is in walking distance to all of the party hot-spots like Potato Head and Mrs. Sippy. It is also super close to the main road with a bunch of popular restaurants!

We had very early flight to catch the next day and the hotel staff helped us set up a taxi to the airport, had all of our paperwork ready for a quick check-out process, and even prepared a breakfast box for us with snacks, coffee and juice for us to have on our ride to the airport.

Thank you to everyone at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for such an wonderful stay! Special thank you to Chatur and Alit. Olea for helping to make our honeymoon so memorable!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1071,Nice hotel,40,June 2019,"Hotel is clean and spacious, breakfast is served outside on the rooftop. The swimming pool is also located on the rooftopwith. Unfortunately the gym is small and poorly maintained. The location is remote, 20-25 mts walk from Seminyak Square, but hotel provides one way shuttle service few times per day as per fixed schedule.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1072,Best Resort Ever,50,June 2019,"I can‚Äôt explain how amazing this place is, from the way it looks to the food to the front desk, me and my wife came to Bali and stayed here for our second year anniversary, we were created with flowers around our neck and a positive vibe even if it was 11pm, after a easy check in and a small Tour of the hotel as it was late at night.

Breakfast was from 6am to 10:30 a very large variety from fresh juices to omelet‚Äôs made Infront you, a whole buffet of Indonesian food which smelt amazing and a beautiful dessert table that I picked at every morning.

The infinity pool was beyond beautiful over looking the beach, at around 6pm you lay by the pool and watch the most amazing sunset. Only thing that was missing was a shisha but understandable why they aren‚Äôt available.

The staff were always so helpful, so polite, they could honestly do no wrong. Me and my wife couldn‚Äôt thank them more then enough for making our stay so enjoyable

That k you very much to the team and I can‚Äôt wait to come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Close walk to town with lots of options for dining and a few bars.
Shout-out to concierge Rupawan who helped with ideas for excursions and restaurant ideas.
Thanks from Canada for a great experience!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1074,New favourite in Seminyak,50,May 2019,"We have been to several hotels on the waterfront in Seminyak
and decided this time to discover The Seminyak. It was a special experience - we loved it.
The infinity pool is the best we have found. Overlooking the beach, you can hang on the edge and watch the surfers, planes landing, beach life. Late afternoon there can be live music, fruit treats do the rounds, even a sunglass cleaning service offered.

The gardens are beautifully maintained, peaceful and a luxury in themselves in busy Seminyak.

But like all good Balinese hotels it is the staff who bring you back to a favourite - they are genuinely hospitable, welcoming and professional. Thank you again Niki and Soni - you made our evening at The Fisherman‚Äôs Dinner very special (as if it wasn‚Äôt already, watching the sunset, eating delicious seafood). Niki, your paper rose made it home safely to Manly, thank you. You are both assets to the hotel.

The Seminyak lived up to our expectations and so much more. We recommend it with our hesitation and hope to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1075,Not 5 star,20,June 2019,"We have been to Bali 59 times & stayed at some lovely places. The location of hotel & size of bedrooms were great but it stops there. Breakfast the worst in a hotel, little choice & over cooked, not healthy. Staff didn‚Äôt really seem interested in us being there & they refused late check out & didn‚Äôt give adequate provision to freshen up.
For the money I prefer THE W in Seminyak or definitely SOFITEL in Nusa Dua",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1076,Great place to stay!,50,April 2019,"A friend and myself stayed here for 4 days/3 nights in a villa and loved it. Everything was immaculate.

1077,Sensational Seminyak!,50,June 2019,"Stayed here with a bunch of work colleagues for a reward trip and was beautiful. Most of us were unfortunately in the garden wing which was across the road but the rooms were still really good. Lovely surrounds and nice pool and swim up bar although I never saw anyone in there. Staff were lovely, buffet breakfast was great and area is perfect. Right next door to Ku De Ta and perfect walk to shop, markets, nightlife restaurants etc. Would love to stay agaun although might be too expensive for me?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1078,Honeymoon,50,June 2019,"We planned our honeymoon to stay in The Seminyak resorts villas which exceeded our expectations. Fantastic place with view on the beach however you still can keep your privacy on honeymoon.

Their service is professional and high care for guests and it‚Äôs such a pretty nice service

Highly recommended for honeymooners or for a family vacation since the hotel have all the facilities and amazing swimming pool and located directly on the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1080,Absolute Luxury,50,June 2019,"Cannot recommend this place enough! My boyfriend and I stayed in the one bedroom ocean villa and it was absolutely incredible. At many other resorts I have been to in Bali, I have not always utilized the in-villa pools because it would look dirty etc, but our private pool in our villa here was absolutely incredible.
There were many little touches left by the hotel staff everyday that made our stay more enjoyable and they were very diligent and helpful. Ogy, our villa host and Windu, the cleaner were incredible. The service and hospitality was outstanding.
Location was great, being very close to many popular bars, beach clubs, restaurants and other stores.
I was also contacted after we had left the hotel because I had left a top there, which they have promptly mailed back to me.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and had absolutely zero issues with the hotel the entire time I was there which I find to be quite rare. Definitely stay here if you're feeling torn!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1081,Great hotel!,50,June 2019,"This was our first hotel in Bali on our first trip to Bali and it was the warmest welcome I‚Äôve ever received. We stayed in the beach wing which was lovely (we did walk past the garden wing and it‚Äôs no more than 5 mins away).

The pool was fabulous and a highlight was the breakfast at the beach front where you could look at the lovely rolling waves whilst sipping a smoothie and eating delicious food.

They do yoga everyday on the grass and the reception were great at helping us organise transport to Ubud. Would highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1082,Great place to unwind and relax,40,May 2019,"Stayed in the independent building across the road, all the benefits of a 5 star resort but without the price tag! Celebrated our wedding anniversary there and received wonderful posey of red roses and cake! Infinity pool is beautiful and service around pool and in room was outstanding. Great location near everything but without being on busy Eat Street.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1083,Luxury beach resort near the bustle,50,June 2019,"We had never been to Bali before and wanted to taste the culture, hustle and bustle of Bali whilst relaxing in a quiet classy resort. This hotel met all of that.

A short easy walk along narrow pavements to lots of boutique shops, plenty eating options and a hotel as good as some of the finest Mauritian resorts that we have stayed in. Beautiful lush gardens.
Staff were amazingly helpful.

Other than a very small yoga class you will have to make your own entertainment at the hotel. Theres a nice gym. No hotel watersports. Only those available on the beach in front of the hotel.

The hotel is very relaxing and is really only for grown ups.

If you go in the ocean, beware of a nasty ocean rip current that runs along the ocean on the right of the hotel, and every few hundred metres on the whole massive long lovely beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1084,Best hotel in Bali,50,June 2019,"This is my third visit to this hotel and my husband and I, can‚Äôt fault it. The service, food, staff and facitilies are excellent. Accomodation is comfortable and spotlessly clean. The breakfast is amazing. The infinite pool is beautiful and the staff around the pool don‚Äôt miss a beat, they even come around and clean your glasses. We will always return to this beautiful hotel in a fab location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1085,Great place to relax and rejuvenate,50,May 2019,"We recently had a short stay here as a belated birthday trip and all of the staff were very welcoming and friendly, particularly Endi, who greeted us at the airport for our transfer to the resort.

The lovely birthday cake & card left in our room was most unexpected, but a lovely touch and very much appreciated.

The resort is well located in Seminyak and the beach front infinity pool is fantastic.

Thanks for making our recent stay with you so enjoyable and relaxing, will certainly consider staying with you again when next in beautiful Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1090,Fabulous Resort,50,May 2019,"This is the best resort I have ever stayed in. The Manager and all the Staff were friendly, caring and helpful. I stayed at the Resort on 15th and 16th of May 2019. The property has a relaxed elegant feel to it and is directly on the beach.
My room was very comfortable and it was soothing to hear the ocean from my bed. My room had a large patio overlooking beautiful tropical landscaping and I could also see the beach from the patio. Housekeeping was excellent.
The infinity pool overlooks the beach and there are plenty of lounges with sun umbrellas and there are also sun-beds. I loved watching the sunset from the pool.
I was glad I had breakfast included because it was great. Lots of selections and you can also order from the menu. I went to one afternoon tea and enjoyed it. I did not try the restaurants for dinner at the resort because I ate in town. The resort did have a fisherman‚Äôs dinner night that looked wonderful.
Location is perfect! It is right on the beach and only a quick 15 minute walk into town. In town there are numerous restaurants, shops, and a nice mall.
The resort is close to the airport.
The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is luxurious, the setting is relaxing, the service is excellent, the staff are friendly and the location is perfect. I highly recommend this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1091,Close but no Balinese Cigar.,40,May 2019,"Let me say at the start that we have had bigger rooms in other comparable Seminyak Resorts for less money and with more sweeteners tossed in such as free massages, free hotel dollars and free lunchtime and evening meals, but from our experience, the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa seems content to rest on its reputation rather than go the extra mile to please its guests. Thats not to say that the staff were not amazing, which they were. It‚Äôs just that management could learn a bit more from some basic public relations.
When I made the initial booking, I researched all the places that had what we had grown to like in a hotel, such as affordability, a spa, gym, free wi-fi, breakfast included, nice grounds and pools and by the beach. This time we selected The Seminyak. We were especially drawn to the large manicured grounds and infinity pool overlooking one of the best stretches of beach in Bali. What we didn‚Äôt expect was to be driven up to the magnificent entrance area of the hotel only to be transferred into a golf buggy and driven across the busy road into a completely separate block of apartments opposite the resort. Granted, it had a pool and was well presented, but it was definitely a block of small apartments separated by a busy road with lots of taxis and motorbikes whizzing by.
Clearly I had missed the reference on their website to the Garden View rooms being totally isolated from the main resort, which I raised with management, only to be told that I could upgrade our two week stay into accomodation in the main compound for a discounted fee of $100US per night, which was definitely outside our budget.
There was no attempt from the resort to address the issue further, even though they had other rooms available and it had been a genuine mistake on our part. We still had to stay on the ‚Äòdark side‚Äô but we did get to use all the facilities in the main resort. The only negative with this was the constant traffic noise in the afternoon and evening and having to cross the road six or more times each day to go to breakfast, the gym, the infinity pool and walks along the beach to watch the sunsets.
The pool and the grounds of the resort really sold it to us but again The Seminyak‚Äôs marketing methods gave us the distinct impression that everything was based around getting as much money from the customer rather than giving them a memorable experience. Where other resorts offered free hotel dollars to be used in the resort, free one hour massages or treatments and 2 for 1 drinks with happy hours from 5-7pm, the Seminyak offered a free 5-minute massage and 3-for-2 designated cocktails in a 3-5pm happy hour when a lot of the guests were out shopping or sightseeing.
It‚Äôs little things like these as well as having to sleep on tired, ageing pillows in the rooms and not being able to get a blanket because the duvet was too hot, that tended to dampen our enthusiasm for the overall holiday package.
If I owned a resort hotel in a large holiday destination surrounded by other comparable resort hotels, I would have to guarantee that above everything, the customer left feeling that they had been truly valued and had received value for money and maybe received an unexpected bonus. We have felt this in other resorts and have left feeling like part of the family rather than just a customer with money to spend. In previous resorts we were invited to weekly complementary cocktail events to meet the management and network with other guests - it made us feel special and valued and we were keen to return to that resort on a future holiday. Unfortunately, like the cask wine we brought with us from Australia, it left somewhat of a sour taste in our mouths.
Despite all of this, I have to say that we really did enjoy The Seminyak - the staff were ever attentive and possibly the resort‚Äôs best marketing tool; the food was lovely, the bed was large and comfortable and the location was accessible to everything we wanted to see and do in Seminyak. Maybe The Seminyak could learn a little by being a bit more attentive and open to people‚Äôs needs and bending the rules a little if I didn‚Äôt cost them too much to do so. Maybe they could also look at building an elevated walkway across the street to link the garden view rooms with the main resort complex. Either way, it‚Äôs a good resort that could be a great resort with a bit more creative customer marketing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1092,Fabulous stay,50,May 2019,I recommend The Seminyak Beach hotel the location it‚Äôs right on the beach and close to the heart of Seminyak.The amenities are fabulous and the staff are so friendly and courteous nothing is to much trouble.I would especially like to praise Viani Tusvi she is the best.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Management team should be very proud of their team as they are all A1, once again terima kasihüòÄ",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1094,A Most Relaxing Experience,50,May 2019,"We stayed a few days at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa in early May and were pleasantly surprised by the standard of luxury offered and the attention to detail in rooms, the restaurants and public areas generally and the pools. We were more than pleasantly surprised on arrival by the attention of the desk staff and the news that we were getting a free room upgrade. A positive start to our stay! Perhaps the best feature of our stay overall was the pleasant and courteous interaction of the staff. They were always cheerful and attentive, willing assist, and to chat with us if we were interested and time permitted (about the hotel and particularly about Bali life as lived by the locals), but not so as to be intrusive. We would give the staff five stars.

The only suggestion for slight improvement we would offer was for a little more guidance and explanation of possible day trips, and tips on what would be best to see at each destination and when and why.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1095,Beachfront Access and Great Service,50,May 2019,"A friend and I spent our last night in Bali at this resort. I really enjoyed the direct beach access and the beautiful infinity pool right on the beach. The room was nice. It didn't have some of the quaint furnishings of some.other places we stayed but it was very nice and had a balcony with a garden and partial ocean view. A great place to listen to the surf.

The service was largely very attentive. Knowing we had late night international flights, they were able to accommodate a late check out. Even better, we were able to continue enjoying the pool and amenities after checkout. And best of all, they let us use the showers in the spa before heading off to the airport. This made our last day so much less stressful and I really appreciate that.

The breakfast buffet was really comprehensive and tasty. We enjoyed the afternoon tea as well. And we had good service poolside thanks to Sang Tu.

I enjoyed the quieter location, facilities and service and would definitely recommend this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1096,Excellent Sunset view...!,50,April 2019,I stay here with my wife last month it was very beautiful property very close to Ocean it has a big Resort and very beautiful garden the best part is is there a swimming pool where you can see the sunset it was an amazing experience the breakfast was also very good the room was little bit small but they have a great view the staff is very cooperative the check-in process very good the seminyak square is very close. You can go by walk we had a lovely time there the staff was very good thank you very much for making my holiday memorable,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1097,My new favourite hotel!,50,May 2019,"We had the best stay at The Seminyak and we are already planning our next stay!

It is a great central location so easy to walk to everything including eat street. The beachfront location is just heaven, we loved sitting by the ocean and swimming in the infinity pool. The swim up pool bar was also a big hit.

It was never a problem finding a lounge by the pool and the staff were so attentive and kind they even cleaned our sunglasses!

The Balinese massage at the spa was amazing, very professional staff and luxurious setting.

A shout out to Sang Tu who provided us with great service and was very friendly and helpful wth local recommendations.

An amazing stay we felt so spoiled!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1098,Fantastic location but not flawless,40,May 2019,"The Seminyak is ideally located and very close to the main bars/restaurants of Seminyak/Petitenget and literally next door to Ku De Ta on the beachfront. While The Seminyak is a very nice, luxury hotel at this price point and level of reputation I did expect a flawless experience and this was not quite what was delivered. Some small matters of service were not quite up to my expectations of a premium five star resort and the pool is relatively small and not really designed for all day relaxation. Perhaps it was a particularly windy couple of days but the wind from the beachfront was not that pleasant and there is a lack of shade available.

I did attend one of the afternoon tea sessions in the bar and this was very pleasant. I also had a very nice pedicure in the spa (albeit very expensive...but I think this is a reflection of their desired clientele). I had a lovely breakfast at Sanje - the peas on sourdogh was a delicious dish.

I noted that on checkout I was not asked to comment on my stay or provide feedback on any concerns. I did address a couple of small matters with the concierge during my stay although a couple of other service matters were not addressed and I got the feeling the staff weren't that interested.

In summary, I think The Seminyak is a good choice if you are inexperienced with Bali and if you are going out on day trips (i.e. not wanting to sit by the pool all day) but also want to be close to restaurants and shopping.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1099,Amazing!,50,June 2018,"A long overdue review. Stayed for 5 days with my girl friend and we had the best time of our holiday lives in this hotel.

Location- Perfect! it's right in the middle of everything!

Hotel Facilities- Loved the infinity pool! It was just exceptionally beautiful. The room was big, clean and luxurious.

1102,"Luxurious, Tranquil Resort On The Beach. Fantastic Stay.",50,March 2019,"My girlfriend, Lauren and myself stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa during our trip to Bali in March. A truly fantastic resort all round. Could not fault it. We were made very welcome by Linda at the beginning of our stay and this set the tone for a truly relaxing and luxurious stay. Accommodation is spacious and very comfortable. The infinity pool overlooking the beach is a showpiece of the hotel. We spent many hours there chilling out sunbathing. I would also recommend you take breakfast by the beach restaurant. Plentiful, delicious and healthy. It was also very nice to meet Michael, the General Manager during a welcome drink. A very nice man. We would recommend highly!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1103,Loved our stay!!,50,April 2019,"We stayed in April 2019 for 8 nights. I am picky and apprehensive about most things but can't fault this hotel at all! It was stunning!!

The pool area is to die for! Plenty of loungers and the view speaks for itself! Lovely touches of small food samples and sunglasses cleaning given.

We had a garden view room, which gave me anxiety before arriving, but it is absolutely fine! Literally one small road to cross and your there. Some resorts are so big it can take you longer to get to breakfast/pool even when your in the main complex. It didnt bother us at all. Rooms were lovely! Not out of this world, but perfectly nice and cosy and clean and with everything you need. We were particulary impressed with housekeeping, our room once cleaned was so impressive and amazing all over again, and how they reorganise your things almost made me embarassed as it was so good!

Breakfast again was lovely, esp the avocado on toast from the a la carte menu, delicious!

I was also concerned about the staff after reading some of the reviews, but I really dont get it, everyone is just lovely! Everywhere we turned we were greeted with a smile! Every single member of staff was warm, friendly and accomodating. Great testamanet to Balinese people.

We came for our anniversary and were greeted with a lovely hand bouquet of roses and a cake a few days later in our room.

LOCATION is AMAZING! We loved our 10-15 min stroll to the shops and restaurants and massage parlours at lunchtime and the evening!

Loved our first trip to Bali and can't wait to return and stay here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1104,Miss Noel,50,April 2019,"Wonderful stay in this hotel staff amazing so is the service.Gede who is the villa head host made our stay most memorable.
Thank you Gede.!!!
Breakfast large selection was surprised with the Gluten free options.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1105,Beautiful hotel with excellent facilities and staff,50,March 2019,"This place is perfect in every way. Beautiful hotel with excellent facilities. Nice location, beautiful pool and lovely beach. Should have spent our entire holiday in this place, but sadly we had booked 3 nights. We stayed in beach view room in the main hotel, very clean and excellent staff.
This place serves tea in the afternoon which was nice touch. Hotel did a surprise cake on my 65th birthday, thank you Seminyak hotel and staff for making my big birthday so memorable. Nice breakfast.
We did a lot of sight seeing from this hotel, everything is very close to this hotel, especially eating places. We ate out all three nights and were able to walk back to the hotel.
We spent one full day in the hotel at the pool side, I wish I had more than one day. Will go again. Enjoyed it very much.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1106,The Location is Perfect,50,November 2018,"We stayed here for a night. The rooms are extremely comfortable. It is beautiful, lush green property with a pool directly facing the beach. It is completely centrally located with all the beach clubs and the main Seminyak street within walking distance. Ku De Ta - a very famous beach club is 100 metres close. Everything is perfect. The food is exceptionally good. We really enjoyed our stay here especially because wherever we planned to go was just minutes away and we didn't have to take a cab and spend extra money. Worth the stay and cost.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1107,"Fancy hotel, good food and great service.",50,May 2019,"Stayed for a week on first trip to Bali. Hotel is very grand and luxurious. Staff soooo friendly and help with anything you like (including offering to clean your sunglasses whilst at the pool)
Food is delicious with many varieties on offer. Beer and cocktails are reasonably priced although wine is expensive (but as expected from a5* resort)
Great location and easy access to beach.
We stayed in the garden rooms which are across the road from the main hotel but only an issue if you like to moan about everything.
Don‚Äôt listen to the poor reviews on here. Hotel rooms are lovely, spacious and clean. So nice!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1108,villa stay in April,50,April 2019,"This resort was amazing.Its situated walk to most restaurants and shops in Seminyak and sits in amongst the high end resorts.
We have been to Bali many times over the years but the service in this resort definitely stood out. Food was very very good, you receive a villa host that can help you at any time. Breakfast can be al a carte by the beach or buffet ( only if you stay in a villa)
Beds are very comfortable and food pricing within the resort/roomservice is great - around $15.00 per main meal/lunch
Very very happy with this resort and would stay again. They dont have a kids club so the resort does not attract many young families. We have 3 children that are over 7 years old so was perfect.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1109,We had a wonderful stay here,50,April 2019,"We spent 4 nights for our wedding. We had a wonderful stay here. It is fabulous. Location, rooms, staff all amazing. I can not say enough positives about this hotel. Had the best time, can't wait to visit again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1110,Outstanding Experience!,50,February 2019,"We stayed here for 3 nights and all I can say is that we never wanted to leave this place! It was so so good! The infinity pool was like a cherry on the cake! I can re-visit this place 100 times! We got a free upgrade too! Like other places in Bali, veg food was a problem!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1111,Perfection,50,April 2019,"We stayed in the beach side part of the hotel in suites on the second floor. Everything, and I really mean everything about this hotel, was stunning. The rooms were massive, bathroom and jacuzzi were sumptuous, and fresh fruit and evening chocolates/cookies were delivered every day. The grounds, pools and beachside bars and restaurant were beautifully kept; the staff were polite, friendly, attentive and extremely helpful and the breakfast choices were not only delicious but contained healthy options and Balinese fruit and delicacies. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, it is a short walk away from the centre of town and I would love to return there. I would suggest that you don't look anywhere else in Seminyak - this hotel is perfect!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1112,"Beautiful location, great service",50,April 2019,"My husband and I stayed at The Seminyak for 2 nights. We were welcome with a frangipani garland and delicious tea. The check in process was smooth. Our room was lovely (we also received a free upgrade!). The 2 pools are cool and clean and all the staff very friendly, polite and everso helpful. One attendant in particular, Sang Tu. Sang Tu was attentive and didn't mind spending time chatting to us about the Balinese culture and Hindu religion. He remembered us the next day and made the experience feel very personalised. Definitely going to go back next time we're in Bali :).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1113,Beautiful hotel & location,40,April 2019,"This is my 2nd time to this hotel since 2016. I travel to Bali 3 to 4 times a year & decided to go back to to Seminyak Beach Resorts 12-15th April reasons being the location near to Seminyak Square & Village, many good restaurants, massages all walking distances. The rooms are beautiful, clean & good size. The pool with the beach front is great & we love it. Lovely landscape with cabanas & ponds.
In 2016 i mention that the Happy Hours is from 5.30 -6.30 & only to the guests who is sitting at the sofa which was limited & not to the pool bed. This time they change it to 3-5pm which is unheard of. People love to drink & enjoy sunsets even thou i start early. Instead of encouraging people to drink for sunset this is the opposite. For a pool bar the drinks are very expensive, a small bottle of champagne is S$100 thats why i notice people dont drink so much compared to hotels i stayed before. For me F&B is also important I hope they can do something about it & i do spend on it. Besides that its a great resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1114,Anniversary treat,50,April 2019,"We spent 11 nights here and had an amazing time. All the staff without exception were friendly and helpful. We chose the room and breakfast option and were glad we did as there was so much choice for places to eat close by. Breakfast in the hotel was what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and we never had to wait for a table either. The pool areas and grounds are immaculately maintained and the hotel has a relaxing spa like ambience. Our only slight criticism is that the towels for the pool and in our room needed replacing as they looked and felt worn out.
Thanks to the staff for a fabulous holiday in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1115,Immaculate Hotel with Flawless Service,50,March 2019,"We arrived at the Seminyak Beach Resort late at night and were greeted by friend staff who draped fresh flower necklaces round our necks and gave us freshly squeezed lemonade.

From here the luxury at this hotel just continued and delivered in spades. The room was massive with a huge comfy bed, the bathroom was beautiful with everything you could need from shampoo to cotton buds and toothbrushes. The staff had left us an amazing basket of fresh local fruit and each evening knocked on the door with more local delights such as cookies and chocolate truffles.

The pool was breathtaking and truly delivered the infinity feel, the restaurants served the best breakfast of any hotel I have visited and this was all delivered by the hard working attentive staff who tended to our every need.

If you are planning a trip to Bali, you really do need to be staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort, you certainly will not be disappointed",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1116,Best Resort that has everything.,50,March 2019,Perfect short stay for hubby and myself. Pool cocktails with pizza -perfect for lunch . Breakfast stunning. Rooms spacious and five üåü. Rained every night but was stunning to watch . Humidity was constant but air conditioning in rooms were welcoming . This is very top shelf if you want to stay in luxury close to Seminyak. Short walk to nice restaurants and Seminyak shopping and markets.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1117,Amazing hotel,50,April 2019,"Stayed for 3 nights. Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Pool area was paradise with infinity pool looking out to sea.
Rooms were very spacious and bed very comfy. Amazing bathroom with fantastic toiletries.
Would definitely recommend and stay again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1118,Fantastic Hotel!,50,March 2019,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel on beautiful grounds. Felt so welcome from the minute we arrived. The staff at this hotel are outstanding and can't do enough for you, always friendly and helpful. The hotel is right on the beach with an infinity pool overlooking the sea in the most beautiful setting. There are plenty facilities including a spa, 3 swimming pools, bars, restaurants a gym and more. The breakfast in the hotel is to a very high standard with a huge selection of breads, muffins, pancakes, waffles, fresh fruit juices, fresh fruit, hams, cheeses, eggs, bacon, sausages and more hot options so much I didn't even manage to look round everything. Not a far walk from lots of restaurants and shops and reception are more than happy to arrange trips, taxis and drivers etc for you. The rooms themself are huge, very well decorated and cleaned each day to a very high standard if you leave your room keeping light on. Fresh fruit and water offered free of charge in rooms as an added touch, welcome letter with information etc given on arrival which was very helpful. The only criticism I can think of is the bar prices at the pool are a bit pricey but that's in comparison to elsewhere outside the hotel. All in all a fantastic stay, would highly recommend and if we are ever back in Bali I would not hesitate to stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1119,Excellent food and romantic setting,50,May 2018,"The sea food here is so fresh you can taste the seawater in it. We had a mixed seafood grille which included lobster. This was followed by fresh fruit salad.
There was also live singing and a delightful little quartet went around to the tables serenading people.
It cost a bit more than other local restaurants but it was well worth it.
Definitely recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1120,This place is the real deal!,50,March 2019,"We stayed in an ocean view villa with a private pool, and it was the oasis that we had hoped for. The sunset view of the ocean from our bedroom and patio was breathtaking. The room was clean and well kept. The staff was incredibly accommodating. The pool area and hotel grounds were stunning and clean. And I can't possibly say enough nice things about the spa - the massages were incredible! We had a villa host (thank you Ogy, Oka, Rocky, Windu, Benni & Ade) who took great care of us for the duration of our stay. All of our needs were met with gratitude and caring. Also, the buffet breakfast and the Balinese dinner were great! I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the Seminyak region.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1121,"Perfect honey moon destination, could be 6 star!!!",50,March 2019,"So sad that we have just left :-(!!!!!!!!!

Our stay here was absolutely second to none, one of the best 5* hotels we‚Äôve ever stayed in.
Facilities ; all excellent, well groomed, spotlessly clean & high end
Food; fresh, varied & delicious
Staff; super friendly, happy to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble, helpful but not too OTT or interfering

Would highly HIGHLY recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1122,Great rooms but...,40,February 2019,"So I stayed here with my girlfriend in Feb for about a week and was glad that we stayed here to an extent. First we booked online and checked in last minute since our other booked hotel didn't look as the website portrayed. Glad that we canceled!

Day 1: The staff helped grabbed our bags and took us to an annex building. This building was across the street and which looked nothing like the main side. In the main building, the staff was much nicer and the energy was so much better. The receptionist in the annex was in a very bad mood... horrible way to check-in. After checking in, we found out that the only amenities in that building was a pool that sucked, business center computers didn't work at times, and the room balconies were blocked in by walls. After our disappointment we decided to upgrade rooms and move to the main building. So much nicer!

Day 2: We went down for breakfast and I have to say the food was not good at all. Yes, it was edible but not worth the price. Later we ventured out to the beach and the view was amazing. We loved everything about the scenery from that side of the hotel. Such a day and night experience as everything was so different.

Day 3: We tried the breakfast again and it was still not good so the remaining days of our stay we eat out in town. On a positive note we had an amazing dinner with special view. The staff really took care of us which made the lows forgettable.

Overall we loved the rooms and stay but would only recommend a stay if you book at the main hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1123,Perfect Haven,50,March 2019,"My husband & I came here for a short weekend getaway. We were wow with the service the moment we step in the resort. Our checking in was taken care of while we went for our afternoon tea. All we need to do was to inform the restaurant staff when we were ready to go and the reception immediately escorted us to our room. We booked the ocean front room. We love everything about this resort. The room was superb clean and very nice. Infinity pool is amazing with fabulous views of the beach, beautiful and well taken care garden. Love the coffee and banana cake. This is a perfect haven for honeymooners. Will definitely stay in this resort the next time we visit seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1124,Perfect hotel in a great location,50,March 2019,"It‚Äôs worth upgrading to a beach view room, the rooms are spacious and well maintained. The hotels has a wonderful spa and gym facilities. There a plenty of sun loungers to use by the infinity pool.
The hotel is maintained to an excellent standard, the employees are extremely polite and do everything possible to make your stay as relaxed as possible.
The hotel is far enough away from the night life of Seminyak to a peaceful nights sleep at the same time being close enough to walk to the many bars and restaurants in the area. I would highly recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1125,NIGHTMARE! Don't ruin your holiday!,10,March 2019,"The hotel and the staff are a nightmare. I have stayed at the best hotels in Bali and am a big fan of the Indonesian hospitality. However, this hotel has surely changed that. I have just checked in and the horror continued with harassment at check in to the room not ready even at 3.30 PM and still isn't as we speak. All hotels hold the booking against the credit card and charge at the end of the trip or you may choose to pay cash. However, I was asked to pay upfront cash which was also alright but then was told I can't pay in usd and will have to step out and convert at that very point. On my insisting that if my family could check in while I do the needful did they relent. I also offered to give them my credit card against which the blocking had been made. The team handling reservations particularly a woman named Dina is a nightmare and a classic case of promising something over a call and when u get a mail it's a different story. All in all please save yourself the trouble and choose another property, specially the price you pay here! Also the garden wing rooms aren't a part of the main hotel but a annexe of sorts on the opposite side for which you hAve to cross a road. Fingers crossed some part of my stay here isn't as miserable!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1126,Fantastic,50,March 2019,"Currently staying here until the weekend and has to be one of the best places I have ever stayed. Upgraded to main sea side room and well worth the extra cost. Lovely well equipped and clean room. Highly recommend breakfast by the beach rather than in the restaurant. Great location to walk in to the town. One of the very few high quality hotels where you don't get ripped off by expensive food and beverages. Service can be a bit slow sometimes, but you are in Bali. Just fantastic and highly recommend staying here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1127,"Lovely hotel, great position and first class service",50,February 2019,"We stayed here 10 days in February. All the five star reviews are true. The hotel is stylish with lovely artwork and furniture, right on the beach with amazing pools. The staff are lovely, kind, funny and so,so helpful - every attention to detail is perfect. Breakfasts are delicious and lots of choice (eggs benedict with salmon mmmm). We stayed in the garden wing which was very nice, rooms lovely . If we could have afforded to stay in the main hotel, we may have done, to save a 50 yard stroll across the road, but it wasn't really a problem.

The hotel is in a great position in Seminyak approx 10 mins walk to the centre on slightly dodgy pavements. Loads of very lively bars - The Champagne bar (other drinks available!) is good fun as is the Nirvana Bar. Mopeds and traffic in general a bit scary, but they stop and let your cross if you walk out.

If you want to visit chilled, beach- front shack-type restaurants for lunch- turn right when you come onto the beach out of the hotel and walk half a mile or so along the beach. There are two or three that are very cheap and good food. The lunch/dinner in the hotel is also good, a little bit more expensive than outside, but not stupid money.

Lovely extras included: meet the management cocktails- not just a plastic cup of Pina Colada, but we were given three different delicious, beautifully presented cocktails. Also at the main pool- iced water on tap and little treats such as fruit lollipops.

Only gripe...two very rude guests bossing the bar staff around and making diva like demands ""I want beetroot with my cocktail, chopped into squares"" No please or thank yous. Poor staff I hope they don't run out of smiles having to deal with such miseries.

Still not a lot the hotel can do about them. The Hotel is GREAT -book it- you wont regret your visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1128,Great Place with The Best Infinity Pool in Seminyak,50,March 2019,"Highly Recommended Hotel! The Room, The Staff, The food, and The Resort Area are Top of the line.

Our room was a very comfortable room decorated with wooden furniture and parquet floor. There was a handwritten welcome card from the hotel manager is a nice personal touch. A complimentary selection of tropical fruits and a night delicatessen are a great way to make the guess feel pampered. A spacious and see-through bathroom with both a shower and a large deep tub was perfect for a nice and relaxing way to end the day with a hot bath.

The Resort offered complete facilities. A nice gym with 3 new high-tech treadmills and other machines, Luxurious Spa, Boutique, Money Changer, Infinity Pool in front of the beach, Restaurant by the beach, a Wedding Venue, and three big Gazebos in the garden. In-room amenities, a safe deposit box, Bluetooth Speaker, Hair Dryer, Comfortable Bath Robe and sleepers, and minibar are very convenient.

The room price that we took came with a free breakfast for two people and a complimentary afternoon tea. Breakfast with a selection of international dishes, continental breakfast, Indonesian food, Indian Food, and healthy breakfast choices from Santan restaurant. Since I am Indonesian, I love their selections of Indonesian food and my husband who is vegan is splurged by the wide range of their healthy breakfast options.

We also booked a fisherman‚Äôs night dinner at the resort which they held every Tuesday and Saturday. It was an IDR 660.000 ++ all you can eat dinner in front of the beach with range selections of fresh seafood. It was very romantic and flavourful dinner with acoustic live music in the background.

Another plus point for this hotel is that after check out we can still use the swimming pool area, Afternoon tea, and they also provide a locker and a shower in the spa area. It is very convenient since I had to wait around four hours until I have to pick up my mom at the airport before we continue our trip to Ubud area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1129,Best hotel in Seminyak !!!,50,March 2019,Amazing hotel and more than anything the service of all the employees is top of the line at all times. Food was excellent and room was great! I will definitely recommend this to anyone. I will rate this place more than five stars because it totally worth every penny. Thank you all the staff and The seminyak beach resort and spa to have us spend and incredible time here in Bali.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1130,Holiday,50,February 2019,"Would thoroughly recommend this resort and would stay here again. I've been to Bali 3 times now and this was my partners 1st trip. We also had our friends join us and it was also their 1st time. Perfect location, very clean throughout. Excellent staff, great, selections for breakfast. Loved everything about this resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1131,Amazing Honeymoon Stay!,50,February 2019,"We stayed at the Seminyak for 5 nights during our Honeymoon and we couldn't have been happier with our decision. Luxury and class from check-in to check-out. We had an Ocean View Room that was perfect for what we needed. I think if we were to book again, we'd probably do just a regular Garden View though. The Ocean view was great but it also overlooked the staff kitchen. Either way, the room was immaculately clean and the sound of the waves crashing all night was a dream. We got room service on multiple occasions and there was no problem at all. Came in good time and everything was delicious. The breakfast buffet was unreal and kept up full until late afternoon. We sat by the infinity pool every day of our stay. It was a little warmer than we were anticipating and once we saw how amazing the hotel was we decided we didn't really need to venture out to any of the popular beach clubs. The staff by the pool were more than helpful and attentive. We could order lunch and drinks right from our lounge chairs. We got drinks at the hotel bar or swim up bar almost every night before going out for dinner or exploring. The sunset from the lounge area outside is incredible. The hotel is centrally located to shops and tons of restaurants. The front desk can call you a Blue Bird Taxi as well. (these are the best priced taxis around). A few of the beach clubs are within walking distance on the beach. Ku Da Ta is literally about 100 feet away, we walked back on the beach one night. Absolutely everything from the service to the grounds was amazing. It was the perfect stay really.

The only negative that we had was regarding the Fisherman's night. The hotel markets the event as a party like setting at the restaurant right on the beach with live music. All day the staff at the pool and around the hotel were talking the event up big time, so we decided we would join. Long story short, they moved the event inside due to rain, even though it wasn't raining, which was very strange, so the setting just wasn't the same. In addition, the live singer (who was amazing!) took a break right when we were seated (8pm seating) and ended up stopping an hour early, leaving us to eat in complete silence for the remainder of our meal. The food and service was great, but I think we would have likely declined or opted to do it a different night if we knew they were going to move it inside and that the singer really wasn't going to be there for the full time.

Overall if we were to return we would only stay here. It was a little piece of heaven on earth and it crushed us when we had to leave!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1132,Second time's a charm,50,February 2019,"This was my second stay at The Seminyak and this was equally good as the first. After staying a few nights in Ubud and the peacefulness, I wanted to end my short week long trip to Bali in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.

Things that really stand out about this hotel are the location, the beautifully appointed rooms and amenities. On both occasions I stayed in the Garden Wing, which is a short stroll across the street from the main building. This is not as inconvenient as it sounds due to the Garden Wing having equally nice rooms in a contained building that is also as quiet and relaxing. There is also a swimming pool and pool bar in the Garden Wing which on most occasions is quiet and easy to get a spot to relax. The rooms in the Garden Wing are luxurious, very spacious and well appointed. There was a lovely handwritten note when I arrived that thanked me for my return visit and offered assistance if I needed it. In these modern times I found a handwritten note something quite special and very touching. A lovely touch!

The first thing that you notice about The Seminyak is that the grounds are spectacular! Its a very open plan hotel that benefits from the sea breeze to keep it nice and comfortable to walk around. The pool areas at the back are right on the beach, divided into two with a smaller pool area that has a pool bar to the right hand side. If you want to get some early morning reading or just to relax and watch people walk on the beach, surfers or listen to the sound of the waves, this is the perfect spot! I went there each morning and it wasn't a busy as the main pool area so I could relax and daydream.

Breakfast was great and the perfect mix between buffet and daily menu, with both local and international cuisine. Despite there being not many people staying when I was there, the service during breakfast was a little slow but I'm not letting that small detail effect my overall rating.

I made use of the gym each day and it was perfect for my needs. There's a good mix of cardio and strength machines available with free weights and a bench. Water and towels are provided along with a stereo to keep you motivated. The cleanliness of the gym was above my expectations - cleaner than my current gym to be honest - and the equipment was also new and of high standards.

The staff were all very friendly and very helpful during my stay.

If you are looking for a solo trip, somewhere to relax, enjoy a honeymoon, take a short break or have a long holiday to explore the beauty of Bali, this is really a perfect place. Location wise is also perfect as it'a s short walk to Seminyak Square, Jalan Petitenget, Potato Head, Merah Putih, Motel Mexicola and of course, is right next to Ku De Ta. Everything you can want in 5-10 mins walk whilst being away from it all to have some peace and quiet.

I will definitely be back here again - to try the Beach Wing side - and can definitely recommend staying here to friends and family.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1133,Delightful way to celebrate our anniversary,50,February 2019,"The Seminyak is 5 star all the way, From the General Manager to the gardeners, we received an extremely welcoming arrival. The service was excellent as wad the food, the breakfast selection is outstanding. The grounds and beach is beautifully maintained.

All in all a truly enjoyable experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1134,Villa Life,30,February 2019,"After arriving into paradise and experiencing an impeccable check-in service, the 5 star stopped there. Ordering room service became difficult and tedious because the person answering the phone did not understand English. The wait for a meal was anywhere from 20 min-45 min. One of the meals arrived cold and the request to not uncap the beer went unanswered, especially after 4 requests to leave the lids on. When anyone arrives to our villa, the doorbell rings no less than 2 times. It‚Äôs quite difficult to jump out of the pool, race through the villa to get to the door, but never less, the frustrations continue to rise because there is no ‚Äúdo not disturb sign‚Äù one can hang on the door to have peace and quiet. We took the time to speak with a manager who was most willing to right the challenges. We expressed the concerns and she explained to us to use our personal butlers number for any requests. We may have oversighted this detail in the check-in process that‚Äôs quick and full of details. Funny, we then see the Butler at our door and he gives us a different number than the one the manager gave us. So we decided to settle in for the evening and the bell starts ringing. Again, not once but several times wanting to turn down our bed, which we were already in. I‚Äôm now starting to feel like I am at home when my children were small and the constant interruptions. It‚Äôs now 7:30 pm and we have not addressed dinner, so we order a pizza using the number we are supposed to. Our butler doesn‚Äôt answer nor does he bring the food. Not 2 hours before, we were instructed on the purpose and usefulness of the Butler. We are now wondering if the conversation to rectify the frustrations was pointless. At 1130 pm the phone starts ringing to bring us water and pillows we requested. Not only did we not request them, but certainly not at that late hour as we had been asleep for a good long while. And finally, we communicated that we would like to quietly enjoy our villa for the day and the manager wants to know when we can vacate the room so they can make the bed and change out the towels. Was no one listening when we said we wanted to have a relaxing day and be left alone. Could ya not just drop two cleans towels to the door and use never ending ringing door bell. If your going to rent a villa, I suggest you understand what to expect. The ‚ÄúButler‚Äù that is assigned to your villa during check-in, we never saw again. We did meet another, but his promise to provide service when we call him did not occur. Is it worth the extra money?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1135,Stunningly beautiful resort in blissful Bali,50,February 2019,"We stayed here in February for three days and were charmed by the place. I have been to Bali many times and this has to be the best resort I‚Äôve stayed in. Right from the time we stepped in, we were treated to a very special experience. A welcome drink to start with followed by a very pleasant check in‚Ä¶. we requested to be upgraded to an ocean facing room from the garden facing one we had booked and were given a complimentary upgrade! I was treated to a neck and shoulder massage at the spa and to tea and snacks at the restaurant while waiting for the room. The suite was stunning with the balcony overlooking the ocean and our very own jacuzzi. A personalized hand-written note by the property manager welcomed us to the Seminyak resort and spa and promised to make our stay special.

I liked that we could choose between the buffet breakfast or order a la carte. The spread was sumptuous though the choice of fruits deserves more attention as they were tasteless‚Äì especially the passion fruit.

The Infinity pool overlooking the ocean was an absolute dream, the beach was private with white soft sands and pristine waters. Sublime!

We sat at the sundeck and watched the most beautiful sunset ever. We had the most wonderful stay at this heavenly resort. Can‚Äôt wait to get back here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1136,Amazing!!,50,February 2019,"We stayed at this Hotel for our first 3 nights in Bali. I can easily say this is the best hotel/resort I have ever stayed in. Location perfect, infinity pool- just incredible with the sunset views, rooms are super clean. And most of all, the staff are super nice and professional. They really made us feel at home there. Special thanks to SangTu, who worked at the pool area! Very professional, super service, he also helped us with further planning on the island.
This place exceeded our expectations and we came back for 4 more nights in the end of our vacation! 10/10üëèüèª

1137,One of the best hotels I have stayed,50,December 2018,"We went for a five day break and decided to stay here. My wife had been before and this lived up to hype. Great service, food and activities. The pool is amazing and the complimentary sun glass cleaning was a bonus!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1138,Excellent Service,50,December 2018,"We stayed in the 2 bedroom Villa over the December festive period.
My children loved the villa pools.
The Villa hosts went out of their way to make sure we were happy at all times,
Rocky and Oggy

in fact all staff at TSBR&S were polite and respectful , they made the holiday.

Highly recommended",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1139,Absolute Paradise,50,January 2019,"There is a plethora of 5 star accommodation options in Bali these days, all of which I‚Äôm sure live up to their rating and reputation. I have stayed in a few of them and haven‚Äôt had too many bad experiences in any. But from the moment I stepped foot in The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa I was treated like royalty. Once through the reassuring security and into the resort the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming. They literally couldn‚Äôt do any more to make us feel comfortable, from the beautifully scented lei around our necks to the traditional welcome drinks. We were then taken on a guided walk around the resort by Mahendra so we knew where everything was and a rundown of the facilities.
We were then taken to our room on the 3rd floor, the Ocean View Suite, and the view was to die for, looking out over the resort, through the palms to the Indian ocean. The room itself was every bit what you would expect from a resort in this category and price point. Entering the room it smelt fresh and clean and every detail was meticulously attended to. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows (which to me are a personal indicator of the quality of the accommodation) were literally perfect, with crisp clean white sheets. The air con was nice and cold and the wifi strong and fast which is important if doing work while on the road. There was also a nice little desk which was great to set up my laptop etc. to do some work while looking out to the ocean.
The resort has 2 restaurants, the Santan restaurant which hosts the breakfast Buffet (plus lunch and dinner) and the Sanje restaurant which has to be one of the most scenic dining locations I have ever experienced. With rustic furniture which looks like it‚Äôs made from driftwood (but very comfortable) all in white wash subtle tones broken only by splashes of colour with turquoise blue cushion on the seats, all set under tropical trees virtually right next to the beach. Sitting there of an evening watching the sun set with soothing tunes playing and subtle low key lighting, it really doesn‚Äôt get any better than that.
The food at all restaurants was magnificent, from the breakfast buffet which had one of the widest selections of food I‚Äôve seen from a buffet, let alone a breakfast buffet. All the food is very fresh and the service from the staff is exemplary. The dinners we had at the beach front Sanje Restaurant were definite highlights of our stay and we actually looked forward to dinner each day it was that good. The menu had a good selection of dishes to keep most people happy and the dessert selection, while not good for the waistline, was just too good not to indulge oneself.
There is also a full bar called Klass & Brass Lounge, tastefully appointed in 1920‚Äôs/30‚Äôs decor, where the Bar Manager Marlon does a mean Espresso Martini. Other features include a business lounge, fitness centre, boutique and money exchange.

On the 3rd day we arranged a day trip to see some of the sights of Bali. Ingrid Hotanijaya was incredibly helpful and professional in arranging the trip to take in the places we wanted to go to. Our driver Wira was exceptional, being very easy to communicate with and his knowledge of the land and culture of Bali was exemplary. We visited the Tegallalang Rice Terrace, Monkey Forest, Tegenungan Waterfall, a Balinese Temple and the Ubud markets. A fabulous day.

We treated ourselves to a 60 minute full body massage in the Kahyangan Spa which was the best I‚Äôve had in Bali. You are first seated in a relaxing room and given a traditional tea and asked what your preferences are regarding the message, before you‚Äôre given a foot salt scrub in a warm petal filled basin. The masseuse was obviously very well trained. Having had many massages in bali on previous trips, you could tell they knew what they were doing. Once finished you are shown to the ‚Äòrelaxation room‚Äô to let the whole experience sink in. An exceptional experience in a stunningly appointed spa which is well worth the money.
The resort has 2 infinity pools, one being 45 m long. Floating around in the pristine blue water with the beach literally metres away, watching the crashing surf reminds you of the stunning location this resort holds.
There is also a sunken swim up bar in the smaller of the two pools and also a Tiki bar next to the main pool.
The gardens of the resort and kept in impeccable condition with staff out before sunrise each morning picking up leaves from the lush green grass that have fallen from the palms and bushes. A beachfront pavilion / chapel sits as a main centerpiece when looking across the gardens towards the ocean, which is used for weddings (we saw two during our stay).

All in all this resort stands alone with it exceeding it‚Äôs 5 star rating standard easily. But what sets it apart from others is it‚Äôs strong theme of Balinese tradition and culture. Some contemporary resorts have all the features and service but lack any sort of authenticity or identity. The Seminyak Resort has this in spades, which to me enhances the whole experience of traveling in foreign country.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1140,still the best hotel on seminyak beach,50,January 2019,"What can I say....simply perfect Love this hotel We have now stayed here about 5 times Each time we just love it more Staff,food,pool,rooms,grounds,location and villas all 5star The new pool bar very nice and the poolside daily treats great",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1141,Best resort ever!,50,January 2019,"Stayed in the garden villa and it was an amazing experience from the minute we arrived! Staff were incredible, especially Rocky. Received a beautiful gift package for our anniversary and buffet breakfast was great. Wished we had stayed longer! Highly reccommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1142,Just amazing!!,50,January 2019,"So, I only just got here today and was so looking forward to staying here for 3 nights until I go to my next place. I must say that so far I am not disappointed. Firstly, I was stressed when I got here because after 19 hours of flying and very little sleep in over 24 hours my airline left all of my baggage in Europe, so I have nothing with me however the check in process with a very attentive guy called Adhi at front desk was just over, above and beyond exceptional. He totally calmed me down and made sure I have all the essentials for the next 24 hours until my luggage gets here, so ensuring I don't miss a day on the beach, there's kimonos in the rooms etc and he made sure that I had all my extras with toiletries too. I am in an ocean view suite - and it is just stunning, it has its own jacuzzi and I cannot wait to see the view from sky balcony in the morning. From what I have seen so far in the few hours that I have been at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa it is just beautiful service, the whole team at front desk and room service has been great and I am very much looking forward to my stay here. I will be writing another review at the end of my trip here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1143,Not the 5 star I had hoped,40,November 2018,"The resort was okay. It was nice enough but for the amount we paid, it was underwhelming having stayed in beautiful locations across the South East / Far East. Seminyak as a whole is a very tourist popular area, but for all of that it was a quiet hotel which we appreciated.

The hotel staff were very very friendly, always greeting you with a smile and were very helpful. We especially enjoyed the flowers on greeting and had great fun taking pics with those.

As muslim travellers, we requested halal food in advance - understanding that despite it being located in an otherwise Muslim dominant nation (Indonesia as a whole) it was not Muslim dominant as an island and found while the resort tried their best to cater, the selections were fairly limiting. They did do a good eggs royale in the morning - made to order. So do order that if you fancy.

The spa was excellent and would recommend both a facial and a full scrub/massage. Even picked up a cute barefoot sandal (jewellery) on the way out.

Rooms were okay. Maybe somewhat underwhelming and initially when we came into our room, it smelt funky. We had to ask for sprays and room diffusers to get rid of the swamp like smells. The cleaning was otherwise good.

It was a good hotel, with the following things to consider for improvement:
More halal food available
Rooms require a look at, especially the smells
The rooms could just be better advertised (our partial view wasn‚Äôt even that)

The plus includes AMAZING views of the water on the beach. Saw the best pink sunset ever.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1144,Amazing four day stay,50,January 2019,"Perfect place to stay for honeymooner, couples who seeks for short gateway together as well as for family with kids. situated in the heart of Seminyak, you don't need to travel afar looking for places to eat or drinks. Very polite,friendly and professional staff who's happy to cater your specific needs or request. The pool by the beach was amazing and so does the bar. Amazing place to watch the sunset with cocktails in hands. As a person who loves spa so much, I truly recommended their spa. They treat you as your are a queen or king. I was in love with their beach bag and happy to purchase one for myself but they gave it to me for free. Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1145,Beautiful hotel,40,January 2019,The Hotel is very beautiful and the staff is very nice. You have a beautiful view at the beach from the Beach Restaurant. Especially we want to thank Mrs. Tia for her nice and comfort service at the hotel bar and the Restaurant. It was a plesure for us to meet her.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1146,Loved Our Stay !,50,January 2019,"This was our first time to stay at The Seminyak but will absolutely not be our last. We stayed in one of the Beach rooms which lived up to the expectations we had. The staff could not have done more to make our stay anymore enjoyable, from a nice greeting everytime they saw us to ensuring that we had everything we ask for. We were curious with the separate building across the hotel's street and were told that it was part of the resort called the garden wing. We checked one of the rooms (thanks to the receptionist' assistance) and surprised to see that it was as spacious as our Beach rooms with exactly the same amenities, but with a better value of money and access to the main bulding's facilities. Overall, we loved our stay and will for sure come back for our summer holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1147,Disappointed as the resort has separate building with very average rooms,10,January 2019,"USD 200 per night for a room worth not more than USD 70-100. The rooms provided were in separate building and not part of the main hotel premises. Also at the time of booking the photos showed were of garden view. The name of the room is also ""Garden wing"" room.

The resort has to understand that in travel industry, such small information can be missed or not communicated well enough. Finally once the traveler arrives he/she is just disappointed and sad thinking its waste of money. Net result is bad review, even though it may not be entirely the resort's fault.

I would suggest to change the name of the room and also try to show different photos for rooms in separate buildings. Other solutions also can be thought of to avoid such disappointments.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1148,Very disappointing - Beware of separate buildings,10,January 2019,"I booked this short trip to finish my stay in Indonesia. Upon arrival at what I thought was a five star hotel I was advised our accommodation was across the road. I was flabbergasted as not at any stage during the booking process/ description or booking voucher through Amona.com was I advised that I would not be beachside. Upon this query at reception I was met with a blank face and told it would be an extra USD$50/ night to change to a beach side room.

The Garden side accommodation at best is 3 star with a horrible mouldy smell to the room.

As I am a regular traveller to Bali & have many friends who travel here I will definitely NOT RECOMMEND the Seminyak Beach Resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1149,"Terrific Location, Beautiful Property",50,January 2019,"We stayed at this property for 6 days in the first week of January 2019. What a great start to the New Year. It is a small, compact property with all the conveniences of a large one. Our ocean facing room on the 3rd floor was large, spacious and well maintained. It had a balcony with a lovely view of the ocean. The bathroom was huge, with his and her wash basins, and even had its own tub cum jacuzi!! There is a coffee machine in the room and they give you plenty of drinking water bottles (which is really thoughtful). The property is really clean and well maintained. The lawns have gazebos where you can lounge and relax. The infinity pool is right on the beach and you can view gorgeous sunsets from the pool. You do not need to go to the much hyped Ku De Ta or Potato Head for sundowners. You could easily do that from the comfort of the poolside Sanje restaurant. The hotel is walking distance from the Seminyak Centre, which is full of clubs and restaurants. The much touted Ku De Ta is next door and Potato Head Beach Club close by, as are many other popular hangouts. Breakfast by the beach at Sanje is a treat. The food is good and hospitality commendabe. We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel and would love to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Highly recommend this hotel in every regard",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1151,Fantastic stay!,50,November 2018,"Stayed here for 4 nights in one of the Garden Wing rooms. Spent most of the time enjoying the infinity pool that looks out over Seminyak beach. Although we had to cross the road from the Garden rooms to access the infinity pool it didn't bother us. The pool next to the Garden view rooms was also very nice. The a la carte breakfasts at Sanje were amazing, the best I've had at a hotel. Definitely recommend this over the breakfast buffet (which was still good for a buffet!) Beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were spacious and very clean. Close to restaurants, bars and Seminyak Square. Thank you for a wonderful stay, I would definitely stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Pros:
- Spacious bathtub with a view of the ocean
- Balcony
- Spacious room and bathroom
- Great location, close to Seminyak hot spots

Cons:
- Staff was very friendly and helpful but could be improved in terms of knowledge. We had to go back and forth regarding the key not working for our room, turns out the door lock battery was the issue

Would come back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1154,Beautiful spot to stay in Bali,50,January 2019,We have been in Bali for a few days and have stayed in two villas in addition to the Seminyak Beach Resort. The staff is very responsive to any needs you mighy have and the hotel is beautiful and sparkling clean. We arrived on New Years Eve with intentions to stay at another site but due to the traffic had to cancel those plans. A few last minute calls and the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa made repairs to a room that was not available to guests and we had a place to stay. Due to that experience and after spending time at two other villas we requested an additional 4 nights here. We had a wonderful breakfast - offerings of anything you might want and a beautiful setting to dine. If you have the opportunity don't miss the Seminyak!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1155,Great,50,January 2019,"One night here and an amazing one.. Thank you for your welcome and your hospitality. We liked breakfast and people.

1156,"Ocean View Suite a Grand Disappointment. Good service, but hotel is very Old and Tired. Can get better for same price",20,December 2018,"WARNING : DO NOT come to this hotel, there are way better options available.

Tonight is my first night at the Ocean View Suite at the Seminyak Beach Resort and I am already looking forward to my check out.

I am surprised to see the many good reviews about this hotel. Being a very frequent traveler to Bali and having stayed in many luxury resorts within Seminyak and Nusa Dua, I have good reason to believe that the good reviews are coming from either :
a) Those who have never seen good resorts in this area; or,
b) Those giving amazing reviews just have low standards, with all due respect; or,
c) Those giving the reviews just like old fashioned designs with old furniture

The pros. The view from the Ocean View Suite is decent (but take note, there are villas in front of you and garden walkways blocking the full view of the Ocean. It is only a PARTIAL VIEW, not FULL VIEW).

But the hotel is downright old, I dare say at least 20 to 30 years old (despite having undergone several renovation phases) and looks very tired. Is this deserving of a 5 star review?

There have been several renovations over time and I think the bathroom is quite decent. But the overall property gives off a very old fashioned vibe, as if it's a hotel for those above their 70s.
- The lobby is a blast from the past and looks like it was constructed in the 1970s
- The lift is made of cheap silver aluminum panels lighted with cheap white fluorescent lights and again, it looks like a scene from the 1970s. Seriously guys?
- The balcony looks very old fashioned
- The bedroom looks very old fashioned and tired, especially the cheap wooden furniture (very 1980s), even though I am given to understand the timber floor was just refurbished
- The aircon is dripping water onto my laptop and onto my old tired wooden study desk as I am writing this review
- The electrical outlet used to charge mobile phones are ""strategically"" placed on one side of the bed, while the other side has no electrical outlet whatsoever. Who planned this bedroom for you?

The point is, if you are accustomed to the well known international hotel chains with modern, well thought-out facilities, you will NOT like this old and tired ""Luxury MOTEL"". But if you have never seen any of these top hotels, then there is no basis for comparison. This hotel is run and managed by a local Indonesian and I will bluntly say that this owner does NOT have good taste in design and is very cheap with his renovation strategy.

For the price I am paying, about USD 1k per night, I know I can get a downright better suite or villa within Seminyak. One with more modern furniture and one that is not so woody, old and tired looking. I feel cheated and just CAN'T WAIT to check out of my USD 1k per night room. Never again will I ever patronize this hotel.

I will reiterate this one more time : If you are accustomed to the international 5 star hotel chains, you will NOT enjoy this hotel, even the Ocean View Suite (as mentioned, it is more like a PARTIAL VIEW of the ocean, not full view). It is most definitely NOT worth USD 1k in comparison to other newer, more modern and sophisticated options available to you in this town - FOR SLIGHTLY LESS.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1157,Stunning,50,December 2018,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. The staff are so helpful and the setting is perfect. My holiday to Bali was an eye opener as to the crisis that plastic is causing and ruining the beaches as with every tide there is tonnes of plastic washed up on the beaches which was so upsetting to see, however this hotel and the locals were on the beach all of the time to clear it all and make the beach perfect which is how it should be. It was sad to see that a few of the other hotels down the beaches didn‚Äôt bother to pick up any plastic and the beaches were littered with tourists bathing between the rubbish which I found shocking. I have utter respect for this hotel do everything that they are doing to make the holiday as stunning as this island is and should be. I will definitely be returning and wouldn‚Äôt consider any other hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1158,"All service, right beside the beach",50,December 2018,"Place is great, right beside the ocean and has the infinity pool right into the ocean. Despite there are two buildings across the street from one another it was easy to cross.

The staff are very well trained, helpful and attention to detail. We went to their Senje beach front restaurant for dinner, recommended by a good friend who lives in Bali. The location of the restaurant is right at the beach, we walk through the lovely garden to get there. The table was beautifully set up in turquoise blue and decor.

We especially loved the pool area which has a beautiful pool and view of the ocean. Service and food at the pool bar is great and good value for money. The hotel is well priced, would return any time. Make sure to get breakfast included as it is excellent!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1167,Best of the best in Seminyak,50,November 2018,"If you want a 5 Star Resort in the heart of Seminyak without the craziness - this is it! Right on the beach, a better view than Potato Head. We stayed in their garden suites across the street and those were (less expensive) just as nice and easily accessible. Gorgeous infinity pool we spent all of our time at! Do the a la carte breakfast instead of the buffet and sit at their little cafe by the ocean. So great!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1168,Romantic 4 day stay,50,November 2018,"Arrived late Thursday night but the welcome was wonderful as expected. Kindly showed us the working of the room facilities.

Two places for Breakfast. The Buffet excellent. Sanje on the beach offers an al carte breakfast and a lovely fruit/chia bowl smoothie. (Great start to the day)

The staff are always friendly and accommodating. Nothing is too much for them.

We had a beach wing room and requested the ground floor terrace. It was wonderful to sit on the terrace and look out to the garden in the morning.

The pool was wonderful looking out to the beach. And service was lovely around the pool even laying out our towels.

Offered afternoon tea/coffee and the breakfast restaurant with fruit smoothies and cakes. Very nice.

The do the turn down service in the evening.

This is a great location for peace and quiet.
Room service was quick and not on the menu, just ask, see what they can do for you.
There is a money changer at the hotel during the day.
I found no authorised changers on the street as its the quiter area of seminyak. But short less than 10min walk to Seminyak Village.
We didnt use the Resort Spa as it was short walk to reputable spas on the street.
We would definitely return for a lovely indulgent couples stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1169,great stay,50,October 2018,"Me and my husband came here for our honeymoon. we stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. Great central location so you can walk where you need.
The room was so lovely, great d√©cor and very spacious. TV in the bath‚Ä¶.wow!!

The staff were very helpful, breakfast was very good with lots of options. Afternoon tea that was included each day was a nice touch. They place little treats in your room each day and also surprised us with a flower bath (was amazing).
checking in and out was very quick and efficient. The pool was amazing, lovely views especially at sunset.

loved our stay here and would defiantly recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1170,Solid Seminyak Resort,40,October 2018,"Stayed one night. They held luggage for several days while we traveled else where in Indonesia. Front desk staff was extremely nice and provided an enthusiastic welcome. Stayed for honeymoon and received special set up in room with flower petal bath and candles everywhere.

One of the best pools of hotels we stayed at in Bali with an exquisite views of ocean and beautiful sunset. Excellent poolside service with drinks food and happy hour but food itself only average.

Breakfast buffet was out of this world. We still don‚Äôt understand how they served food from four different continents and and it still gelled together so well.

Overall a great stay, only improvement could be bigger room and better poolside food and room service food.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1171,Bali,50,November 2018,The hotel was in a great location about 5 to 10 min walk to the beach/ restaurants and bars. The room was nice and for the price you can‚Äôt beat it. The staff was friendly and will help set up any activities you want in advance. The hotel also set up a personal driver to the airport for a small cost.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1172,Corporate trip,50,November 2018,Nice breakfast and the staff are helpful!!! Big rooms and it's located in the quiet area of seminyak. Although our rooms were on the other side of the road it gave us some privacy and it has a small pool as well. We came early in the morning and they help us check in from the airport. What a service!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1173,"AVOID ""across the street"" or ""independent building"" rooms",30,November 2018,"It is our second time staying with the resort. Last time we booked beach wing rooms and felt the stay was pleasant.

This time, not reading the fine prints carefully enough, we booked ""independent building"" across the street. While they do offer buggy to take us to the other building and still have access to all facilities in the resort, the stay was not pleasant at all.

The room is very wet and moist, our first night we felt itchy after night of sleep as if there was flea. We asked the linen to be changed and a machine to be put to de-moisturize. It did not help, the room still felt very humid and wet. It was very comfortable to relax in the room despite they offer great range of TV channels.

Fruits were only provided on the first day of checking in. Asked housekeeping whether new ones will be provided, the boy replied yes and I gave him some tips as he changed our linen that day, too. Next day no fruits were provided at all, disappointed.

Pool: It has great sunset view from the pool and walk to beach. You are literally getting torched the entire afternoon as there is no angle for umbrella to provide a shade for you. Either keep applying sunblock or cover up. Luckily we brought strongk Australian sunblocks and we were not burnt at the end of the day. Tapas and drinks are exceptionally good, but price is just average.

Service: Just average, asked about airport drop-off service from resort and was told it is US$38.00 while a taxi only cost about 100K IDR ($7USD or 10$AUD). It would be much better if you just reply, they could arrange a taxi for the guest rather than quoting USD$38.00.

Once again, it is a decent resort to stay and location-wise it has great access to shops, restaurant and bars in Seminyak. Beach is great. However, JUST AVOID ""ACROSS THE STREET"" ROOMS. Please do check fine prints while booking!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1174,GREAT HONEY MOON,50,October 2018,"i was in seminyak beach hotel for my honeymoon from 30sep til 05oct.
it is very nice and luxury hotel and resort for couples ans honeymooners.
great infinity pool , good beach area , so beautiful garden , luxury spa and traditional fruits for breakfast. nice location and easy access to shops restaurants and bars.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1175,Luxurious beachside hotel,50,September 2018,Beautiful hotel set on the beachfront of Seminyak close to many shops and restaurants. Staff extremely friendly and always helpful. For those staying in the Beach Wing rooms this is seperate from the main hotel across the road. Breakfast choice of either a buffet or set dishes. Infinity pool is amazing with fabulous views of the beach. Mainly couples with small number of families.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1176,Amazing hotel for relaxing,50,October 2018,"As i sit in the lobby waiting for our taxi back to the airport i write this review.
Thinking back on the last 10 days of our holiday and how amazing it has been. This hotel couldn't have been any better, what with the smiling and happy staff that are pleased to see you and make your stay that much more pleasant.
The hotel made you feel so relaxed with tranquil music in the background so everything flowed.

We had the garden room which was a nice size, very clean and the bed was a good size too. We had fresh fruit every third day after the room was cleaned, they also do a bed turning down service on a evening to see if you needed anything.

The breakfast which we had included with the room was really nice. The food was a mixture of western and traditional. So you could mix it up. With bacon, eggs and curry. Or you could have breakfast by the beach in the other restaurant which was a set menu. The spainsh eggs was my favourite with a smoothie bowl, fresh juice and coffee too.

Our last night and we managed to get a upgrade to a one room garden villa with pool. (Extra cost) so worth it
We spent the evening chilling in the room ordered in house dinner and just relaxed.
Next morning sorted our cases but with no rush as we was still swimming in our own pool not even thinking about the flight.
Ask one of the staff if it was possible for some petals for the bath for the mrs. Within 10 minutes he came back with two bags of different coloured flower petals.

Even checking out was easy, they come collect your bags sort out whats owed and done. Now just sitting here with time to write this. If you get chance then book this place you will not regret it.

Have a great holiday",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1177,Beach and sunset!,50,October 2018,"A wonderful hotel with an exceptional location, hotel is on the beach (beautiful sunsets) yet shopping and restaurants in Seminyak are very close by. Staff are all exceptionally friendly (especially many thanks to Oka). We (2 adults and 2 children) stayed 3 nights there mid October 2018 and we can highly recommend this hotel! Our stay was juts perfect!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1178,Robert P.,50,October 2018,"We had the best time here for the moment our cab droped us in front of the hotel. Extremly friendly and helpful staff, beautiful scenery both with gardens and at the pool/beach and a great variety of meals to try from. They have everyday yoga classes, which was a great plus and you are right in the center of Seminyak. We really had a great experience here and would love to come back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1179,Absolutely perfect,50,September 2018,"I am lucky enough to have stayed a many 5 start resorts before and i can honestly say The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is one of the best ones I have ever stayed. The service was perfect. Friendly prompt staff. Always smiling always willing to assist. Wonderful buffet breakfast, both western & classic Indonesian. The infinity pool is perfect. Especially if you want those perfect Seminyak sunsets without the hustle of the beach club. And the rooms are 10/10!! Finally. location is PERFECT!!! Walking distance to all the best cafes & restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1180,Luxury and location!,50,September 2018,"My friends and I recently stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa in September for three nights during our nine night holiday in Bali. Oh, how I wish we got to stay longer at this gorgeous resort!

From the moment my friends and I arrived we were treated so kindly - the customer service was exceptional. In fact, one night my friend was quite unwell and a staff member (who noticed this at the reception area) brought up tea and cookies for her!

Location is spot on - we were a short walk to cafes and restaurants, massage and beauty salons, boutiques and markets, and of course, the beach!

Our Ocean View Room was just as beautiful as the views from its balcony...and spa (the spa windows overlooked the beach - so romantic).

The lush garden and footpaths lead us to the infinity pool and beachfront Sanje Bar and Restaurant. I like that this resort is high end but encapsulates Bali style and culture with it's buildings and gardens.

The infinity pool and area was spacious and stunning. I spent a lot of time here, soaking up the sun, occasionally with a passion fruit granita in hand.

We were lucky enough to experience the 'Monster Pizza' from Sanje Restaurant, which needs to be ordered one day in advance. A must-try, so order on check-in! Plus, you need to experience the views from this dining area. A moment when you can sit and absorb the surroundings and truly feel bliss.

The breakfast buffet was plentiful which made it difficult not to want to try a little bit of everything. The various cuisine and juices were freshly made and the coffee was great too!

It's been a month since I stayed at the resort and the memories are still fresh in my mind. This was definitely one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at for many reasons. I know I will be back, hopefully sooner than later!
If you want to holiday like a king or queen then this luxury resort and its amazing staff will welcome you like it's your palace!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1181,Beautiful hotel with a couple downsides,40,October 2018,"The Seminyak Beach Resort was a nice way to end our trip in Bali.

The rooms were nice and clean and the hotel was located in a central area. There were plenty of restaurants to walk to. The breakfast buffet was awesome, offering traditional Balinese meals in addition to western food like omelette bars, etc. I also couldn‚Äôt get enough of their fresh fruits, juices, and adorable decorated hot lattes. One morning I got an elephant design on my coffee and it was beyond cute.

Prices at the pool and restaurants were a bit high compared to what you could get outside the resort, but overall fairly reasonable. While at the pool, we frequently would walk to the beach to get Bintang beer for $2 USD!

I only had a few gripes when it came to this resort:
1. At check-in, you are basically forced if you don‚Äôt have cash to charge over $200 to your credit card. This is absolutely ridiculous, as it takes over 2 weeks to get your money back after check-out. The hotel should change their policy to be similar with the US (get the card for their files and charge $1 to ensure it processes, and then more if necessary following check-out). I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait to get over $200 back into my account.
2. We had a beach wing room. The traffic outside was close and very loud. It was hard to sleep at night when you hear constant horns and cars/motorcycles driving by.
3. The beach. I guess my point with this is don‚Äôt come to Bali for the beaches. The views are nice when their isn‚Äôt litter and plastic all along the sand. It also didn‚Äôt smell like a beach, but similar to an outhouse. However, this isn‚Äôt the hotels fault necessarily. The hotel pools made up for beach disappointment though. They were beautiful and the pool bar and pool bar staff were great!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1182,Honeymoon 2018!,50,October 2018,"My husband and I spent 3 nights and 4 days here to finish up our Bali honeymoon. The resort itself is beautiful, very luxurious and beautiful grounds. We had one hiccup in the beginning after we checked into our room and after speaking to the manager he went above and beyond and upgraded us right away. The customer service was amazing and truly helped make our final days of our honeymoon impeccable. The pools are also amazing and room service was very quick. If you have the chance to stay here, you definitely should!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1183,Perfect in every way!,50,September 2018,"Absolutely beautiful hotel. Staff are amazing, rooms are beautiful and the pool overlooking the beach is to die for! We splashed out on this hotel to have a treat for a couple of nights during our 10 night stay in Bali and we‚Äôre so glad we did! From the moment we arrived the experience was incredible! We‚Äôd mentioned it was our anniversary and we were greeted with a massive bunch of roses on arrival! We were booked into the garden wing and were a little apprehensive due to some of the reviews we read but apart from a short walk across the road you wouldn‚Äôt know you weren‚Äôt in the main hotel building! The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you, the facilities are amazing, food is to die for and the views and sunsets are incredible! Don‚Äôt hesitate to book this hotel, you won‚Äôt regret it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1184,The Perfect Stay,50,October 2018,"We spent the last 2 nights of our holiday here and unlike the other days we decided to stop, relax and enjoy this resort. We spent our time enjoying the infinity pool and walks on the beach. Breakfast was beautiful! A lovely selection. The staff are wonderful. We experienced the spa and it was a delight. The only downside was: We booked the garden view room but we weren‚Äôt informed that it was across the street in another area and not in the main building area, it would‚Äôve been nice to have been informed of that, but that didn‚Äôt ruin the fun holiday! I‚Äôll definitely return here for my next Bali adventure ‚ù§Ô∏è",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1185,Our Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa Holiday - a huge success!,50,October 2018,"A very special family holiday. We nailed our accommodation and it was everything we could have hoped for. Loved it!

Loved our two bedroom private villa, the infinity pools. swim up bar, on site restaurants, magnificent buffet breakfasts, pool side dining, yoga sessions, friendly professional staff, the grounds and gardens, the glorious sunsets.

So much to love and we will definitely be back to The Seminyak. Easy to recommend.

Huge thanks to Oka Beny and Ogy Windu also, for looking after us so beautifully during our stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1186,Another fabulous stay,50,September 2018,"My daughter & i enjoyed another fabulous stay at this superb Seminyak hotel. We are able to stay in the same room as last year, so felt we were returning home. Ground floor beach side with an exit directly to the beach & pool area from our front door. Everything was superb, the lovely start to the day with yoga- gentle sounds of the ocean & bali coming to life, to add to the magic. Followed up by a delicious breakfast- we tried both ocean front & the buffet & loved them both. Days relaxing by the pool- every lounge has a pool/ocean view as the infinity pool is huge. Live music in the late afternoon to add to the ambience. We loved the new boardwalk, beach access & deck area following the renovations & enjoyed manager's drinks in the beach Bar. The hotel gym is also excellent. I have been coming to Bali for 40 years & have seen huge changes, not all favourable. The Seminyak retains an authentic Balinese ambience, with 5 star elegance and is the perfect island retreat. I shall look forward to our return next year.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1187,Luxury,50,August 2018,"Expensive, but exactly what you would expect for that price! Every kind of comfort, supernice and committed staff, into a glittering marble and tropical tree place. Astonishing sunset on a hard and wavy sea. Luxury.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1188,Pure Luxury for a special Honeymoon,50,September 2018,"My wife and I spent 8 wonderful nights at this truly spectacular hotel. It really made the last segment of our honeymoon special.

The hotel itself looks beautiful. It's location right on a private section of Seminyak beach makes it the most relaxing setting, with unparalleled views of the Indian Ocean and those famous Bali sunsets. Given the pool area is right next to the beach as well, it's everything you could wish for to be able to spend the day relaxing in amazing sunshine. The hotel grounds and gardens are maintained beautifully as well, which adds to the quality of the hotel.

We stayed in an Ocean View suite and we could not have wished for a better room. It was massive with an amazing jacuzzi included. They really made an effort to make the room look great for our arrival, even including 2 cakes for us to enjoy our first night there. The bed was very comfortable!

The staff here were truly wonderful as well. Always there to help you with a smile and recommend things to do in and around the local area. Big shout out to the staff at the pool area as well - everyday they serve and help you with smiles on their faces and wonderful senses of humour.

We had lunch a few times around the pool area. The food is of a grill nature (burgers, sandwiches, etc) which were very tasty. Although it did feel a bit samey and limited at one stage, we did learn that you could also order from the other restaurants they have in the resort too. Also, the Sanje restaurant is beach side and has a very healthy and varied lunch menu too, so a lovely setting to have lunch away from the pool area.

The location of this hotel was fantastic as well. It's about 10 minutes walk from the main street in Seminyak where all of the nice bars and restaurants are. Ku De Ta is right next door and Potato Head about 15 mins walk away. Perfect for strolls in the evenings to sample Seminyak's finest. We decided to head out each evening for dinner as the hotel restaurants did seem a little quiet for us, probably due to it not being the busiest season.

We only had one slight grumble while there, in that the service in the Sanje restaurant at breakfast time was slow. We complained to management one morning about the wait and quality of the breakfast, which was handled incredibly professionally and they could not apologies enough. A very minor issue and certainly does not stop me giving the hotel a 5* review.

Thank you so much to everyone at the hotel for making our honeymoon spectacular. Highly recommend this place to anyone, especially for honeymoon, and we would love to come back again sometime.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1189,Beach Paradise in Seminyak,50,October 2018,"Hotel is located beachfront, perfect for surfers to enjoy the beach and the magnificent sunset. Also perfect for swimmers to enjoy the sunset from
the infinity pool. I hung out mostly in the other lap pool by the Sanje Restaurant so I could hop into pool, beach n restaurant.

We liked the place so much we also stayed for the Fisherman‚Äôs nite dinner at Sanje. Good food and friendly staff, with the waves as our background, what a lovely evening.

What a perfect time in Seminyak! üòÉ",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1190,Best way to see Bali!,50,September 2018,"I visited The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa early September, and it was the first time for me to visit Bali. Given its strategic location, I think it's the best hotel to stay in when visiting Bali.

As a woman from the Arabian Gulf Region, I enjoy my privacy. We booked an Ocean View Villa room and it was exactly as we had expected. The room was spacious, the pool is completely private, and slept to the sounds of the soothing Ocean.

My favorite thing about the hotel is how attentive the staff are, and they are very detailed oriented. Even the guards outside the hotel, knew our names and greeted us personally.

I've never been a fan of room service food generally, but The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa's menu is delicious. Their margharita pizza is one of the best I had in my life, and it's very diverse with Mediterranean and Arabic dishes on the menu so it's good for Arabs who like to eat their food when away on holiday.

Also, the property is huge, and you have access to a large stretch of beach where you can go surfing or simply take a nice, long sunset walk.

The hotel is highly secure, and every vehicle is checked before entry.

The best part, is that the city's hustle and bustle and nightlife is only a short walk away. From fashion, to furniture, to markets and malls, you will always have something to do at night.

I'll definitely be coming back and this time I'm staying more than 4 days!

1191,Great location on the beach and fabulous breakfast,50,October 2017,"We stayed from July 5 to July 10 2017. Friends from Switzerland were staying at the same resort. We stayed across the road but used the facilities on the other side (main part of hotel) of the road for breakfast, restaurants and the large swimming pool. Location is good, right on the beach. Breakfast is probably the best I have had. Huge buffet plus a-la-carte menu which is to die for. The granola yoghurt cereal was a must every morning. Eggs cooked to perfection. They also offer complimentary afternoon tea. Breakfast is served overlooking the luxurious pool facilities.
My only gripe is the $300 deposit on arrival. While this is fully refundable, it would be better to be informed of this prior and that you can budget/plan for it.

Overall a fabulous hotel!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1192,Fantastic! Without fault.,50,September 2018,"Highly recommend. We were a little concerned we were across the road from main resort but it didn‚Äôt make a difference. It was absolutely fantastic. Great food on offer, great service, great pool with ocean views, great location. We checked out of the terrible Saranam and came back so actually stayed twice it was so good. Will definitely bring the family back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1193,Amazing,50,September 2018,"Stayed in 2 Bedroom Villa. Cleanness and facilities were amazing. Staff made the trip nothing was too much for them,especially when you are unwell. They are always happy and welcoming. Location is perfect, the facilities are amazing from the pools to the wellness centres. Breakfast buffet is wonderful the only fault which is small is the soy milk.
Room was very well equipped and clean again another fault but totally personal is the bed was too hard.
Look forward to our return visit",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1194,Amazing week with an amazing pool,50,September 2018,"The seminyak Beach resort is awesome.
We choosed this hotel for our first week on bali.
The staff, the rooms, the restaurants, the pool, etc. is fantastic. There was nothing we missed throughout the week.

Our room cleaner Made Adi helped us out alot with special requests and he has done a perfect job with our room. He even left us a small note on our last night.

We also met Marlon at the pool bar. He comes original from Ubud and gave us lots of great Infos for our trip to Ubud and makes great espresso too.

The Beach resort has two restaurants you can choose from. One of the restaurants is located directly at the beach. So you can order great food with an ocean view and a sea breeze.

We we're lucky to have the two weighters Superman and Chrisna several times.
Both of them went over and beyond to creat the best atmosphere and dining experience possible. We really appreciate the evenings with them.

The infinity pool is the best pool I've seen so far.
While relaxing in the deck chairs the border between the pool and the ocean is vanishing so you feel like your laying on the beach.
You get a beach feeling with out having sand everywhere.

We're honestly sad that we haven't booked a second week here but there is so much more to see on bali.

Definitely we would book this hotel again and will refer it to everyone that want to stay in seminyak.

We thank all the staff for such a great experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1195,I was brought tea & cookies - best service ever!,50,September 2018,"This was such a lovely experience! When I was very sick the hotel staff brought me complimentary cookies and hot tea to make me feel better. Absolutely amazing service! I'd like to make special mention to Endi who was always so happy to help with whatever we needed, he make it such a treasured experience. The buffet breakfast was delicious with a range of savoury, sweet and international foods to suit all people. Highly recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1196,Amazing hotel,50,September 2018,"What can I say, loved every minute staying here. Right in the centre of Seminyak easy to get to all the great restaurants and bars. Highlight is the main infinity pool next to the pool. The staff cannot be more lovely and helpful. Gutted to be going home!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1197,"Balinese style, great service, great location",50,June 2018,"I am of the opinion that if you are going to travel overseas, you need to stay in accommodation that reflects the country you are in rather than a sterile, super-modern place where although very nice, really, you could be anywhere.
This resort has an ambience that makes you feel like you are in Bali. The food is great, the bar and poolside service is exceptional. The location is fabulous- on the beach but past the noisy, music-pumping areas. It's a very short walk to shops, restaurants, bars and beach clubs if that's what you want to do. There are poolside lounges, cabanas, beach-facing beds. It's lovely.
It probably wouldn't be the place to go with lots of very young kids or if you want a big party/booze/bar atmosphere.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1198,Beautiful hotel and amazing staff,50,September 2018,"Stayed here after 4 nights in Singapore looking for relaxation and a break

This is exactly what we received , from the first day to the last , every and I mean every member of staff were amazing

Had a beach side rooms and this was so clean , always being cleaned and staff wanting to know if needed anything

The infinity pool and ocean is a view I never stopped being in awe of...

Excellent breakfast and lunches also , the pool bbq does great steak sandwich

I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in ... just amazing and my words and pictures don‚Äôt do it justice

Thank you to all staff for amazing holiday",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1199,Amazing hotel for my honeymoon stay,50,August 2018,"This is an excellent hotel resort! As first time visitors to Seminyak, the staff went above and beyond to cater to all of our needs and make us feel welcome. We stayed in one of the Ocean Villas which was truly sensational and well maintained. I honestly cannot find a single fault with this place and would be back in a heartbeat! As a honeymooner, this was one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at for relaxation and it's prime beach front location made it the perfect setting for us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1201,I'll be back!,50,August 2018,"Perfect! This place is visually stunning and such a beautiful place to relax. What really made my stay here exceptional was the customer service from the staff - every staff member I encountered warmly greeted me and made me feel special (I was travelling solo). The customer service, from the housekeeping staff to the General Manager who asked how my stay was on my last day, was more than 5 star service. A special mention to Darma, Rudi and all of the other staff who worked at the pool and the Sanje restaurant by the beach. I had dinner at Sanje twice and the food was excellent and delicious, and what a beautiful spot along the beach, it was spectacular. I had an amazingly huge room with a balcony looking over the ocean. But the infinity pool - wow! I don't have words to describe how relaxing it was lying by the pool looking over the ocean, just beautiful. I also want to thank Mr Wira at the front office and ""Ayu"" (sorry about the spelling). Breakfast at Sanje restaurant is a must! The healthiest, most delicious breakfasts I've ever had. I can't wait to come back here for longer next time. I highly recommend The Seminyak if you are going to Bali. Suksma!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1202,First time in Seminyak but not Bali,50,September 2018,"The surrounding in the resort is so peaceful, and our room can still hear the waves at the beach. The are 2 places you can breakfast. Santan is the main restuarant that serve breakfast. Although the buffet spread is not big, quality is ok. Unfortunately, there is no view in the restaurant to see the ocean. The restaurant is Sanje. They serve ala carte Healthy Breakfast with a view of the ocean. 1 point to take note, on alternate day, the breakfast tables are arranged in different location. We feel if the sun is strong and the number of umbrella are not enough, it may be too sunny.

The edgeless pool is wonderful with ample deck chairs and umbrellas. With a breathtaking view of the sea. We really enjoyed suntanning by the pool.

The hotel room, is big. With no double sink and with nice enough bathtub. 1 thing missing is a sofa area or lounge chair to rest or eat if you order room service.

There is only 2 lifts near the front desk, so handicapped guests may not find it handicap friendly enough.

Overall, we love staying in Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort even though the traffic jam is horrible.

I would recommend friends to stay there....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1203,Honeymooners,40,August 2018,"We stayed here for 14 nights and was a honeymoon to remember.
A beautiful hotel with stunning grounds, very clean and tidy at all times.
Staff were so friendly from morning until the evening, greeting you and they couldn‚Äôt do anymore for you whether that‚Äôs helping you at breakfast, room service, ordering taxis, advising on places to visit or even just helping to get you towels out and put up your umbrella around the pool area. You can tell they pride themselves on customer service. One morning, my husband wasn‚Äôt very well and left breakfast, one of the lady‚Äôs came over to me noticed he wasn‚Äôt there, I told her he was unwell and she offered to send ginger tea and some croissants to make him feel better - just one example of how the staff go above and beyond for their customers.
The pool area is just stunning, so clean, peaceful and relaxing because you can hear the sounds of the waves crashing all day, good food menu and cocktail choices - drinks are a little on the pricey side but kind of expect that within a resort, also could do with more variety on the music around the pool but I think we picked up on that staying for 14 nights. The view of the sunset is unforgettable - so beautiful!
Only downside is there is no atmosphere in the evenings, it‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre the only ones staying there as no-one seemed to use the bar or restaurants in the evening. Usually me and my husband like to get back to the hotel after being out exploring and have a few drinks when we get back but there just wasn‚Äôt anyone around. As I said before the food and drinks are quite pricey within the hotel and if you go out you can find somewhere to eat and drink for much cheaper, that‚Äôs all I could put it down to.
As for honeymooners, on arrival they were great! We got the usual service of drinks, nice conversation with the gentleman that greeted us and someone to show us our room. We stayed in a beach side ocean view room and it was beautiful! Very spacious, tidy, nice decor. They‚Äôd even put rose petals in the bath and on the bed and a few other lovely touches in our room for when we arrived, which was special however after that we didn‚Äôt have anymore special treatment for honeymooners, which was a little disappointing (not to sound ungrateful but you only get to go on your honeymoon once!).
Their location is second to none, walk out of the hotel and there‚Äôs shops/bars/restaurants with short walking distance. Lots to explore in Seminyak!!
I would 100% recommend to stay at this resort, certainly was a memorable honeymoon, a trip we won‚Äôt forget. Thank you to all the staff at Seminyak Beach Resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1204,Balimoon,50,August 2018,"We‚Äôve just finished an incredible stay here at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. We arrived after 23 hours of travelling and the smile we were greeted with was so welcoming and made us feel at home. You have a refreshing towel & drink whilst you‚Äôre completing the check-in process. A call out we weren‚Äôt aware of was that you had to pay a 7m Rp deposit, around ¬£400 against a credit card or withdraw the cash. We‚Äôd already paid upfront and I normally expect around a ¬£100 pre authorisation or a card swipe.

That wasn‚Äôt the hotels fault but I didn‚Äôt know about it so we had to sort that first and being a little delirious for travelling it‚Äôd have been good to know as I would have been prepared with a card.

The service at this resort is outstanding. Everyone smiles, says hello and asks how you are, day and night. The hotel security will stop taxis for you and make sure you and the driver know where you‚Äôre going (and for how much!).

The breakfast service is great here, a mix of western and Asian foods, catering to all tastes. The staff are so friendly, especially Nika and her helping teach us Balinese was great too and you can see the staff appreciate you speaking local language too.

Our room was fab, a ground floor ocean wing room. The room was cleaned twice a day, once in the Am and then a nightly turndown service around 7pm. They even folded clothes and tied up your charging wires too. Brilliant.

The beach scene here is one to be envious of and you see people admiring as they walk up and down Seminyak Beach. The view out to the Indian Ocean from the infinity pool is amazing and the sunset is incredible. The pool side service is ace, glass cleaning service, complimentary canap√© service and food & drinks poolside on demand, with a smile. The staff even help you set up, lay your towels and put your umbrella up and down. The General Manager helped us one morning too, he‚Äôs very hands-on and present around the resort. There‚Äôs plenty of sunbeds, you can arrive at 10, 12, 1pm and find sunbeds looking out to sea allowing you to just sit back, relax and enjoy every moment whenever you want, no rushing.

The hotel has a great location, just a 10 minute walk from Seminyak square and near numerous minimarts. You can even get a taxi back of an evening for 30k (if you‚Äôre feeling lazy!). One night we were shattered from being with our private driver and we had food delivered from a restaurant and reception rang us when they had arrived - winner!

This is definitely one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in and highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a luxury Seminyak escape.

1205,"Perfect, a dream!",50,August 2018,"This hotel is truly a 5-stat hotel,
from the amazing room with balcony and sea view. The rooms are very well designed, you can litterally take a shower or jaccuzi with the sea view.

The infinity pool is so beautiful with the sea right behind. You can take beautiful pictures. It‚Äôs a spacious hotel, with nice gardens where you chill and relax on beds. The breakfast was really good, a good mix of local and international. The service is top notch overall.

We barely had to get out of the hotel, it was so nice. I would recommed this place without a shadow of a doubt.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1206,Wonderful Hotel,50,September 2018,A great place to stay in seminyak. The rooms are very luxurious and was well prepared for our honeymoon. The staff is very accommodating and the food was great. We would love to visit it again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1207,Personification of elegance,50,September 2018,"Our little 2 night treat for my Wife‚Äôs 60th Birthday Bali tour. Sublime!

Arrived with knee injury and immediately they presented me with a wheel chair, 20 mins later a doctor; seamless.
Hadi, the GEM, is without doubt the best ‚Äúfront of house‚Äù ever, coordinating a room nearer the lift, being just one example of the staffs commitment to customer satisfaction.
It‚Äôs top draw on every level and the rooms are stunning.

Food and drinks are realistically priced given its 5 star status.

Bucket list venue.
I‚Äôm 80% there now, like Hadi, thanks to the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spar",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1208,So nice,50,August 2018,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was just a dream! The room was beautiful, so luxurious and a huge bathroom. The main pool was beautiful, nice loungers right on the beach so you get a lovely sea breeze! We would love to stay here again couldn‚Äôt recommend enough!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1209,Beautiful beachfront hotel,50,August 2018,"We stayed at The Seminyak for the first leg of our honeymoon, and it was overall wonderful! The rooms were nice, and the service was great as well.

The highlights are definitely the amazing beachfront infinity pool and the Sanje restaurant! It‚Äôs spectacular, but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get a lounge chair so be sure to go earlier in the day because people usually stake out their spot for hours on end. You can also have amazing juices and healthy bowls at Sanje by the beach.

My only constructive criticism is a bit niche. I‚Äôm a yoga instructor and avid practitioner myself, so I was excited to see that there were daily yoga classes offered every morning! My husband is very VERY beginner level at yoga, but they assured him it was a class for all levels. During the class, the teacher tended to push the beginner level students beyond a point I would consider safe. We practiced next to an older woman (mid to late 60s), and I was starting to get concerned with the adjustments and directions given to her and my beginner husband. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude by correcting the teacher during class, but afterwards my husband complained about hurting himself during yoga. It‚Äôs been about 5 days, and he‚Äôs still sore from the unsafe adjustments.

Aside from the yoga class, I would absolutely recommend this to everyone - couples, single travelers, and families! It‚Äôs a fantastic vacation spot, and I hope we return again soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1210,Back to our favorite hotel after the renovations,50,August 2018,"We purposely booked the newly renovated wing rooms.
They are really spacious, nicely designed and the bathroom is very nice (bath tube and a separate rain shower cabin).
Facilities are great.

Staff is so well trained, so professional, smiley and attentive. Management is doing a great job.
Wine menu is better than before. You have really nice affordable wine for the pool, especially the Gris Blanc from Bertrand Gerard that you can drink like water while enjoying the sunset at pool.

Our only concern was the pool side.

The day before leaving the hotel, we contacted Mr. Michael, GM of this amazing establishment, to give him our feedback of the renovations.

He has been very reactive, so we met him the day of our departure during a fantastic lunch at Sanje. The lunch will be reviewed in another post.
He took note of our feedback, that were 99% positive. This behavior belongs only to great managers. We spent a fantastic lunch sharing our experiences.
He shared with us his mid/long term expectations for his hotel and we can tell you that they are great.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1211,Nice Resort,40,August 2018,"The Seminyak is a beautiful place to have relaxed holidays. Main building, pool and beachfront are excellent zu what I do not recommend is to book a room in the separate gardenwing. It‚Äôs across the street with a lot of traffic noise and nobody is at the pool at all.
Rooms are very well equipped, clean and in a modern Balinese style.
Breakfast and coffee is great!!
It‚Äôs my second stay at the hotel and with a good offer I would also go back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1212,Authentic Balinese Paradise on Happening Seminyak Beach,50,August 2018,"We stayed for 2 nights at the resort. Received by the friendly staff presenting frangipani lei and refreshing welcoming drinks. The resort area is decorated with Balinese element, which we like. The resort staff are so friendly and attentive.

Our spacious room at level 3 has a nice view of the ocean and part of the lush garden. Even has an in-room jacuzzi with ocean view! They have all amenities you need. The bed is comfortable. Love the pillows too. We slept so well. However, tap water in the resort is a little salty. Bottled drinking water are provided anyway.

The hotel always has floral fragrance, especially at night. Love the flowers along the corridor called ""Sedap Malam"". There is a chapel in the garden, facing the ocean, it was decorated for wedding event. Simply romantic. Instead of relaxing at one of the gazebo in the garden, we spent our noon time hanging out by the amazing beachfront infinity pool.

In the evening, we had our Balinese massage at Khayangan SPA. Very professional and personalized massage. The massage was gentle yet with adequate pressure. Much relief on my shoulders after that. It was so relaxing. Thanks to Tini!

It was overall a pleasant, relaxing short stay.

*Thank you Ingrid for the warm welcome and took care of us! You are a star :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1213,Stunning location excellent service,50,August 2018,"A beautiful hotel with its centre piece beingthe newly refurbished pool area with direct and panoramic views of the sea. Unfortunately there was a tendency to switch music in during the day, which above the noise of the wonderful crashing waves gave out a nasty base boom, however on request it was switched off and other guests expressed their relief! I suspect when the sea is Super calm it might be ok to play gentle music...

We chose to stay in the cheaper garden wing rooms and walk across the road to the main hotel. Rooms are good but older in decor , ours included a dehumidifier as well as aircon and all that you would expect - except for the hairdryer (the type that is weak and takes forever to dry your hair - I did mention to GM and will add a picture of suggestedmidel that the very good Body Works spa nearby uses - at least have a few good hairdryers on site for fussy guests!) The other room issue is poor lighting for ladies wishing to apply makeup! The breakfast was impressive, the service TOP notch. We also ate one evening at their small restaurant overlooking the sea, also good. My current fav restaurant in Bali is Sarong!

We really love this hotel and will be back - will have to pack my hairdryer though!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1214,Just wonderful!,50,August 2018,"We stayed here 7 nights and were absolutely amazed by the location, staff, and resort. I highly recommend it here and could ask for anything better. The food is awesome, the staff is even better, and the resort has an amazing pool!! Just beautiful!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1215,Outstandingly relaxed hoiday,50,August 2018,Magical spot smack on the beach yet a short stroll into the bustle of Seminyak. Amazing pool to lounge around with very attentive staff who look to meet your every need. Has a great night with their cultural evening and Okta and Bobbi deserve special mention. We will be back for sure.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1216,"Great hotel, don't eat there except for brakfast",40,August 2018,"This is a very nice hotel. Great facilities, great people. Service is slow for this price point. Not enough service people. Breakfast is good, but the rest of the food is mediocre at best. Great location. You can walk to great restaurants and shopping. For food, make reservations at least a day in advance at Bikini, Cu De Ta, Chanti, Caum, Potato Head",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1217,An unforgettable honeymoon,50,August 2018,"We enjoyed our 6 days stay at the Seminyak Beach & Spa Hotel very much.
It is a quiet, well-tended complex that is especially charming because of its infinity pool as well as its direct access to the beach and its lovely mediterranean restaurant with a relaxing ocean view.
The personnel is very friendly and courteous.
However, one of the staff members, called Ketut Suardiasa, cares about the guests' well-being in a very outstanding way.
We would definitely come back again!

1218,absolutely 5 star,50,August 2018,"This was our first time at the Seminyak beach spa and resort but will not be our last. We stayed in one of the ocean view pool villas which lived up to the expectations we had. The staff could not have done more to make our stay anymore enjoyable,from simple advice to ensuring that everything we needed was organized behind the scenes. A special mention to both Ogy and Benny who always seemed to be in the right place when we needed help, they are truly helpful and happy to assist.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1219,Amazing Hotel and Super Friendly Staff,50,August 2018,"Cannot say enough good things about this hotel.
My girlfriend and I stayed here for 9 nights and enjoyed every minute. We stayed in the Garden Wing and the rooms were amazing! Don‚Äôt be put off by staying across the road, it literally is no more than a few steps before your in the main hotel and there is no difference in quality. The Garden Wing pool is also a lovely quiet spot as most guests head to the main pool.
The staff are extremely helpful and go out of there way to make you feel welcome. Pool area is perfect for a cold drink and watching the waves crash in to the beach. Even when the sun beds were all taken, a member of staff called Sang kindly asked us to follow him and he managed to find a lovely secluded spot with beds elsewhere. The location of the hotel is perfect and central to all that Seminyak has to offer.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1220,Not for the average luxury Bali experience...,50,August 2018,"Absolutely mu ""go to"" when i need a break from the daily grind...5 star lixury tucked away in the center of a hustling busyling Seminyak.

One you enter the lobby you are transported to a serene island resort that filled with a soft ambiance that encourages you to just...breath...when was the last time you caught your breath?

Location: just steps away from the diverse selection of restaurants that Semunyak has to offer with shops and spas everywhere.

Rooms: unlike most resports in Bali, the rooms are large and designed to make your flow energizing. I'm a frequent traveler and i can say eniugh about the design of a room tk make my life easier with the comforts of home on tne road.

Property: the main center courtyard is as tranquil as you see in photos...a place to meditate, do yoga or just lounge. Just steps from an amazing beach views, breezes and sounds...its like being isolated from the outside world.

The spa...we all know you can get cheap massages all over town from the tiny warung style shops to fancily named Spas but the spa here is amazing, the island simplisity merged with the exorbitant luxury and the professional flair that just eases away your tense muscles.

Food: so I've been coming here for about 4 years and Chef Josh has curated an menu that surprises me with every trip...fresh food and taste that you wont be disappointed with from Breakfast to Lunch and Dinner and even that 1am snack.

All in all, if you haven't been...you should and if you have been..then you know already.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1221,Fantastic experience,50,August 2018,"From the warm welcome to the attention to detail, this is a top 5 star hotel. Beautifully kept, elegant, private and calm, despite what I assume was full capacity, the hotel always felt quiet.

The pool area was the highlight for me. I have never stayed at a hotel where ever 45 minutes or so you‚Äôd be offered a popsicle, a freshly squeezed juice or even someone that would clean your sunglasses.

Bravo!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1222,Great stay,50,August 2018,"Shoutout to tut suardy who made out stay very accomodating. Great pool, great service, we especially liked the free yoga in the morning and the free tea and coffee.

1223,"Fantastic place, staff and overall value",50,August 2018,"Beautiful gardens and pool area with direct access to the beach. It is peaceful and charming.

I would totally come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1224,Great location no personality,30,August 2018,"For the cost of an ocean facing room staying with my daughter i was dissatisfied with the standard and the customer service. Rooms are dated and poorly lit with grey towels and bedding.
Breakfast was ordinary at best and service was non existent. Cold coffee ect..
The position is perfect and gardens pretty.
Shame the rest has absolutely no personality. Needs some management as that seemed totally lacking.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1225,Superb hotel with top service,50,May 2018,Located beach front with an infinity pool on the beach. Nice large room very well appointed. The staff is always very helpfull and polite.

Our room was a beach view room and was modern and very nice. Not huge but big enough.

The location on Seminyak beach was superb and is also the hotel is extremely conveniently located for Seminyak shopping and restaurants.

The booking site we used stated that the hotel offered an airport transfer service but the info failed to mention the rather high cost.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1227,Great experience a second time !!!!!,50,August 2018,"We stayed for the second time at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa recently.
Its always a worry going back to where you have been before and had a great experience, you are usually disappointed. I can confirm we were not!!!
The same great staff, outstanding food great pool and service made our 8 night visit a special treat.
If you want some time out this is the place. The spa is superb as well and you can walk to several great restaurants for a change.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1228,"Peace, Beauty & Tranquility in Seminyak",50,July 2018,"This hotel is situated on the beach and the restaurants are right next to the Ocean. Having breakfast was a piece of heaven everyday. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the Olympic size swimming pool looks onto the ocean. The location of the hotel could not be better. You are close to all the amazing shopping Seminyak has to offer and all the delicious restaurants. It is a busy place and having this quiet wondeful hotel to return to is heavenly. The rooms are large, warm and very pretty plus the beds are very comfortable. The staff here could not be warmer and the security is top notch with a gate manned by security who checks every car entering. I loved this place and if I return to Bali will stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1229,Amazing villas,40,August 2018,"Just along the beach, you will find this beautiful hotel with amazing villas. The garden villas with their own pool our really awesome. The service is very, very friendly.

We had a wonderful time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1230,Heaven on Earth,50,July 2018,"My husband & I were so impressed by this resort last year we took our whole family there this year. Our adult children & their partners were gobsmacked not only by the incredible view of the pool & clean beach, but by the friendliness & attentive staff. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We requested our Beach Side room from the previous year & our family were next door in 2 other rooms. A big thanks to Executive chef Josh for getting in my special dietary requests too. We started our days with Yoga & body surfing before breakfast. It was wonderful to then spend an hour or more eating breakfast leisurely with the family without any one waiting for a table( something that we never do at home). Food variety is fantastic too. I had 1 spa treatment & that was AMAZING too. Listening to the surf while having a 90 minute massage was out of this world! Rooms are large & very comfortable. We loved being on the Beach side. One suggestion I do have is to make a Coffee Bar in the restaurant with another machine & Barista for the busy breakfast time. I have seen this work well at another 5 star restaurant. There was quite often a long wait & coffee was also luke warm not hot. Overall a fantastic trip & will certainly go back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1231,Amazing resort with amazing service!,50,May 2018,"This resort is so beautiful!The location is by a wonderful beach. It‚Äôs a quiet part of the Double six beach, not crowded at all.

1232,World class hotel on the sands of Seminyak Bali,50,July 2018,"we had the beach front ocean room and we could reach out and feel the sea. We had been a couple of times before, but the recent upgrade to the pools and beach restaurant were fantastic and allowed you to have peace and quite.

Staff were friendly and the food and drinks were well priced.

The main pool is great for people watching walking along the beach, or doing deals with the ladies selling things on the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1233,Lovely hotel don‚Äôt do the Balinese night,40,July 2018,"So firstly the hotel me and my wife felt very safe good levels of visible security at the entrances to the complex! We stayed in the garden wing which was nice but we faced the road and could hear the scooters in our room going passed along the road which did make it hard to sleep at times!

The room is one of the largest we have ever had and was very good indeed.

The pool area also excellent and the staff really could not do enough for you the breakfast and lunch menu being very good!

The hotel is very close to the main strip but far enough away to have no noise

The only regret was the Balinese night which was 700,000 per person which me and my wife did having been pushed by the staff the food although buffet was all cold and we where the first in the que for the food the dancing was good but this was very very poor value for money particularly the cold cold food

But overall a very good stay and well worth it",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1234,Honeymoon Bali,50,July 2018,"A beautiful hotel with exceptionally friendly staff. We had a gorgeous garden villa and it simply beautiful. We knew the hotel was stunning but it was a real wow moment when we walked through our villa entrance.

From start to finish everything was exceptional and you can tell that the staff all strived for perfection. Our villa hosts consisted of Gede (the villa manager) and 4 hosts Ogy, Oka, Benny and Windu. All were brilliant, nothing was ever too much trouble they really were there to ensure everything was perfect at all times, and all every opportunity ensuring we ok and that we had everything we wanted and needed. One of the days we were having a chat and we found our jacuzzi pool pump wasn‚Äôt working. We didn‚Äôt mind but they insisted on changing it. For the trouble they gave us a free dinner and also a free 1 hour massage. I suppose that really shows that commitment to their jobs.

The only constructive feedback I would give to the hotel as a whole is to maybe offer a slightly broader choice on their menus, there is 2 speciality evenings fisherman‚Äôs and Balinese which are great but it would be lovely to have some other additions. This is not to say there was a small choice just for me I think as an Englishman I love my food and love to try different varieties. The food they did offer was lovely and was always brought with a smile.

I also was impressed with how they helped with a request of mine. I was looking to do a fishing trip and found the sea fishing to be very costly. One of the lovely male receptionists mentioned a new fresh water fishing venue called Predators (near Ubud) which had recently opened up. In the end the hotel took me to the venue and I spent a few hours fishing in a man made lake and had a whale of a time.

All in all there‚Äôs so many things I could say which made it trip brilliant. But if anything is to be said is that the staff are lovely and the hotel is beautiful. We will try and get back in the future for a honeymoon anniversary.

And a thank you to the villa team that looked after us. Also as we left it was lovely touch for Aldo the hotel assistant manager to come and chat to us before we left for the airport.

Hopefully be back soon!

1235,Very Nice Resort,50,July 2018,"Staff were polite and beach view room beautiful. The pool is also quite nice, positioned right on the beach with an amazing view!

1236,Special,50,September 2017,"We stayed at the Seminyak September 2017.
All I can say is this is a fantastic hotel.
Luxurious rooms.
Incredible infinity pool
Beautiful grounds.
Delicious food.
Excellent staff.
My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1237,Great staff although food below average,30,June 2018,"The staff where excellent and we felt very welcome on arrival. The room had a very mouldy smell - maybe a water leak? The door to the balcony outside shut but had a large gap that let in mosies and also felt less safe as on ground floor and open area. The gardens were beautiful and the staff were attentive at the pool and this is where it stops.
The breakfast buffet was average and not a lot of choice. We decided to dine at the same area for dinner one evening and were shocked that the curry we ordered was so tough - unable to eat - plus no taste; my partners food was very similar. We ended up quietly speaking to the waiter who credited our meals. We decided to go down to the restaurant near the beach ( same resort) and this was not much better. We ordered a couple of tapas style dishes - one being a bruschetta - although down-sized?? to 1cm x 4cm a piece x3 for roughly $14 Australian.... did not even taste like bruschetta. We ate the food and left very disappointed - and decided that we would book in somewhere else and forfeit our money. The breakfast the next morning was very average - with 6-8 staff standing around while we cleared our own plates and they chatted and looked at their phones. Nice resort if you don't want to eat! We ended up forfeiting 2 nights here and stayed at the Mulia at Nusa Dua and it was the same price!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1238,amazing in every way,50,July 2018,"staff were friendly. Morning buffet was amazing. Loved the pool. Amenities were fantastic. Always clean.

1239,"tranquil ,serene, great location",50,July 2018,"I was there for 7 nights, the hotel is wonderful in terms of its location, hospitality and amenities. It is walking distance from seminyak square...which is where you can head out for dinner/lunch/breakfast..while there are lots of places in seminyak which offer great sunset and sunrise' ..but nothing beats the view from the hotel. The infinity pool was absolutely amazing and we spent most of our time lounging by the pool, enjoying the unobstructed sea view and the amazing cocktails. Will most definitely stay there again :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1240,Fantastic,50,July 2018,"Note, the hotel has 2 different locations. One is where the beach is. The other one is across a road, with no beach access. You'd need to walk to the other location to access to the beach and all the restaurants.

It's fantastic stay. Not too far from Seminyak Square. Would come back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1241,Amazing Stay!!,50,August 2017,We had such an amazing stay here! Check in was quick and easy and we even had a complimentary arrival drink which was a great touch. We were showed to our room and shown around the hotel and all facilities explained to us. The room was lovely and the housekeeping team were fantastic and kept the room spotless throughout our stay. A lovely touch in the evenings when they came round to offer homemade cookie of the day and a turn down service. Breakfast was very good! Lots of choices to order from the menu and a big selection of buffet options. The service was always quick and lovely food. The pool area was the best I have ever been to! Such a beautiful view of the beach. The staff around the pool area kept it clean at all times and were very attentive. There was one gentleman in particular who looked after us everyday and even remembered our drink order and what time we liked to order I wish I could remember his name. We ordered food by the pool a few times and it was always delicious. We were celebrating my partners birthday and they left a lovely celebration cake in the room on the day which was a lovely touch. We cant wait to come back would definitely recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The feeling is always amazing each time we come back, of course because of the 5-star amenities, but most importantly thanks to the amazing staff team (which has not changed since the first time we came): extremely kind and helpful, paying attention to small details. I can only warmly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1244,Amazing Resort & Amazing Staff,50,July 2018,"We Stayed here for 5 days/ 4 nights and it was just a dream! We were in a ocean view villa and the room was so beautiful, nice private pool, so luxurious and a huge bathroom. It only took us 2 minutes to walk to the main pool by the beach. The Staffs were amazing, especially GEDE (Head Villa Host), through out our stay, his hospitality was marvelous, he gave us all the information we needed. His Service was super kind and super helpful. He organized his team so well and they couldn't be faulted at all, they all so friendly!
We can highly recommend this hotel - one of the best i've ever stayed at. We will be back. Once again, Big thank you GEDE. You made our stay even more amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1245,A slice of heaven on the Island of the Gods,50,April 2018,"Three months after my trip to Bali and this thing called life is finally calming down. I finally get the chance to let my holiday blues come running back. Thought I'd catch up with writing some reviews and this one of Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is definitely long overdue.

I chose to stay at the Seminyak on my return to Bali this time. And what a fine choice it was. The hotel was fantastically located; amongst all things happening in Bali (right next to Kudeta, walking distance to many fine restaurants/cafes, and shopping destinations) but yet so serene. It was the perfect hide-out. My room was clean, well stocked with amenities. A sucker for comfort, I was delighted with my bed and had fantastic sleeps during my time in Bali. It helped that the resort was serious about safety and security of its guests.

Breakfast was a feast with options to accommodate any palette. The infinity pool offers a beautiful view of the sea and you could even see the plane taking off/touching down in the far distance.

As I am an event planner by trait, I requested a show-around the impressive property with their lovely Marketing Manager, Ingrid, whose passion for the resort was infectious. All the staff was very hospitable and personable - this definitely stood out throughout my stay. My room attendant, Agus, even made me a cute towel animal when he's turning my room over for the evening. The service was consistently delightful and warm throughout from reception to restaurant to poolside to room service.

Can't wait for my next time in Bali and looking forward to going back to Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1246,A Seminyak Experience,50,July 2018,"Service at The Seminyak was impeccable - each staff made it a point to converse with you everyday, whether they were the receptionist, the security staff, those waiting tables/serving the pool deck, etc.

We were welcomed at check-in with lovely frangipani wreaths and refreshing homemade drinks. The receptionist took the time to get to know us and also walked us to our room (free upgrade) to show us around.

Our room was well-kept each day, including in the evenings (where they'd automatically set your room/curtains for the night). A lovely in-room surprise was prepared for us when they learnt our trip to Bali was also our honeymoon.

The view of the ocean at the infinity pool is breathtaking, especially at sunset. We also enjoyed our dinners at the hotel (one a unique/one-off dining experience with Six Hands Chef Rupert & Carrie Blease, and the hotel's own Fisherman's Night).

Spa was luxurious (go for the Kahyangan Delight). Facilities included a sauna, jacuzzi, salon.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. They made us feel right at home.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1247,Enjoyed Myself,50,July 2018,"Upon booking my room, I thoroughly went through the lower reviews and nothing really stuck out as consistent in my opinion by dates. I booked my room and said go with it.

I arrived and my room was not ready, I really didn't care nor does that bother me because I was given a tour of the facilities so it made up the time. The security at the location is very real to include a barrier, security cameras, guards and announcement of visitors. That did increase my personal security. Upon arrival I was given a flower wreath for my neck, a wonderful ginger drink and with the upmost hospitality.

My room was great. I am not sure the water quality of Bali but there is an abundance of complimentary water, ginger drinks, stocked bar and personal hygiene products. That was very thoughtful and I know my stomach appreciates not getting sick. The room was huge, bed was soft and air conditioning worked well. The room had a jacuzzi, rain shower, two sinks, safe and dual outlets. When room service cleans, they folded my clothes which was cute. There was also yoga in the morning in the courtyard. I did not check out the spa but the gym is nice, money changer on location, ATM is kinda crazy since the max is $90 USD max withdrawal.

I do not have any complaints except there were mosquitoes at times but it is an island and trees everywhere so what do you expect. Warning: The ocean view is not as ocean view as you think, you can see the ocean and hear the waves perfectly but since the courtyard has trees you cannot see the immediate sand/coast. I think I did get a dirty towel but I am not sure. Really, no complaints.

The staff everywhere to include security were so nice, sweet, opened up in conversation and did everything they can to accommodate me and other guests. I could not point out any one person but say they were all 5-star. I was amazed at what I saw and how I was treated.

I have to give the room, the facilities, customer service a 5 but the restaurant on the beach was average.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1248,Exceptional Service and an Absolutely Beautiful Place,50,July 2018,"My wife and I chose to stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort recently for our 10 year wedding anniversary. The number one reason to choose this resort is the Exceptional quality of service here. We have visited 15-20 countries together and stayed at many high-end hotels and resorts. I would rank the Seminyak Beach Resort in the top 3 for customer service, attentiveness and just overall friendliness/helpfulness of the staff. By that I mean ALL of the staff. Every.Single.Person.

We also booked the Candlelight Dinner (see photos) which was an incredible experience. The food was amazing, the service was, again, perfection (shout out to Rocky!) The GM of the hotel even stopped by and took a photo for us. It was a phenomenal experience we highly recommend.

A few other key points from our stay:
1. 24 hour room service available which is extremely helpful when you are arriving late/leaving early/have tours leaving at odd hours/etc
2. Beautiful pool area overlooking the beach with plenty of spots to sit, relax, and enjoy the Bali sunset
3. Fantastic daily breakfast buffet with a nice array of options
4. The staff even put together breakfast boxes for us when we had to leave very early in the morning for a tour to Nusa Penida.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1249,"Now , that‚Äôs called living !",50,July 2018,"What can I say , forget every thing you think you know about a vacation next to the sea , because nothing ! Nothing compares to this .
Imagine sitting by the pool over looking the sea gasping at your feet singing in your ear while the staff offer you on the house treats ... I guess we are in Bali üôè",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1250,Wonderful Place,50,July 2018,"I love the design, low profile but elegant. The balinese ambience is perfect and the interior of the room is astonishingly beautiful. It‚Äôs a real escape for anyone, with mind blowing views everywhere, makes you forget all your problems. Love the food, the chef has done excellent job. I will visit this lovely place on another opportunity.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1251,Ooooohhh !!!!,50,June 2018,What can I say.. Fantastic Hotel filled with fantastic staff. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and clean. We stayed in a garden room behind main hotel. It had its own small pool with swim up bar and was peaceful .We had our meals right at the shore and everyone of them was delicious. The meat and fish were excellent every time. The spa was amazing too. The hotel is lovely away from the bustle of Seminyak itself but so close to walk to. Thank you to everyone at the Seminyak Beach Hotel.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1252,Day Drop in,40,July 2018,"So first trip to Bali and on our last day decided to give the pretty people at the usual hotspots (potatoHead and Ku De Ta) a miss!

We picked this place to base ourselves at 400,000 IDR per person for us. We are a family of 6: 2 Adults, 2 teens and 2 young ones. We were charged for 4, giving us a food and beverage total as part of the entry fee. Relatively good value considering the other choices. Nice and quiet too.

Note: the horizon pool is for hotel guest only but we had the other area and it was great.

Great facilities, swim up bar and excellent food. Yes, it is more expensive but as a place to rest and just chill for the day. It hit all the right spots. Beach play, pool play and close to local shops for last minute purchases if you wanted it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1253,So pleasant,50,August 2017,"over a year ago went here, it was so amazing. veey expensive where we stayed it was the pool villa $1100 a night but was very worth it and we were definately looked after. fresh fruit everyday, room cleaned, nicr buffet breakfast. amazing! especially beachfront wow!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1254,Outstanding service,50,July 2018,My wife and I have been staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for only 2 days so far and are having a great time. The service here is outstanding in particular Sang who was excellent and very friendly.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1255,beware: this hotel recycles used/dirty towels...,10,July 2018,"so on the night of our arrival, i noticed that two towels had black markings on them, but i tried to ignore it. the next day, we took a shower in the afternoon, and what we normally do is leave the used towels that we no longer want to use in the bathtub, and at any hotel we have stayed at it has never been a problem, the staff would always replace it with fresh towels. this hotel however, dug all the towels out of the tub, and hung them back onto the racks...seriously? what is wrong with you? the tubs aren't even clean! then, i remembered the night of our arrival, the black markings on the towels...gross! for a hotel at this price, you're being really dirty and cheap!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1256,Simply perfect üîÜ,50,July 2018,"From the moment we arrived the staff gave us the warmest of welcomes and the most professional level of service. The attention to detail in everything the hotel offered was faultless. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was absolutely lovely with perfect sea view, we instantly felt at home. During of 12 night stay, we had the chance to enjoy the resort facility in fullest. The stunning infinity pool is big enough to feel private and enjoy the unlimited sea view, beautiful set up at the resort just what we needed, gorgeous spa facility is just incredible. Easy access to the beach made things so easy, and close by to Seminyak Square for local food and a shopping... simply perfect. The special event hosted in the week were excellent (Balinese Night, with a dance performance and special Menu and drinks). Food is excellent quality and breakfast prepared to order we are really missing since we left. We can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1257,"Four sensational days and my third visit to one of my favourite Bali resorts, I will be returning in 2019..",50,June 2018,"Service, experience and amenities, first class! My room in the Garden Wing overlooking pool, beautifully maintained. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Improvement, room fridge not cold enough",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1258,Awesome hotel to stay.... at least for one night,50,June 2018,"Well, when you are willing to throw money, you get the quality for it. This place gives you an exceptionally different feeling from the moment you step in to leaving. The place itself is spic and span. Every staff you meet will greet you warmly with a smile. In fact, I found the guests here also soak up in the atmosphere and smile at you. What I am partuclarly impressed here is the environmentally practices they adopt to save the earth. No plastics, even straws are biodegradable. The infinity pool is awesome. You get a big variety of food for breakfast and afternoon tea. Overall, it is the kind of place you want to stay at least for a night or two to make your visit to Bali and unforgettable one!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1259,Does the Job - lacks anything special,30,June 2018,"This hotel does the job but I really struggled to find anything memorable about the hotel itself. It felt The hotel location is good, its right on the beachfront and has the most stunning sunsets. It is a public beach so you do find is spoilt by dog and human waste.

The rooms are clean and effective but you would rather be outside than in anyway. Do not stay in the Garden wing, this is not connected to the hotel, it is the building opposite with its own pool but none of the hotel service is available here.

The breakfast areas is very small for the size of the hotel so you have to go really early or late otherwise there is a queue for empty tables. The service is also very slow, the food is made to order in a separate kitchen so it takes a long time to get through breakfast, give yourself plenty of time if you want hot food.

The pool is nice, (not heated) but large and has the view of the sea. The pool staff work hard and in the heat do a great job. Thank you Eti for being the only member of staff that really made kind of connection with us on our stay! Pool food is minimal but good. There are cocktails and pizzas and burgers.

For the price I wouldn't say this is worth it, the hotel runs day to day as it should but has forgotten how to make the experience memorable to make sure guests come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1260,Beach villa delight,50,June 2018,"Just completing a most enjoyable Bali holiday in the delightful surroundings of Seminyak Beach Resort. The luxury of the beach front villa added to the pleasure of a birthday celebration.
Our stay was enhanced by the attentive service from staff members, Ogy and Windoo. They did a great job and we thank them very much.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1261,Good Property With Comfortable Rooms,40,October 2017,"I went with my friends to Bali and booking this resort was the best decision we made.
It is a beautiful property at a great location. The rooms where super comfortable and staff was friendly. Food wasn‚Äôt that great, that was the only concern. Other than that perfect place if you want to enjoy pool, beach and spa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1262,you are looking for escape? just go for it!,50,June 2018,"when planning for my trip, I was quit hesitating about where to stay in Bali, a friend advised me with Seminyak Beach Resort &Spa hotel. i would like to thank her for that! its an amazing resort from A-Z! I stayed with my friend in Ocean view Suite and guys I really recommend you to book that! its just outstanding with its ocean view with ocean waves sound and nature beauty, the suite was having everything you need + complementary tea afternoon that you can enjoy in your room. this resort has been an escape and overwhelming place to stay, its so quit and staff are so kind and helpful even for things you need outside the hotel, they smile all the time which really make your day!! food is sooooo tasty in all the restaurants inside the resort Santan and Sanje Restaurants. of course when we were there, we couldnt miss any sunset as its a very beautiful sunset spot on the beach+ their infinity pool on beach front side is an extraordinary place to enjoy the sun, get some tan and drink tasty coktails! and I couldnt leave without trying the nice Spa with amassage session and it was just amazing though the hotel was 3 minutes from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, Seminyak Beach Resort was having a totally different comfortable atmosphere and mood for people looking for quite places! everything was perfect and definitely Seminyak Beach Resort will be my first destination when I come back to Bali..actually I miss the resort already!! Thank you for all the team for your warm hospitality.. cant wait for my next vacation to come back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1263,"Love, Love, Love This Hotel!",50,June 2018,"This hotel ticks all the boxes, it took my breath away!
From the moment we got to the hotel we were greeted with amazing service with refreshments and a frangipani necklace lei. Our room was exceptional & the infinity pool facilities was absolutely amazing, I literally could of stayed there forever. I will be staying there again 100%. The location was perfect, walking distance to Ku De Ta, The Samaya, Mrs Sippy all the lovely bars across the beach. Please do yourself a favour and stay at this hotel. Its absolutely amazing, the room turn-down is great as well - the staff always leave tea & sweets on the coffee table and it's a very peaceful hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1264,Amazing amazing amazing!!!,50,June 2018,"One of the best hotels ever! I don‚Äôt know where to start this hotel is that good! Here are a few points that just make this place simply amazing:
1. They upgraded our room from garden wing to main hotel as it was our first year anniversary. They have my wife a bouquet of roses on arrival and a nice cake in our room for our first night. Such a lovely touch.
2. The staff are so friendly helpful and can‚Äôt do enough for you. The staff really do make this hotel! Special mention goes to Made Adi who cleaned our room! Couldn‚Äôt do enough for us!! Lovely guy!
3. Afternoon tea and cake which is complimentary is a nice touch. Breaks up he day and you can have a snack away from the sun if you need.
4. The pool is amazing overlook the sea. So relaxing. In the evening as the sun sets they have live music which is soothing and relaxing.
5. Bring round little bites to eat every so often round the pool! Most likey food left over from lunch etc but nevertheless such a nice touch!

You have to stay here you‚Äôll have the most relaxing time!!! Pure 5 star luxury. You won‚Äôt be disappointed",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1265,Excellent Service!!!,50,June 2018,"Beautiful hotel, excellent facilities, nice beach front and excellent service!

Our room is beautifully done, nice bed, nice bathtub, downside of our room. We are located across the main building. Simple tip don't book yourself across the main building, make sure that you are booked in the main building to enjoy this hotel.

My first time in Bali and I had fun, the only thing that so off to me are the taxi drivers, they are charging overpriced, if you have Grab use grab, or find the Blue Bird taxi they have an honest metered rate.

But nonetheless it was a great trip for us. Try to check LA LAGUNA, LA PLANCHA and LA FAVELA.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1266,Service -quality-and lots of ‚ù§Ô∏è,50,June 2018,Among a lot of resorts on the main street of seminyak you will find this stunning resort. The rooms are beautifully decorated you feel space and cleanness .Even though the resort is not a small boutique hotel it does feel that way with the personal touch you will find everywere ...smelling the scent of fresh bali flowers in the hallway . Service is of course with the wellknown bali smile . The pool is impressive and is situated at the beach giving a stunning view of the sea. Breakfast was close to perfection ! I totally ‚ù§Ô∏è this resort !,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1267,great place of vacation,40,May 2018,Rooms are restaurants are lean. The staff is very friendly. The beach area is perfect. The hotel drivers specially a guy call Rupawan (e-mail: k.rupawan@yahoo.com) knew the island very well. The food quality is good and fresh with lots of local varieties of fruits and cakes. Everyone speaks good English.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1268,Amazing Infinity pool & sunset bliss!,50,August 2017,"Romantic beachfront accommodation right at the doorsteps of trendy Seminyak. We don't often stay at the same resort twice, however, this place is really something special. Great location, close to bars, restaurants, shops & located right on the ocean's edge. We loved to start every morning with breakfast beachside, with a perfect section of fresh fruit, smoothies and a great la carte menu. Then why not head to the amazing infinity pool enjoying great cocktails, food and watching the surfers hit the waves and then head out to one of the great restaurants or clubs close by for dinner. The rooms are a good size and had everything we need and we enjoyed staying in one of the bottom rooms so we could walk straight out to the beautiful manicured gardens or pool. If you are looking for something special this is the place.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1269,Be careful what you book,30,May 2018,"Cutting the story short - if you book a room which is with garden view and it says that it is separate building = it is view to few plants facing the wall and building is 5min walk outside main resort area, across the public transport street. Actually you need to call for a car to get there.

Another issue there is F&B - ordering food at beach restaurant (not the pool restaurant) is waste of your money. Food is not enjoyable at all (we took steak) as well as they don‚Äôt know how to make cocktails properly. Better go to KUDETA which is next to the Resort and enjoy your vacation.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1270,Daily Yoga and Breakfast by the Beach!,50,May 2018,"Daily yoga is included in the service price so, if everyone else is lazy in the morning ( ;-) ) you get one-on-one tuition!

Breakfast at the beachside restaurant is a standout; less crowded than the main restaurant and more flexibility to choose what you want or have what you want made to order... and view the early morning beach activity in tranquility.

Overall a great location for Seminyak, beach, restaurants and, of course, the shopping. All within a few minutes walk.
PS Staff should pay some attention to spraying the rooms with insect repellant otherwise grounds and rooms were immaculate.
Rooms (Suite size) are well designed so that you have privacy both from sound and being overlooked on the Ocean View wing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1271,Totally Bliss,50,July 2017,"Actually stayed here in January 2017. The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is absolute bliss. From the rooms to the beautiful gardens, the pools, the staff and security it is 5 and a 1/2 star quality. Something everyone should experience. The staff are not at all intrusive so you have alot of time and space to yourself while at the same time extremely attentive and helpful when ever you need something.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1272,Peace and Tranquility,50,June 2018,Beautiful hotel and grounds. Staff are all friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Thanks to the guys (Edy and Wirawaya) at the pool bar and lounge area even ensuring sunglasses were clean. We really enjoyed the peace of the garden accommodation and the pool. Most days we had this pool to ourselves with the company of the wonderful Rudi chatting and serving us our bintangs.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1273,Best experience in Bali,50,June 2018,"Absolutely loved Seminyak Beach Resort!!

We got so looked after by all staff but Trainee Ketut was our guy, so happy, helpful and friendly. Taught us about the mid year ceremony that was on at the time. Also recommended the Seafood Banquet which we enjoyed so much (fresh seafood üòç)

We will be back!! üëçüòé",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1274,Amazing Pool,50,May 2018,Initially we booked 3 nights at a different hotel in Seminyak. As we were very disappointed we looked for the nicest place we could find and this hotel is it! Must say Seminyak Beach is not nice but this hotel made up for everything the beach was lacking. Being our anniversary and last 2 nights in Bali we couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place. Breakfast buffet was unbelievable. We upgraded our room to ocean view and were happy with this. Service and food by the pool was splendid. Your sunglasses will never be cleaner! While we wouldn‚Äôt go back to Seminyak the hotel itself made our stay a masterpiece!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1275,Had to write a review of this place,50,June 2018,"So taking the time out to write a review you probably are feeling either very happy or very unhappy. This is a one of a kind resort that requires writing about. My 15 year old daughter and I stayed there just one night (2 days) and it was a customer service experience like no other I have had in Bali (or elsewhere). Checking in we couldn't get into our room until 4pm instead of 2pm so our room was extended 2 hours on the next day. This was great as we had a late night flight to catch. But this was only the start - everyone was ultra friendly and helpful. Nothing was too hard. Sitting by the beautiful infinity pool I had my sunglasses cleaned not once but twice! Also served mango smoothy shots and mango ice blocks - all part of the service! The best part though was that we had arranged to have a 5pm ""Late Departure Hydration"" - 1 hour massage, half hour facial, shower facilities and 3 course meal! Our luggage was taken care of until we left for the airport (this would have been the case even without our hydration package!). For anyone who is worried about managing that long wait for a night flight just talk to this wonderful hotel about how best to manage it - sure they will try to be accommodating! Thank you Seminyak Beach resort and spa!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1276,"Amazing place, amazing people",50,May 2018,"My partner and I stayed at the Seminyak for two weeks during May. The weather was fantastic during this time. The hotel room was fabulous and spacious with a huge bed which was so comfortable and a luxurious bathroom. We had a room with a balcony so had a lovely view of the gardens and could even see the sea. There were a few weddings being held during our stay and had a great view of the bride and groom while their photos were being taken in the gardens.

The hotel is situated in a great spot which is close to all amenities and just a short walk to the town. The hotel caters for everything you could possibly need from the fantastic room, delicious food, afternoon tea and even getting your sunglasses cleaned poolside. The staff are so friendly and always greet you with a smile and a few kind words.

The infinity pool was never crowded and we could always find a sun bed round the pool whatever time we went there.

All in all we couldn‚Äôt fault the service, the staff nor the sleep quality.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1277,Fantastic hotel,50,May 2018,We loved staying at the Seminyak Resort and Spa. We stayed in the garden wing which is across the street from the main hotel and we loved it. The garden wing has its own pool which was very quiet and you can always get a sun lounge. The main hotel has a stunning infinity pool which we used a lot but it was nice to have the option of both pools. The hotel is in a great location next to Ku Da Taand 5min walk to the main shops. The staff at the resort could not have been nicer! My husband and I would definitely stay at this resort again as we could not fault it.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1278,Spacious,40,May 2018,"Stayed here for 2 nights via hotels.com TripAdvisor. Location is good, valet parking is efficient, receptionist and service is fine. Reflection not quick enough when I dialed 0 and requested for shower gel and replacement of kettle. Kettle got stain. Room is tidy but I found 3 ants between days. Pillow is too soft not comfy. The private beach sounds good but most of the beach in Seminyak can‚Äôt swim. Infinity pool is ok. A number of rest areas. Breakfast has limited local cuisine and those served in pots are not interesting and cold, not well heated. However, they have few other choices of made to order breakfast.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1279,The BEST hotel I have ever been to!,50,May 2018,"This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in considering I have visited 31 countries that says a lot! You could not fault it! The customer service was excellent, the breakfast was to die for, the hotel itself was thoughtless and beyond clean every single day, the turquoise blue swimming pool was stunning and quiet, with postcard perfect views onto the beach. The restaurant food was of the highest quality and eggs cooked to perfection every morning in the breakfast area served by the most splendid welcoming friendly staff. We met a wonderful polite girl called Dekta who made our stay a real pleasure! Dekta met us every morning with a huge smile, perfect English, remembered our favourite foods, intolerances and could not have been any more hospitable. She even came to meet us on her day off to show us around Bali which was so kind of her. She is a real asset to the hotel as she took customer service to the top level by being the go to person for any questions and always so happy kind and friendly. We would look forward every day to getting up for breakfast just to be greeted by the fantastic staff including Dekta, and enjoy the most delicious healthy breakfast cereals, juices, fruit bowls, traditional breakfasts, continental and UK classics....everything was fresh and perfect. The grounds of the hotel were impeccable with not a weed insight, and from visiting various hotels around the area this was by far the best in luxury hotel without being pretentious. Every day by the pool we would be offered a free healthy shot drink, our sunglasses to be cleaned, or a fruit jelly lolly with staff continuously trying to please the customers and make our stay more enjoyable. We stayed in the garden wing of the hotel with the view over the pool and road however it was so quiet and picture perfect. The cleaner Pak Guru was his name, made sure everyday we came back to a spotless room with towel animals which was a lovely touch. Because of this wonderful hotel really made us fall in love with Bali. In the heart of the luxury hotels and shopping area we would go out every day wondering around to look forward to coming back to such luxury and excellent customer service. I honestly cannot fault this hotel at all and would give it 10 stars if I could. Anybody looking for perfect relaxing retreat with stunning surroundings and be treated like royalty on a daily basis when nothing is a problem then you must visit this hotel. Plus pass on a hi to the lovely Dekta xxx thank you for the best holiday, we look forward to seeing you all next year xx We cannot wait to come back. Katie & Kaan
Terimakasih The Seminyak Hotel Beach and Resort Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1280,Nice hotel but I wouldn‚Äôt stay in the garden wing again,30,June 2018,"We stayed at Seminyak beach resort for 4 days after we had stayed at a pool villa close by. We had a garden wing room and I have to say, I wish we would‚Äôve stayed at the pool villa (which was also cheaper than the resort!). There was just not that Bali feeling when you stay at a small concrete complex with a balcony looking over a busy street. The actual hotel on the other side of the street is nice, however it‚Äôs also not the best I‚Äôve seen so far. It has for sure an amazing pool overlooking the beach, but it‚Äôs a little old in some areas and we ended up not using the pool but rather went to beach clubs nearby where drinks and food were much better. All they really serve at the pool was club sandwich type food and we found the quality to be much better in all the beach clubs (healthier, tastier) as well as the atmosphere.

The service is good and everyone was friendly. However once we wanted to go to breakfast at the beach around 10.45 and they told us it was too late already, which wasn‚Äôt true cause breakfast there closes at 11.00. Breakfast at the main restaurant was much bettter though anyway. The breakfast box we were given due to early check out consisted of just unhealthy sweets like croissants and muffins, not something I would normally eat. Room service wasn‚Äôt that good either unfortunately, shower gels etc never got replaced even though they were empty. The AC is super loud too and you can‚Äôt turn down the fan.

All in all, for the price of the hotel I would stay somewhere else next time. There are so many lovely small hotels where you can get your own villa with butler and a pool for much less of the price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

We had a 0120am flight back to Seoul, and they graciously allowed us late checkout 4pm, held our luggage, and allowed us to use the spa showers to refresh before our long journey home. The grounds are gorgeous. The espresso martinis are delicious, the breakfast phenomenal. The pool is beautiful. There are two places on the beach right behind the resort that offered surf lessons. We attended the resort‚Äôs Balinese cookout and dance which was very enjoyable. Our room was spotless (ocean front with infinity pool) and luxurious. For real a 5*",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1283,Joyful return to our Bali Home!,50,May 2018,"This is our 7th stay for the month of May to visit family here each year!
The essential and challenging work carried out to the pool area following damage and disruption last year has now been completed and the stunning location of this hotel now offers a truly unrivalled pool area for its guests! The service from the beach attendants is second to none - thanks to Ketut, Edy, Mustika and Putu for looking after us so well and preparing the comfortable sunbeds with divine towels each day of our stay! My sunglasses have never been so clean thanks to the new service provided by these guys! We shall miss you all! The service waiters are so attentive too guided by Yasa the new F&B manager - particular mention to the amazing Supraman IWayan, Gede and Rocky who provided an exceptional service both around the pool and in the much improved Sanje Lounge which has unrivalled beach views, beautiful furniture and sun shaded providing much needed relief from the midday sun and delicious lunch menu! The welcoming smiles from waitresses there always make it so special! New chef Joshua is sure to make huge changes both to lunch and dinner menus here and it will surely become one of the must go to places to rival other fabulous restaurants in seminyak! The legendary breakfast at the hotel never fails to astound by the choice provided to suits all nationalities - best breakfast in Bali!!! Many thanks to chef Dawa who assists and certainly keeps control in the kitchen at busy service- he will certainly help Josh to find his feet following many years at the hotel.... the dishes he creates for the Barung dinner and the fisherman‚Äôs night are exceptional and quality traditional Indonesian fayre - do not miss the amazing Barung dance during your stay it is a truly lovely way to be part of the traditions of Bali !

1284,"Great hotel, appropriate for a quiet getaway",40,May 2018,"I was upgraded on arrival. The hotel is lovely and spacious with large clean rooms that spell luxury, probably more appropriate for couples looking for a quiet hotel than people wanting a vibey hotel. The service was great, I was served by a gentleman named Ketut who‚Äôs service was more than exceptional. This same gentleman served me again at dinner and really made my evening very pleasant. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quiet romantic getaway.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1285,Overpriced,30,May 2018,"The hotel was good, but we couldn‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs very overpriced. We chose to upgrade from the room across the road and are glad we did - the other building is completely separate to the resort.

Location is good- short walk to restaurants and shops. Nice infinity pool. I‚Äôm not sure why they say 2 swimming pools as one is very small, surrounding the restaurant and only has 3 sun beds/cabanas around it. The hotel has quite small grounds and not what we expected for the price!

Service was good - nice to have free water at the pool and little extras that are handed out throughout the day.

Food around the pool was very poor - over 2 days we had the veggie wrap (bland) & the burger (soggy) both with cold chips, and the pizzas (chewy and old crust). Not at all what we expected from a 5* resort. Room service wasn‚Äôt much better unfortunately. Breakfast was quite good but a long wait for ordered food and generally not as good as previous hotels in bali!!

Spa treatment was good and the facilities were great.

Overall slightly disappointing and not good value for money.

We paid almost half the price for the same number of nights for a 5* in nusa dua that was superior in every way - huge immaculate grounds, lots of pools, better food & service (the laguna).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Seminyak Resort and Spa

Amazing Villa Experience

The Seminyak Resort and Spa has been one the most relaxing and enjoyable villa experiences I have ever had.

The service from the security at the gates right up until we were shown to our villa, and everything in between, was amazing.

The Balinese people have all been very friendly but nothing like the level and quality of service we received at the Seminyak Resort and Spa.

All the staff were extremely accomodating and greeted you as if you were a close friend, even if you were just walking by.

In particular, I would like to thank a few staff members for their hospitality, and service which made our final days in Bali an unforgettable one.

Benny - Villa Butler
Benny made sure we were comfortable, and had everything we requested before we had a chance to ask. He had made our stay stress free and very relaxing.

Windu - Turn Down service
Windu worked overtime for us to ensure that our turn down service was immaculate, and it was beyond that. He made the room look and feel romantic with mood lighting, a selection of herbal teas, and hand towel origami. It was perfect.

Sang - Pool waiter
Sang served us by the pool as we had already checked out and were waiting a couple hours before we needed to be at the airport. Sang treated us as if we were still guests, and kept us company for a while as we were not in the mood to leave!

Overall, our experience at the Seminyak Resort and Spa was a truly amazing experience that I would recommend to all couples debating on where to stay in Seminyak. The service, the views, and the hospitality will be the reason for our return later this year.

Thank you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1291,Best Pool with the Best sunsets,40,May 2018,"This hotel is really great. The staff go above and beyond to help you with anything and are a credit to the hotel.

The pool areas are some of best we have been to and the infinity pool is the best by far! It is so perfect you have the most amazing views of the sunset right by the beach in the comfort of your own hotel without crowds of people. (Check out the picture from inside the pool)
Location is great, easy walking distance to seminyak square and its location along the beach is great to walk through to many beach bars.

The food was simply amazing!!! With so many food options to choose from in seminyak the food here at their restaurants are fantastic. Their burgers, ribs and chicken wraps are fresh, beautifully presented and taste phenominal. The hotel facilities are also very good with a beautiful spa and good gym facilities.

The grounds are very well presented and constantly maintained by the staff. The rooms are great size and well presented however the beach wing room we stayed in didnt have enough lights which can make it a bit dim when in the room and also not much storage for clothes(we were staying for a long time and had 4 pieces of luggage) however is sufficient for lighter packed travellers.

Overall fantastic hotel!!!! Definately worth visiting.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1292,Our last days in Bali - the perfect hotel!,50,May 2018,"After traveling and exploring Bali for one week, we wanted our last hotel to be a chill out place. And we had a BLAST spending the last days at Seminyak Beach Resort! :-)

The hotel is great, located directly at the beach. Rooms are beautiful and big, breakfast and food is incredibly yummi but most of all we felt very welcome as everyone working at the hotel was really friendlly and helpful.

Allthoug everyone was helpful we would like to thank especially SANG an in charge of the pool at the sea as he was always just there when we needed something, with a big smile, and gave us some good advises regarding our last trip to mount batur and the tempels around that area.

Also, as on our last day we would return from our trip at 1, it was no problem to get a late check out - this made our last day much easier.

The hotel is doing a great job and we can warmly recommend it! :-)

1293,LOVED IT!!! Best Location,50,April 2018,The rooms were spacious and super clean! The breakfast was ok.. I was expecting a better selection for the price per night.

1294,Its like coming back home again:),50,April 2018,"This is our 2nd stay in seminyak beach resort, as we came 2 years ago on our honeymoon. And seriously this is the best service in a hotel u can get in bali. All the stuff are always smiling and helpful especially paristan(who helped us find another room immediately after finding a lizard in our room since it was 12 am.

Minutes walk from seminyak square where all the bars and restaurants are located. Would definitely recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1297,Beautiful Hotel. Your every need covered,50,April 2018,I can not fault the seminyak beach resort. I had a week‚Äôs stay at the beginning of April and everything was perfect. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I had a ground floor room overlooking the beach which I highly recommend. Mainly adult guests which suited me. The manager was also very approach able and often about talking to guests. I would definitely go back.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1298,an amazing hotel in a great location,50,April 2018,"This is a high-end hotel in busy and bustling Seminyak beach. However, you wouldn't know it. Once inside the gate it's a peaceful place to relax and recharge. Staff are incredibly helpful. The rooms are well appointed - ask for one in the main building with a porch!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1299,Holiday in Bali,50,September 2017,"My fiance and I stayed at the lovely Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. We stayed here for a little over a week and could definitely have stayed longer. The proximity to restaurants in fantastic - only a short 5 minutes strolls. For those days where we didn't want to venture out of the hotel, we spent the majority of the time by the infinity pool. The service was impeccable. One of the younger guys working was Sangtu, he's great. He was very attentive and constantly checked to see if we were ok, needed another drink or some more food.

I look forward to coming back to the Seminyak again December for my honeymoon and to see the staff.

Cheers.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1300,Lovely,40,April 2018,"We stayed at the seminyak, hotel was beautiful our room was lovely.
Wirra and studdy where fantastic members of staff, made us feel very welcome.
The fish might hold on a Tuesday evening was very disappointing, we had booked a table it was gave away they did not replenish any food so by the time we got there all the good food was gone.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1301,One of the best!,50,April 2018,"We have had lovely trip to Bali and staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa has just been wonderful!
The location is the best around Seminyak beach. The hotel is a beauty and the staff is one of the greatest you can find... And I have not been paid to say this!
While usually I don't write reviews, this one deserves an exception.
I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a great quiet stay to come to this hotel and book rooms or villas on the beach side! Infinity pool will attrack you for sure...

At that level of excellence, the menu choice in the restaurants can be improved with more selections, changes in menus during the week and less 'sold out' items.

I wish every staff member we met a great continuation in making this place a paradise!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1302,Amazing views from the pool but let down in other areas,40,April 2018,"Stayed at the Seminyak for 2 nights after adventuring in Ubud. The resort was well maintained and quiet (almost too quiet at times due to a lack of staff in certain areas). On arrival there was no one to greet us so had to drag our luggage and find reception, which is unusual for this type of hotel.

The ocean view room was large and did have a lovely view of the ocean. The shower was hot and powerful and had plenty of amenities. It also came with a hot tub but it was almost pointless as even after an hour it was less than half way full. After an hour an half, I abandoned the idea and left. The jets were also dirty due to lack of cleaning.

The hotel limits the aircon in the room so you can't set it below 22c which for me at time is too warm. After complaining they sent up an engineer to reduce it to 18c. I found this a cheap trick to try and save money. Considering the cost of the rooms this really makes the hotel look stingy and really put a negative outlook on everything else.

The pool however, is the saving grace. Located right on the beach the view is fantastic and gives the impression it merges with the sea. It wasn't crowded and was easy enough to find a place to relax. Amazing views of the sunset in the evenings so take your camera.

Afternoon tea is not worth the time. It consisted of 2 types of self served cake. The lack of staff at the restaurants also meant we were hanging around for 5 minutes waiting for someone to man the desk.

Overall this could be a great hotel if they up'ed their service levels and didn't try to be so cheap on the AC.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1303,Best resort in Bali,50,April 2018,"This is our third stay at the resort and it never fails to impress. Not only is the property exceptionally well maintained but the staff are fantastic as well - nothing is too much trouble. On some days we don't even leave the property, and when you do everything is in close proximity.

This resort has truely become our happy place.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1304,Absolutely amazing,50,April 2018,"We stayed at The Seminyak beach hotel and resort the last week of March with our two kids and the hotel and staff has exceeded our expectations. The hotel has many activities for kids in the morning and the afternoon, which gave us time to relax at the spa and sneak in few massage sessions. The kids loved the hotel and staff as everyone knew their names and greeted them wherever they went. The hotel and rooms are well maintained, the infinity pool is relaxing, and suitable for children. The beach is clean and plenty of space to relax or do some surfing. Pool attendance are very polite and always ready to make your experience enjoyable..

Hotel location is central in Seminyak, walking distance to shopping and restaurants and is very safe area, we didn't have any issues walking to the hotel late at night with our kids.

1307,Relaxing and beautiful room,40,April 2018,"This hotel is very beautiful and well maintained. The pools are heaven on earth - the infinity pool is gorgeous and the swim up bar is so beautiful. Rooms were cleaned twice daily and the rooms are very nice. The bathroom needed a bit of a scrub around the edges but other than that very clean. I know that it is a very upmarket resort but it is not cheap. We found it to be the same price as home (Australia) in terms of food and drink prices. Charge to get from airport to hotel is 520,000IDR - expensive right?! But was a very good car ride.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1308,One of the nicest resorts in Bali - Great Location.,50,March 2018,"What a lovely resort. Excellent service from the moment we arrived at the airport, where we were met by our driver from the Resort, to check in, which was efficient, complete with cool towels and a drink, and our rooms (2) which were on the lower floor beach wing (rooms 3109 and 3110), with terrace opening onto the lovely lawn gardens, sweeping down to the pools and Seminyak Beach. There were a couple of issues with housekeeping, where fresh towels were overlooked but this was corrected without too much fuss. We also had key access failure and safe code failure but each was corrected promptly. The staff were always available and helpful. The infinity pool is really beautiful, and the service around the pool was excellent, in particular I recall Januarad who was particularly helpful. As regulars of Padma, Legian, this was our first visit and we fell in love with the resort, the location and the staff. So much so, that a planned visit to Padma in October has been cancelled in favour of the Seminyak Beach Resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1311,Exceeded Expectations,50,March 2018,"Friendly and efficient staff, beautiful grounds, good food, large rooms, gorgeous pool overlooking the beach and fabulous sunsets.

We made a last minute change to The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and were sooooo glad we did!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1312,A real piece of heaven,50,March 2018,"Our special anniversary was spent in a villa with a beach view and private pool. From the moment we arrived, service was impeccable. A warn greeting from the staff that continued for the whole stay. Taking care of all our needs with big smiles made this an occasion to remember.

1319,Right on the beach with a stunning infinity pool!,50,November 2017,"The Seminyak hotel is fantastic, we loved everything from the infinity pool which over looks the beach to the complimentary afternoon tea and the gorgeous well appointed bedrooms.

We stayed in the property across the road where rooms were a bit cheaper. I do not regret this decision as the room was wonderful and we didn‚Äôt spend much time in there anyway. We still had a nice little balcony and it‚Äôs literally across the road from the main hotel so if you need to pop back to get something it‚Äôs no further than if you were staying in a big hotel where rooms are spread out.

The restaurant does a mix of Indonesian and western cusine, we ate there once and it was pretty good. I‚Äôd recommend a lovely Aussie brunch place just round the corner called Kim soo which does fantastic eggs on sour dough, high quality artisan coffee and yummy cakes.

I‚Äôd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat for couples or friends looking for a relaxing haven whilst still being in the heart of seminyak beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1320,Truely 5 star honeymoon experience,50,August 2017,"I searched carefully and thoroughly when booking accommodation in Seminyak for my honeymoon. I wanted it to be somewhere special, memorable and luxurious and the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa ticked all of the boxes, and more. We didn't even get a chance to explore all of its features and services.

We were greeted with garlands and a drink as soon as we arrived at the hotel. Once checked in and going into our room, we found a personally addressed card/message from the manager which was a very nice touch and this got our honeymoon experience off to a great start.

Throughout our stay, we were just amazed at the friendliness of all of the staff at the hotel and how they would go out of their way to greet you and assist you. It felt personal and you never felt like just another guest/number.
Hotel service was fantastic and staff were always on hand to handle queries regardless of the time of day/night. The hotel was extremely clean both inside and outside. It looked impeccable and was maintained to a very high standard by a number of staff throughout the day, every day.

We had breakfast at the hotel every morning which was lovely and there were a wide range of options available. The atmosphere always felt serene and you always felt that sense of luxury wherever you walked in the hotel.

The room and bathroom were very spacious and we had a nice patio area outside with the garden view. We preferred this as the garden view was nice and gave a change of scenery from looking at the beach all the time when you're outside anyway.

The hotel is located in the heard of Seminyak and all shops and restaurants are a short walk away. The hotel usually arranged something in the evening for guests and during our stay this included traditional dance, barbeque and drinks evenings where the manager and staff were keen to engage with guests. The hotel is located right over the beach and you can either stay within the hotel area beside the infinity pools overlooking the beach, or can walk right down to the beach itself. During the day, beside the pool area there was fresh grilled food and drinks available and we enjoyed some snacks on a couple of occasions.

My partner and I were so glad that we were able to spend our honeymoon at this hotel and we're thankful to all staff at the hotel for making our stay special. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and it was just what I was hoping and expecting from our honeymoon accommodation. It has left us wanting to go back and we would definitely choose to stay in this hotel again should we visit Bali in the future.

Highly recommended for couples who want a luxurious getaway or special honeymoon. Thanks to Michael and all of his staff. We look forward to seeing you again in the future.

1321,Romantic getaway,50,May 2017,"This resort is so peaceful and gorgeous. It is definitely a spot for couples who want romance. It is so quiet, you could almost call it Adults Only. We really enjoyed ourselves as we just needed to get away and relax together. The room was so beautiful, spacious and clean. The room layout was great and the amenities were fantastic. The bathroom was so stylish, I loved it! The POOL! The pool is just dream like. The view stretches out as far as your eyes can see. It's an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. You can hear the waves crashing as you lay there. It was pretty special, and I have to admit it was nice that there was no noise and no children. It was definitely what I wanted for that particular trip. The staff were so helpful and kind! The location of this resort is probably the best you can get other than a resort right in the middle of the noisy strip of Seminyak. It was steps away from Ku De Ta which is great for food and music. It was no more than a 1o minute walk to the main strip of Seminyak which we loved because we would eat out every night and we were never too far away. The breakfast buffet wasn't the greatest. It is an outdoor type feel, so it can get quite muggy. The selection and variety was average. The quality and taste of the food was average also. Out of the five nights we stayed here we ate there three times. The other three times we went out for breakfast instead. Other than the food though I cannot fault this place. I would visit this resort again when I want peace and quiet. Definitely the place to pick for serenity.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1324,First time in bali,50,January 2018,I have recently returned from Bali and stayed at the hotel for 9 nights. Even though on my arrival I found out that the main part of the hotel on the beach was closed for refurbishment so we would have to stay in the other part of the hotel. As you can imagine I was very annoyed but this was not the hotel or the staffs fault this was down to the company I booked with. Even though the hotel did not have all of the facilities I could not fault the service we received from the staff. They could not do enough for us and even tried to help me find another hotel. When this failed and we decided to stay regardless of the situation nothing was too much for the staff. The rooms were exceptional with a walk in shower and free standing bath. The bed was huge and the turn down service always meant there was a little surprise. I could not fault the hotel and obviously when the main hotel re opens I am sure it will be amazing.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1325,Not what I booked,10,December 2017,"Upon arrival to the resort, we were redirected to another nearby hotel and told that the resort was under renovation and we would be accommodated at a different nearby hotel. When we got the lobby of the second hotel, we were told that we could either get a full refund and stay elsewhere or stay at this second hotel and receive a 20% discount. We were never notified that the resort was under renovation even though we booked 4 months in advance. We were essentially forced to stay at the second hotel, because we had very limited alternative options. Disappointed with the way they do business.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1326,Again a nice stay in the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spe,50,October 2017,"We are now the third time in this hotel and again we must say it was for us a wonderful time. We have nothing to comande who was not ok. The Manager, the personal and all the people we had to do they are all so helpful and they every time will do their best that we have verry nice holidays. Again we have every day a excellent breakfast and also the foods are first class. Because that we also have planed to come back the next year 2018.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1327,Service minded staff,50,December 2017,"Unfortunately the hotel was under renovation at the time for our staying there which meant we couldn‚Äôt visit the main building. We hadn‚Äôt noticed this before our booking. Although, we still had access to the smaller building which included a small restaurant and temporary spa. This was nice. The hotel offered a cold welcoming drink and a free 60 minutes massage for 2 because of the inconvenience. The rooms are fantastic. The food in the restaurant is okay. They offer free shuttle to the beach as the main hotel is closed. The staff was very helpful and we were incredibly satisfied with our stay here. They also offered us a free night once the main hotel is back in business.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1328,Family Vacation,40,December 2017,"The main hotel was closed for renovation during the period of our stay (6-10 Dec 2017) and we were offered the Annex building (across the road from the main Wing) that is not sea facing. Right from the start, our experience in this hotel had been more than satisfactory. Staff were friendly and professional, always ready to assist. We were led into the Business Centre for a comfortable and express check in, We had an adjoining room with twin beds for our adult & teen boys and another with king-sized bed for ourselves. Rooms are spacious and equipped with full bath amenities (including a big and deep bath tub). We did not consume any breakfast in the hotel, but noticed that breakfast was brought from the main Wing across the road to the guest rooms.
I was told that renovations will be done in 4-5 months. Despite Mt Agung's minor eruptions, Seminyak and other parts of Bali are very very safe to walk about, even in the night. The Seminyak Resort & Spa is well guarded and that made me feel so safe.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1329,Unfortunately not same the resort in 2015,20,October 2017,I was shocked when I arrived to the resort It was completely different from the Seminyak beach resort I knew in 2015. My room was Double Resort Suite Ocean Side . Negatives: ‚òπÔ∏è 1- long time for checking in . 2- unclean sofa in room . 3- Refrigerator was old and not very cold. 4-water in bathroom was too salty and very hot. 5- old and broken ground in swimming pool. 6- old and dirty daybed in swimming pool. 7- unclean towels. 8- unfortunately unfriendly towels boy . 9- very expensive for the hotel situation . Positives: üôÇ 1-location. 2-sunset view. 3-Afternoon tea. 4-egg menu in breakfast. 5. Jacuzzi in the suite room. I had a beautiful memories there in 2015 but unfortunately the hotel need to renew now. 5 nights there cost me 1450$ by that price you can get amazing room in Ayana resort or Mulia resort . Seminyak resort management try to rescue your hotel. Thank you,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1330,wishing i was still there,50,November 2017,I absolutely love The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa we stayed in the garden house rooms. All the staff were friendly and very helpful just a lovely bunch of people always ready to help. I would definitely stay there again if I was to ever go back its a 2-minute walk to the beach and a 4-minute walk for the shopping district. such a beautiful place and worth seeing.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1331,Exceptional staff and incredible rooms,40,November 2017,"We loved out stay here. From the moment we arrived, we were treated so well. They greeted us with a welcome drink and a flower lei. We also received massages there, which were wonderful. The room was gorgeous and so well appointed - definitely one of the nicer places I've ever stayed and was worth the price. We stayed in the Garden Wing, which is across the street from the main hotel. Unfortunately the main hotel and pool area were under construction and not available when we were there. If it had been, this would probably be a 5-star review. Even still, the Garden wing has its own pool, swim-up bar and restaurant, so we still had plenty of fabulous amenities!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1332,Amazing hospitality!!! Great location,50,November 2017,"The main hotel was under construction where we booked an ocean view, so we had to stay in their smaller building across the street where we had a garden view. I was disappointed at first but upon meeting Michael, the hotel manager, and the warm and friendly staff, We didn't mind at all. After all, you have the ocean a block away from you! The staff are so attentive and go out of their way to please you. Kudos to his team!! It's the little details that count! They gift you a large straw basket for the beach, a Happy Anniversary letter from Michael with fresh fruit, pastries in your room at night, etc. I also wanted flowers for the bath tub and the staff took flowers from the tree nearby... The room is large and beautifully modern with a Balinese flair. The bathroom is large with beautiful white marble and soaking tub with separate shower. The hotel is about 10 minutes to Seminyak square..... nightlife, restaurants, and fun shopping.... the staff would smile and say "" more shopping again today""? I do wish we could've stayed in the larger Hotel but we are looking forward to that next time we come back. I also suggest hiring a driver there to take you around, I had a fantastic one who took us everywhere. All in all it was an amazing trip in Bali. I highly recommend this hotel, do it now!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1333,Overpriced but definitely 5 star in best suite on top floor!,40,December 2016,"Very very expensive, a bit overpriced, our room damn amazing, massive, just fabulous, but stayed just as nice for half the price maybe just not as spacious the room size but who spends all day in there anyway so what‚Äôs a few sq ft.... had a ball, staff lovely, food nice... stay again - not for the price but for the place yes.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1334,Nice Hotel,40,October 2017,Hotel was comfortable and clean and the staff were extremely friendly. The infinity pool is beautiful with views looking onto the sea and the swim up bar is nice. Found the hotel to be overpriced for what it is but this is in comparison to other places we stayed whilst in Bali which is perhaps not a fair comparison. It may be that Seminyak is more expensive to stay than other places such as Nusa Dua. As far as Seminyak is concerned I would stay here again but in general if in Bali I would stay in Nusa Dua again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1335,Quite possibly the best hotel we've ever stayed in,50,October 2017,"This is one of the best, if not the best, hotel we have ever stayed in. The location, right on the beach, is superb with great sunsets to be viewed every day, a great pool with plenty of room and even someone to clean your sunglasses for you! The overall vibe was relaxed and with very attentive staff who really worked at making this a great place to stay, this amounted to a superb place for a holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1336,Bliss in Bali,50,October 2017,"Fabulous hotel - cannot recommend enough. Staff, food, quality of accommodation and location - all amazing. Tip for your room would be to ensure on beach side / west of property. The infinity pool leads right onto a beautiful beach. It is perfect for lying on a sun lounger, drinking a cocktail and watching the sun set. Seminyak is 5 min walk to Main Street where you can shop, eat and drink. Horse riding is close by - reception can organise trips, book restaurants and horse riding with no hassle. The spa is fabulous. Treatments well worth the experience. Loved this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1337,Renovations-disappointed,30,November 2017,"I booked online the choice was between this and alila resort.looking at the pictures it looked great, and sure it would of been if there was no renovations or warning! We only booked one night as I live in Bali and this was for my anniversary. We ended up being on the otherside of the road to the beach and a tiny pool!! When I was expecting sea views, and a beautiful resort. The room was good, but no room service so had to order GO-JEK!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1338,Wonderful that you remembered us,50,October 2017,Thank you for your wonderful hospitality. It's great that some of your staff like Shanti actually remember us and the birthday cake was a wonderful touch. Shanti is always cheerful and the breakfast team is fast with our request and always wear a wonderful smile.Special mention to Sutarsa of house keeping for doing a wonderful job tidying our room - friendly gentleman who speaks very good English. Great job guys.. Will be back again next year .. congratulations for having such a wonderful team at your resort. Thank you,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1339,Pure Luxury in perfect location,50,October 2017,"We had a fabulous 5 days at the resort. It's such a beautiful setting and the staff are beyond lovely and helpful. Perfect location in Seminyak - close to shops, Ku De Ta, Motel Mexicola, Potato Head. Would definitely recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1340,"Perfect location , perfect staff which helped with room and upgraded us to garden view ground floor, amazingly polite",50,October 2017,"Thank you seminyak hotel, I Am planning to return next year with family and friends , the amenities at room were perfect extra clean and comfortly welcoming, the food at the restaurant was also speechless but expensive",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1341,A very nice wedding anniversary stay!,50,October 2017,"It was our first visit to Bali and we did our research before hand to weigh up which part of Bali to stay in and which hotel. After deciding that Seminyak would be best suited for us we then came across this hotel which had great reviews and it didn't disappoint. We really enjoyed our stay here, the room was clean and well kept by the cleaning staff, the breakfast was nice with a wide range of foods to choose from and the hotel grounds were well maintained and clean. We were there for 8 nights and could have easily stayed longer if we had the chance to. The staff were always very friendly and very smiley and always willing to help, we got to know a few of them, Nika, Winda, Tia, Arta, Eka, Indra, to name but a few but all the staff were great, from the trainees serving at breakfast to the cleaners, the security guards, receptionists and bar staff who were all very nice and friendly! The hotel is located near lots of shops and places to eat which are just a 5-10 minute walk away and there are always blue bird taxi's to flag down if you need one. Overall we enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the beach and pool area and the hotel's restaurant that over looks the beach and ocean. We used the hotel sauna and which always had fresh towels and nice showers and the business room was useful when we had to check in online for our flight back home, you could also make yourself a cup of tea or coffee and there were jars of cookies which were yummy! Every afternoon between 3-5pm the hotel would serve complimentary afternoon tea with a selection of cakes to hotel guests which we thought was a nice touch. Our only disappointment was that we would have liked to have had a room in the main part of the hotel as our garden view room was located in the other part of the hotel across the road, (which we didn't realise at the time of booking) it feels like you're separated from the main hotel so if you are going to stay here its a point to consider when booking your room. The other part of the hotel does have it's own pool and pool bar and business room, it can feel like you have your own private pool as it's very quiet at times. Other than that we were very pleased with the hotel and helpfulness of the staff who made our wedding anniversary a rememberable and enjoyable one. Thank you to all at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa! Matur Suksma!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1342,Return visit disappointing,30,September 2017,"On a recent visit we had a couple of days in Seminyak and opted to return to Seminyak beach resort as we had really enjoyed a week there previously . We stayed in the garden wing which we really did NOT enjoy . When we enquired about an upgrade to an ocean front room which we were totally prepared to pay for the main reception said they would look and get back to us later that day . We never heard from them again. Even if no rooms available please call and say that . We really felt like we were in a completely different hotel across the road and one with no staff . In three days I saw three staff .A lone reception person, a very lonely barman at an empty bar at the empty mini pool they have there and a cleaner .If you call for ice be prepared for a long wait. Our shower was backing up ,we reported it and waited . No response so went to the pool for five hours and on return still not fixed . Finally we asked the cleaner who was very helpful went and got some tools and fixed it We never saw the maintenance man who was supposed to come. When passing the lone person in the lonely reception we asked a few times for different things and got "" Dial 1"" as a response . Felt like there was low level of service Especially when the entire reception area is empty and they are not attending to anyone else . The main pool in the main resort across the road which for us is the main draw card for this resort was disappointing . The temperature of the water was bath warm so not ideal if you want a more refreshing swim . Half the decking has been replaced but the other half is frankly dangerous. Wood rot , boards sticking up and a genuine hazard . The deck chairs are jammed together Not enough personal space between strangers basking in the sun. Also no pillows and towels are shabby . They are about to close and renovate this hotel and it sorely needs it for the price they command per room . Having stayed at some of the newer beach front hotels recently this hotel doesn't rate well in comparison . Sadly it's off our list for any more stays . Really needs to improve to justify the costs . Garden wing . Forget it !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1343,Great Experience,50,October 2017,"We loved the Seminyak Beach Resort! We stayed here the last two nights of our honeymoon and found the resort to be perfectly located and a wonderful spot to have a few relaxing days! The staff was super friendly, helpful and accomodating. The beachfront location was excellent!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1344,Perfect location but choose your room wisely...,40,October 2017,"I had stayed here for four nights for a relaxing holiday.

I booked a garden room in the building across the road as I didn't mind a short walk to work off the Bintangs.

Unfortunately I was not aware of the noisy traffic that would wake me up every night.
The building is on a busy road and my room faced the road, every night the sound of motorcycles and horns beeping.

It was so bad after the third night I complained and was thankfully moved to a garden room in the main building.

It was absolute bliss listening to the ocean waves until the mosquitos started buzzing in my ear.

Despite the sleep disturbances everything else was perfect especially the infinity pool that over looks the beach.

The day spa is worth a try, I had a Balinese massage here on my first day and it topped the other day spas by far.

The staff are very attentive and cannot be faulted.

The hotel has an ATM that is very conveniently located next to the day spa.

The location is close to many great restaurants and shops.

Overall a great hotel but be careful when selecting your room.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1345,Wow wow and wow! Amazing,50,October 2017,"We stayed here for 5 days / 4 nights and it was just a dream! We were in a garden villa which was located across the road but it really wasn‚Äôt a disturbance at all, it only took us 5 minutes to walk to the main pool by the beach. However there was a small pool in our area of rooms too! The room was beautiful, so luxurious and a huge bathroom. Nice air con and the housekeeping staff left the room immaculate and were so lovely. The main pool was beautiful, nice loungers right on the beach so you get a lovely sea breeze! The pool was the perfect temperature and so clean. The staff were amazing, so kind and helpful and they couldn‚Äôt be faulted at all! The hotel was in a great location, 10 minute walk to the main streets and seminyak square. The shops and restaurants are all amazing! Very trendy modern and perfect for myself (20‚Äôs) and also my mother who loves a ‚Äòmooch‚Äô. Our favourite cafes for breakfast within a 10 minute walk were: KimSoo, Sisterfields and Cafe Bali. All worth a check out !! The Italian restaurant ultimo was also amazing !! The restaurants in seminyak are less than half the price of any in Nusa Dua and a much higher standard. We would love to stay here again couldn‚Äôt recommend enough!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1346,Beers in the bathtub...,40,October 2017,A very nice hotel. The beachfront is great for the sunset and a few beers although there were a lot of mosquitoes in the day (a lot more than we saw at the other hotels in Bali we stayed at - we'd been getting away with only using DEET in the night elsewhere). The room was beautifully laid out. There's a glass screen between the bathroom and the bed so you can drink beers in the bath and watch TV. Some of the rooms are on the other side of the road from the main room though so make sure to ask for a room in the main complex.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1347,Wonderful!!,50,October 2017,"A wonderful hotel in Seminyak!!
Right on the beach!! pure bliss and elegant luxury
A stone throw away from all the cafes and restaurants and fab shopping
service is sublime
Staff are friendly and so wonderful
Stunning all round resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1348,A great hotel,40,October 2017,"We spent eight blissful nights here, and were super-impressed by the superb service, friendly staff and great food (especially breakfast and the complimentary afternoon tea). Our room was spacious and well-equipped. The setting is quiet and peaceful - the perfect spot for a very relaxing beach holiday. The only thing that has prevented me from giving it an 'excellent' rating is the fact that the food and beverage prices are very high in comparison to the many excellent local restaurants. We were on a bed and breakfast deal, so we ended up eating away from the hotel most nights - as it appeared did many other guests too, as the main restaurant was virtually empty most evenings. However, this was not a major problem as it enabled us to get out and about a bit more than we otherwise would have done. Overall I would recommend the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and I would be very happy to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1349,The most amazing Resort in Seminyak!,50,September 2017,"My Husband and i decided to travel to Bali for our first anniversary for one week.. and it was our first stop after a very long flights..

we spent the first 3 night in The Seminyak Beach Resort and spa.. i was overwhelmed with how everything was great from the second we arrived..
First of all They surprised us being upgraded to ocean view suite instead of beach wing for our anniversary:)
I can say a lot about the staff and how friendly they are i even found a girl on the reception ( unfortunately i forgot her name) bringing us flowers beside all the special treats we found in the room..
The view were awesome.. the food.. and their special afternoon tea, which arrives to tour room daily for free..
The breakfast has so many choices and so rich!
My only problem was, me and my husband usually feel hungry after 10 pm:D and got to choose from a very limited choices for in dining room.. as they serve certain few plates after 10 pm..
About the resort location, i can say its literally in the heart of Seminyak, a 5-10 min. Walk to shops.. and also theres a 24hr market only 2min away!
Also theres a great beach lounge and club ‚Äúku de ta‚Äù almost 30 second walk!

Overall i highly recommend it:)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1350,Great experience - we loved it,50,October 2017,"Thank especially to Desi, Kardiana, and Nika - they were very helpful, friendly and made our stay much more enjoyable. It's a lovely resort with good food, a good view, and lovely people. We would highly recommend it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1351,big enough but not to large,50,October 2017,thoroughly enjoyed our stay. very friendly and attentive staff. not ideal for children. shopping area and good restaurant selection all in easy walking distance. would come again and can recommend this hotel.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1352,Superb first class hotel with amazing staff,50,October 2017,"This is our second visit to the hotel this year. We love the place. It's hard to know where to start. The rooms are fantastic - spacious and clean with all the extras anyone could want. Beautiful gardens (sitting out on the balcony overlooking gardens and ocean in background listening to birds singing was one of my favourite parts of the day). The resort had an outstanding pool area with an infinity pool. The buffet breakfast is amazing - serving continental, Indonesian buffet, the usual eggs benedict and bacon etc, a huge array of fresh fruit, freshly baked pastries and excellent coffee. Great cocktails by poolside too with nightly entertainment. Swimming in pool is allowed until 10pm - night swimming blissful in the balmy heat.
Most of all the staff are superb - so so friendly, happy and accommodating and eager to please. Can highly recommend this hotel - one of the best I've ever stayed at. We will be back. Good luck with the renovations and thank you for making our stay so special.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1353,Nice but expensive,40,October 2017,"Beautiful gardens lead to the swimming pool which overlooks the beach.
Staff very attentive and helpful.
The hotel is well located away from the busy end of Seminyak.
Will probably return but a little concerned about the expense.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1354,Perfect location to relax,50,October 2017,"The Seminyak Beach Resort is wonderful located. The staff is very welcoming and friendly.
The beach is great for long walks - the infinity pool perfect for swimming and watching the surfers.
The resort is a footwalk from the heart of Seminyak with its nice shops and restaurants. We would highly recommend and choose the resort again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1355,"An amazing stay, stunning beachfront location",50,October 2017,"We have just stayed at The Seminyak for 9 nights and it was just perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff as so friendly, everywhere you walk they say hello and can't do enough for you. No one ever said no to any request.

The hotel is spotless throughout with fresh towels in the room, well kept gardens and an amazing infinity pool. The room was a great size but as other reviews have mentioned stay in the main hotel. We were in the garden wing which meant crossing the busy dirty main road everyday which ruined the resort feeling. Once inside though our room was lovely with a very larg e and comfy bed and a fantastic bathroom. They also left 6 bottles of water a day which was great, nice touch.

The location is perfect, walking distance to everything. I would advise you always walk as the traffic is so bad you can walk quicker than the taxis! Sunset cocktails next door at Ku De Ta were our favourite. It's also a perfect size as it's large enough to feel peaceful and not crowded but small enough to feel intimate. We were choosing between here and the W and I would recommend the Seminyak as it feels very traditional and more chilled. The W is cool but you could be anywhere in the world and it had more of an Ibiza style vibe.

We did the full board option which was great. The menu choices were endless and the Indonesian food in particular was the best we had in Bali. The drinks are very expensive though, especially wine. I understand wine is expensive in most of Bali but we felt the hotels wine prices were ridiculous, especially when we had a lovely bottle of red for ¬£8 at Ultimo Italian restaurant which was a stones throw away.

My only other tip to the hotel is that it's lovely yoga is included that was part of the reason we booked. However attendance is very low and I think it's because it's way too early! 7.30am everyday with no other alternatives meant I only went once, too early for holiday. Other guests said they would all go if it was later and a sunset option would be nice on the lawn as well, would love it if they added that for our next visit.

Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so luxurious and special, we definitely felt spoilt and will send friends and family visit soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1356,A beautiful place !,50,October 2017,"Excellent service, beautiful room and nice surroundings. The price of drinks and meals inside the hotel are quite high but it's so conveniente to admire the sun set from the lounge chairs at the pool facing the ocean.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1357,Outstanding resort!,50,October 2017,"Definitely an unrivaled experience. Staff go above and beyond to ensure you have a pleasent stay, exceptionally friendly and generous. Managers hosting complimentary cocktail nights by the beach with live music watching the sunset was amazing. Lazing by the massive Infinity pool ( with the Beach as your back drop ) watching the sunset over the water was incredible. I couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough how great my experience was and for others to try them out too! Such a convenient location, no transport needed as all shopping and food spots are minutes walking distance
from the resort. Will definitely be return for my next trip to Bali! Thank you for an incredible stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1358,Comfortable and relaxing stay,40,October 2017,"Great location, quality facilities and food at affordable prices. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were well upkept and clean. Easy to get around to the other areas. Would recommend the beach wing or beach suite.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1359,Lovely setting.,40,September 2017,"The Hotel is set in lovely gardens with a fantastic beach-side location and large swimming pool. There are 2 parts to the hotel- the main hotel and an annexe across the road with it's own small pool.We spent 2 nights in a ground floor garden terrace room in the annexe. The room was large, with ample sized bathroom with both a shower and a bath. The outlook from our room however was depressing as our balcony looked out onto a wall. I would not have wanted to have stayed in this room for any longer because of this. Also it was a bit tedious having to cross the road over to the main hotel. Lots of restaurants, cafes and shops are within easy walking distance although the restaurant and bar facilities at the hotel were excellent.I would recommend that anyone wanting to stay here book a room in the main hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1360,Sept 24 - Oct 01 2017,40,September 2017,"Great pool, beach suite room was nice and staff very friendly...
Only thing disappointing was they ran low on alcohol and didn't replenish stocks. No rose, San Miguel or captain Morgans after day one. I thought they would of gone to bottle shop and bought some more...
Also breakfast is expensive... 300000 rupiah per person.. better off going down the road to Kim Soo for breakfast.
I would stay there again without hesitation",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1361,Honeymoon stay,50,October 2017,We just stayed here for our honeymoon and absolutely loved it! It is a beautiful sanctuary in the heart of buzzing Seminyak.

1362,Good atmosphere,50,September 2017,"Well located in Seminiak, excellent breakfasts, beautiful infinity pool overlooking the sea and sunset, attentive and helpful staff always available.

In the rooms the comfort is very good, however for a 5 star, the air conditioning as well as the jacuzzi show signs of old age.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1363,Fantastic!,50,September 2017,"Loved this hotel. Great location - easy to walk to restaurants, shops and markets. Staff were amazing - friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Remembering guest names from check-in is impressive and makes you feel valued! Room clean and spacious. Breakfast buffet lovely. Pool sensational - staff there to help with food, drinks, towels, even sunglass cleaning! Beautiful beach on the doorstep. NOT the place to go with young children - perfect for couples, business or solo travellers. Can't fault it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1364,Relaxed resort holiday,50,September 2017,"We were just thrilled with our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort! We were welcomed by everyone we came into contact with and were super impressed that they would call us by name from day 1! Pretty awesome considering the size of the resort! The facilities were just beautiful, clean, modern with helpful staff and nothing was ever too much trouble. We made the most of the onsite spa, cultural evening, restaurants and the amazing infinity pool. It was our wedding anniversary and we were given flowers, a card and a cake to celebrate! A lovely personal touch! Located in a great spot, easy to walk to many restaurants, nightspots and markets and an easy taxi ride to Kuta/Legian. Just beautiful, we hope to be back soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Staffs are super helpful and accommodating, location is great - it's near to many restos/shops/etc, the infinity pool with ocean view is literally THE dream! And many, many incredible things that I'd like to mention however I think it's best if experienced yourselves. I have no complaints, perfect.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1366,Beautiful resort,50,September 2017,"My partner and I stayed for 3 nights, definitely wasn't enough!!
My favourite part was the pool area, facing directly in front of the beach.
Room, facilities and service is above average.
Everything was at 5 star level during our stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1367,Fabulous beachfront property,50,September 2017,"We enjoyed 5 nights at the fabulous Seminyak Beach resort recently and had a wonderful, relaxing break. The resort is beachfront and boasts a huge infinity pool, overlooking the surf. The are plenty of pool beds available during the day which are well serviced by the pool staff. The pool itself is refreshing but not freezing- so lovely to relax in. Our room was on the ground floor and we loved exiting via our balcony area & going to the pool or gazebo. We had a mini view of the ocean & could hear the waves from our room. The rooms are lovely with superb Aromatherapy amenities, TWG teas and a secret treat box every night. We loved the daily afternoon tea with my favourite TWG tea served with a choice of three delicious cakes. Manager's drinks was also superb at the beach bar at sunset, with live musicians, delicious cocktails & canap√©s & the resort Manager Michael introducing himself to all his guests ensuring all are being well looked after. It was a lovely five days and we shall look forward to returning on our next trip to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1368,fantastic place and location,50,August 2017,"I stayed here for business but gave myself a few extra days, so relaxing, great staff, location perfect, short walk to seminyak square, property is on the beach so nice long walks along the sand after dinner was wonderful, food was fantastic here also, make sure you stay in for the seafood BBQ NIGHT, PERFECT",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1369,Relaxing stay,40,September 2017,"Ocean view suite was nice, had a balcony and an ocean view but for the price my expectation was to be closer to the ocean, these rooms have a view of the distant ocean across the top of the motel. The door to our room & was facing a busy noisey street & the driveway, I was a bit shocked by this to be honest, because you have ocean view you kind of expect to be near the ocean....Our room was turned down nightly all except one night and i'm not really sure why.

Reception were helpful on check in, the room wasn't ready but they allowed us use of the facilities. Check out was 12pm & with a late night flight we were again allowed use of the facilities including the showers in the resort spa. Fantastic!
Breakfast was fabulous with lots on offer....

The infinity pool was the place to see the sunset but around 3pm there is no shade. The food at the pool could have offered some healthy options but instead had American inspired takeaway style hotdogs, ribs and chips, pizza etc...

Afternoon tea comprised of cakes/pastries and coffee, lovely.

We usually stay in Legian and wanted to try something different this time, I found this resort a little over priced for what it was and while the suite was spacious it's location within the resort did not meet its pricing expectation. This resort is well located to Seminyak Sq and the surrounds but there is so much more to Seminyak than these streets ....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1370,Peaceful paradise,50,September 2017,We had a suite which overlooked the ocean & we could watch the sunset! The breakfast was amazing & cooked to order. The infinity pool was lovely & overlooked the beach. We even had our sunglasses cleaned! The staff could not do enough & even ordered me almond milk especially for my coffee. We will definitely return!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1371,Great Resort,50,September 2017,"My wife and I stayed for five nights. The facilities, staff and location were fantastic and the level of service was five star. The entire stay was enjoyable from check in until check out. I highly recommend the Resort to anyone thinking of staying",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1372,The Seninyak Beach resort,50,September 2017,"An excellent place to stay. You can combine visits up north in the silver village or Wood one. Just enjoy and relax and do surfing just in front of your Hotel and to at night fall have fun, have delicious drink in one of the many restaurants and bar at walk distance.
A bit more expensive compared to other islands parts, it's just up to you to to decide which kind of holidays you want to experience, and unique chance to combine luxury and bag pack in one single trip. We loved it! Oh September is a perfect time, as less crowded and much more affordable too and a perfect weather.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1373,Central,40,September 2017,A great place to stay as it's in the centre of the humming party central of Seminyak. Walking distance to Patato Head and right next to Ku De TA which offers amazing food. Lovely staff and always friendly. Rooms are comfy and clean.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1374,Amazing hotel,50,September 2017,"Stayed at the Seminyak in September 2017 with my partner. Cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Staff were so friendly and NOTHING is a problem for them, this includes reception staff, security at the gates, cleaners, breakfast staff, pool staff.
Breakfast was amazing, there‚Äôs a buffet option or you can order a la Carte. There‚Äôs 2 men playing steel instruments as you eat which is lovely as well.
Room was clean, no faults, the staff cleaned it twice a day and left us sweets in the evening. Room had everything we needed and more, including hair dryer and safe. Really good size bath and shower as well.
We stayed in the Green wing so was escorted each trip to the main building, was very safe.
Hotel is in an excellent location, right on the beach and right near the strip, lots of restaurants, bars and clubs.
There‚Äôs 2 pools, one infinity which looks over the scenic views of the sea and one with a swim up bar. Plenty of sunbeds so even if you get there at midday, there‚Äôs still so many beds available.
To sum up, this hotel caught my eye when I wanted to book Bali and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt stay anywhere else.
Thank you so much for having us, it was a holiday of a lifetime.

1375,The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa...a paradise for any traveller..,50,August 2017,"Recently returned from my second stay at this fabulous resort.
Within 3 weeks of arriving back in my home city of Perth WA, I had booked for my next stay which will be in June 2018. The Seminyak is such a relaxing resort whether you choose to stay at the Beach Wing or the Garden Wing, both areas have fabulous pools, beautiful surrounding landscape and the staff on both sides are second to none!!
The evening sunsets are something to experience from the Infinity pool, and this area also boasts a couple of wonderful beach side restaurants, The resort is also ideally located for easy access to the wonderful Seminyak ""eat street"" region where yo can experience the sophisticated hustle and bustle of this sensation region of Bali.
Come, investigate The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, you won't be disappointed...!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1376,Great place - would highly recommend,50,September 2017,"Lovely place. Good service, infinity pool that overlooks the beach. Clean, modern and spacious luxury rooms. Breakfast was truly international with cuisine from all around the world. Great spa. We stayed for 2 nights to end our trip and it was perfect.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1377,Amazing hotel and service!,50,September 2017,"I personally thought the hotel was amazing - great infinity pool over looking the beach. The lounge chairs by the pool were easily available. The rooms were also great - lean and spacious. Most of all, I thought the service topped it of - very helpful staff which made my stay extremely pleasant. The location is also very central to a ton of restaurants and shops!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1378,Great place!,50,August 2017,"My wife and I are used to come to the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa every year, for the last 7 years.

If you ever go to Seminyak, this hotel is just the PERFECT location!
Few steps away from main street, with the best shops (my wife is happy) and restaurants to hang out at night.
And just in front of the Ocean, a long sand beach to walk around and a nice left wave to surf (I am happy!).

You will enjoy these large facilities, luxurious garden, beautiful 40+ meters infinity pool, roomy and stylish accommodations but in the same time at human scale!

The staff is very kind and dedicated.

Great breakfast in the main restaurant or next to the beach.
Don‚Äôt miss out the beach front restaurant, with a very nice Mediterranean food menu and good selection of wines!

And if by chance you can meet the new director Michael, you will get to know a very nice and involved gentlemen.
He just arrived this year, but we have already seen the improvements he made compared to last year.

We will definitely get back there next year!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1379,Great Hotel all round,50,September 2017,"Had a wonderful stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa . Great location , food fantastic and coctails amazing but what we really loved the most was the true hospitality of the staff and attention to details . It was my partners first time in Bali and a early birthday get away . We where lucky upon arrival to be upgraded to a suit which was stunning and very clean as well as a birthday cake for my partner .We also took advantage of the Special promotion they had in the Spa treatment , twice actually it was that good . Love this place and highly recommend to couples especially . We cant wait to visit again .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1380,"Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Infinity Pool, Great sunset views",50,September 2017,"Beach view room, very spacious, great views. Great choice of food for breakfast, caters for all nationalities, nice and relaxing. Lovely staff nothing was too much trouble. Even the security staff always spoke and asked how our day / evening was.
Wide choice of restaurants within walking distance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1381,Loved this hotel!,50,September 2017,"Couldn't fault this hotel at all. We used the hotel transport from the airport, the driver was friendly and had drinks waiting for us. We had the warmest of welcomes when we got to the hotel. We had booked a room in the garden section of the hotel which is across the road from the main hotel but no complaints. It was lovely. Immaculately clean, serviced every morning and the bed turned down at night. Everything you would expect from a 5 star. Breakfast was excellent with lots to choose from. All the staff were friendly and helpful. A personal greeting from the Manger was a nice touch and a cocktail evening. Pool area is beautiful and the pool restaurant is reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Great beach too!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1382,Paradise,50,September 2017,We stayed in 3 hotels in Bali and this was by far my favourite. It's not too large and as a result the effort has gone into making it as beautiful and well organised as possible. The staff are so friendly and helpful - the breakfast is amazing and the food in the restaraunta the rest of the day is excellent. The pool is beautiful and so close to the sea. Excellent place to chill and we loved it so much we could've stayed there most evenings rather than heading out into Seminyak. The spa is great and similarly a lovely place to be in. They are very generous with bottled water too - 6 per day is the most we were offered whilst in Bali which is a real perk believe it or not! I would absolutely visit again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1383,Another amazing stay at The Seminyak,50,September 2017,"We recently enjoyed another 5 days at The Seminyak. Again, this beautiful resort did not miss a beat . The rooms are so spacious and comfortable, and we love the doors opening straight onto the garden . Breakfast and afternoon tea even better than our first visit. Our favourite spot of course is around the stunning pool, wow, what a position . Could lie here for hours sipping the delicious cocktails !!
Our five days here were the perfect finish to our 2 week holiday , hopefully we can return in the not to distant future .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1384,Loved this Resort,50,September 2017,"Excellent location, right on the beach and an easy walk to the centre of Seminyak. The resort is not to large, making it even more relaxing. The infinity pool is beautiful. I will definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1385,Lovely Hotel,50,September 2017,"Really beautiful hotel by the sea, we stayed here for 4 nights. Mostly very clean around the hotel, very very friendly and helpful staff, excellent service from start to finish, lovely gardens and grounds kept very neat and tidy, pool view of the sea is amazing and very clean. Only complaints - they play Indonesian style music through the hallways quite early in the morning which woke me up every morning, one evening there was an event at the Ku De Ta Beach Club next door which went on quite late with loud music, also avoid staying in the building across the road if you can, not as nice. Spa was quite expensive, you can get treatments for less than half the price across the road. The hotel was very very very quiet and could do with being a bit livelier, but then that depends what you're after.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1386,The best hotel we have ever stayed in!!!,50,September 2017,"It was our 4 year anniversary and we arrived to the most amazing welcome and were greeted with flower garlands and drinks. We were then told we had been upgraded and our room was absolutely amazing. With the incredible breakfast, free afternoon tea, complementary snacks and sun glass cleaning by the pool and turn down service and sweet treats on the bed this hotel everything we could possibly wish for! The staff were so friendly and we actually got engaged on the beach whilst we were here! The perfect hotel and the perfect holiday, could not recommended highly enough and we will definitely be back!

1387,5 star Luxury Hotel with Amazing Infinity Pool,50,September 2017,"ocean suite - amazing view, very spacious, top floor - great views, balcony was perfect for morning coffees, spa bath with a view was amazing
breakfast - amazing, fresh food and variety exceptional
pool - 50 mtrs in length, never crowded, right on the beach, pool bar menu needs improvement = limited, but still acceptable
location - walking distance to shops, restaurants and cafes.
seminyak shopping itself - very expensive - nice stuff but pay same, if not more, than Australia (eg Camilla kaftan - $599 in Aus, at Seminyak Square Shopping Ctr - $990 . not joking either .. yikes)
Definitely will be staying back at this resort. Amazing staff.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1388,Honeymoon to remember!,50,August 2017,"We've just spent 2 weeks based at this amazing resort. The quiet and serene atmosphere was a complete contrast to the busy, bustling town in which it sits. The accommodation was perfect and facilities exceeded our expectations. The infinity pool and staff were fantastic and a special mention for Suparman who looked after us so well poolside! Breakfasts were exceptional, so much choice and again exceptional service especially from Nika who's respectful and friendly approach was a joy ( thank you Nika for the Happy Birthday rendition üé∂üéµüé∂ and the lovely cake!). If your looking for a little bit of luxury combined with some occasional hassle and bustle then I would highly recommend this hotel as a base, we couldn't fault it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1389,Top quality beach hotel at Seminyak,50,September 2017,"We stayed 4 nights in September, had booked a garden bedroom but got an upgrade upon arrival.

Best of hotel is the infinity pool, nothing beats the sunset from the pool with a cocktail!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1390,Perfect for Our Honeymoon!,50,September 2017,My wife and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort in Bali for our Honeymoon at the beginning of September and had an amazing stay. From check-in to check-out the hotel experience and staff was amazing. The rooms are fantastic and have everything you need. The resort has awesome infinity pools and a great swim up bar at the smaller pool. The restaurant and breakfast buffet was like anything we've ever seen and the food was excellent and a great cultural experience. The resort is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from one of the main streets with shops and restaurants in Seminyak. We loved our stay at this resort and would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about traveling to Bali.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1391,An oasis of calm and paradise in Bali,50,September 2017,"What a superb resort. Everyone is so charming and the rooms were heavenly. Everything about this hotel is classy and totally geared to pampering the guest. Room 3101 on the ground floor was stunning with great access to the garden, beach and restaurant. Couldn't fault the service or the location. Seminyak itself was a little too busy for our liking but you did not feel it once inside the resort. If I could criticise anything it is the drains which upon arrival at the hotel is your first impression of a bad drain smell (probably more associated with Bali drainage as a whole) but maybe they could use some deoderizer being applied in the area of the reception as they open the car and check the bags/boot of the car for security reasons and the smell knocks you sideways. Within the hotel and grounds there was nothing to fault whatsoever. We stayed for 5 days and would have liked longer. The beach is also very quiet at this end of the resort and very romantic setting.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1392,Superb stay,50,September 2017,"Went there for our honeymoon in September. Stayed in the ocean villa with private pool. It was just perfect. Super clean, very spacious, with all the privacy you wish for. Hotel very well maintained and the staff is very friendly polite and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1393,Possibly the most romantic resort in Seminyak Bali,50,September 2017,"If you are looking for romance yet desire to be in the middle of bustling Seminyak, The Seminyak Beach Resort pool villas is the perfect place for you. We stayed in a gorgeous beach villa with a private pool, enormous bathroom for two with a beautiful oversized bath and double vanities, very comfortable bedroom and a private courtyard with our own private pool. Unlike many hotel villas this one is completely private and nobody can peek over the fence - a perfect honeymoon retreat.
We loved the villa so much that we hardly left it, but when we did, beachfront pool was an absolute treat - fancy sipping a fresh coconut and enjoying some of the most spectacular sunsets in the world from a comfortable deck chair right on Seminyak beach.
Beachfront restaurant is also excellent - they serve light mediterranean cuisine with a sensational beach view. I loved the food and the decor and would recommend Sanje even to those not staying at the resort.
All in all - a very romantic, luxurious, pampering stay - everything we hoped for! Recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1394,5 Star Beachfront Hotel with amazing infinity pool,50,September 2017,"My husband and I celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary, along with his birthday .. and we picked the right hotel to do so.
Infinity Pool was amazing. Beach front was great to walk along, but as for swimming ... no.
The Ocean View Suite was perfect. Spacious, ocean views, quiet, clean and bed was perfect.
The breakfast buffet, which was included, was fresh, and the quality of the food was fabulous.
The staff of this hotel are very welcoming, very professional and always have a very warm smile to greet you.

1396,"Good location, worst management ever",10,September 2017,"Hotel has good location. But management is a pure disaster. No cooperation. No support. No understanding. Nothing to do with hospitality. Wanted early check in and was turned down for stupid excuses. They don't go the extra mile , easier for them to say no",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1397,"The 3 L's location, location, location",50,August 2017,"This hotel has an amazing location - in the middle of Seminyak, and on the beach. A close work to Seminyak Square, shops and restaurants.
It is beach side - for walks, sunsets and drinks
It is short walk to the great restaurants of Seminyak.
Like most hotels in Bali, the staff will accommodate your every need. The rooms are spacious and face the garden and ocean - those on the ocean side.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1398,Beautiful beach view,50,September 2017,"A beautiful location, right on Seminyak Beach. Room was clean, the staff were really friendly and the service was excellent. The infinity pool was a great spot to watch the beach waves and easy access to the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1404,Most memorable trip,50,August 2017,"We booked garden wing room which is across the street as beach wing room prices were very High. But upon arrival on request we got upgrade for beach wing beach view room .Which was $160 for 4 days .We actually got good price upon request .Thank you Devi for arranging us beach view room as resort was full at that time .Otherwise Service ,view ,food and staff is extraordinary. They do room service twice. View of the sunset and atmosphere is so beautiful we ended up cancelling our visit at Ayana Rockbar to sped an evening here . Garden wing is just across the street so if u get it for $200 then its fine ..we booked for very high price due to peak season but I am happy we got upgrade for the fair price . It has beautiful infinity pool . It is next to famous beach club Ku Ta Da and 500m from Potato head club But believe me u get better ambiance at resort and wont fell like going any if those loude clubs .I would would definitely go back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1405,Great location!,40,August 2017,"Wonderful smaller resort right on Seminyak beach. Has a beautiful horizon swimming pool you can lol in & watch the beach walkers go by. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & the staff are friendly.
I do think for the price paid though they can make your stay just that little more special! We often stay in the private pool villas at Ayana & once you've stayed there well - they make the villa guests feel super special -
We felt at this resort besides a board at the front st breakfast there was no communication or anything extra. Pitty because we missed out on a few things as a result. Eg. The local dinner which they set up so beautifully out on the lawn! Plus we were return guests.
But on the whole great location & lovely relaxing resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1406,"Moved rooms twice, very noisy and undercooked food at the BBQ",20,September 2017,"We must of had an unfortunate stay for our honey moon. Can't fault the staff but the hotel is not up to scratch for 5 star and the cost. Firstly there is pungent sewage smell in the entrance area from from the fountain I presume. We upgraded at a pretty sum to the ocean wing on recommendation and our room had the dreaded faulty air con we all hate in hotels, a maintenance man tried to fix it but continued to be noisy all night. We got accosted outside the hotel by a timeshare scam and gave them false names and room number to them to receive a call to our room the morning after!! There was no way they could of traced us unless the hotel gave our info out as they called our actual room waking us up but then addressed us as the fake name we gave, very strange! After this we were moved rooms into a ocean view room, great we thought apart from the smell of rotten eggs we had which by the second night from again the air con we had to say something. They put an air purifier in the room which was as much use as a chocolate fire guard so we had to be moved again. In fairness they upgraded us to a suite room but unfortunately it was right above reception and next to the main road which means that from 8am until 12 am beeping taxis going by keep you awake. When the locals have a ceremony you may as well go and take part as the mega phone screaming is so loud in your room sleep is not an option until at least 2 am. Breakfast is good a little slow at times with orders off the menu but generally very good. We eat at the lunch BBQ twice and had undercooked food two days running so didn't eat at the hotel again after that. You'll struggle to get a sunbed by the pool if the hotel is busy it's pool is small in comparison to the surrounding hotels. In summary there a hotels in a much better position with much better facilities and better food as that's where we eat every day and night just down the road. Like I said can not fault the lovely attentive staff but the hotel is not worth the money when the hotels on the same road are a far better standard with high standard restaurants and much better swimming areas in better. Not to mention away from the noise of the local ceremonies that take place until the early hours. Would be nice if the hotel informed you of the likely noise so you could plan around it just happened to be our last night and several early mornings! Try the legian, the oberoy, the W, double six hotel and others are far better standard and facilities and in some cases cheaper. I'm sorry to say I would not stay here again. There's a only so much you can forgive even when the staff are as nice as they are.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1407,Lovely break!,50,August 2017,"We recently enjoyed a five night stay at your resort during our 4 week tour of Indonesia! It was a welcome break and gave us time to put our feet up before moving on! The Hotel was 5-star indeed! All the staff were polite, courteous and charming. The suite and room service was excellent as were the beach staff. The food and particularly breakfast selection was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay . . . thank you!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1408,Nice hotel on the beach with great staff,40,March 2017,"We came to two other couple and stayed a week.
The location in relation to the beach was super.
The hotel was lovely and quiet, it was never overcrowded, noisy or too busy.
The service from the staff was great
It was a short walk to a busy bustling street filled with spas, restaurants and things to do which was great.
Be prepared to be hassled by taxi men on the main road though.
Breakfast here was nice, repetitive and slightly lacking in variety however the quality of food was great.
The rooms were spacious and lovely with stunning views.
Hotel taxis are pricey, we would always walk up just a few minutes to the main road and get a much cheaper offer outside.
Pool at the hotel is a real plus! Always clean and well maintained which we needed in the hot weather.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1409,Great stay,50,August 2017,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa has a prime location directly on the beach within a short walking distance to key shopping and dining outlets.
A wonderful hotel with fantastic staff, comfortable clean and spacious rooms.
Extensive choice for breakfast and a first class room service

A massage at the spa is well worth the visit

Would stay there again on our next visit to Bali",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1410,Great Facilities & Location,50,August 2017,"Very pleasant stay ! All staff were super friendly and catering to all needs. The facilities at the resort are fabulous, including the beautiful infinity pool! Would stay here again, but would upgrade to a room in the main building as opposed to the garden room. The location is great and a short walk to a tonne of restaurants/ cafes etc.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1411,Beachfront beauty,50,July 2017,Beautiful little resort in front of the ocean. Seafood options are plentiful. We thoroughly enjoyed the sunsets on the beach and the kids loved the pool. Helpful and polite staff at this hotel. Spacious rooms and good housekeeping staff.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1412,"Not the best, but good enough",40,August 2017,"Hotel is nice, rooms are big and well decorated. Close to all Seminyak's restaurants. Service is dedicated and fast. Restaurant lacks character but who cares with all the others available so close. There are more luxurious places in Bali but this is a very good option.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1413,Good hotel - late check in,40,July 2017,"The hotel grounds and service were quite nice. The rooms were clean, breakfast was good, and the hotel was right on the beach. However, upon checking in I was met with a 2 hour wait for my room to be ready. Note: I arrived after 2 hours the official check in time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1414,Disappointing,30,August 2017,This was our second visit to The Seminyak in 18 months and sadly not as enjoyable as the first. When we arrived we were told that because of the White Party at Ku de Ta next door we would be moved to another room for our last night. When on holiday my husband and I like to unpack and relax and not have to move rooms. We were not advised of this at the time of booking. We paid around A$750/night for our room which simply wasn't worth it even without the problem of the party next door. On arrival we asked if we could move to a room on the other side of the resort which would have been a downgrade but it is where we stayed the first time and we were told that we could move but no refund would be offered for the difference between the 2 rooms. Overall our stay was disappointing and for the amount we paid the room was not worth the money and in need of refurbish. Other resorts nearby which we have stayed at offer beautiful rooms for the same money.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1415,Relaxing beachside luxury,50,August 2017,Attention to detail and warm hospitality is what will draw us back to this place. Its location and beachside access is a drawcard. We were spoilt by the range of food at breakfast and the free high tea in the afternoons.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1416,A tasteful and moderately exclusive resort,50,August 2017,"This resort is fantastic. Not too big, it deserves a certain level of exclusivity and personalized hospitality in an environment tasteful and stylish. The rooms on the main building rounding a beautiful tropical garden open to the beach are wide and so fine, with elements of ethnic modern design, parquet floor, a shining and large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. Concerning the rooms it is important to outline that there are similar rooms on an annex building, that cost less but whose location is absolutely less inviting, because you have to cross a street with usual traffic. So it is a must to try to book the rooms inside the structure wanting to perceive the outstanding experience of staying in this resort.
All other features and amenities of this structure are at a very high level. A beautiful SPA is available, and a long infinity pool directly dominating the waves of Seminyak beach is a dream. There is not a private beach but really to stay in the swimming pool is better than having sun beds directly on the public beach in front. The breakfast, really delicious and tasteful, is offered in the main open air restaurant while in an inviting restaurant open to the beach you can have a dinner under the stars with a fantastic ocean view.
In general the service level is very accurate and you feel not to be a number like in many big resorts.
The location, very quiet and relaxed but in the same time in the middle of the very trendy and pleasant Seminyak is perfect and considering also the quality price ratio you should not find easily elsewhere a similar pleasure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1417,Absolute bliss in Bali,50,May 2017,"Months later and I dream of our stay at The Seminyak almost every day - we had eight days of absolute luxury in the most beautiful, calm, peaceful resort. I loved our hotel room (amazing bed and shower), the daily fresh local fruit, the beautiful kind Balinese people who work there, the service, the incredible pools and cabanas. AND daily drinks at sunset by the ocean.

You can't beat this place for location - on the beach perfectly positioned between Potato Head and Ku De Ta (a short walk in either direction) as well as close to Seminyak Square and all the vibrant cafes and shops (go to Sea Circus for breakfast!).

My favourite thing was the daily morning yoga sessions on the lawn. On our last day I was lucky enough to be the only attendee, essentially getting a one-on-one yoga session where I was given personal attention and able to tailor the class and try more advanced moves where the instructor could assist me. It was an honour.

I can't wait to come back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1418,Must go!,50,June 2017,This property is beautiful - pristine - staff are friendly. We had a suite that was approx. 600 sq ft. - one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. Great location re: beach and city life. Highly recommend.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1419,Great place for couples,50,August 2017,"Wonderful service, beautiful property with well manicured gardens, excellent food selection (buffet breakfast). They were happy to cater for gluten free as well. The staff were so friendly, we had a great time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1420,Luxury that you pay for,50,August 2017,"We decided to end our trip on a high and couldn't have picked a better place! We fortunately had a garden room which opens out to obviously the garden but leads directly onto beach front pool and restaurant!

In the heart of Seminyak right next door to Ku De Ta, it ticks all the boxes! Just be aware that it's normal prices. After travelling the rest of Bali enjoying the cheapness of it all that was the only downfall.

Such a great way to end our holiday.

One tip - don't pay for the hotels transport to the airport - get a blue taxi (metred) it is 1/3 of the price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1421,Stunning resort.,50,August 2017,Great location. Incredible pool. Great staff and security. Nothing to fault. I will certainly be back and will not hesitate to recommend. Breakfast was fantastic with both menus available to select from.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1426,wonderful stay spoilt by a few annoying things,30,August 2017,"The grounds including the beach front pools and eating areas are beautiful and the rooms are spacious and clean, however, the service and maintenance of the rooms should be improved especially considering the price of the rooms. They include:
1. When the cleaners clean the room they leave the room door open on the latch and the cleaners bang the door against the latch as they go through them. The outcome of this means that during the day forget about having a sleep as there is a constant banging.
2. The shower pressure is minimal which means you have to be in the shower for a long time to remove any shampoo and as the shower drain doesn't work very well by the time you get out of the shower you are standing in a couple of inches of water.
3. The rooms are not very soundproofed. The piped music in the hallway is quite loud and provides a Bali feel but the music should be turned off on the evening. I had to ask for the music to be turned off one night around 10pm as it was inhibiting my sleep.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1427,Bali vacation,50,August 2017,"The drive to the resort from DPS took about 45 minutes and we were not disappointed when we arrived. The property is beautifully maintained, our room with a king sized bed was spacious and luxurious. The infinity pool is the main reason we picked this resort as that is where I spent most of my time sunbathing. My husband rented a surfboard steps away from the pool. Poolside service and service in general was fantastic. Security was everywhere and very friendly. We would stay here again and again. Loved the restaurant/bar for sunset watching. Restaurants and shopping were a 10 minute walk or less.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1428,Great place to stay,50,August 2017,"Great place to stay in Seminyak. Fantastic sunset every night ..

+ large & clean rooms. Housekeeping 2x a day
+ delicious breakfast (√† la cart and buffet)
+ super friendly and helpful staff
+ fantastic sea & and sunset view from the pool
+ shops/restaurants/massage places etc. in walking distance

- bar/restaurant next to the sea/pool closes very early
- music from next door club (ku de ta) might be a bit loud (maybe check with the hotel the party calendar before you book)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1429,Excellent Service and an outstanding spot for a winter break,50,August 2017,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 9 days. Food was superb, service fantastic, spa was outstanding, pool areas on the edge of the beach unbelievable. The staff are amazing, very well trained and focused on delivering good service. Outstanding place for R & R. We will be back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1430,Fantastic in every way,50,August 2017,"Visited for a short break of 5 nights. We had 2 beach rooms for a family of 4 adults. Rooms were exceptionally clean and very well serviced. They have the most beautiful bar on an evening for a drink before going out, or after dinner. The staff are amazing and very professional. The spa, again is amazing. This resort isn't cheap and at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. Definitely recommend for a pampering break.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1431,Amazing!,50,August 2017,"Couldn't of asked for anything more. Was perfect in every way. In the heart of Seminyak, but yet peaceful and feeling a million miles away from it when at the resort.
Staff, food, rooms, pool ... everything was faultless.
I will be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1432,Infinity pool. Need I say more?,50,August 2017,"Top notch rooms, great service, friendly staff, awesome pool!!

My wife and I spent the last 5 days of our honey moon at this location and had an amazing time. There's lots of events organized and spending a lazy day at the infinity pool is definitely a great way to laze around (they even got a guy that'll randomly pop up and clean your sun glasses. Sweet!). Pro pool tip: try the burger, it's delicious!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1433,Good choice,40,July 2017,"I didn't have a very good first impression after being informed that I'd booked a room that wasn't even on site which is a bit ridiculous, so we paid extra for 5 nights in a beach view room. It ended up being really expensive in comparison to other 5* hotels we stayed at in Bali.

The positives however, are that the staff are so friendly, helpful and accommodating, it is one of the best hotels I've stayed in for customer service. From check in to departure we did not encounter one rude member of staff, there is always someone on hand to assist you, they are very attentive, and keep the very big hotel grounds looking pristine.

There were a couple of minor issues such as the bath plug constantly getting stuck and the sensor on the room stopped working a few times so we kept getting locked out, however maintenance arrived abruptly each time to take care of the problem.

The room itself was very spacious, clean and the amenities are lovely!! Room service was also very prompt, tasty and good value. All the little touches such as housekeeping leaving us chocolates were appreciated.

The location is okay, however it may have been nice to stay slightly norther along the beach where there are more beach bars, restaurants and nicer shops. The beach is very much a surfers beach so don't expect calm and tranquil! The infinity pool is lovely, and you get great views of the sunset!

The complementary afternoon tea was better than expected, lots of lovey sweet and savoury snacks. Again, the staff there were so nice, it really makes a difference to your experience. Balinese service is so much better than what we get in the UK!!

On the last day we decided to get breakfast, it was quite ridiculously expensive so I advise to book it in advance. The selection and quality was really great, however service was really slow (the place was pretty busy though).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1434,"Fantastic Honeymoon, Exceptional Staff!",50,June 2017,"We stayed at the here for our honeymoon for 10 nights (split into two, we stayed in a different part of Bali in-between) It was by far the BEST place we have ever stayed.

The staff are so very special - kind and welcoming, they really are a credit to this place. Set in stunning grounds, you really can't see a part of the hotel that looks bad or run down. It's all exceptional!!

For the first 5 nights we stayed in a Garden Villa which was beautiful! Then for the next 5 nights they kindly upgraded us to the Ocean Villa which has breathtaking views of the beach. We were so impressed by the attention to detail everywhere. The villas were peaceful, immaculately clean and very well equipped. The beds are also super comfy!!

We ordered food to the room on 2 occasions and the price/quality was fabulous.
We really enjoyed the breakfast and afternoon tea. Once again the quality was fantastic and the service of course seamless.

We really recommend you try the Balinese evening, it's a great way to try out local food!
I promise how ever long you stay will not feel like long enough!!! We're already desperate to return.

To the team and The Seminyak Beach Resort - thank you so much for your hospitality and making our honeymoon so special. Mr & Mrs Message",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1435,Holiday,50,July 2017,"Excellent Hotel, Great location and pristine resort. Friendly staff and outstanding service was given. Will highly recommend and will return if staying in Seminyak again :) They also noticed i stayed during my birthday and placed a birthday cake in my room which really went above expectations.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1436,Amazing Property with Amazing Staff!,50,July 2017,"One of the best resorts we've ever stayed at! We were greeted with great warmth upon arrival; very organized check in process and the cold drinks and towels were a nice touch. Great location just a few minutes walking distance from central market/shopping center & restaurants. Noticeable and effective security staff made us feel safe.

The rooms were fantastic (Beach Wing 2nd Floor)...very clean and first class amenities, and just a few steps from pool, beach, & restaurant. Great sound insulation from other rooms/floor.

Welcome reception for new guests was a nice touch...bartenders were great, met the front desk manager, and personally met and spoke with the GM, Michael. Great first impression.

Restaurants are fine (esp pool restaurant/bar) and the kids really enjoyed the afternoon tea service included in our package.

Infinity pool was fantastic, especially it's very close proximity and view of the beach/ocean.

Ok, so what really made this one of the best resorts in addition to the location, amenities, accommodations, and landscape...it was the entire resort staff!!! The responsive service, friendliness, and professional commitment of this staff were OUTSTANDING and really made a tremendous difference in our positive experience at this resort. EVERYONE (security, doorman, lobby/reception, spa, pool service, bar, room service, restaurant waiters/waitresses, & management) was so sincerely nice to me and my family and always made an effort to assist and provide us 1st class service each and every time. Even the GM checked-in on us a few times during our stay to see how we were doing. I wish I can mention and thank every staff member's name here...but it's just too many, they're all so fantastic!

THANK YOU to the amazing team and the professionalism of the management staff. I highly recommend this hotel (esp for families). We will definitely come back to this resort. You have a great team, Michael (GM)!

1437,Beautiful hotel,50,August 2017,"I stayed here with my husband. I was slightly disappointed that our accommodation was across the road. However the accommodation was lovely and we had a pool, bar, in lovely surroundings. The pool at the main hotel overlooks the ocean and is stunning. Service was great and staff were friendly and helpful. We only had bed and breakfast but the breakfast was amazing. So much choice of buffet style food. Also you can order from the menu pancakes, waffles, omelette etc. I would love to return to this hotel one day",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1438,"Great pool, central location",40,July 2017,Beautiful facility and amazing pool. Great location short walk from restaurants/bars and right next door to Ku De Ta - great spot to watch sunsets. Stayed in Garden Wing just across from the main hotel. Friendly staff.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1439,Very disappointing,20,July 2017,"Hotel is conveniently situated to walk into town and has a lovely pool and view of the beach. Totally let down by service. We paid extra to be in the beachside for four nights and found service to be poor both at the pool side restaurant (examples include drinks arriving after we had finished our meal despite repeated requests, room not serviced until very late afternoon etc. very disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Worst thing was the Bikini party on Sunday night in adjoining property. The noise started at 12.30 and did not finish until midnight! When we complained we were offered ear plugs! Absolutely not good enough when the room was positively shaking from noise level! Hotel should advise you before you book of this disruption so you can choose in advance whether to pay for an expensive room or stay elsewhere. Overall nice location but a big disappointment",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1440,Excellent,50,July 2017,"The villa is very good, the staffs are very helpful. The location is very strategic to some local shops, you can find everything you need in just 15 minutes walking from hotel. You can ask the staffs if you need a transportation (taxi or a rent car). It is very good, trust me!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1441,Great hotel in prime location,50,July 2017,"We had a wonderful stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa! The staff is incredibly nice, the rooms were beautiful, and the location is amazing. It's a 2 minute walk into town with a bunch of restaurants and shops all right there. The pool and beach are also gorgeous. Very clean and nice! Would highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1442,Great mid size resort - infinity pool overlooking beach and ocean,50,July 2017,Great quiet room away from the street in the 'Garden' wing - across the road from the main hotel. Daily High Tea - included in the daily rate was a bonus. Staff very friendly and always smiling and helpful. We shall stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1443,Fabulous Resort,50,July 2017,"This is a beautiful beach resort with all one could want. We were upgraded to a large suite room which was huge with a beachfront terrace overlooking the ocean. The infinity pool is large and beautiful and there are other smaller pool areas. Staff is attentive and helpful but not intrusive. The pool snackbar food is great. The grounds are gorgeous and scenic. The room we had was fabulous with a large jacuzzi in the bathroom by a window looking out on the ocean and the bathroom itself was large and long. The breakfast buffet is great and one can many items separately from western breakfasts to Indonesian dishes as part of the included breakfast. It is a romantic setting with many romantic vistas which can be reserved such as a private candle-adorned platform by the ocean for dinner.
Any shortcomings are minor. The Gym is nice but only has one elliptical machine. The in-room Jacuzzi takes nearly an hour to fill up with water as the water is slow.Spa treatments are great but expensive, even by American standards. In town treatments can be found at a 90% discount from these prices. Also the restaurant is quite good but also expensive and better Indonesian food can be found at 80% lower prices in town.
On balance, I would be delighted to return to this resort and recommend it highly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1444,great resort. But the rooms across the road are not worth it.,50,July 2017,Great Resort Great location Great Pool on the Beach. Very disappointed in the room which was across the street fro the main complex. Too far away from the beach and the rest of the complex. It should not be sold as part of the main hotel. $300+ per night far too expensive for where these rooms are located. .,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1445,Great resort,50,July 2017,"Seminyak is a beautiful resort. Customer service is terrific, restaurants are lovely and the pool and suuroundings are gorgeous. We enjoyed our honeymoon stay there. The beach was incredibly wavy and rough during our stay which was the only negative we can think of and obviously out of the hotels control.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1446,Confusing,20,July 2017,This hotel doesn't tell you there are two different areas. There is a beach front area and also an area across the road a short away away. As we arrived we were unhappy that we were driven over the road in an adjacent hotel. On the website it should state there are two different accommodations.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1447,Beautiful Five Star Beach Resort with feel of traditional Bali,50,July 2017,"Beautiful Five Star Beach Resort with feel of traditional Bali Architecture and Culture. We stayed for 4 nights with them in ocean view deluxe room and they pampered us with their excellent service. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast menu was wonderful with lots of traditional Bali food to try out!

I would not recommend their Garden View Rooms as the building is completely separate from the main resort building. Initially we booked this room but after reaching we upgraded to main building. Garden view room is situated one road behind the resort although they have buggy service to take you to main building 24/7.

Ms. Ayu at reception was very helpful. We liked the music they played at their breakfast venue and Ms. Ayu was very prompt to arrange a free copy of the CD for us.

We also stayed at Sheraton Kuta for 2 nights in Kuta but Seminyak resort was better if you want to enjoy a peaceful beach with big infinite pool! I will highly recommend for families and couples :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The room was large, airey with the most fabulous bathroom ever.
We enjoyed the restaurants, lunch by the pool, breakfast and dinner on the beach. Great food, fabulous staff.
I can recommend the couples massage in the hotel spa. A highlight of our trip.
Would definitely stay here again.
Our room was across the road from the main resort in the annex, as a result we had a quiet room and were generally the only people using the pool there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

It was only about a 10 min amble to Seminyak Square. Turn left or right from outside the resort and there are numerous shops, bars and places to eat. What stood out for us were the complimentary extras, sweet treats left in our room every night, sangria shots at the infinity pool once a day, tropical fruits in our room and daily afternoon tea with delicious cakes. We are definitely coming back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

the breakfast was very good and free afternoon tea everyday.
qualty of food excellent.
location was perfect.on the beach next to Ku De Ta a beach side club.
lots of amazing restaurants walking distance of five ten minutes,
they come and make your bed in the evening too,
will definately stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1452,Lovely Rooms and Resort,40,July 2017,"We stayed for ten nights in July and had a truly restful experience. The room we had was in the main beach part of the hotel, on the second floor with wonderful views over the gardens and beach. The bath tub, which took a long time to fill, also had a huge window which opened up to allow in the sound of the waves and the fresh sea air. The room was very spacious for the three of us and the cleaning standards impeccable, nothing was too much trouble. In fact all the staff were very friendly and welcoming and whenever we asked for any assistance, nothing was too much trouble.

Breakfast was plentiful, although annoyingly there was never enough glasses for water and juice! It was a combination of buffet and a la carte and plenty of fresh fruit for the healthy conscious and pastries to treat yourself. As with any hotel there are busy times for breakfast but we never waited more than a few minutes for a table. We ate a couple of time in the main restaurant and in the Sanje restaurant on the beach. On each occasion the food was plentiful, fresh and very tasty. The one downside was the inflated price compared to the plentiful choice of great restaurants a short walk away. I am aware that this is common practice for hotels to charge a premium, but not sure the experience was sufficient on this occasion to warrant paying the extra. The pool was great and the infinity pool on the beach a real treat. There was some construction on the beach side of the pool which became a little annoying, so most days we chose to sit on the beds in the Sanje, which had the perfect view of the beach and the world passing by.

My only gripe was in the in room coffee! At the risk of sounding pretentious, the offer was seriously lacking. On an island where coffee is grown and the quality and choice of coffee ranges from boutique bath roasted brews to Starbucks, being offered sachets of freeze dried Nescafe as my in room coffee option, in a hotel where quality was clearly a priority, was something of an embarrassment. We solved the issued by buying some ground coffee and requesting a French press, but would really expect the hotel to offer a similar solution. Aware that cost will be the factor here, but an extra few rupiah investment on a French Press for each room and a mason jar of some fresh ground coffee would make all the difference.

I would definitely recommend staying here, the location is perfect for the beach and exploring the boutiques and restaurants of Seminyak without needed an taxi.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1453,A Truly Luxury Balinese Resort,50,July 2017,"The Seminyak Resort & Spa is a truly luxury balinese resort. we can feel the atmosphere since arrive at gate. The hospitality from security is pretty good, they make us feel safe and friendly. Everyone staff was fabulous, call us by name, smiling face, warm and very helpful.

The Seminyak Resort & Spa located at Seminyak area which great spot tourism in Bali. More completely with pool facing the beach and private beach. Wonderful

Every Tuesday and Thursday, they have buffet dinner. Fisherman for seafood dinner buffet on Tuesday and Balinese dinner buffet on Thursday. Lucky me, i have been join dinner on Tuesday. Many variety of fresh seafood from the sea (lobster, shrimps, crabs, fish, squid, etc) with variety spices options. It was delicious and cooked well by chef team. Very recommended!

The rooms are very well appointed with all the amenities you would expect from a resort such as this. The gardens are immaculately kept and the resort backs right onto the ocean. I can highly recommend the Balanese dinner nights. The food was delicious and we were treated to some traditional Legong music and dance. I would also recommend heading to the beach bar for sunset followed by the happy hour cocktails.

1468,"The Best Holiday, Best Hotel in Seminyak",50,June 2017,"This was by far the best hotel I've stayed in. There wasn't one thing I could have faulted.
The staff were friendly and every evening we had a knock on our door with cookies, cakes, chocolates and other surprises. Upon arrival we freshly squeezed juice in the lobby,, once we entered the bedroom we had rose petals in our bath. We upgraded the last night to a suite room with a Jacuzzi that over looked the sea!! I was blown away.... it felt like i was in a dream... Were going back next year and have recommended all our friends to stay.

The hotel is right by the best restaurants and places to see..... You cannot hear anything from the hotel either.. Its just perfection",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1469,Best resort in the world!,50,July 2017,"We stayed two nights in July in the Beach view Villa. The views are breathtaking, the rooms are amazing and the staff was unbelievably helpful and kind. This is the nicest resort we have ever stayed at and will be looking all over the world to find its equal. The beach is nicer than Jimbaran, the resort has restaurants and shops nearby as well.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1470,Beautiful Beachfront Resort!,50,July 2017,This property is absolutely stunning with an oceanfront view. Most comfortable bed during our honeymoon! We stayed in the Garden annex which had its own fantastic swim-up pool bar and the main building has the most stunning pool overlooking the ocean. The breakfast was also the best of any hotel during our trip!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1471,Beautiful,50,July 2017,This is the second time we have stayed at The Seminyak Beach and Spa resort and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent as were the accommodations. The ground and the poo were beautiful. I differently return.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1472,Thank you for your help!,50,July 2017,"The seminyak beach resort and spa is a very good place. That's because there are very caring and nice staff.
I remember the man whose name is ""GEDE""
I appreciate his help who helped me to get my money back which was stollen by a money exchanger on Seminyak road.
I felt blue and I didn't know what to do when I got ripped off.
I had a drink at the bar of the resort and I talked to the staff ""GEDE"" about my story. He said he would help me to get my money back.
Without their help, maybe it would be bad to to stay in Bali and I couldn't enjoy my hollydays.
Anyway I really want to say thank you for your help again and helping me to making a great memory!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1473,Room not ready in time,30,July 2017,"Arrived at around 2:30pm, check in was at 2 and our room was not ready. We were informed that it might be ready by 3pm (an hour after it should have been). We were staying at the other resort about a minute walk from the main resort (I was unaware there were a second part to the resort). Since our room wasn't ready, even though we arrived after check in, we were sent to get tea and sandwiches in the main resort. Unfortunately tea and sandwiches were not being served until 3pm... I'm unsure why the receptionist sent us there, so we went back and waited for our room to be cleaned. Finally, our room was ready and nobody to help with our luggage (and there wasn't an elevator). It was a beautiful room. We ordered drinks near the pool and service was good. We also ordered room service and it was fine. Check out was fine despite nobody helping with our luggage. Overall, the hotel is nice, good location, clean room; however, very disappointed at check in, sort of ruined the initial experience. We were expecting something better for the cost, past reviews, etc.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1474,Fantastic,50,July 2017,Very friendly staff and a relaxing venue to stay at. breakfast had plenty on offer and coffee is particularly high standard. security is around to make you feel safe but not intrusive. My wife's birthday today and without prompting the staff sang happy birthday to her at breakfast and presented her with a delicious chocolate cake. Had a wonderful massage and this is the place to stay in Seminyak,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1475,Bali Traditional Style,50,July 2017,"My wife and I have been to Bali many times and we are currently midway through our stay. The hotel is wonderful, truly 5 star but at the same time has a more tradition Bali feel than many of the recently built contemporary hotels. The gardens, the restaurants, the infinity pool and the rooms immediately set you in a mood for a relaxing holiday. Breakfast is tasty with lots of choices and the staff are helpful with no request to hard.
The location is fabulous, close to all the host of activities that Seminyak offers.
We are staying in an ocean side suite and the room is perfect with a large bathroom, lots of living area and a wonderful ocean view from our balcony.
If you are thinking about staying in Seminyak this hotel is a great choice.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1476,The Seminyak resort and spa Sanctuary,50,June 2017,"What a wonderful surprise to find this beautiful property with its beautiful grounds, wonderful staff especially around the infinity pool - they even had a staff member walking around to clean our sunglasses!! We'll be back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1478,Just amazing,50,June 2017,"We stayed for 2 nights end of June and we truly enjoyed our stayed at this hotel. The beach wing rooms are great, and the pool side is just perfect, with the view on the ocean. Breakfast is really good as well. The only downside is that the service can be a bit slow, at the pool but also in the rooms, and the breakfast area, not so big, can be quite crowded in the morning (but still quiet - that's the good thing...).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1479,My favourite place in Bali to stay,50,June 2017,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is my favourite place to stay in Bali. Great location, great rooms & the best service in Bali.

1480,Amazing holiday,50,June 2017,This is an amazing hotel with brilliant helpful staff. The location was also perfect with only a 5 minute walk to shops and restaurants. Would highly recommend. Thank you for making our holiday so special.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1481,Pleasurable and safe,50,June 2017,"On honeymoon for three weeks in Bali and finished off with a week in semniyak, the staff are very sincere and helpful, the spa is a must great for couples as only one shower to wash each other off. The security is top notch and the hotel was very clean rooms were nice and also cleaned very well.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1483,Not at all what we expected...,20,June 2017,"It is with sadness I am writing this as we did so much research before coming to Seminyak, and thought we'd chosen a great hotel. To simplify here are the small amount of pros and cons..

CONS-

CHECK-IN
- We arrived at 2pm (ready for a 2pm check in) to be told our room is not ready and we have to wait 20mins, 40mins later we are still sat waiting for our room which we eventually didn't get into until 3pm...no apology and it wasn't until we asked what was going on we were offered an air condition room with water to wait.

THE ROOM:
- To our surprise we were upgraded which was nice, but it was not a 'treat' at all. Firstly our jacuzzi didn't work (not being big complainers and grateful for the upgrade we just left it). From the suites you can also hear the road quite clearly which wasn't ideal...

THE FRIDGE EXPLOSION:
- We stayed in the room the first night after a busy day of travel to be awoken by a huge bang and the smell of smoke, the hotel had a wedding on that night so we assumed it was the fireworks from earlier that evening. We started to drift off only to hear another two huge bangs. My husband looked around the room only to open the cabinet the fridge was stored in, to see sparks coming from the plug and smoke pouring out into our room. We called reception who just got an engineer to swap it, no apology again, only to be asked 'did you get it wet'...almost felt as if it was blamed on us, when if we hadn't have called it could have set alight... another wasted few hours on day one.

PAINT FUMES:
Day two, we then return to our room to the most overwhelming smell of paint/glue pumping from the air con. We go down to complain at reception who say they painting the gloss work in the room next door (it gave us both headaches within 10mins). They said the work has now been done so we will go and refresh the room whilst you're at dinner.
When we return the fumes are still so strong (if not worse). We asked reception to be moved rooms, after being rather polite we are now getting rather annoyed with the lack of compassion. We were told to go and have a drink (in the most expensive lounge they have at the hotel) while they get our new room ready- which we did, and then we were asked to pay for them which was odd.
After two days of issues we get into our new room unpack... but also found out they put a new couple arriving into the paint fumed room.

JACUZZI WATER
All relaxed we then thought we'd have a jacuzzi (as we've now been moved to a room which works) we pushed the button for bubble to get a huge amount of brown 'gunk' come from the jets with the worse smell of egg, we jumped out. Sounds dramatic, but It was like the smell of a stink bomb. Done with complaining and not getting great service we have just left it.

There have been other small things that haven't been great, people bed saving by the pool in the morning, slow service of ordered food at breakfast, and some grumpy staff. They also had a Tsunami over a year ago, but it seems that other than a screen to hide it, they haven't done much to fix it, making the hotel not look great from the beach side, and restrict access to the beach.

PROS:
-The hotel settings and gardens are beautiful not to mention the look of the rooms.
-The pool service is also great and the team cannot be faulted.
-Great location to the main town and restaurants
-Friendly and approachable staff

Hopefully we've just had bad luck other's have a better experience...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1484,Day Pass for pool/sun lounger use,50,May 2017,"We were staying in the area and wanted to experience a relaxing day poolside at a nice resort and The Seminyak offered a day pass for outside guests on a first come basis and based on the hotel guest occupancy for the day. We arrived on a weekday, so not sure if the weekend would be available. The total cost in USD for two was $55.01. I believe this was 375Kpp idr and this amount paid was a credit for use towards food and beverage. We felt it was a reasonable amount to pay and the grounds were just lovely. The food and drinks were excellent and all staff were very attentive and accommodating. We definitely enjoyed our day here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1485,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!,50,June 2017,Friendliest people I have ever come across. The resort was spotless. The food was scrumptious. They made you feel special. Would come back again and stay in a beach front room next time. Can't find anything to fault them even if tried,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1486,Excellent location,40,June 2017,"We stay because of the location & beautiful gardens overall quite good. Lots of maintenance work happening certain area's inaccessible, same last November. Big changeover of staff all appeared very young. Seemed slightly dirty. Mattress's could do with an update. Food acceptable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1487,A 5 Star plus experience,50,June 2017,"Only had a 5 day stopover at this hotel but I could not fault any aspect of it at all. From the moment you step out of the car you are met with a warm welcome by the bellboys where one whisks your cases away and the other takes you through to reception to register with one of the elegantly presented lady receptionists. Once a again you are greeted professionally with a floral garland, a cool towel and a welcome drink. You are seated down with the receptionist who goes through all the relevant details which was very painless.
You are then shown to your room, where your cases have already beaten you to it, along with a presentation of all aspects of the room.
Wherever you go in this hotel every member of the staff acknowledge and speak to you even if its the gardener or maintenance personnel.
English is widely and well spoken by all staff.
The infinity pool is one of the longest I have ever seen and is kept immaculate. The staff too are always on hand to lay the towels out for you on the sun loungers and are frequently available to order drinks or snacks.
the hotels' location is within 10 minutes walk of all the usual local facilities including bars and restaurants. The hotel itself also offers fine dining along with and excellent breakfast and afternoon tea.
I would have no problem recommending this hotel to any traveler to Bali and would certainly be happy to stay there again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1488,Brilliant hotel,50,June 2017,"Absolutely amazing hotel, right on the beach front. The room was large and cleaned twice a day, and the staff couldn't do enough for us. Location is just a 5 minute walk from lots of nice restaurants and 10 minutes up or down the beach to the famous beach clubs.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1489,Beautiful Honeymoon Resort!,50,July 2016,"I stayed here in December 2014/January 2015 for my honeymoon. Even though we stayed for four days, we felt that the time we spent there was not nearly enough! Every detail was taken care of perfectly from check-in to check-out, and we could not have asked for more!

We were upgraded to a Junior Suite with a private Jacuzzi. The room was beautiful and spacious, and had every amenity you would want with a complimentary treat on our table every night as we came back to our room. The service was excellent at all times and everyone was always polite and friendly.

The hotel grounds are beautiful and spacious! They also have a really large pool that falls off spectacularly as an infinity pool at one end. We also got to use the cabanas that were not charged at the time. It was also fairly quiet at the time so we got to experience a quiet romantic time together. The buffet area was fantastic, wonderfully done with excellent food choices and tons of fresh fruit everyday.

The location is great as well, with the very well known Ku De Ta next door, and some nice local food choices around the hotel.

I would definitely come back here on my next visit to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1490,Faultless,50,June 2017,"I cannot find any criticism at all about this hotel. Wonderful staff, beautiful gardens, fantastic setting.
Freshly cooked breakfast if desired with buffet with great choice and complimentary afternoon tea.
Lovely rooms, very clean and well maintained extremely comfortable beds.
Well located for shops, bars, restaurants etc...
Fantastic holiday awaits!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1491,I was sorry to leave and would definitely return,50,June 2017,"My partner and I had the most wonderful stay here with friends. We were very happy with our room in the garden wing which is across the road from the main building - and enjoyed the private pool there, which was hardly ever occupied. The breakfast buffet was huge and very tasty, and we liked that you could request your eggs to be cooked a certain way. The infinity pool is divine! It's big enough to accommodate a large number of guests - there was some repair work going on in front of it during our stay which meant the view was slightly obscured on one side with dividers, but that didn't bother us. The service from all the staff was amazing. The only thing we wondered was why we only received sweets during the turn down service 2 nights out of our 7 - although we didn't really need the calories anyway. Overall, a beautiful resort to stay at - you can also access the beach from the grounds and it is within close walking distance to many shops/restaurants in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1492,Brilliant place to chill,50,June 2017,"Currently still here on a girls week. What a beautiful resort with amazingly friendly staff, always smiling and nothing was too much trouble.
Situated next to ku de ta restaurant and bar, and walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. Lovely beach out front of resort with great swimming or surf.
Rooms are well appointed and quite spacious with lovely toiletries provided. Great wi fi throughout the resort also.
We have a ground floor room beach side which is fantastic, close to pool, beach, restaurant and looks out onto beautiful manicured gardens from a lovely outdoor area.
Great pools and also pool bar, plenty of deck chairs.
Lovely food at the restaurants, breakfast fantastic with a huge array to choose from. Afternoon tea provided free of charge as well.
Great service around the pool with free samples of food and sangrias thru the day. Cold towels, sunglasses cleaned... no cost just lovely smiles.
I have travelled extensively, and & all I can say is, beautiful resort that I would recommend to family and friends in a heartbeat.
The only thing I would mention is that there is an annex to the resort next door or across the road not sure which but it has rooms and a pool... cheaper rate but not the atmosphere.. can use the main resort pools etc so just know which part of the resort you are booking",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1493,5 Star Bliss,50,June 2017,"We had the most wonderful 2 nights here, Complimentry room upgrade and the most fantastic hospitality. 5 star facilities and amazing food. Thank you Seminyak for making us feel so very spoilt . We will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1494,Amazing service,50,June 2017,"We have just ended an amazing five days at The Seminyak.

The resort is beautiful and luxurious. Very lovely. The location is perfect - just a short walk from the main centre of town but far enough away to allow you some peace and quiet.

Food was varied and extremely tasty!

The staff were beyond compare. Absolutely fabulous. Especially the wonderful Irwan. Your help and service throughout the stay was amazing !! Seminyak - you are very lucky to have him.

Thanks for a great stay! X",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1495,"Nice property, Quite, Great Infinity Pool",50,June 2017,"This was a very nice resort. I had a beach front room, and it was very spacious and very well equipped with many toiletries and daily coffee and tea. The breakfast included with the room was also a wonderfully lavish buffet with many different cuisine options. Of course the highlight of the resort is the infinity pool that is right against the beach. I was a solo traveler and many of the guest were couples but it was not uncomfortable. The property was quite at night and the staff was always helpful and friendly. I would come back for sure, I felt the value of my money was well met. I used the spa services and they were excellent as well, the spa is very luxurious. There was a small miscommunication about a taxi service to the airport at the end of my stay but other than that I can not think of one complaint. I highly recommend trying some of the local Balinese cuisine in the on sight restaurant, it was one of the best meals I had there!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1496,Great spot in Seminyak,50,June 2017,"Fantastic hotel right on the beach in Seminyak, and so close to everything, seminyak square, all the best restaurants ,great beach, mini mart across the road and you can watch all the surfing action from your sunbed by the infinity pool. We loved our stay and would definitely stay again. We were upgraded to a suite with an amazing beach view a fantastic room. The only one negative for us was the food at the resort was only average and could do with improvement and as such the restaurants and bars were not that busy and lacked atmosphere . It is a fantastic hotel in a great area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1497,Five days at paradise,50,June 2017,Extremely polite and friendly staff. Fabulous food. The best Pina Colades. Very very clean. Beautiful pools.Spotless grounds. Mixture of European and Indonesian food for breakfast.. The beer was cold!!!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1498,"Luxury Hotel, Fantastic service and great location.",50,June 2017,"What a great hotel, From check in to departure everything 1st class. This is and absolutely immaculate hotel in every aspect. We booked an ocean view suite and where delighted with the nightly sunsets we had the pleasure of viewing. Rooms cleaned daily with an evening turn down service, all areas of the hotel absolutely spotless, breakfast had amazing choices and was part buffet and part a la cart so you could have freshly cooked if you wanted. The pool and the food served at it where one of the highlights. The staff are amazing, friendly, polite and nothing seemed too much trouble and to be honest for a 5 star luxury hotel it was not over priced. Location again was perfect as it was on the beach but very very close to a massive choice of restaurants and bars. All in all one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we would just like to thank all the staff who treated us like royaly a big thank you and Om Swastiastu. Andrew & Richard.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1499,"Disapointing hotel, shouldn't be 5*",30,June 2017,"I would not recommend this place. We booked this hotel for the last 5 days of our honeymoon (we are in fact still here). Booked the more expensive ocean wing room to be closer to the sea and the pool, as we planned spending most of the time sunbathing in front of the lovely infinity pool we saw on the photos. We were very disapointed to see that the pool is absolutely crowded, sunbeds are situated 20 cm. apart and there is in fact not enough space for all the guests. Furthermore, there is some construction going on on both sides of the pool, which makes the space even smaller and restricts the view. The nice greenery between the pool and the ocean, that you see on the photos, is non existant and from the edge of the infinity pool you can see some terrible concrete with pieces of metal sticking out of it. Before this hotel we stayed at two other 5* luxury resorts in Bali (absolutely great ones, same price range), and we've been to such in other places of the world and this one is absolutely not worth the money, especially because of the sunbathing and pool area (as it is an important part of a beach resort) - crammed centimeters apart (if you find any place at all) is not in any way a luxurious experince, which this place claims to offer. The staff is nice, showed sympathy, at some point after noon when a couple of sunbeds became available they did call on us to move to the pool, but the space is simply not designed for as many guests as they have right now. We believe we should have been warned in advance for the construction around the pool (as I read from other guests' comments, it is a habit of this hotel not to warn its guests of things like these...which for me is unacceptable) and for the chance of the pool area being overcrowded - we would have deffinately chosen to spend our holiday at another place. Very, very disapointing - we can't get back those days from our honeymoon.

Other comments:

- Staff is nice
- Room is nice, pretty basic, but pleasent. First floor rooms get little sunlight, while lights from the garden at night are rather unpleasant when you would like to sleep. The airconditioning is noisy sometimes. Shower cabin could have been cleaner.
- Breakfast is alright

Overall, a very overrated hotel, you can find much much better places in this class in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1500,Bad experience made good,50,May 2017,"We had booked this holiday as a real trip to remember. We spent a lot of money going for the best. Best flights best location and best hotel. We waited and waited for the time to come,to jet off on our dream trip.

Business class flight was of execellent quality my Malaysia airlines, private transfer on arrival at the airport in Bali which only took approx. 30mins to get through all the baggage collection, immigration and customs and out where we met our representative.

He took us to our private transfer to the resort which at first was very harrowing as the locals don't tend to driv rather point and hope for the best. We arrived in one piece and were greeted by the security who were very courteous although not very thoughough. At this point the holiday turned south not for fault of the hotel but by my health. I had back ache nothing to bad but bad enough. The bags were taken To our private villa which had its own small pool lounging deck and shallow area to lay in during the heat of the day. The room was huge with all round sliding doors plenty of storage and a massive bathroom again with open air doors but cleverly closed in for privacy. You felt very secluded but also just a few feet from the pool bars and public pool and restaurants.

Gede our concierge come personal contact point showed us around the apartment and left us in piece.

At this point my back was aching worse and I pointed this out to my wife. We unpacked and relaxed taking a drink from the stocked mini bar. After showering and getting ready we walked into the local area called eat street where all the bars and restaurants were. I struggled to walk to far due to the back ache and I knew something wasn't right. This continued for two days to the point I couldn't leave the hotel room. I went for a massage in the resort and this did not relieve the pain.

We spoke with our travel representative and he contacted the hotel. Gede was at the door within a couple of minutes. Very concerned and was insistent at calling a doctor. Gede stayed with us the whole time making sure I was comfortable and bringing us drinks if needed. We felt that he was not concerned about any cost just our wellbeing. The doctor arrived and carried out a thoughough medical. In the end a pain killing injection and some tablets were prescribed. Gede was on hand all the time to translate or offer advice.

This course of treatment worked for the night and we went out again to eat street but wandered further along the stip. we had a great night and then returned to the hotel to find Gede still there enquiringl about our evening and my health. At this point I felt fine still some mild pain but bearable.

The next morning was a different story. I could not stand correctly and could not sit comfortably for more than 1minute at a time.

We managed breakfast but returned to the room where I decided to make a call to our insurance to see what they suggested. ""Complete waste of time"" we at this point suddenly felt very alone in a very foreign country. The day went by and we decided to try and go out for the evening. I barely made it to the nearest restaurant. We ate quickly and walked back with me in severe pain to the point where I thought I would pass out. This is now 3 days after our arrival. First thing in the morning out of desperation I contacted our insurance again and again found them to be absolutely useless they said they could do nothing until after the bank holiday in the uk to get my medical records from our GP to make sure that we were covered? I thought that was the point of taking out holiday travel cover. We again at this point spoke with Gede and our travel advisor and between them a doctor again was called. Again further injections and tablets. At this point I had now spent over ¬£1000 in tablets from pharmacies, doctors visits and prescriptions, one trip to the local hospital where further injections and tests were carried out.

I did not want to stay in hospital and leave my wife who is not a good traveller on her own so refused admission. Another call to the insurance who I had to relay the complete story too and beg them to do something even now all they said was we were on our own until after the bank holiday but we were to keep all receipts as if we were covered we could claim. They said to return to the hospital as if we were there on the door step they had a duty of care and had to treat us as we were a uk citizen and had very good relations with their government? Um what about my insurances duty of care.!!!!! At this point we truly were desperate Gede and his team were faultless we ate, rested and drank in our room at no expense all room service charges were wiped and every day either Gede or one of his team would constantly check in on us. Gede and his team were fantastic. 3 further days went by and on the fourth day our insurance called to say I was able to be admitted to hospital in Bali which Gede arranged and helped us with transport in the hotel car free of charge as the ambulance wanted to charge us as the insurance company would not cover it until I had been assessed.

Anyway long story short I was admitted to hospital with a herniated disc which required operating on I was medivacked to Bangkok for the operation and 28 days later I am now about to return to my home in the UK.

What I wanted to say is a huge thank you to Gede and his team from Seminyak resort and spa who took great care of my wife whilst I was in hospital, visited me and bought me items that I needed. Helped me to get my wife to the airport early to get her home as the trauma was getting to much for her on her own. Gede visited me in hospital arranged for hotel drivers to bring me what ever i needed either from the hotel or purchase. And was just a familiar face to bring me comfort through a very harrowing experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1501,Paradise Hotel,50,June 2017,"Wow. Simply WOW.

I don't know where to start. We stayed as part of our honeymoon in early June 2017 and had a beach facing room with balcony (I thoroughly recommend paying the extra to be on the beach wing).

The location is perfect, walking distance to the nicest bars and restaurants in Seminyak. Situated right on the beach front. After waking around Seminyak we were delighted with our location.

The inifinity pool creates a beautiful setting on the beach without getting sandy feet. The food is top quality and made with fresh ingredients, slightly over priced but worth not having to leave your sunbed to order!

Staff are extremely helpful and friendly and simply can't do enough for you. They create a family environment and just make u feel at home. Everywhere at the hotel was immaculate.

We were personally invited to a managers cocktail night on two occasions which was really nice (30mins free cocktails).

As a honeymoon hotel we simply couldn't have asked for anything more and would definitely stay here again.

1502,Lovely Stay,40,May 2017,Situated right on the beach with lovely gardens and spacious rooms this was a very good choice in Seminyak. Tasty breakfast with friendly staff. Included afternoon tea was a nice touch. Lovely pool areas overlooking the beach. A welcome respite from the bustle of Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1503,Beautiful Hotel,50,June 2017,My mum and I stayed here for a week. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The rooms very spacious and immaculate. Great location as you are very close to all the shops and restaurants nearby. The staff were very friendly and would go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I would highly recommend staying here and I will be coming back for sure.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1504,Quick stay,40,June 2017,"Quick stay on our way through Seminyak. lovely resort, right on the beach. The garden rooms are across the road from the main hotel and still comfortable and quiet. Sea view rooms are in the main part of the hotel. Decent breakfast. Nice pool area but the hotel is doing some work so they have some screens up, nothing too crazy but some areas near the pool are being worked on. Lastly the beaches from Seminyak up to Echo Beach are dirty, lots of rubbish, plastic and glass in the sand. The streams that flow into the sea are dirty and smelly. Bali needs to do more to clear up its pollution problem.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1505,Beautiful and relaxing stay - pure luxury,50,June 2017,"We had the best stay at Seminyak Beach Resort, from our welcome greeting with beautiful flower decorations (felt like we were in Hawaii) until check out.

We were lucky to get upgraded to Jacuzzi Suite :) Location is excellent close to shops and good restaurants and swimmingpool is stunning with the infinity pool and sun all day. Breakfast was delicious with wide arrangement both a la carte and buffet. I would recommend this hotel to everyone wants a bit extra of excellent service and luxury in Seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1506,5 stars!,50,June 2017,"My husband and I recently stayed in the ocean pool villa (number 2) and all we can say is wow!! The villa and private pool was so amazing. We had a lovely view of the ocean and could hear the waves crashing from our room. The breakfast was good and we liked that we could order the eggs (instead of waiting at an egg station). The resort was in a great location, but it was a bit of a walk to potato head.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1507,Beautiful and clean resort,50,June 2017,"My husband and I stayed here from June 5 to 8. The resort is beautiful and the all of the staffs are so friendly and polite. Our room was always clean. They make the room twice a day. The only complaint I have is the room is a bit dark. The pool area is picturesque with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. They offered complimentary breakfast with a wide variety of food. Loved all the fresh exotic fruits they have. Yoga is free and available every morning. Our instructor,Arleni, was friendly and good. This was what I enjoyed most. Also the hotel is close to all the restaurants and shops. Overall I highly recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Enjoyed sitting watching the sunset. The beach restaurant was a good place for breakfast. The staff were charming, courteous and attentive at all times.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1512,Fantastic experience,50,May 2017,"Everything about tne hotel and my experience was just perfect. Great location, fantastic helpful and polite staff, clean property with lots of amenities, on the beach, nice room, nice groundw. Just an overall great stay. The hotel is pricey but worth tne $150 per night i paid",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1513,Amazing Resort - Staff are second to none,50,May 2017,"Just spent another two weeks - fifth time - at this fantastic hotel. It is a truly tranquil place in the craziness of Seminyak has become during the last years. Nice and lovely decorated rooms, cleaned twice a day, with view at the wonderful garden and beach. A gorgeous infinity pool never seen so far where you can relax, hearing the waves and watching surfers during daytime and best place for stunning sunsets in the evening. Fabulous breakfast, snacks and drinks at the pool. Afternoon tea with delicious sweets is included.

What this hotel makes it so special: Staff is just amazing! Always smiling, super friendly and helpful. All of them do everything they can and treat you like a royalty. For our Wedding Anniversary we have been surprised as never before in our life!

So many thanks to the whole team of the Seminyak Beach Resort. It has become our second home. Even it is a long journey to go there, we cannot imagine to spend our holidays at another place. We are planning to come back soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1514,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service",50,June 2017,"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. They welcomed us with flowers and a drink, and drove us from the main building to the garden building that we stayed in. The staff was unfailingly polite, and answered our questions easily. They were attentive and responsive. The room itself was gorgeous - my wife and I are talking about remodeling our bedroom to look like it! The wood was exquisite, the bed was pleasantly soft, and the bathroom was top-notch.

We also ate the breakfast that they provided, and it was delicious. I'm used to American hotel and motel food, and so I was expecting tepid dishes. Instead, we got fresh fruit, freshly cooked Indonesian and European food, and delicious Balinese desserts.

My wife and I are looking forward to staying here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1515,Absolutely great,50,June 2017,My wife and I have just come back to Melbourne after having spent 9 of the best days staying here in Bali. The attention to detail and service from the people here is first class. We had a slight problem with our room ( broken toilet ) and were upgraded which was a treat. The Director Of Room Rachmah Pontoh looked after us for the rest of our break and we cannot wait to re-book our next visit as soon as we can.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1516,Truly tranquil,50,June 2017,"The seminyak hotel was truly amazing, we absolutely loved our stay here! We stayed in the beach room wing which was a gorgeous room, beautifully decorated with Balinese touches. Housekeeping did a fab job everyday, running us a lovely rose petal, bath salts bath and leaving treats at towel art on turn down. The infinity pool was gorgeous, but we spent a lot of our time on the other side where there were just a few sun loungers directly onlooking the beach or the beds which provided a nice bit of shade when you've had too much sun!

The seminyak staff are to be applauded they always went above and beyond to make your stay special. We had a lovely cake sent to our room for our anniversary, always stopped what they're doing to greet you and one day the maid may have misplaced the soap we bought with us but as soon as I told reception they replaced the exact same one straight away!

The spa was probably one of the best I've seen, really luxurious and high end.

Breakfast is good, not as good as other places we've stayed and the Sanje restaurant menu offering could be better considering it's a 5 star resort. It is pricey here but that's to be expected, there's so many restaurants/bars nearby in walking distance so there's plenty to choose from.

One of the elements that stood out to us was the complimentary daily afternoon tea which had a whole array of sweet treats and canap√©s to devour.

A 5 star experience, thank you seminyak, we will surely return again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1517,Lovely Hotel.,50,May 2017,"We have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Seminyak Beach Hotel & Spa. We loved the whole experience, spacious beach/garden room, facing the sea. Loved all the little extra toiletries, supplied in the bathroom, from shoe shine to moisturisers. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Food excellent, lots of variety for breakfast, the Sanje restaurant right on the beach is fab, pricey, but perfectly situated. My only gripe was the wine choice was lacking and a little overpriced. Overall we would definitely return to the Seminyak Beach Resort, thank you for making our stay a very memorable one.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1518,Great Service/ Great Food,50,June 2017,"Staying here six nights we were impressed by the great service, the very tasteful and nicely presented food and the overall perfect stay we had here. The whole staff is trying to make your stay a comemorable experience. The infinity pool is great sunbeds are always available. Just one question left: When will we have the time to come back ?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1519,Overdue Honeymoon,50,June 2017,"Beautiful scenery located directly on the beachfront. Stunning gardens and a great room.
Easy walking distance to great restaurants and pubs. The restaurant ""The Library"" does a 10/10 egg breakfast.
Highly recommend the Semiyak Beach resort. Hope to get there again one day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1520,6th year!,50,May 2017,"We are approaching the end of a wonderful month at this hotel which feels like our Bali home after 6 years running! The welcome we receive from all the staff here is just amazing and their smiling faces are a pleasure to see every day! We have watched this hotel evolve and improve year on year into what has become a very tranquil place in the craziness of Seminyak! It is hard to believe there is so much traffic outside the hotel as it provides such peace at the infinity pool on the beachside! The quality of service has much improved under new GM Michael and food is more varied under the watchful eye of Alex F&B manager.... there has obviously been many hours of training and time given to many improvements over the last year...
So many staff to thank!
Concierge team - all of whom are just fantastic ! Sulsama boys!
Reception team - delightful girls who just brighten up even a cloudy day with there cheerful helpful manner! Thanks so much to Heni and team - special favourites Lina and Dewi who are like old friends to us...
Kitchen team - suksama for the amazing breakfast buffet and fantastic breads and pastries on offer! I will miss the Nasi and Mie Goreng so much! Best in Bali!
Housekeeping Team- Geck and her amazing team with fantastic towel art creations for us each day and spotless attention to detail - our suite was just beautiful every day....
Poolside team - beautiful clean towels on our beds every day and always made sure our parasol gave us shade when we needed it!

Sanje staff and pool waiters - what great guys! Kardi, suparman, Dede, are big favourites but keysha, June, wayan, made, putu are all so attentive! Thank you all so much!
Mr Denney as always keeping the crew on their toes and working hard!!
We hope to see all you guys again soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1521,Wonderful Resort,50,May 2017,"This resort is small and friendly when compared to larger facilities. We found the service very personal and caring. The breakfast was amazing with a choice of ""a la carte"" dishes every morning. Enjoyed our stay immensely as it was so relaxing and all of our needs were catered for.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1522,Relaxing rest in style,50,May 2017,"If you look for a most comfortable relaxing holiday on the beautiful island of Bali in the vicinity of nice shopping and fancy restaurants this is the place to be : The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. This beautiful resort with magnificent garden and the most beautiful infinity pool we ever seen, where you can swim whilst enjoying the view and beating sound of the high waves on the sea challenged by adventurous surfers, is an oasis of rest zen, a most delightful exquisite breakfast with various asiatic kitchens, an abundance of fresh fruits, homemade bakery and pastry, various eggs like the famous delicious and wanted egg Benedict with Salmon etc etc evening cocktails and dinner accompanied with stunning sunsets and the most kind friendly helpful staff with genuine smile like Ami, Yasmin, Keysha, Souharto, but also the excellent competent management like Gede and Rachmah etc etc
Only praising words for this wonderful resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1523,Wonderful experience,50,May 2017,"We spend six nights and had a very nice time, had breakfast and afternoon tea included.
Shopping area near by very nice and stylish, very good restaurants.
Had the seafood buffet at the hotel one night it was very good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1524,The Seminyak exceeded all of our expectations...,50,May 2017,We absolutely loved staying at this resort. The food was amazing. The room was huge and very nice. We loved the local fruit that they brought to the room each night. It was perfect for us. The massive infinity pool overlooking the ocean was also very nice. We were treated like royalty and would highly recommend this resort.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1525,Spectacular !,50,May 2017,"Great resort, luxe, friendly staff and food at sanje is so delish!! Despite our room not being ready when we checked in, the staff rectified by offering us later check out. Staff was very apologetic and catered to our every need from there in in. We had the best time at Seminyak beach resort despite a bumpy start.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1526,"Great hotel, however be aware the hotel has 2 buildings.",40,May 2017,"Lovely hotel, but be aware that the garden rooms are in a seperate building across the street (we upgraded to stay in the beach rooms). While the garden rooms and beach rooms are the same standard, all the facilities are in the beach room building so if your staying in the garden rooms you have to walk across the street (2min walk) to get to the main building. The beach rooms were great, we staying on the ground floor room which allowed us to simply open the French windows and walk straight in to garden to the beach. The service there was execellent. The beach opposite the infinity pool is quiet however you are only ten minute walk on the beach away from the beach restaurants ( bean bags and all)if you want abit of activity. The infinity pool was big, alot bigger than what the picture showed on the website and the hotel provide afternoon tea between 3pm -6pm if you want to snack. The room was clean and nicely designed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1527,Lovely resort - good location,40,May 2017,"We had 7 perfect days at this resort located on the beach in Seminyak. Originally we had booked a "" garden room "" but we asked to be moved within the complex as garden rooms are 500 metres down and across the street with no view and you must come to the resort for your breakfast, which by the way is great üëç
The new room had a view of the water and worth the extra money if you are thinking of staying here. The rooms are large and beautifully appointed in either location.
The sun lounges are ready for you with your towel and ladies, you get cucumber slices and beautiful aloe vera infused cold towel for your eyes every morning ü§ó
The toilets near the infinity pool aren't operational at the moment as the hotel is having the steps and pool retaining wall redone and that was a bit of a nuisance as it was a walk to the nearest ones... they have been at this for over 3 weeks now and it doesn't seem that they will be finished soon... Bali time I guess. There is a small swim up bar pool area but we didn't use it.
I have few criticisms of this place except that the "" Chef's special "" at the restaurant on the water, was the same for the whole week we were there and according to a couple who stay there for a month each year, it had been the same for the previous weeks üò≥
The staff are excellent and very courteous.
If you want to move away from the madness of cheap shops and stalls, turn left at the gate, not right, and you will see another side of Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1528,Simply fabulous,50,May 2017,We spent 10 days at this hotel in an ocean view suite. Simply fabulous. Large room with all that you would expect. Fresh fruit and plenty of water delivered daily. Top floor ensures ocean views over the tree tops. Tea and coffee making facilities and small fridge. Balcony with table and 2 chairs. Superb pool right on the beach. We spent days lying by the pool watching surfers. Great location next to Ku De Ta and local shops and restaurants. Quality breakfast and complimentary 'high tea' each day at 3pm for delicious treats. Incredible staff and service the entire time. We are planning to return. Highly recommended!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1529,Birthday for our son,50,May 2017,"The Hotel staff was more than great, always willing to help going out of the way to assist you. Kind, sweet. Staff also excellent on honestly. We left over $100 in our pocket sent to launder,they contacted us that we left it. Rooms beautiful clean views are spectacular. Food really good. All around wonderful stay. Did i mention the spa? It was better, took care of me, everything clean professional service with the kindness from the heart.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1530,Amazing,50,May 2017,"The Seminyak is a beautiful hotel in a great location. From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly by the staff who quickly checked us in and took us to our rooms.

The hotel itself is extremely clean and modern. The bedrooms are large, and most importantly so are the bathrooms. They're well stocked too just in case you forget to bring anything along with you. The room service menu is extensive and 24 hours, which is perfect if you have a late flight arriving into Bali like we did!

The service here is impeccable. Rooms are cleaned twice a day and the staff are so quick with fulfilling any request you might have. They're always on hand to answer any questions you might have and make recommendations so you can make the most of your stay - from organising drivers, telling you which sights to go see, where to eat, how much you should be spending etc. They're always so polite and eager to ensure you're as comfortable as you can be, it really makes your holiday that much more enjoyable.

The breakfast buffet here is delicious. There's a wide variety of options - pancakes, toast, waffles, cereal, fresh fruit, fresh juice, pastries and asian breakfast options served with teas and coffees. Other amenities around the hotel include a money exchange but the rate isn't as good as going outside of the hotel as you'd expect, a luxury spa and gym.

The hotel itself is in a great location - you are near the spas, the markets, clubs, bars and restaurants so you can easily have a quiet nice or a big night depending on how you're feeling. The sights in Ubud are maximum an hour drive away and you have Sunset road and the airport just a half hour drive away.

Overall, it's the staff that make this hotel as good as it is and I'd go back in a heartbeat.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1531,Our favourite resort in Seminyak!,50,May 2017,"We absolutely loved staying at the Seminyak Beach resort.
The staff were so nice and treated each person like royalty, very quick to answer any questions or give recommendations! We received special treats each night on our pillows üòä and the rooms were very clean! Great facilities and delicious buffet breakfast, definitely recommend the breakfast inclusion!
The only con we had, was the prices of the food and drinks especially when the service tax was added- however this was everywhere in Bali.
We recommend this resort to anyone staying in Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1532,Good stay,40,May 2017,"The hotel is luxurious, well situated in Seminyak. The service is friendly but not exceptional or personalised. I found the staff a little bit commercial in marketing the spa services. Food on the pool was just average.There was work on the beach that was not anticipated. Cleaning on the pool during the day while the clients are seated was a little strange!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1533,Five star,50,May 2017,"We had the pleasure of staying 4 nights in a Garden Villa.

The moment we checked in it was 5 star service and treatment, with the GM also greeting us personally in the lobby and with a lovely handwritten note in the room.

All staff are extremely friendly and helpful and of course all knew our 8 months old name during our stay.

The villa is large and private and after seeing the location of the beachfront villas behind the main pool, our preference is for the more private garden villa.
The pool was perfect and even had shallow sitting area for our baby to splash. As the pool wraps around the villa, it probably wouldn't be suitable once our baby was crawling/ walking- but great for this time!

Bed and pillows very comfortable and the villa has a huge bathroom area, very well equipped. (We loved that the bathroom was air conditioned too- with the outside garden area behind glass doors- great for getting ready to go out and keeping cool!)
The doors to the bathroom are beautiful- but unfortunately just ornamental and don't block any sound out....

Breakfast was excellent, with made to order selection and buffet too, the restaurant is set amongst the beautiful grounds with people doing Yoga on the lawn most mornings.

We ordered a selection of Indonesian dishes on two occasions and they were outstanding.

The main pool is picturesque, and although there are some minor works going on at the stairs entry to the beach, it is managed and hidden well, and certainly doesn't affect enjoyment of the area.

We also had a pre-dinner drink in the bar/lounge and I had one of the best dirty martinis I've had!

Wish we had more time here- we were sad to leave.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1534,Excellent !!,50,May 2017,"The best part is the cooperative and friendly nature of all the hotel staff.
Food is good.
Room Service is fabulous.
Room cleaning was done regularly.
The view from the ocean suite room is good.
Totally recommended for a relaxing stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1535,The best hotel in seminyak we did,50,May 2017,"we went there for the 30th birthday at my bestfriend. They upgrade our room. Beautiful room. The infinity pool just on the beach it just amazing with such a nice view. The food is very good for a good price. The staff specially Soni at fb service department was very nice and so helpful, always smiling. Very professional and taking care all the time if we need it anything. I really recommend this hotel",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1536,Perfect place,50,May 2017,"We stayed there for our honeymoon. They thought for us every detail. Detailed-oriented, usable and luxury designed this hotel also have perfect staff. Breakfast is also good but it should have been faster for the tea serve and taking another request. You should decide for this hotel with no hesitation. Thank you for all.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1537,Best pool in Seminyak- beautiful hotel and grounds,50,May 2017,"Everything at this hotel was luxurious and beautiful. I fell in love from the second we pulled up to it, the reception was stunning and the hotel staff were all incredibly nice and friendly. When we got to our room we had a hand written note from the manager which I've never had before. It was so sweet and just added to the fantastic experience.
We stayed in the garden rooms, and I can't say it made our stay any less special. In fact, it was quite fun getting a buggy over to the main hotel! There is still a beautiful pool with swim up bar, but we spent all our time over at the other pool on the beach which is unreal! It's infinity edge was the best I've ever known. There was yet another pool as well, with a swim up bar and cute little bridges. We watched the sun set over the sea, it is worth sticking around for. At 3-5 there are drink deals, so although the drinks and food are quite pricey, you can have a few bintangs or cocktails for a better price at this time. We spent ¬£120 between two of us over the 3 afternoons we spent at the pool, and it was completely worth it just because of the setting.
The grounds of the hotel itself is very well kept, and the restaurant is beautiful. We went and had tea and cakes every day there from 3, which was free for all guests.
We didn't bother with breakfast as there are so many places around we could go. If you are trying to save money, get a room in the garden location and don't include breakfast. Although expensive, this hotel is worth every single penny. If I come back to Bali I will stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1538,Wonderful Stay,50,May 2017,"I stayed here recently for a week with my mum and sister and we enjoyed every second.

We stayed in on the beachside part of the hotel. There is a part across the road, which all hotels seem to have and this seemed nice, there are some reviews that people feel ""short changed"" staying in this part but I don't think that would be the case.

The breakfast is great and there are several choices of local and international foods. Also the afternoon tea is great - great choices of sweet things. They even kindly gave my mum (a keen baker) one of their recipes.

The swimming pool is lovely, good service by the pool and there was always enough beds available. The sunsets are amazing and a must to see!

The rooms are lovely, in keeping with the surroundings. Housekeeping was always on point. Regularly topping up of water, shower gels etc

Location is also good and close to some good restaurants. To the right of the hotel is the more busier side, we found a great restaurant Batik which is a must try. To the left less busy also some great restaurants Sea Circus, Bambou, Saigon Street, Motel Mexicola are all great and within a 10-15 minute walk.

What we loved about this hotel were the staff all so gentle, kind and polite.

Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a wonderful stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1539,Absolute luxury,50,May 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach resort to celebrate our anniversary for a week. I was impressed right from the start communicating with the reservations team and the high standard was continued throughout our stay. Our ocean view suite was incredible with stunning views and a large bathroom and spa bath tub. The rooms were serviced extremely well and very spacious and comfortable. We had breakfast daily and was impressed with the large selection and delicious food, we also ate at the beach side restaurant which was also delicious. All staff were very friendly around the resort and it was truly a luxurious and relaxing experience. We cannot wait to go back !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1540,Wonderful Relaxing Ruby Wedding Anniversary Treat,50,March 2017,"This was the first stop on a 35 day holiday. The hotel was superb and the staff were great.
The buffet breakfast was exceptional and very plentiful. The hotel is a little way out of town which made it lovely and quiet, but we were within walking distance of plenty of places for eating.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1541,10th Anniversary Celebration,50,May 2017,"On the day we arrived at Seminyak there had been a cultural celebration so everyone was dressed in their cultural outfit. We received a warm welcome checked in and went to our room. As we had opted for half board we went to one of the restaurants and had supper. Its then that we met Dede, what a pleasant gentleman. Great service and an even better conversation, enlightening especially for first timers all the way from Africa. We really enjoyed our meals.

This hotel is really beautiful with stunning views, the only time it got busy was at breakfast otherwise throughout the day it was very quiet.

We would like to thank the hotel staff for a beautiful stay (suk suma), we will sure
return one day with our kids.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1542,Stunning resort in the heart of Seminyak,40,May 2017,"Beautiful hotel with excellent service. Staff were unfailingly polite and always on hand to help with our needs. Hotel itself backs onto Seminyak beach with an infinity pool looking out to sea. Perfect for morning relaxation. The restaurant/bar by the poolside is perfectly placed to watch the sun go down. Simply stunning. Location was perfect - a short walk to number of popular, smart bars and restaurants. Also, closer to the high-end boutiques. We would certainly go back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

high five to keysha and dexta from the resorts restaurant and dewi from the front desk ,u ladies are just too awesome",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1544,Front desk staff spoils the experience,30,May 2017,"We booked the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa just one day ahead during our last trip to Bali. We have visited the island 15+ times and stayed at different hotels at the beachfront, but never before at this resort. We selected the hotel for its beachfront location. Upon arrival we found out we booked a room at the part across the street. To be honest, upon checking this was mentioned in the confirmation, but we hadn't picked up on this. Quickly decided this wasn't why we booked a beachfront hotel, so we opted for an upgrade for USD 150 to the good side of the street. The room wasn't ready so we headed for lunch first. After the lunch we returned to the front desk. The room was still not ready, at that point it was around 2 p.m. and it started to be a bit annoying. The reason provided was that we chose to upgrade, therefore the room wasn't ready while our original room was ready. This argument has two absolute faux pas of hospitality 1) blaming the customer. 2) it was a blatant lie. Upon arrival I have checked the original room, which was far from ready at that point. Paying so much for a room and then have to wait, getting blamed and being lied to while at least 6 people behind the check-in counter do nothing at all thoroughly spoils the start of your stay at this resort.
Staff in the restaurants and the pool is a totally different story; they spoil you in a good way! This made up for the unfortunate start, until faced with the front desk staff upon checking-out again. As at checking in the staff in the resort is all too happy to swipe your credit card and charge, charge charge! I had to persistently ask for explanation of the different bills, a request to speak to the manager was ignored. To top it all of I had to sign I didn‚Äôt have Oreo‚Äôs from the minibar. After spending around USD 1000 at the resort for a 2 night stay getting this treatment? Nope never coming back and will advise others not to visit the resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1545,Splendid stay,50,May 2017,"Stayed at the Garden wing. Staff was very friendly. Room was clean and huge. Loved the room and bath layout. Location very near to Kudeta. The beds and pillows were so comfortable.

Things that could be improved were wooden floor planks were creaking. Breakfast was average. Found it a hassle to cross the road to use the main builiding's facilities.

Overall, I would still come back for another visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1546,Top Class Resort with excellent service,50,May 2017,Great location. Resort is beautiful and very well maintained. We loved the infinity pool overlooking the sea. The cocktail hour was a great bonus. Service was excellent. Would return in a heartbeat. Well done to the Management Team.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1547,Superb,50,May 2017,"Everything about this hotel is great. The staff is very friendly and pay attention to every detail; every afternoon they knock your door to check if you need anything and will give you some biscuits and bottles of water.
The breakfast is superb, you can eat local dishes or any kind of eggs, pancakes, waffles, toasts or yogurt from the menu, also fresh fruits/juice and a pot of coffee!
You can enjoy coffee or tea with cake and biscuits every afternoon at not extra cost.
The room is massive with a very modern design. The infinity pool and chill out areas are incredible. Prime beach front location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1548,Relaxing stay at the beach,50,May 2017,"We stayed in several resorts while in Bali and this was our only beach resort. The staff were wonderful, the room was HUGE, and the ocean access and infinity pool offered some great time to relax in the sun.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1550,Excellent location - beach front resort,40,May 2017,"We have come to Bali many, many times and this time we chose to stay at a hotel based on recommendation and were very happy with our decision. We stayed for 3 nights (beach wing) and would like to highlight the following:

- great hospitality and super friendly staff
- wonderful experience along the entire stay including airport pickup with drinks and cookies onboard
- efficient check-in
- central location but quiet
- prime beach front location with nice terrace for beautiful sun set chill out
- fantastic infinity pool overlooking the beach and ocean
- clean rooms and comfortable bed
- brand new gym
- breakfast choices not extensive, but healthy a la carte selections and daily changing local food",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1551,Beautiful pool,40,April 2017,"The pool is really nice as are the grounds.
Staff could have been a bit more attentive, left us waiting quite a bit at checkin.
Booked the villa, totally worth every cent.
They have this weird thing with the creditcard guarantee, like everytime we reached the deposit we had to ""repay"". Chill, we will not pack our bags and leave without paying, wtf?
Bfast was good. A la carte, so a nice change vs the usual buffet.
good location.
Quite honest with the taxi; you book a taxi by the meter and not an overpriced hotel taxi.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1552,very nice location,50,April 2017,"very nice room, super bathroom, all was clean, very friendly staff, nice garden, nice infinity pool, absolutely great breakfast. All was super. I could recommend this hotel very much. It is in quite location, but there are a lot of Restaurants and Shops around.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1553,THE MOST AMAZING HOTEL AND HOLIDAY EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,50,April 2017,"Our journey to Bali was horrendous due to flying with Malaysian airlines. Please do not travel with them. We landed at 12pm and was picked up by our private virgin holiday driver. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with fresh garlands and all the staff at the front were so lovely and made us feel like royalty. We were then seated and one of the staff came over to give us fresh face towels and some juice , this just made our day. We were sticky , tired , jet lagged but they just knew what we needed. The hotel staff really made our stay the best, so polite and lovely. I could not fault this hotel one bit. We even met with the general manager Michael just to say how fantastic our visit has been. We were on a full board basis and this was the best decision we made. The food was 5 star literally. We stayed in the Suite with a fantastic ocean view as well as the jacuzzi which was in our room. I will be definitely coming back and atm have the holiday blues. Amazing HOTEL AND AMAZING STAFF ESPECIALLY NYOMAN AND FENDII.. (From Naziyah and Sahin)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1554,Relaxing stay,40,October 2016,Four star property next to the beach with beautiful grounds and friendly staff. Stayed in three properties during my four day stay and would recommend the garden suite which was very comfortable and spacious. Villas have their own pool and are on two floors. Breakfast had many choices and was the best we had on the island. Property features several pools and daily exercise sessions. Town is within walking distance. Good swimming and surfing possibilities.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1555,Enjoyable stay with great service,50,May 2017,"I hv booked an ocean view suite facing the Indian Ocean, the room is spacious and clean.

Breakfast with diff variety and there is free afternoon tea from 3pm to 5pm.

Directly access to the beach from the pool area.

I could spend most of the time in this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1556,NICE HOTEL,50,April 2017,"We booked the basic room which was located across the road from the main resort.
<And we knew that in advance>
The room was VERY NICE, however we were keen to see if we could upgrade to a room on the main wing of the resort.
Someone from reception took us to look at 2 rooms on the beach wing side <which were 100% identical> to the room we already had across the road.

The hotel then quoted us $180US <$240.00 AUD> extra for the 5 nights, which I thought was a bit rich. If the rooms on the beach side were bigger, or at a higher standard then I don't mind paying for the upgrade, but paying $240 for exactly the same room to avoid a 15sec walk across the street seemed ridiculous.

I think it would be better customer service for the hotel to fill rooms on the beach side <if they have availability> even if customers have paid for the garden view rooms across the street.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1557,An amazing stay!,50,April 2017,"This resort simply wowed me! The location is excellent, the service is way above expectation ( my benchmark is a 6 star luxury cruise ship)! I love the infinity pool, the sunken bar, and the amazing breakfast! I'm definitely coming back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1558,Luxuries Hotel!,50,September 2016,"Seminyak is a must visit place if you are visiting Bali,
Perfect place for Honeymooners
The hotel is the luxurious place I have ever visit
Food is perfect
view from the hotel is perfect
the only negative comment that it is a little bit expensive but it worth",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1559,Breathtaking and stunningly beautiful!,50,April 2017,"The Seminyak (as it is known there) is one of the most beautiful, luxurious hotels that you will ever stay in. Where do I start? I will start with the most relaxing and beautiful pools you have ever swam in. The infinity pool is large and is right on Seminyak Beach (next to Kudeta). You will spend many hours in that pool overlooking the beach and watching people walking by. Not to mention the many hours you will spend on the property taking selfies. By the pool alone, I took hundreds of photos. The grounds are kept so clean and immaculate. The staff are wonderful and all speak English. The service is polite, discreet and respectful. The rooms are large (I had ocean view). The breakfast is fantastic. They have a buffet as well as a menu so you can have cooked eggs brought to you as well as pancakes etc. They also have a complimentary afternoon tea everyday from 3pm to 5pm. I love this little gesture. It's in the restaurant and is generous and refreshing at that time of day. I would always make sure I was back at the hotel so I don't miss out. Going back to the pool, it's like you never want to leave. I love my shopping and massages and I never sit still. But the pool kept dragging me back in over and over and I was so relaxed and content in that pool. This pool is better than the infinity pool in Marina Bay Sands Singapore. That pool was stunning because it's on the edge of the skyscrapers but this pool will make you feel like you are in heaven. I am going back in August! And just the thought of me knowing that I'm staying at this hotel, is making me so excited. Do yourself a favour and do it. My opinion, it's the best!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1560,Beautiful Resort,50,April 2017,"Seamless check in even though we arrived early hours of the morning, welcoming friendly staff, gorgeous spacious rooms, beautiful grounds and pool areas, top location in Seminyak . Loved this beautiful resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1561,Good Hotel and good manager,50,April 2017,"I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

When compare with all same gradeing villa at Bali, the facilities of this villa hotel is not the best and the renovation is not the luxury enough. However, this hotel can provide a good family and home feeling with a large size of private pool. Another unique of this hotel is the beach view villa, if you are looking a hotel can reach the beach in 3 minute and have a beach view with sunset on the sofa bed of your villa, it should be no.1 in Bali.

Moreover, the hotel manager, Chris is the best I have never met before. I have lost my camera on a taxi when I arrive the hotel. The manager drive me to the police station and help me to report to the police. And his recommendations of everything close by are all above our expectation.

The only 1 thing I can complain is the cleaning of the room is not completely statisfly. The floor feel like not clean completely.

The location of this hotel is very good, surrounding full of good shop and f&b. I like Seminyak area more than Kuta area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1562,3 nights in the hotel,50,April 2017,"Excellent weather and hotel. Warm service from the staff there, especially there are special events in the hotel every day. This really surprise me. A few things that can help to improve the hotel:
1/ the tap water tast a little bit salty (I did not drink it, I taste it when I wash my hair)
2/ there are nasty smell when I turn on the stream in the jacuzzi. I think this is due to there are some shower water left in the engine from the last user. So I need to flush away all the water in the jacuzzi, take shower again, wash the jacuzzi and then refill it. This took me
More than an hour's work.
Except the above, it is still an excellent hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1563,Relaxing Hotel,50,April 2017,"Get excited to visit The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.
The staff are incredible, check in & check out, The Pool(s), The restaurant, the bar... you name it.
The rooms are massive, well decorated, but yes, a little bit dated. Luckily their 'timeless' (albeit contrary to my previous comment - their Balinese setting/influence helps substantially).
The pool is one of the best in Seminyak and would be the envy of anybody at Potato Head or Ku De Ta (next door).
But most importantly - despite some of the negative reviews, that this place is beginning to look tired and they feel ripped off by having to stay in the Garden ""villa"" etc is nonsense.
This place is a smaller, more boutique brand playing with the big boys (i.e. The Legian next door, The Hilton and The W) but realistically, at a fraction of the cost.
Do not feel disheartened if you're relocated to the Garden Villa (over the road), in my opinion, its newer, its nicer, its smaller in terms of guests / volume and is likely a nicer overall stay.
The 100 metre golf buggy transfer adds an element of fun and exclusivity to those watching you on the streets too ;)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1564,"Stunningly beautiful. The most amazing pool, you will never want to leave",50,April 2017,"We go to Bali very frequently and have stayed at The Oberoi, W Hotel, The Westin etc. They are all beautiful hotels and I gave them great reviews. But when you go the Seminyak, the experience is pure luxury and serenity. The pool is amazing. It's an infinity pool facing the beach. Large and warm. You don't have to sit on a deck chair facing the ocean but you can stand in the pool and face the ocean. You will get the most stunning, beautiful photos at this hotel, I took over 400 of the pool alone! The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The staff cannot do enough for you. They are polite and friendly and all speak English. The breakfast is a combination of a buffet and menu. Very nice and will suit everyone. They have a lovely afternoon tea set up everyday from 3 to 5 pm in the restaurant. Little cakes and biscuits with tea and coffee etc. I love this hotel. I have stayed at some beautiful hotels over the years (see previous reviews) but with this hotel, I just didn't want to leave it. I hung around the pool and swam, would go shopping and want to return for another swim. This hotel is worth a visit, you will not be disappointed. I want to stay there again and again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1565,Perfection in the heart of Seminyak,50,April 2017,"This hotel is right on the beach in the heart of Seminyak. 2 minute walk to the main square in one direction and the infinity pool on the beach in the other. The hotel was immaculate, rooms were cleaned and turned down every day. The staff could not have been more helpful! This was my 4th time to Bali and i'd definitely stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1566,Very disappointing,30,April 2017,"I have stayed in the hotel a number of times in both the Ocean Suite and the Beach front Villa. We save this hotel til the end of our holiday because we have loved the service, the food and staff friendliness. This stay was nothing short of disappointing. Trying to get a reservation or a response from the reservation was virtually impossible. In the end I had to ring directly and practically beg for the pricing to come through. As the confirmation from did were sent after left for Bali, I went directly to the hotel to sign the forms and confirm my reservation. We stayed here in January whilst the hotel reception and surrounding areas were under reservation. We are told that the works would be finished in February. When I arrived to confirm my booking I noticed that the hotel was still being renovated. I was told it would reopen (be completed) in a couple of days, before I checked in. On that basis I decided to upgrade my full trip to the Beachfront Villa which is substantially more expensive than the other rooms. Upon check in, the hotel was in the same, unfinished state. I had a pre arranged for a Beach Villa that did not have all the vines and trees blocking almost the entire room but was not allocated this room. In fact, I was told that as 'valued, returning guest' I was offered a good rate therefore that was the best room they were willing to give me. I literally had to stand on my tip toes to see the view- most villas along the beach front had been trimmed except ours. I was also disappointed to return back to my room at the 4.45pm to find out that housekeeping still had not cleaned the room. As the children were now in the room after a long day out, the cleaners could only do a 'light clean'. We did not have a turn down service for 3 nights. After I had to complain numerous times, a big effort was put in to maintain a good level of cleanliness. There were a number of other issues we had so we decided to check out early. They practically begged us to stay which we did. I was offered complementary snacks and massage on our last day and asked to write on trip advisor which obviously I am doing now. Lastly, I order a 'Hotel' car for 38US dollars. Instead of the hotel car I was given local transport which cost 200,000 Rp. I had only realised that it wasn't the hotel car when I was dropped at the airport with my three children and all my suit cases were dumped in the middle of the road and he drove off. I was completely lost for words. I called the hotel and asked for a manager to call me back, not surprisingly I never received a call. It would take a lot for me to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1567,First class hotel,50,April 2017,This is a first class hotel in an excellent location! The hotel has both rooms and villas. We stayed in a room which was very spacious and beautifully appointed. The staff are outstanding. On arrival we received a hand written card of welcome from the hotel manager. Each guest is also invited to a sunset cocktail event to meet the Hotel Manager and senior staff. This strong leadership from the top is then displayed in all the staff who to a person could not be more helpful. We had breakfast and afternoon tea included in our package and they are both excellent! Highly recommended.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1568,"Nice hotel, not amazing",30,April 2017,"Perfectly nice hotel - nothing particular to complain about, just not outstanding for the price.

The staff are fantastic - all lovely and super friendly. I got tonsillitis whilst I was there and the staff were really helpful and a Dr was in my room within half an hour to give me antibiotics, which was great

The infinity pool and beach location is great - very relaxing and the sunsets are incredible.

The rooms are good - beds are very comfortable and spacious.

We were on a room only basis so went out for breakfast everyday. We did consider staying in at the hotel but at $30
per person, this seemed ridiculously high, especially when there are so many fantastic places within walking distance at a fraction of that price. Would highly recommend Sea Circus - absolutely delicious, every time.

All in all we had a good time but the hotel just feels a bit soulless...you could be anywhere in the world really. Wouldn't go back but it's a good hotel in a good location for some r&r.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1569,Beautiful Space,50,April 2017,A beautiful resort set amongst lush gardens. There is a wonderful sence of space here. We stayed at the site across the road which was very serene and peaceful. Excellent staff and the food was great.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1570,Mixed feelings,30,April 2017,"Very mixed feelings. There are some amazing things, and some very average ones.

The staff are lovely, typical Bali service being slow but still lovely and doing their best.
The pool is amazing.
The location is great.

The not so good points.
Breakfast is very average for Bali standard.
There is actually a seperate dwelling that is a part of the hotel that you can be put in. To be fair it feels like you're a second class guest. It shouldn't be considered the same hotel. Feels like we were pool hoping and using another resorts ammenities.
Over priced. The pool bar happy hour is a pretty bad deal. The room service portions are very small, even for Bali standard.
For the amount you pay for your stay you can get a better hotel.

Main things that attract people to this property is the pool and location. It's not a bad resort, just you can get better for the same price.
Won't return or recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1571,Best on Bali,50,April 2017,Nice and clean hotel. Friendly and helpfull staff. The breakfast was great and the espressomartini awsome! Great poolarea for swimming and relaxing. We lived in the villa across the street and that was private and peacefull.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1572,Popped in for drinks and reminiscence ...,50,April 2017,"Having stayed here 5 years ago, my husband and I visited just for drinks in the day with our young son.

Entering the hotel was just as amazing as our previous visit - smiling welcoming staff and beautiful decor.
We walked straight to the pool and were immediately seated as guests under an umbrella.

The views over the beach were spectacular as ever and the same tree through which you see the sunset while eating by the other pool still there !

Ice cream and cocktails arrived within minutes of ordering and staff were attentive and accommodating.

Exactly as we remembered it- high standards, helpful welcoming staff and definitely convinced me that I need to book my next stay here again!

1573,Great hotel on the beach!,40,April 2017,Loved this hotel and location! Staff was helpful and friendly. I picked this hotel because of the pool and beach access and it did not disappoint! Would highly recommend watching the sunset from pool/ bar. Only downfall to the room is that the shower did not have hot water. Would definitely stay at this hotel next time I visit Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1574,Amazing hotel!,50,April 2017,"The staff was so friendly and welcoming. As soon as arrived we were greeted with afternoon tea (complimentary). The staff showed us to our gorgeous room. We had yoga in the park (complimentary of the hotel). The pool overlooked the beach. There were cute little markets within walking distance of the hotel. I love to travel and I have to say this was one of my top favorite hotels I have ever stayed at. Whether you are with family, friends or a couple, I guarantee you will love this hotel!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1575,Quiet abode in Seminyak,40,March 2017,"Nice location on sea shore with lush green surroundings.
nicely furnished and comfortable rooms.
Good food and courteous service. Staff is polite and helpful.
Overall a real pleasure to spend your holidays in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1576,Mr,10,January 2017,"Trip booked for late Jan/early feb.
Due to unforeseen circumstances the trip had to be cancelled. Has been nothing but a headache. We have been trying to get our money back for months now and finally got told today that it won't be happening even though there was more then one months notice. Excuse today was that their accounts had already filed the money. Pathetic.
Bali mandira in Legian have been fantastic to deal with and have refunded all of our funds. Have stayed at mandira many times before and thought we'd give Seminyak beach resort a try and this has happened.
If handled correctly we would have re-booked.
In saying this we have re-booked with Bali mandira for dec/Jan 2017/18 for the whole time.
I'm sure the Seminyak beach resort is a beautiful resort but the way this has been dealt with is un acceptable.
To save all year and cancel due to unforeseen circumstances that were inevitable and it be handled this way is very disappointing.
I've never written a bad review about a resort but this has really disappointed me.
If you book this place do not cancel. You'll be bitterly disappointed in the outcome.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1577,Most centrally located,50,April 2017,"You are in the heart of all activities if you choose to stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for sure. It is adjacent to Ku De Ta, and within a short walking distance of the Seminyak square.

To begin with, this hotel has the shortest walking distance to the beach from any room. Its infinity pool itself is superb with unobstructed views of the sunset. There is a pool bar also that adds to the charm.

The rooms are all fairly large and well appointed in all aspects. We chose a balcony room with a jacuzzi and were very happy. Several power points are there everywhere, and we did not need an adapter as they were all universal. Toilets are well stocked and decently large with ocean view. Shower pressure was not up to the mark though.

The staff here is very friendly and courteous too. We had a Manager's sundowner invite over cocktails and it was quite amazing to see them concerned about our preferences and stay at the hotel. It was a nice gesture on their part!

Spa is also very nice, though pricing is steep. They do not have a steam room but the sauna is very good.

We found the breakfast to be a bit dull, firstly because you do not get a view of the ocean from there, and secondly because for vegetarians like us, the spread is a little repetitive, unlike most beach resorts.

Now, some general tips for Bali, which you probably won't get anywhere: Do not exchange currency from booths or kiosks on the streets. They are all frauds sitting there to lure you with unbelievably good rates. While giving you the money, they slip out notes and you will not even realise it. We had heard of this from a friend and tried one to see the magic, and were amazed! We just left without changing anything. The ones that are inside food marts are genuine and give you exchange slips as well.

Also, while traveling in taxi, always choose the blue bird metre taxi, even from the airport. Their rates are genuine and reasonable. Fixed rates are usual 4-5 times higher, though it may not seem too much in actual terms as everything is very cheap out here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1578,Fabulous hotel,50,March 2017,"What a fabulous place to stay. The most amazing beachfront pool area with multiple pools to choose from. WE stayed across the road in the Garden Suite which was gorgeous and lovely with its own skin up bar / pool as well. Ive never seen so many amenities in a bathroom as in this hotel. Great place, sad to leave and will surely be back and next time in the beach front villa!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1579,Great stay there,50,April 2017,"I really love to stay this hotel and I will come back again ! All the workers there are very friendly and warmhearted , and give me a smile no matter any where you see them . The breakfast is also good there !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1580,Private Villa with Indian Ocean view,50,January 2017,"Was upgraded to th garden room villa with private pool

Service as expected. Impeccable!

I didn't expect the upgrade and checked in on New Year's day. Needless to say they started my 2017 on the right path! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

The villa was so nice I barely used the common facilities. I was happy and content in my own private world.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1581,"Excellent hotel, you won't be disappointed",50,April 2017,"I stayed in their ocean front suit. Housekeeping twice a day, amazing pool, great breakfast, room service, good wifi (it's important when you travel solo haha) excellent front desk administrators, great location with lots of restaurants and shops around. They have a spa and early morning yoga classes available. Nice touch with fresh fruit in your room twice a day. Very relaxing place. One of the best experiences I've had in the last couple of years",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1582,a great choice in Seminyak!,50,April 2017,"It's a great experience staying with The Seminyak Beach Resort. If you're looking for a good hotel, a touch of luxury and excellent surrounding, this hotel is the right choice.

Friendly staffs are first ones you meet at the gate and through to the beach.

The reception area is great, though so, I prefer the main lobby that now are under maintenance - hope it'll finish on schedule!

Check in process? Seamless! I was asked welcome with warmth, asked for the details of my reservation and checked in!

We were escorted by the FO staff that assisted during check in and were explained about the room facilities. All in order. The room is great. We're allocated near the beach - the waves sound is so relaxing.

Excellent view from our room's balcony, the chapel, garden, pool, are exquisite!

Food and beverage are good - I had a little birthday cake during the breakfast and many thanks for the gesture!

The Staffs! Most friendliest I ever met lately. Good to know that there are still hotel/resort with such high standards/qualities around.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1583,"Nice resort, great location!",40,October 2016,"We ended our Bali adventure in Seminyak staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. The grounds and pool are beautiful. The infinity pool overlooks the ocean and is a great place to hang out. Being right on the beach you can go out front and walk down the beach for hours, stopping along the way for some cheap & cold Bintangs. The beach is wide & flat, but stay close to the water because the sand gets HOT!

Our room had ocean views and was very large. The bed was comfortable and the resort was quiet which allowed for some great sleep after a long day in the sun.

During our stay, we had a couples massage in the Spa. The Spa was clean & relaxing. Our Spa room overlooked the ocean and with the windows open we had a nice ocean breeze moving through.

The only place we ate at was the pool while hanging out during the day. The food was good and I would recommend ordering a pizza if you need a snack.

Service overall was top notch; welcome staff, reception, pool and cleaning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1584,Attention to detail!,50,April 2017,"While seminyak was by far the most expensive city we stayed in Bali, the resort has all that you'd expect from a high end destination plus every little detail. A fridge stocked full every day, snacks provided, umbrellas, hats, sandals and beach bags all in your room ready for use. The GM even stopped by at check in and had a signed card waiting in the room.

Make sure to spend plenty of time by the pool soaking in that gorgeous view!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1585,great location,50,March 2017,"stayed here in the garden wing actually in same room as previously
room was great with comfortable bed
curtains were blockout so it was possible to sleep in
breakfast and afternoon tea were a highlight and included
we had a choice of where we could sit
either the small pool in the garden wing or by the infinity pool by the beach
just a warning
we got quite sunburnt the 1st day under a beach umbrella
obviously the umbrella was not completely 100% uv absorbing",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1586,Beautiful hotel and but side villa not private,40,March 2017,"This is a lovely resort in a convenient location. So much greenery and a wonderful view. Stayed in a gorgeous beach Villa, but was really looking for privacy, and because we got the beach villa closest to the chapel / poolside bar, whenever we were standing we could be seen. Granted, we didn't pull down the blinders in the outdoor living area, but then you miss the view of the beach!

When there wasn't any guests at the bar, there were always security guards. Would have preferred more coverage on the right side. Probably better to get a villa that faces the pool because at the villa's elevated height all we would have seen is the beach and no guests -- as they would be all swimming!

On the flip side, if you don't need privacy and you're happy to flash, this villa has more view of the beach and skies than the others. Do note, if you're lying on the poolside chair in villa, you don't see the beach view. Only from the gazebo...

Food and service was excellent. Villa itself was very nice. Wonderful bathtub. Amazing to wake to sound of the beach, and breakfast was delicious. Overall, might stay here again and try another villa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1587,Stunning Service and Location,50,March 2017,"I stayed at this hotel with a group of friends for a week during March and can honestly say this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at. The staff were friendly and accommodating, doing anything they could to make your stay more pleasant. The location on right on the beach was amazing. From here we could watch a beautiful sunset every night. The rooms were immaculate and spacious and the breakfast buffet had every type of food that you could ever wish for. At the end of our 7 day stay I don't think we had managed to try everything - there were so many options! Its an easy walk into the heart of Seminyak with lots of options for food or entertainment very close by. The only small disappointment was the limited menu by the pool consisted only of western style snacks - pizza, chips, club sandwich - with no local options available. However this was easy enough to find a 5 min walk away if this is what you were after. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be definitely be staying there on my next visit to Bali. Thank you Seminyak Beach Resort!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I would not hesitate to visit again, definitely a hotel not to be missed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1590,Made to feel like royalty!,50,March 2017,"As soon as we arrived for our week stay I knew this resort would not disappoint. The staff are all too happy to help and serve. The service is flawless!

Our room was very clean, perfect beach view and always clean. Nothing was out of place. We went for a premium room with a perfect sea view

Breakfast was perfect everyday accompanied by that perfect service. Staff also knew my name every day - small touches which count.

If i visit Bali again I wouldn't hesitate to book this place again.

We were here for 'Nyepi' which is their silent day to celebrate new year's and no one is permitted to leave the resort. During this time the resort gave us plenty of time to plan this day as well as many activities to get us through the day.

I am travelled far and wide across Europe and easy Asia - Seminyak resort demonstrated the best service I have ever encountered by a long way. As well as one of the prettiest sunsets I have witnessed

1592,Wonderful and Photogenic resort ^^,40,March 2017,"Me and My best friends had wonderful stay here, our room had a sitting area overlooking the gardens. The infinity pool at the beach is stunning with plenty of sun lounges and umbrellas for comfort and shade. It is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the view, especially the insanely amazing sunsets and also swim up bar which is not to be missed. If you're staying in Seminyak, I highly recommend this place, even if just for a night or two. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Staff is really very well trained and really helpful :). So happy to spent our Nyepi holiday in this resort and we couldn't stop our self to post every picture that we took in our social media 'cause every single spot in this resort are very photogenic and instagram worthy :).

Thank you very much for making our holiday unforgettable, hopefully we can comeback very soon ^^",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1593,Flawless,50,March 2017,"Everything about this resort is absolutely first class. There was a wide variety of breakfast items at the morning buffet, the afternoon tea was gorgeous with traditional Indonesian sweets to try, if you fancy, the setting of the restaurant has a very tropical feel and of course, the staff are all so friendly.

In the morning there was a bamboo type instrument or drum being played by the staff and was a nice touch to this tropical setting.

There is a luxurious infinity pool and swim up bar which is not to be missed. If you're staying in Seminyak, I highly recommend this place, even if just for a night or two.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1594,"Excellent service, excellent resort, excellent everything!",50,March 2017,"My wife and I booked into The Seminyak for my 40th birthday - we booked the beachside villa and we're there for 9 nights and 10 days. The hotel and grounds are immaculate, the private beach and infinity pool are beautifully kept too. The restaurant and in room dining were both excellent and the servicing staff could not be faulted. I would certainly recommend this hotel to a friend and we will be visiting again in the future.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1595,Amazing stay,50,March 2017,Such an amazing place and super friendly staff and management that would go over the top for the comfort of their guests. They are really unique and made me feel like i am in my own luxurious home. The hotel rooms and facilities are simlply incredible. The location was excellent as well.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1596,Amazing Hotel and Beach,50,May 2016,The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Hotel is really luxurious and service is flawless. Staff is really very well trained. The swimming pool is nice and the beach is really the best. Very well located. Just a few steps from the famous Ku De Ta.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1597,Amazing resort,50,March 2017,"We had our wedding at the Seminyak back in August 2015 and recently returned in March 2017 for a dinner for two.

From the moment we arrived at the resort during our wedding planning in January 2015 we have found the staff to be incredibly welcoming, helpful and understanding. My partner and I had a ""rainbow"" wedding or gay wedding at the resort and the staff were very respectful of our needs and made us feel incredibly special during the wedding planning and on the day itself. Nothing was too difficult. The wedding itself we couldn't fault, the chapel the ceremony was held in looked amazing, the reception dinner was perfect and the food and beverages were to die for.

We recently returned in March 2017 and wanted to re-visit the resort as it was the first time back in Bali since our wedding. The resort put on a special romantic dinner for two held at the chapel. We both felt very special and spoilt by the staff and it felt like getting married all over again.

The rooms were spacious, very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was on the best I have had in SE Asia.

All in all I would recommend this resort if your looking for that extra special Balinese experience and I will be returning when we next visit Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1598,Excellent hotel and amazing staff,50,March 2017,"We spent a week in Seminyak and stayed at this gorgeous hotel. The facilities are very new and in excellent conditions, the staff is lovely and extremely helpful. They were always looking for ways to make our stay better and answered every request we had very quickly and always kindly. Every time we walked into our room, it had been cleaned and there were fresh fruits and warm tea waiting. The swimming pool is beautiful and the hotel located right on the beach that is kept very cleaned. Extremely quiet hotel, the breakfast was delicious and very diverse. We have traveled in several locations on the islands and this was by far the best hotel we stayed in.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1599,"Beautiful resort, amazing staff",50,February 2017,"We have stayed at the Seminyak 4 times now and they manage to excel every time. The gardens are beautiful and meticulously maintained. The staff are friendly and professional and nothing is a problem. If there is any oversight they rectify it immediately. On our most recent visit my father took ill and they sprang into action, organising doctors, room service for my mum whilst she stayed with him. They treated my parents with such attention and kindness and we are extremely grateful. Our rooms were authentic balinese style and each had a sitting area overlooking the gardens. The infinity pool at the beach is stunning with plenty of sun lounges and umbrellas for comfort and shade. It is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the view, especially the amazing sunsets. We have already booked our next stay - what more can I say!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1600,Lovely hotel!,50,March 2017,We could not fault the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa - lovely surroundings and great staff. It was great to be on the beach and within walking distance of some great restaurants and shopping. Happy to recommend it to anyone.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1601,Awesome location .,50,March 2017,The best part of this property is its location . It is on the beach . Good food good service . What more you want . In all it was great staying here .Seminyak is a very happening area . All best clubs cafe r on walking distance .,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1602,SUPERIOR in every aspect !!!,50,March 2017,"This hotel supercedes the EXCELLENT category.

This hotel surpasses the EXCELLENT category. WOW !!! The staff and service were exceptional, courteous, professional, attentive, and very respectful. Always had a smile and ready to assist the client with whatever was needed. Had the pleasure of meeting at least 60 members of the team and I do not have enough words to express my appreciation for the superior conduct and service we received during our stay.

The room was immaculate, the garden was very well kept and it was a pleasure walking and enjoying the tranquility. The service within the pools was fantastic and provided a great view of the beautiful sunset in the evenings.

The food was exceptional and being very picky about the way my eggs are done, the kitchen staff surpassed my expectations and without hesitation, the best preparation I have experienced in my many years of traveling through various countries.

I can only say, thank you very much for such a wonderful experience and look forward to visiting The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa in the future.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1603,Good location,30,March 2017,"Good location & polite staffs. However, inconsistent house keeping. Some days missing out a hand towels and did not refill the body soap. Got a stained towel once too. Other than that, this place is good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1604,Location to the beach,50,March 2017,Very nice sea breeze in the hot afternoon by the pool under the trees. The hotel is doing some small renovations on the pool deck next too one of the pools. The rest of the hotel is excellent. Beds are a little hard for me but the rooms are clean and modern. Short walk to the main shopping and restaurants street.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1605,Paradise!,50,March 2017,Such an amazing place to relax and spend time with my husband. The staff are amazing and a special thankyou to them all for making our stay so special. Wish we could have stayed longer. I would highly recommend a this place.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1606,Amazing Hotel!,50,March 2017,"We stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for a week of relaxation to end our eastern travels.
This is a beautiful hotel and the staff go out of their way to make sure guests enjoy every minute of their stay and nothing is too much trouble. The food is top class and the choice available at breakfast incredible! We can also thoroughly recommend the Seafood Buffet evening. The location is perfect to enjoy beach walks and the sunsets with a cocktail. All in all, the Seminyak is total luxury and Balinese hospitality at its best!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1607,"Don't bother, terrible",10,March 2017,"Thought this was going to be 5 star and it's not!!! Negatives - very dated, dark rooms. The bedding had mold on it and by the time we checked out, all our clothes were damp. We left a Berocca out and when we got home it had soaked up all the moisture in the air and was soggy!!! Management said it was because it was the wet season but we checked out and the next hotel did not have the same problem. Reservation manager extremely unhelpful. Rooms have very little natural light. Our dark floorboards were lifting so every time you walked it creaked. It's an old hotel and extremely dated and they should not charge the prices they are. It's marketed as a beach hotel but the restaurant is up by the road at the back of the villas and only 2 tables can see the water. Restaurant is basically a few poles holding up a roof so very hot! Food prices really expensive. Infinity pool was beautiful but shoved in with not much room for sunbeds that were lined up literally right next to each other, crowded and with little shade. The pool on the other side of the bar was much nicer but only had two bales. The annoying thing after paying that much money for a crappy room was the construction work that we were not told about and made relaxing impossible. Gym closed (moved to a room). Food and spa prices were much too expensive. Crazy to put a huge wedding pavilion that was empty all the time we were there to block out the water view. Positives - great breakfast. Wonderful friendly staff!!! Great location. Good security. Beautiful grounds. Housekeeping did a great job working with what they have. Even with those good points, I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. It needs much too much work to get it up to competitors levels. It's expensive for what it is. All the good reviews of this hotel are singular, there is a reason for that. So very disappointed, completely ruined our holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1608,Nice accommodation at large resort,40,March 2017,"It's a beautiful resort., large beautifully maintained gardens. Friendly, professional staff eager to help. Great infinity pool., great location. Complimentary afternoon tea daily. Great security. Large rooms at the beachside accommodation we chose.
Unfortunately, we arrived an hour pre checkin and had to wait until 2pm to get into our room. The hotel was not at optimum, as this time of year is slow in Bali. We felt that a $500 holding fee at checkin was too high. $300 would have been acceptable. This was non negotiable. The TV and DVD player had to be replaced as both were faulty, and the exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn't working. Just a little disappointing for this standard of accommodation. It is competing with newer hotels of similar price. Dining in was quite expensive also, so we chose to explore other outside restaurants. Overall we had a lovely holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1609,"Friendly staff, beautiful resort",50,March 2017,"We had a Deluxe Garden view room which had a lovely bathtub and small private patio area which opened out onto the central garden area. The room, as with the rest of the resort ground and facilities was absolutely meticulously clean and well maintained. All the staff were super friendly and helpful. There was daily yoga/meditation/Pilates groups you could attend, although we spent most of our time in the infinity pool sipping cocktails and watching the world go by! There were beautiful sunsets each evening and the area they have set up for weddings etc looked like it would be really magical if that's what you were looking at going there for. The room felt a little bit damp which I think was a combination of the humidity and the air conditioning being on. There was definitely no evidence of mould or anything but I think having a dehumidifier in the room might have helped. If we were to go back again I think we would definitely get a ""villa"" with private Garden/pool area - but if you don't plan on spending much time in your room or at the resort then a standard room is more than adequate. Breakfast was great with heaps of options both a la carte and buffet, with omelettes, waffles, pancakes, granola, smashes avocado on toast etc as well and an array of local dishes.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1610,The best of accommodations,50,April 2016,"We made a mistake here and didnt ensure we had a ground floor room. A quick upgrade and we had a private villa with a pool just off the beach. My wife and i loved the resort. We were able to have a very relaxing time. I have never felt so looked after. The staff were all very helpful, polite and eager to please. The restaurants nearby and at the resort had great food which we kept trying. It was such a great time we will do it again real soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1611,Best first trip to Bali! One of the best hotels in seminyak!,50,March 2017,Our two kids 6 and 8 couldn't get enough of the place. They fell in love with the private beach ... and Everyday we struggled to pull them back to the hotel room.. and once in they didn't want to leave the awesome tub. The staff were also Super friendly.. they made special off the Menu food for our kids which was Lifesaver with my little fussy eaters. Loved the breakfast choice- fresh and tasty n new every day. Loved the afternoon tea. It was complimentary - nice touch. Loved the area. Right next to ku de at which the kids loved. Thank you so much. Our first trip to Bali. Our first hotel in Bali. Will definitely come back here!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1612,Amazing resort,50,September 2016,"The resort is beautiful, we had such a warm welcome, the staff are really excellent! great decor and the grounds are beautiful! Would 100% stay again! We really liked seminyak, lots of nice bars and boutiques :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1613,Pleasant stay,30,March 2017,"The Hotel was going through some renovation during stay, which took some points off our rating.
One area as well the Hotel but concetrate on is in Food and Beverage. The Restaurant Breakfast is good but the concept and Food for Lunch and Dinner needs to be looked into.
Staff however extremely friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1614,Beautiful Resort,40,March 2017,"We had a great stay at the Seminyak Resort. All the staff is extremely friendly, the room was amazing, the food was delicious, and the spa services were great. Our only negative experience was the laundry service. They charged $50 but they did not actually wash the clothes and they actually lost or stole a pair of shorts. Management was made aware of the issue and they did nothing to correct it or reimburse me for the loss.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1615,Incredible hotel,50,February 2017,"Stayed in a garden block room and was initially concerned after reading reviews, however this was completely misguided. The stay was fantastic! The staff where always helpful, friendly and happy. The small walk to the main building for breakfast was a small price to pay for the peaceful retreat that was the garden wing, which had its own virtual empty pool with swim up bar. The complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea where delicious with a great and varied choice. Excellent location with short walks either into town and restaurants or up along the beach to many of the beach clubs.
Overall fantastic stay will recommend to everyone and can't wait to come back! Thank you!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1616,Very kind staff and also gorgeous resort.,50,March 2017,"We hope to see soon Bali because of the good stay in the resort, beautiful beach view, accomodation, massages and also breakfast. Perfect place for your holiday. If you considering where to stay in Seminyak, this is the place!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1617,Bali,50,March 2017,"This is my 4th time in the resort, I very much recommend it. Staff is polite, welcoming and friendly. Views are breathtaking, and it is a quick stroll to Kudeta. The garden wing feels like paradise and it's peacefully quiet.
You can also choose to go surfing right in front of the resort or just enjoy a quick walk on the beach. Looking forward to my next visit to the resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1618,Prime Location,40,March 2017,"Exceptional staff that are more than happy to have a chat or just to say ""how are you today"",infinity pool on the beach, great location, spacious room with no noise from the road,great view from balcony.
Only negative was no coffee machine in the room.
Would recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1619,Pure luxury!,50,March 2017,"This is our first time in Bali, both my hubby and I agree that we chose well to have stayed at Seminyak - Beach Resort & Spa. We stayed in the garden wing (across the road from main complex), I would have loved to have stayed at the ocean view over looking the beautifully kept grounds. The staff are friendly and attentive (this appears to be the bali way!). The infinity pool is amazing with uninterrupted gorgeous views of the beach and sunset. Multitude of choice when it comes to breakfast buffet. The crowd / hotel patrons are of honeymooners, older couples and some families (laid back luxury). Highly reccomended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1620,So Beautiful and perfect!,50,March 2017,"The moment we arrived to the resort, the staff greeted us with lays and a nice cold coconut drink with a lemongrass straw! They took in our luggage while we registered and asked if we were here for any special occasion. I told them that we were celebrating our anniversary and the next day when we came back into the room they put rose peddles on our bed in in the bath tub! They even wrote us a nice note to congratulate us on our anniversary. Not only is the room beautiful but the whole resort is really nice. We went during the low season and the resort was only half full which was perfect because we pretty much have the WHOLE Infinity pool to ourselves! Also, the view from the ocean at the pool was amazing, you MUST watch sunset there. The complementary breakfast was really good and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would defiantly book this resort again. I wish I'm back there right now.

OH almost forgot, there's a security that checks all the cars before letting anyone enter the resort which makes us feel much safer. And the resort is smack in the center of a lot of things so you can walk to most places. Wifi is free as well!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1621,Stunning location!,40,March 2017,"We were greeted by the lovely staff at the The Seminyak and immediately were taken care of very well. We had a lovely afternoon tea provided by the hotel and a lovely afternoon in the pool (unfortunately there was construction going on at the pool making it a bit noisy). The beachfront location of the infinity pool was priceless... Breakfast was delicious and had so much variety. We would have loved it if the location of the breakfast had a view of the beach, but maybe that is something they are working on thus the construction. Our room was lovely and very clean. The hot water in the shower didn't work well but we did not want to bother using our energy to complain because we were only staying one night. Im sure they would have fixed the issue promptly had we let them know. Because of the construction at the pool, the not great location of the restaurant and the water issue we feel as if the hotel was a bit overpriced.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1622,Fantastic stay,50,March 2017,"Beautiful accommodation great views of the ocean love the breakfast and the free yoga. The pool is to die for with it's water edge, such a beautiful position we feel totally relaxed and rested, we will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1623,It doesn't get any better,50,February 2017,"When I travel to Bali I'm looking for that special place that blends nature, lifestyle and local culture into one seamless package...the Seminyak does just that!

Service from the airport pick up to check in to settling into my room requires no thought and pure elegance in delivery.

The property takes me to a very peaceful and comfortable place with stretches of green gardens and a view of the sunset that can't be beat.

Right outside the property is the lively enclave of restaurants, sights and shopping, all within walking distance.

In a island where 5 star hotels crop up with marble and glitter, the Seminyak offers a 5 star retreat that offers everything wrapped around the perfect local island escape.

Highly recommend if you are a traveler that believes comfort and lifestyle are important components for a great trip!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1624,"Great location, pretty resort",40,February 2017,"The hotel is in a great location, right on the beach and walking distance to downtown Seminyak shops and bars, that's primarily why we chose it. Sunset watching on the beach is superb - they have a DJ that comes to play music every evening and you really have the best seat in the house.

Hotel: I think this hotel is maybe 2 years old so everything is new and very nice. The rooms are great, very modern, super clean, their evening turn down service is a very nice touch. Our room was facing the garden with a view of an ocean. Coming from Alaya hotel in Ubud where everything is very open, I thought this hotel's check in area felt a bit like a room where they are trying to sell you timeshares.. I don't know, just kind of awkward and again, only because I'm comparing it to all other hotels in tropical areas where everything is open and you can feel the breeze of the ocean.. this was a closed room where you felt the breeze of AC. The bar is next to the reception.. again, i think it would get more traffic if it was closer to the beach.

Pool: Pool area is Instagram-worthy. Truly beautiful, long infinity pool, nicely landscaped. Downside - the wooden floor around the pool gets ridiculously hot and it is unbearable to walk on it barefoot, you literally have to run to the pool. There is an area an the end of the pool with a white concrete that doesn't absorb sun - it should be all around the pool like that.

Service: As everywhere in Bali, people are superbly nice and very service oriented. You just melt in their kindness. Everyone speaks great english and is there to make your stay as enjoyable as ever. Anything you need in your room, they deliver within couple minutes. We lost power one evening, and they were there within 2 min to fix it. Service at the pool area is a bit slow. When we were there, the resort wasn't too busy and I thought waiting 15 min for a glass of wine was not reasonable.
Food: We only ate some food at the pool and I thought it was ok. Mostly Western cuisine but lacks any spice/flavor. Cocktails at the pool are awesome. You have to have their Seabreeze - it's magical. I would recommend going next door to Kudeta beach club where food was truly inventive and beautiful.

Overall, we would recommend this place to anyone, but it can make some slight improvements.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1625,Great hotel.,50,February 2017,Lovely hotel on the beach. Great gardens. Nice inclusive breakfast and afternoon tea in garden with Koi carp swimming around. Nice rooms. Close to the middle of Seminyak. Good value for money. Would definitely recommend.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1626,Beautiful beach front hotel,40,February 2017,"We stayed here for the second half of our honeymoon, and perhaps our view was clouded as we came from such a wonderfully intimate hotel in Ubud with fantastic personal service, but we found the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa to be beautiful, but felt some of the service could be better.
Location. Seafront location is amazing, close to some popular restaurants and beach clubs but far away from the noise of Kuta, but not so far that a taxi is expensive. It only cost us about 55-70,000 one way from outside the hotel to Kuta main area.
The room. We were luckily provided with a room very close to the beach with an incredible view over the pool and sea, and we could hear the waves at night which was very relaxing. Huge, very comfortable bed, lovely bathroom with separate shower and bath tub.
The swimming pool(s). The main infinity pool was a great place to spend half a day, swimming in the pool with a view of the sea, watching the waves and the surfers and dog walkers was really great. We only visited the other pool once but it's a good place to relax without too many people around (there are only 3 pairs of beds by the second pool).
The food. Firstly, the breakfast had a huge selection, with some things (such as eggs) made to order, and a huge buffet of bread, cakes, fruit, juice, yoghurt, deli cheese and meat, cooked rice and curries, sushi, salad. Our only complaint was that the food seemed to be either very salty or very sweet, and not very healthy. The food at the Sanje restaurant by the beach was very good. Everything we tried here was great. However, we felt the staff were a little rude at this restaurant, which was a shame because the location is so beautiful we would have enjoyed more meals here if we didn't feel so uncomfortable. We also had dinner at the main restaurant where breakfast is served only once, and we wondered why it was always empty, and unfortunately I think it's because the food was mediocre but very expensive, and it's missing what other beachfront hotel restaurants in the area have and that's a view of the sea. I recommend if you eat dinner in the hotel to only eat at Sanje restaurant. The view and the food are better. The main restaurant staff were very kind and attentive, however, and great about checking if the food is OK for my allergies.
Reception staff and all room service and cleaning staff that we met were also very friendly and helpful.
We didn't try the spa services as the prices were at least 3 to 4 times more expensive than other places.
Overall we were glad we stayed at this hotel as the room, the location and the swimming pool were great, but for the price we felt the food and service should have been better.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1627,Great Stay!,50,February 2017,"Stayed 4 nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and had an absolutely brilliant time. Hotel was incredibly relaxing - the rooms, pool area, easy access to the beach, grounds, breakfast all fantastic and can't fault a thing. Special mention to the staff as well who were all wonderfully nice & friendly. Hotel is also in a great location for evening bars/restaurants....easy walks to places such as Ku De Ta, Potato Head, Bambu, La Favela but could list many more.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1628,Lovely Property right on the beach,40,March 2017,W stayed in the independent building which was only across the road from the main hotel - but more importantly from the beach pool. The price was a fair big cheaper which why we opted for it - and not the main building. The hotel is a lovely property and in easy walking distance to pretty well anything you'd need in that seminyak area. Staff were friendly and the room was clean.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1629,Just hollidays,50,February 2017,"Very friendly, very clean, nice breakfast, good feeling, very safe with the security, relaxing at the pool and having a drink is just beautiful, beautiful room with nice surprises like animals make of towels.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1630,Beautiful but not private,30,February 2017,"Lovely staff and premises, gorgeous views and acces to the sea and beach ...pity was not informed of building and renovations....so from and afternoon nap come nothing but frustration....rest was extremely nice....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1631,One bedroom villa beach side,50,February 2017,"My husband and I stayed in the beachfront villa. The room was perfectly clean, the service was amazing and the staff extremely friendly.
The infinity pool was beautiful.
The hotel is very well located too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1632,A great experience,50,February 2017,"We had a private villa with beach front views
The villa was beautify appointed with even a daily paper delivered with complimentary bar and snak usage on the first day
Our breakfast selection was amazing.
The pool area has beach front sunset viewing
The lobby bar is small and not inviting
It needs to be located.. There is a new GM that was spending a lot of time meeting and greeting and doing a marvellous job and we believe that there are some new changes coming.
There are always minor things that can let a resort down
Our mini bar was not refilled for three days , so they missed out on sales .
We had a 90min massage which was so relaxing but a little pricey

Overall a very enjoyable well located and older style resort / villas stay",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1633,The Seminyak,50,July 2016,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is lovely place for international holiday makers, this is more than beautiful, beach side is the greatest in town,. Try to avoid night beach situation and better stay in the hotel in the night instead",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1634,Great resort,40,February 2017,"The resort is well maintained with stunning gardens and pool area. Staff were friendly and professional. Location in Seminyak is ideal for access to restaurants, bars and shopping. Food at the resort was great however like most places in Bali a review of the wine selections would be well received.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1635,VERY NICE HOTEL,40,January 2017,"Lovely hotel but was disappointed in that I booked a pool terraced room and was under the impression that the loungers outside our room were for our use only - not so - any resident can use them but can't leave them for longer than 40mins unattended. Staff were attentive and very helpful. Hotel was situated in a very central part of Seminyak shops, restaurants etc. near to hand. We also thought this hotel was situated on the beach - not so but they have a buggy shuttle to beach on demand.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1636,The best experience,50,February 2017,I like staying there and the staff was very friendly and helpful .. the beach is nice and good.. the bool was good. The area is helpful and the restaurants was a lot of good entertainment and environment,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1637,seminyak beach resort,50,February 2017,This property is beautiful and in a lovely location on the beach. The staff is the best around and makes the stay an unbelievably enjoyable experience. It is my second time to stay at the resort and I will stay everytime I return to Bali.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1638,worth every penny,50,February 2017,"the hotel is fantastic, the services are excellent, the crews is really nice and accomodating. gonna come back when i have time. sadly i lost my phone in the beach, when i taking a video with my cousin's phone it fell to the sand and taken by the sea. other than that i love the hotel so much",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1639,Just WOW,50,February 2017,I stayed at this stunning resort with my family and I have just one word for this stay - WOW. Location is good and few mins walk to Seminyak Square and all action is available here. We had an an amazing sunset view room at Ocean View wing and it was just Perfect. Hotel has a spa which is great and one can witness a mesmerizing sunset from pool-side. Overall a complete stay and we would like to go again here....,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1640,Amazing resort in wonderful location!,50,February 2017,"We stayed in an ocean veiw suite for 4 nights. The room was serviced twice daily with fresh towels and bathroom items always replaced. The evening turn down service included a hot thermos of tea! The breakfast buffet as well as egg menu was amazing! Seminyak Beach resort is located a short walk from shopping streets, bars and restaurants! At the end of the day the resort Infinity pool and restaurant by the beach provided amazing sunset drinks in pure heaven! We loved our stay at this resort and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful oasis in a great location right on the beach in Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1641,Great resort. Top notch,50,February 2017,Arriving at the Seminyak beach resort and being greeted by staff from the reception was very refreshing after being disappointed with our previous accommodation at an alternative establishment. Very accomodating staff. Beautiful breakfast. Room was very cosy and comfortable.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1642,10 days in paradise with amazing service!,50,February 2017,"Long review - worth reading!

My wife and I held a small intimate wedding ceremony at the hotel. We were a party of 14 people, many from Dubai, several from other parts of the world, all accustomed to good standards and service, and all staying at the resort. From the moment we were picked up from the airport and throughout our stay, the experience was absolutely amazing.

All the rooms were very spacious (we had the 1bed ocean view villa, others had various room types), decorated in stylish Balinese yet modern design, staff always friendly, smiley and know you by name, we were consistently tended to, room service and house keeping were always present within a few minutes of being called, our room was replenished all the time with everything we needed....

The GM took a personal interest in our party's well being and kept track of what was going on in the days leading up to our ceremony, checking in on us regularly...

The F&B Manager, Alexsander Paim, was an absolute superstar, going well beyond his scope of responsibilities to ensure our day and our whole trip was a fantastic success. He took on a role of a consultant giving us amazing advice and tips on so many of our outings and various days of celebrations. Alex worked with us daily to tailor the food and cocktails menu for our big day, he sourced entertainment, getting us a good price for a capoeira show, and even managed to throw in a complementary jazz band over dinner! Wow!

The hotel was so accommodating and flexible in every way we could have asked for, they provided us various areas across the property to host the various parts of the evening - the chapel designed exactly to our liking, drinks facing the ocean on an outdoor terrace, followed by dinner in a garden and ocean setting, all this while also maintaining an indoor back up plan just in case it rained (luckily it didn't! We were requesting changes to several things till the last minute and it was all done, service with a smile). Finally, a party to dance the night away at the Klass and Brass bar which was sealed off exclusively for our group....cocktails were designed specifically for that part of the event, to our taste and liking! We couldn't have asked for anything more, we have been left with a beautiful experience and memories for a lifetime...all our friends have also been exceptionally complementary of the hotel and the entire team...

Thank you very much Michael (GM), especially Alexsander (F&B Manager - I know we were quite a demanding bunch!) and to the entire staff and team at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. I would recommend this property to any family, couple or group of friends, it truly caters for all needs and is strategically positioned close to the lively parts of Seminyak while still maintaining that sense of privacy and exclusivity.

We hope to make it back again next year!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1643,Five Star Experience,50,February 2017,"Everyone in this hotel greets and smiles.

In-room complimentary teas are from TWG! Every afternoon, there is also a complimentary tea and snacks for all hotel guests!

The hotel facilties are superb, very cozy. The inifinity pool is perfect, facing the Indian Ocean. Very quite, guests are mostly couples, no big tour groups. The hotel also has access to the beach, perfect for sunset!

Now the Spa! This is THE SPA. We took a couple's traditional balinese spa. The couple room was facing the Indian Ocean, and the room was surrounded by traditional Balinese stained glass windows. Started with the foot scrub and then the perfect massage.

Will come back to this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1644,Our 4 night stay exceeded all expectations,50,February 2017,"We had read some reviews from disappointed guests and weren't sure what to expect. On arrival, couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Our accommodation was spacious, attractive and had a entry to the lovely gardens and great outdoor pool area. Complimentary tea, coffee and water was replenished daily, breakfast was excellent with a huge range of choices.
The infinity pool overlooking the ocean was the highlight, plenty of sunbeds, great staff who offered cold water, cucumber to cool the eyes and chilled refresher cloth to guests on arrival. complimentary snacks, even a mini cocktail were welcome little gestures that were appreciated. The pool was as beautiful as it looks in all the pics... and very much underused.
We were offered a late checkout as we had a late flight, with use of shower and spa area to freshen up prior to our departure.
We thought the hotel was very personal, the invitation to complimentary drinks with management and other guests was a nice touch and the chance to chat to other visitors encouraged a friendly feel.
We recommend this hotel as a peaceful retreat with all that you need for a very well located hotel in the heart of Seminyak. We thought it excellent value for money and would definitely return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1645,Great resort,50,January 2017,"Stayed here for three nights at the end of Jan as a family of four adults. It was a shame that the weather was really bad and we didn't get to enjoy this gorgeous resort as much as we might have.
On arrival the reception is a little unimpressive as it is being renovated. We arrived earlier than check in time
so sat at the pool where staff came to us once our rooms were ready. Our kids were given a room very close to the beach and I was a little jealous until we got to our room which was possibly even better as we faced the beach and had a large balcony. Really liked that you could enter or exit the room from either the front or back doors.
Rooms were well equipped and very comfortable.
The pool was great with good water temperature and a depth that you could walk in all the way around. There was a shallow section for kids too.
Breakfast was very good, although not the best buffet breakfast that we've had in Bali.
Would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1646,Overall run down,30,February 2017,Needs major upgrade from rooms to gardens and Resturant. Totally old and seventys look and dark rooms. Furniture and bathrooms are all worn out the side table in our room top was coming off drawers didn't work. Basically major upgrade needed.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1647,dissapointing,30,February 2017,We booked the Seminyak beach resort for the last night of our holiday. The room was incredibly damp and the smell was horrible. The restaurant at the beach was lovely and the staff were nice. Room was not worth the money what so ever.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1648,Great experience,50,February 2017,"I have to sat my one week at the resort was excellent. The service team was very attentive to all our needs and expectations and were always around for anything we needed. Special thank you goes out to Alex, the FB Manager who went above and beyond his duty in helping us organised a wedding for friends, from the ceremony to the dinner and the surprise birthday we had in store a few days later...I think Alex worked for two weeks non stop just to help us make it a memorable trip and I can say it was!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1649,Beautiful and clean Resort,50,January 2017,"I had a wonderful stay at The Siminyak Beach Resort, I truly felt at home when I was there, everyone was so warm and nice, beautiful rooms and very modern and clean, amazing staffs, very good management. I love ‚ù§Ô∏è The Seminyak Beach Resort ‚ù§Ô∏è all the staffs made my solo trip very memorable and enjoyable. I thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1650,"Beautiful pool, Grounds and Location (but avoid staying in Garden Block)",50,February 2017,"I had booked two garden view rooms for 5 nights, not realising at the time of booking that the garden view rooms were in a separate block 200 metres from the hotel entrance on the other side of the road. I do not understand how this block (inaccurately known as the garden block) could be considered part of this hotel. It doesn't even have a meaningful garden. I immediately asked to be moved to the main hotel and I was offered an upgrade to a Suite for $100 (usa) per night per room. This was unacceptable but I had no choice.

The main hotel is excellent. Our rooms in block two of the main hotel were one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. Each room was very large with a large Jacuzzi and bath tub with excellent views in to the garden (a real garden) and beyond to the sea. The main hotel has beautiful gardens, some of the best pools I have ever seen in a hotel, excellent staff, two beautiful restaurants. The breakfast was delicious and the hotel provides complementary tea in the afternoons. It is within walking distance to Seminyak shops, restaurants and bars. The service everywhere in the hotel was excellent, the hotel staff and management could not do more.

Unfortunately, I understand why some people who have stayed in the Garden block give it a very low rating; this block should be named and marketed as a separate hotel. Excluding the Garden block, and despite renovations to Reception and the poor weather, our stay at this hotel was very enjoyable and I rate it a top 5* hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1651,Great location and awesome service,40,January 2017,"Centrally located in the heart of Seminyak's Food and retail offerings. Great service by the team too.
Only downer was their gym was under renovation and they had a make-shift one which had basic equipment and was really busy during peak times.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1652,Beautiful serene seaside resort,50,February 2017,"Impeccably clean, beautifully landscaped, tremendous ocean views, several pools, lots and lots of lounge chairs poolside, incredibly friendly and attentive staff. Had to delay our departure from Bali due to sickness and checked-in here. Very glad we did! Staff was so helpful making sure we had everything we needed to recover (lots of tiny, tasty little bananas, rice and soups!)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1653,"Good position,poor hotel",20,January 2017,"Staff in this hotel is the only positive comment every other aspect of this over priced poorly maintained hotel is one I would never re visit. Everything from the poor renovation to the bad tvs reception to the poor breakfast & so called High Tea in the afternoon there is not a positive aspect that would ever rate this hotel above 3 stars except for the garden cabana area.
Management appear to have spent very little on a 5 star renovation on an old hotel & it shows.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1654,Amazing hotel!,50,February 2017,"We had one night here as our last in Bali! The room, pools, spa and food were incredible!
We also did a free of charge yoga class in the garden just for the 2 of us!
Perfect way to end our holiday!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1655,Spa treatment,50,February 2017,Great atmosphere and service. I had the traditional facial massage and it was worth it. Price and quality are great. Very clean rooms and good quality of the products. The welcome drink and the tea at the end were a plus! Great service and really recommended.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1656,"Good Hotel,not quite 5 star",40,February 2017,"Although we knew it was the wet season we have just had an enjoyable stay at this resort. Check-in was excellent, room was very good, large and had all the necessary equipment. The grounds are beautifully kept, pool is great and beach, although rough at this time of the year ,was clean.
The staff are excellent and kind, any problem was fixed immediately even though the resort was at 80% capacity. Our many thanks to all the staff.
There are many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel which is good because getting around in a taxi is not good, the traffic is horrendous.
Buffet breakfast was the only thing that needed improvement, no egg station meant ordering from the kitchen which was a bit awkward for timing but the food was good and plenty of variety for all nationalities.
We would recommend for couples ,not for younger children.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1657,Good Hotel and Service,40,February 2017,"Finished up a 4 night stay here. Great service from day one with them greeting you by your name, very helpful etc. The weather was not great so they arranged for management cocktails and various other events to make up for this. The management made a point of coming and speaking to you with one of the managers particularly helpful and giving good recommendations. We upgraded to the suite which was an enormous room with no complaints here.

Breakfast was good though I wouldn't say it was any better than some of its hotel competitors nearby. Only criticism would be the Garden Rooms which I believe are slightly off location - would recommend going for a suite if you are staying here. All in all was a good stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1658,"Perfect romantic vacation with everything from beach,shopping,restaurants just a walk away",50,January 2017,"me and my wife were very keen to stay at seminyak...as it was little more upscale then legian and kuta area .we also wanted hotel on the beach and all the action and restaurants near by. the seminyak beach resort and spa was a perfect one... the beach was good,pool was excellent just by the beach,spa and jazzuci was great, sauna was also good...the check in was very fast and room deluxe beach wing was excellent.. room was pretty big and very well maintained and well equipped. large balcony opes in garden just leads to pool. breakfast was good and the staff tried the best to provide us vegetarian food every day.... the staff at this hotel was very polite and helpful. it really felt special..and best part you could just walk to seminyak square for all the action and shopping.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1659,Extremely high humidity,10,January 2017,"Extremely high humidity , damp room which smelled like mold, sheets were damp and our clothes were always damp and became mouldy when put back into our suitcase to return home.

Stayed in the garden room across the street , not sure if the same problem is witch the main hotel.

The rest of the hotel was great but this was a large problem that outweighs the rest",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1660,Wonderful,40,January 2017,"Fantastic hotel with beautiful garden, large infinity pool and direct access to the beach.

I would definitely recommend it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1661,"Excellent location, best staff ever",50,January 2017,Loved this hotel lots despite the temporary closure of its lobby. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The best breakfast buffet I've ever had. Loved the pandan croissant. Rooms are with views to die for of the Indian Ocean. I can spend days at the infinitely pool.

Beautiful beach front, and I can only say enough thank you to all the team of the Seminyak, from the cleaners to the front office and restaurants and Spa.
Gorgeous gardens, peaceful place....
Thank you to all for the memorable memories I will keep always with me!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1663,Family 6 night holiday,40,January 2017,"We stayed in two beach wing ground floor rooms (47sqm). The approximate cost of both rooms for 6 nights was AU$4,500. The rooms are very nicely decorated and have all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The gardens near the ground floor rooms are beautiful and well maintained. The resort is a good size with only approximately 75 rooms for accommodation on the beach side.

Breakfast was very good with a great variety to choose from. The wait staff are lovely.

The pool was beautiful, with a fantastic aspect out on to the ocean.

The Resort location is excellent with close proximity to other restaurants, cafes, pharmacies mini-marts etc.

We would possibly stay here again, and recommend this resort to other people, but the following may deter us:

Cost: compared to The Legian next door 2 basic rooms of 99sqm for a 6 night stay in July, with free cancellation, including bfast for $10,561, the Seminyak would charge $13,351 for two 47sqm rooms with free cancellation including bfast (Expedia 23/7/17 to 29/7/17). We have stayed at The Legian many times, but not since it was sold by GHM. It is a top notch stay in every way. The Seminyak is doing extremely well in trying to provide additional services such as complimentary afternoon tea, but sadly this does not compensate for the basic luxury floor space provided by The Legian which has also provided exceptional services for many years.

Resort sea wall condition: This is a concern not just for The Seminyak, but all older ocean side resorts / hotels in the area. With ever increasing sea levels (due to thermal expansion from rising sea temperatures etc) the wall facing the ocean is going to be exposed to increasing deterioration at a rather quick rate. This will be extremely costly to reinforce, but should be given immediate attention to ensure safety to the resort / hotel structure and ultimately guests.

On a positive note, someone was meeting breakfast guests one morning and asking if we had any feedback (both positive and negative) on how we found the resort, showing that the guests mattered. I'm not sure if he was the manager, he didn't introduce himself.

We had a great holiday and The Seminyak contributed to this in many ways. Thank you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1664,A perfect holiday,50,January 2017,"Nothing to complain about, everything was perfect from the rooms, staffs,food and amenities. As for the location it's heaven on earth. It was a family trip and will surely visit again in future. To all the staffs, well done guys to make r stay so beautiful experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1665,We love to come back everytime,50,January 2017,"We love to come to the seminyak beach resort, for us it is the perfect place to stay when we are on Bali. Its not far away (10 min. walk) for the main road and you you have Kudeta near by a cool beach club. The food is great the rooms are modern and super cool and the service is phenomenal. The infinity pool is a highlight too!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Great breakfast selection of buffet and A la Carte. New bar recently opened is a nice touch and sells some great cocktails. Barman know their stuff and create things to tailor to the guests needs if something from the menu doesn't catch your eye. Perfect infinity pool and pool service of food and drink. We love it here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1667,Great location,40,January 2017,The location was fantastic but we were very disappointed with the initial accommodation across the road-certainly not 5 star worthy! Once we moved beach side though we were very happy being so close to the beach and the room was great. The staff were fantastic but we were disappointed that the gym and lobby area were being renovated and therefore not in use when we stayed.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1668,Lovely Semintak Beach Resort,40,January 2017,"The place is fantastically located. Quier and relaxing whilst near all the restaurants and shops.
Staff are wonderful. Thank you for making our stay so pleasurable.

1670,Amazingly good...,50,January 2017,"This resort is simply wonderful - a great place to rest, enjoy peace and relax. Brilliant location. Staff are polite and very helpful. Food impressive, and the pool area breathtaking. Gardens are wonderful to relax in. This was my second time there, and I'll book again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1671,Good location and lovely staff,40,January 2017,"Genuine, friendly and helpful staff. We enjoyed the relatively child free pool area and nice sun lounging layout with swimup pool bar. Would have liked to see more Indonesian options on the pool bar menu. Didn't use hotel restaurant for dinner as there are so many fantastic places to go to Seminyak, most a short taxi ride away. (Most people did this as hotel restaurant always empty at night as was the hotel indoor bar). Due to renovations the fitness equipment was situated in a room and only one treadmill which made it cramped with 4 people in there at once, and three wanting to run on the treadmill at the same time! Plants around the resort looked like they needed regular watering as foliage dry and stressed instead of lush tropical green. But overall a really pleasant and relaxing visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1672,The Seminyak Beach Resort,50,December 2016,"For my 17 yr old daughter and I it was our first time to Bali and we wanted to stay in Seminyak. Found this hotel on Trivago. Great location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Warm and friendly staff who greeted us with huge smiles from the moment we arrived and for the 7 days we were there. The hotel was undergoing renovations so we couldn't experience the entire hotel but what was available was great. Fabulous pool area. Would definitely stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1673,Not as advertised,30,November 2016,"I visited here for 5 days in November, my first impression was one of confusion. It looked nothing like the photos we had seen of it from the outside, we were taken round the side and into a makeshift reception area where we were sat on a sofa under a leaky roof/air vent where water dripped on us as we waited to be checked in. We were later told that the main entrance and reception was undergoing a refurbishment. This was really disappointing as we wasn't told that upon booking. The price was extremely expensive which we didn't mind paying for a luxurious holiday but that isn't what we got. Had we been told there would be work going on and the main entrance and reception was closed we would have booked else where.

The grounds were beautiful as was our hotel room but there were some issues I had which made me feel like the hotel definitely wasn't the luxurious 5* resort we had booked.

The pool was lovely but the water features/fountains didn't work properly - some times they sprayed random water out and you could tell a mile off that they was broken. The decking around the pool was worn and some planks were sticking up out of place which is really uncomfortable to walk on.

The biggest selling point of the pool is that it is an infinity pool which is right on the edge of the beach, which seems amazing but when actually in the pool trying to relax and enjoy the view there were men and women CONSTANTLY coming right up to us trying to sell everything from kites to scalves to bracelets and more! And they did not take no for an answer.

The bath in my hotel room ran brown water one day and a cleaner was sent to clean it but the actual problem was not resolved for over 24hours.

All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful I cannot fault them at all but my overall experience was not a 5 star one and was just disappointing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1674,Holiday,50,January 2017,The hotel was lovely and the room was amazing with comfortable beds and luxury bathroom. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The food selection for breakfast was incredible. Pool area was beautiful and relaxing.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1675,Wonderful place to rest,40,October 2016,"The hotel I would say is just below average for it's standard but above average would not do it justice.
Pool was lovely and beach was impressive but on the second day the hotel ran out of beach towels for a half day...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1676,Excellent oasis in Seminyak,50,January 2017,"INCREDIBLE infinity pool, the service was insanely good, and we had a lovely stay! This hotel was a highlight of our trip, and we could see ourselves coming back here year after year. A highlight was the privacy and serenity of the place, and how lovely and kind the staff were, always smiling!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1677,"Beautiful hotel - 5,star location and service",50,January 2017,What a gorgeous authentic Balinese hotel! Loved our stay in the beach wing. The hotel and the service are beyond amazing. Our room was located near the infinity pool and main restaurant and the gardens in between are so calming and gorgeous! Had a one hour spa treatment which was the best massage on the island. I highly recommend you spend a few days at this hotel - you will leave refreshed and on cloud 9. Thank you to all that made our stay so memorable,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1678,Verry nice holydays,50,October 2016,We are the second time in this Hotel and this was not the last time. We are verry happy. All was for us wonderful. One of the nicest holydays we had.

1679,Beach front resort,40,January 2017,"There weren't many beachfront resort with private villa in Seminyak and that's why we have chosen this resort.

We stayed in the one bedroom beach view villa, room 1005 for 3 nights. Fantastic room with great outdoor pool and dinning area. The bathroom was amazing, there were 2 small garden inside the bathroom!
The main pool was great which was oceanfront.

Great sunset view at the resort, no need to go to go the many beach club in the area to get a drink and soak in the sunset.

Location is great and is a short walk to everything.

It was monsoon season and the beach was quite dirty. It was really sad to see how much plastics gets washed up onto the beach. The beach would have been great if it wasn't so dirty but that is not the hotel's fault.

Our first night there were loud music coming from Ku De Ta which is a beach club right next door, the music probably went on till about 2am, but did not notice it for the next 2 nights.

Only complaint we have is the hotel guests and their use of drones. We had a private villa, which is located right behind the main pool. Everyday there were drones coming from the pool area flying over our villa invading our privacy. Hotel need to let their guest to respect other guests within the resort and not allowing them to fly their drones peaking into the private villas.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1680,Bali honeymoon,50,January 2017,"We stayed in this hotel as the second part of our honeymoon in Bali and it was lovely. After a stay in quiet Ubud we arrived in busy Seminyak a bit worried that this wouldn't be the atmosphere we wanted. However as soon as you enter the hotel it's wonderfully quiet and serene with beautiful views over the ocean. It was also nice to have the busier shops and eateries down the road if we wanted a change of pace.
The hotel is pristine and the rooms are large.
We went half board and were provided with more than enough food. There are two restaurants to choose from in the evening serving 3 courses- one traditional and one more Western. Both were very good.
We stayed in early Jan and the hotel was quite quiet. We had no problem booking spa treatments or getting beds by the pool.
The pools are beautiful and these are where we spent most of our time.
I had my favourite spa treatments in this hotel. There are so many places you can get cheap treatments locally but if you want a very luxurious experience then it's worth paying a little more for a package at the hotel. We had a beautiful couples room overlooking the ocean at sunset.
The staff were lovely, greeting us by name everywhere we went! They were so helpful. Nika who served us many nights in the restaurant was so friendly and made our stay wonderful!
Thanks all at The Seminyak for a great stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1681,Holiday/elopement/wedding,50,January 2017,"One of our best holidays!

We have both travelled quite a lot but have to say that The Seminyak Beach and Spa resort was one of the best hotels we've stayed in.

Originally we booked this as a holiday but then decided to get married (elope) whilst we were in Bali. We contacted the hotel with our plans (initially it took their events team 3 weeks to respond to our email, we were not sure why!) but once we started communication everything worked perfectly. It was completely organised over email correspondence and we met our wedding planner the day before our wedding to go through the itinerary. Everything was exactly how we imagined to it be, the day was just perfect and we will remember the day forever.

When we first arrived, we were quite worried as it looked like we booked a hotel in the middle of all the hustle and bustle but as soon as you passed the main gates you were in paradise and couldn't hear anything from the outside. Also this hotel is 5 mins walking distance into the shopping and food area, which was heaven for us.

The staff at The Seminyak are incredibly friendly and super helpful and are always greeting you with a beautiful smile. The best breakfast buffet by far and the food was delicious and fresh. Dinner was also very good and the coconut sticky rice dessert was the best!

We booked the beach wing room and was very happy with our decision, the room was spacious and had all the amenities we needed. House keeping was extremely fast with requests we had.

The pool area was quiet and very clean and not so busy, hardly any children around.

We absolutely loved every single minute of this holiday and would definitely be coming back and staying in this hotel again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1682,Beautiful,50,January 2017,"The resort is close to great shops, markets and restaurants. The hotel is right on the beach. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are loverly and the food is great. The spa was amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1684,Honeymoon,40,January 2017,"We stayed 4 nights at the seminyak and really enjoyed the resort. The beach villas are comfortable and spacious.

Staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall a great trip! Would highly recommend this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1685,Great beach resort,50,December 2016,"We stayed in a beautiful room. Lots of space, beautiful bathroom and great view.

1686,Beautiful,40,January 2017,"We had a wonderful stay at The Seminyak for our 20th wedding anniversary.
We chose the resort because we wanted an ocean view room (ocean suite). The room was huge and bathroom stunning...with a gorgeous tub beside big opening windows.
The balcony sunset view was perfect.
I have read a few poor reviews recently and can understand there was concern about renovations happening (we were also very disappointed but to be honest there was no noice and it didn't really impact our stay at all). The lack of a fine dining restaurant meant the resort is very private and peaceful...you don't get people wandering in and we were really happy with how quiet it was. Even on the hottest sunny afternoon we could always find a lounge by the pool...and the pool wasn't filled with squealing children.
The staff were lovely although the poolside service was slow and we often had to ask for service...this could be improved.
Overall we loved our stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1687,"Good place to stay, Clean and close to the mkt",40,December 2016,Good place to stay from location. For veg they need to add some more variety of vegetarian food. Staff friendly but can be more knowledgeable about the tourist options. Rooms are clean and the tropical fruits kept in the rooms are wonderful.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1688,"Great people, great location, great Spa",40,January 2017,"We found this hotel to be very friendly, relaxing and enjoyable. We would recommend it to other travelers who are looking for a good priced, great location with friendly, accommodating staff - then this hotel offers it all.
The central Lagoon Villa rooms embraced the Balinese culture, we enjoyed our thatched roof villa with the lagoon pool at the door step.
It was a little noisy with neighbours close by, but it meet our needs well. The spiral high stair case to the loft style bedroom was a little challenging - but manageable as it gave the room character. It would have been nice to have a little more of a comfortable lounge to stretch out / relax on - but once again it was comfy as we were out the room mostly, traveling, dining and swimming and attending treatments at the fabulous Hotel on-site Spa.
We would definitely recommend the Spa treatments - the salon was much more expensive than on the Bali streets salons - but far less expensive when compared to Australian salons. The menu was expansive and the therapists were highly skilled and the environment and facilities were excellent. Beware the Spa is certainly worth trying - and one treatment will not be enough! We recommend the Balinese traditional massage and the hair cream treatment - simply divine!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1689,Overall too expensive-poor kitchen performance,30,December 2016,"Beautifull hotel in poor surroundings
. The sea is rough on this side of Bali and brings lots of garbage and dirt on the small beach. Forces the hotel to have cleaners there busy all day. Friendly and well trained personel . Good and well assorted breakfast. Very poor cooking in the main restaurant. Keep away!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1690,Poor service & lackluster rooms,20,December 2016,Hotel was under renovation to which we weren't informed!! Never compensated us for this. Gym was shoved into a room & pool was half closed. Old rooms & payed full price but didn't get free breakfast!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1691,"Great people, great location!",50,December 2016,Staff were very friendly an accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble. I went there to convalece after and eye operation. It was the perfect place to hang around for ten days!! Take a bottle of whiskey and they will supply the ice.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1692,"Beautiful modern set up, great pool, cocktails and sunset view",50,December 2016,"We stayed here over christmas for 5 nights. Rooms were perfect - aircon a bit confusing but we got sorted in the end. We stayed in quarters across the road from the main building - we had our own pool and swim up bar which was perfect. It was generally quiet too. Location was close to all the major spots like ku de ta, breeze, and nearby great eateries like sister fields, sea circus, mexicola, potato head etc and a 2$ taxi to fab places like sardine, Barbacoa, etc. Great brekkies at the hotel too and service very friendly. Also had the most amazing treatment at the spa. Awesome sunset spot - we got some great pictures. During Christmas season the beaches in the Kuta area wash up all the dirt from the sea. The hotels do their best clear as much as they can but it can be a bit of a shock if you are unaware of this. In saying that unless you are sitting on the beach you can avoid it as the hotel provides lovely grounds to sit on and it can almost be blind spotted! Seminyak as an area is a busy spot and we had a bit of a culture shock having come from the quiter uluwatu. If I were going again Id cut our nights down to 2/3 nights and check out some other spots futher afield like Ubud, gili's etc. But overall this hotel was a great spot to stay and Id throughly recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1693,It was the best!!!!,50,December 2016,"Place was fantastic!!
Quiet and clean with fantastic view!!
Everyone was all so nice and i haven't felt once uncomfortable.
It had the best view and when i went to potatohead or hardrock i wanted come back right away to The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa as the view here is much much better!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1694,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,50,June 2016,"Absolutely glorious. Upgraded on arrival to a beach front room. Could hear the waves crash of a night time. The staff were warm and welcoming. The infinity pool was excellent, I highly enjoyed watching the foot traffic along the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1695,Relaxing week by the pool,40,December 2016,"The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa is a lovely spot, very modern and well maintained rooms and facilities.
We went there as a couple to have some time out - object to sit by the pool read a book, listen to music and just chill - job done!

If you don't fancy sitting by the main pool there are a number of more private areas you can find to relax. There is a smaller pool with pool bar also.
Staff very helpful and friendly.
The cocktail bar is worth a visit but a little hard to locate - just near reception hidden behind some sliding doors!
Had a great massage, reasonably priced, would recommend this!

This is a family friendly resort and equally a couples.

There are two parts to the resort so be careful which part you book, one is located away from the main building across the road, the other on the beach front (the main building)

Location is good very easy walking distance to the main centre of Seminyak, with plenty of good eating places within a ten minute walk.

Only down is the condition of the beach, it is a real shame that Bali has such a litter issue - I wouldn't recommend walking on the beach let alone swimming!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1696,Relaxing at Seminyak Beach Resort!,40,December 2016,"It had everything we were looking for......infinity pool overlooking the beach was great to relax at....
Close even to walk to the nearby restaurants and shopping areas! Better to stay at its beach wing.
After the lobby renovation, it will even look and feel better....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1697,Relaxing Holiday,50,December 2016,"Great resort, great pools, nearby shopping, restaurants, bars, massage.

Thoroughly recommended for a relaxing holiday in the sun where the staff are very friendly and accommodating.

Lots of interesting day trips possible although Bali traffic makes getting around slow.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1698,Amazing resort - exceeded our expectations!,50,December 2016,"We booked on Agoda a 'garden wing' room and were extremely pleased upon checking in that we had been put in the main resort (not across the street where the garden wing is located). Better yet, we had a room on the ground floor which opened out on the grassed area and could even see the beach. The ground floor rooms had a much larger sitting area compared to the balconies upstairs. Everything about this resort is 5 star - the breakfast buffet was the best we have ever had. The service to the room was extremely fast. We felt very secure as there was a lot of security to get in the resort as well as guarding the beach entrance. The pools are lovely - just beware that it is not cheap to drink at the pool bar. If you want cheap beer, you can pay $5 for a lounge on the beach just in front of the resort and drink $3 Bintangs which was great. There are lots of hawkers around so the infinity pool overlooking the beach is not as peaceful as it looks in photos. Location wise, this resort is in the best spot in Seminyak. It was about a ten minute walk to Seminyak Square which is surrounded by lots of shops and cafes etc. Ten minutes the other way is another area of Seminyak (near Potato Head) where Motel Mexicola and Sea Circus are. We were never without somewhere nice to eat and drink. We absolutely loved staying at this resort and would recommend it to couples looking for somewhere nice but not as expensive as places such as the Legian etc.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1699,Right on the beach and friendly staff,40,December 2016,"The service and location are definite standouts of the resort. Really close to Seminyak square, shops, right next door to Ku de ta are all great things. There is a bit of refurbishment happening at the hotel though so the gym and reception area are quite basic. It will be much better when this is all done.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1700,Lovely stay,50,December 2016,"First, we got upgraded room because apparently the room we chose from Agoda was under renovation. We didn't know actually that the type of room we chose was not located inside the hotel complex, but accross the street which was not convenient. Fortunately the upgraded room was very close to the pool and beach. For next booking better to look closely which type of room and where it is located. Overall, we had a great time at the hotel, pool and beach was lovely. Location is superb nearby cafes and restaurants within walking distance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1701,Amazing Hotel,50,December 2016,"We had a wonderful stay in the Seminyak Beach Resort starting from the room, breakfast, pool and everything else. The staff are very nice, polite and always smiling. The hotel location is perfect, were you have access to everything.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1702,Fabulous luxury on the beach,50,December 2016,We had a divine time at the Seminyak Beach resort with our 5 young adult children staying in a two bedroom villa. Such a peaceful retreat but so close to all the Seminyak activity. The Breakfasts were amazing and the staff made us feel so welcome and looked after.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1703,Great stay,50,December 2016,"My wife and I, had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights, and it was a wonderful experience. From reception, which was very warm and welcoming, we were convinced to upgrade to an ocean front villla, a decision we never regretted. Everything was clean and orderly, the workers were all nice and friendly. The only problem we had was the terrible pollution of the beachfront on our third day, and after a rain storm which washed masses of plastics and garbage to the beachfront. The hotel team did its best to clean up, even bringing school children to help.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1704,Serenity and Peace,50,December 2016,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel, it's a real retreat, quite and with a beautiful and modern balinese character. Very well located at the heart of Bali's night life, when you get inside, it's a haven of serenity. The pool has a stunning view on the beach and sunset. The service is excellent! The food in the restaurant is good, although I would have expected more seafood and fresh fish (being on an island), the menu lacked a bit of choice from that perspective. The Breakfast is excellent!
I highly recommend it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1705,like dejavu,40,November 2016,"Was stayed month ago at the seminyak beach resort. Got ocean front view room! So peacefully, quiet, polite staff and i love the garden!
for me this place looks like Hilton Jakarta in 90s..Gosh, im old!hahaha.
the best egg benedict only in this hotel! trust me..you should try & the fish grill is so fresh! This is great place to stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1706,The best!,50,December 2016,"We stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for three nights, it was not long enough! Stayed in a standard garden room (next time hoping to get the private pool villa - they look unreal)!
The resort itself is stunning! The infinity pool over looking Seminyak beach is incredible! Also having a kids pool attached and another separate pool with a bar. Really caters for everyone!
The staff are so helpful, they treat you like royalty!
The food at the restaurant is also amazing! Buffet breakfast in the morning has everything you could want plus it's cooked to perfection and fresh!
There's nothing negative I can say about the resort as it's a dream place to stay in :)
Thank you to all the staff here, all fantastic!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1707,Birthday surprise!,50,November 2016,"Lovely peaceful stay. Birthday surprise treat.
Attentive, polite staff. Clean and tidy. Very efficient.
Only problem, I had to ask twice for a bedside clock as ours was missing and I had forgotten my phone charger so didn't know what time to go to breakfast!
Would thoroughly recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1708,Great stay,50,December 2016,"It was our first time in Bali and as for Seminyak, the hotel was the best part of it. The staff was incredibly nice and the pool was amazing. We wish we booked for more days at this hotel. We will definily come back once we visit Bali again :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1709,Amazing stay!,50,December 2016,"Staff were amazing, service brilliant. Prices of food and beverage not as cheap as outside the resort, but worth it as the ice is filtered so very safe and coctkails are fab. Food and beverage staff really make you feel like kings.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1710,Bali Beach Run Weekend,40,December 2016,My wife and I had a truly wonderful stay. The resort and grounds were beautiful and calming. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would go back to this resort for sure. One suggestion would be allow for ordering food poolside in the morning - this would have been helpful after our race.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1711,Relaxing,40,December 2016,"If you are looking for a quiet and relax holiday, you might want to try this resort. We took the spa indulgence package which we kinda regretted not because the massages were no good but rather for the price package we paid. If you want to stay here, just book the room and you can get cheap massages outside of the resort. We stayed at The Room Beach Wing just couple minutes to the beach and pool. Excellent wifi connection.
We arrived very late and was raining heavily. At the time of checking in, there was a power failure but was quickly restored.
Breakfast was not bad but nothing to brag about.
Infinity pool was nice facing the beach.
Room amenities were good and they have TWG tea.
There was constantly ""no service"" from my indo telephone provider though wifi was always connected.
We requested for late check out till 4pm and they only offered till 2pm, after that the system charges automatically. Think they can be more flexible since not full occupancy. I've stayed in many hotels which are quite flexible and always get the late check out at no extra charge.
Overall experience is good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1712,PERFECTION!,50,November 2016,"Best hotel in all our vacations. Good service and people , excellent food, awesome rooms, great pool area. Close from everything in seminyak. We spend over a week in Bali in different hotels and we loved this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1713,Great place to stay,50,September 2016,"In September we stays for a few days, the place was amazing, the staff were great, rooms spotless and the pool fantastic.
The breakfast was a good deal and very nice.
Good place for couples as not really child friendly.
l would recommend the upper west wing, great views
Close to everything and the security is a bit daunting but reassuring.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1714,Quiet Haven in Bustling Seminyak,50,December 2016,"I stayed with my 18 and 20 year old children in an Ocean View Suite, the room was very spacious with a beautiful bathroom (large spa bath) and very good wardrobe storage. We loved the balcony overlooking the ocean - a lovely spot to read in the rainy season.

Staff were beyond fantastic, so friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome (particularly Rocky who made such an effort to remember our names and look after us).

Pool area stunning, beach clean, ocean warm and safe to swim. Breakfast fabulous! Coffee excellent - get the French Press!

Location right in the heart of Seminyak was brilliant - especially for young people. Brilliant cafes (try Kim Soo - shop and cafe), restaurants (Merah Putih), beauty spa (Bodyworks) and shops all walking distance.

Hotel security is excellent - always felt safe and secure - the hotel security guards do an amazing job! Can't wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1715,Fantastic,50,November 2016,"Great rooms and amazing hospitality, five star service hands down. From day we entered until the day we left everyone was smiling and extremely polite and helpful.

Adding to that the location of the hotel is literally in the middle of the two main areas of the town. (5-10min walk)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1716,Pure Paradise,50,November 2016,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel for 7 days in a ocean view suite on the 3rd floor overlooking the beach out front.

From the moment we checked in the staff were amazing! Super friendly and helpful.

The room was extremely spacious and not noisy at all. We really enjoyed the balcony and spa that had windows that folded right in so you have a unobstructed view of the ocean from the spa!

Buffet breakfast was a wonderful start to each and every morning of our stay. Very plentiful and fresh.

Room service was also good, Reasonable cost, pretty good selection as well. My fav was the Nasi Goreng.

The infinity pool is stunning! We spent a lot of our holiday in and around the pool and hotel grounds. One night the rain was pouring but it was still hot so we sat in the garden cabanas and ordered cocktails and pizza. It was beautiful sitting with candles after a long busy day on a tour having a relaxing drink,smelling the rain, and listening to the waves crashing out front.

We spent our 2nd night in the bar inside the hotel, we had planned on having one drink and then heading out of the hotel for dinner but after tasting one of the drinks our barman Pius had made we stayed for the whole evening. Nothing was too much trouble and we had a great time trying freshly blended fruits and alcohol in dragon fruits and coconuts! Thanks Pius!

We also thoroughly enjoyed the blessing by the beach conducted by the hotel.

Love the fact it's modern but traditional at the same time.

All the staff are lovely but I'd like to specially mention a few who really made us feel very welcome and happy.

Ryan, Epi, Chi Chi, Pius & Sujana
Thank you!!!

Can't wait to return and stay with your hotel again. Thanks for a very memorable stay :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1717,Highly recommended,40,November 2016,"Excellent facilities, wonderful room, amazingly polite and helpful staff,very clean beach, fabulous location. one minor point - onsite food and drinks over-priced for location, probably explains why hotel bar seemed very empty.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1718,Our Memorable Honeymoon,50,November 2016,"Even though we just stay for one night but we are satisfied of the services. We are glad they prepare something special with our honeymoon. We impress with the services that we haven't find at other hotel. The hospitality is great. They give you the personal touch services that make us feel really special. The breakfast is so nice. They have a buffet menu, and also the ala carte menu. So tasty and great selection food. Thank You All !!! We definetely will come back to Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1719,no title,30,November 2016,"Nice hotel, very central location in Seminyak, but food choices very limited at lunch and snacks. Staff very friendly but our room not restocked with fruit as advertised, and bathroom face towels only replaced for 2 days of our 6 days. All in all a bit old fashioned.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1720,"Wow, wow, wow",50,November 2016,"Our stay at The Seminyak was amazing. We booked a room on the ocean side of the complex, in the main building. Upon arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a suite. The room was huge with a fantastic view of the ocean. The location is perfect, being both on the beach and in the main Oberoi eating/shopping area. Although the Balinese are generally always friendly, the staff at The Seminyak were just amazing!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1721,Bali Holiday,50,November 2016,If you are looking for a relaxing getaway with an opportunity to try some of the most amazing restaurants in Seminyak then this is the hotel for you.

1722,Everything perfect!,50,November 2016,"Everything about this hotel was perfect, the staff were so helpful and genuinely nice and attentive,
The rooms were one of the best I've ever stayed in and the food was 10/10 that was four courses as well as the afternoon tea and breakfast.
The infinity pool sits on the beach with the best of both worlds! Perfect location within walking distance of the shopping and eating out plus great bars!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1723,"Excellent facilities, attentive service, friendly helpful staff.",50,November 2016,"We had an amazing week at this resort - we left our three children at home. So relaxing - best pool Ive ever swam in - so nice to watch the ocean from the pool. Great cocktails, comfy beds, yummy breakfast - highly recommend. November typically wet season - rained overnight a couple of times but only one day out of seven. Resort in a great location next door to Ku Da Ta and walking distance to many great restaurants and all the seminyak shopping.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1724,Perfect anniversary trip!,50,November 2016,"My husband and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for our wedding anniversary and it was wonderful.
The hotel and the grounds are very well maintained. The staff is highly efficient and very friendly.
The infinity pool facing the beach is unforgettable.

My husband organised a surprise for our anniversary and the staff helped him prepare the room (flower petals, jacuzzi with candles, a cheesecake and herbal tea, he thanked them with a gift, but nothing was solicited from him) They went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience and succeeded in that!
We have been recommending them to our friends and family. You can't go wrong if this is your first time in Bali.

Thank you to everyone at the resort that made our trip unforgettable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1725,Beautiful property and friendly staff,50,November 2016,"Beach facing with a gorgeous Infinity pool. It has serenity and yet near to the coolest places to be such as ku de ta and potato head.

The room was clean, big and well maintained.

Staff were very friendly and after a few days they would remember guests by name.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1727,Amazing,50,November 2016,"Staying at this hotel was truly an amazing experience, the staff couldn't have done more for you. The surroundings were amazing with access to yogo during the day, free afternoon tea and many different ways to relax. We stayed here for my friends birthday where they had arranged for a little cake to be delivered to the room with a personalised message and candle. This is definitely a must and right next door to KU de ta restaurant another great experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1728,Beautiful infinity pool,50,November 2016,Lovely welcome with an upgrade to a room with ocean view. Great room with a glas wall to the bathroom with freestanding bath tub. Beautiful infinity pool right on the beach. I love the food you could order from the pool menu. A bit pricey breakfast with gorgeous orange juice. Very pleasant and helpful staff.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1729,Thank you,50,November 2016,"Awesome resort. we stayed for our honeymoon and loved it. Staff are incredibly friendly, you're close to everything and it is so relaxing poolside. I would highly recommend the seminyak beach and spa resort to anybody!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

What a beautiful place to relax on the pool front, the best. Take the rooms seaview and up as garden view is across the street.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1731,Incredible!!,50,June 2016,"WOW! This hotel is absolutely incredible. After a week in the quieter area of Nusa Dua, we were looking forward to a week in what we already knew to be a luxury hotel in Seminyak.

The location is fabulous - right on the beach! So close that the waves sometimes even reach the stunning infinity pool! And less than a 5 minute walk into the very centre of Seminyak. The hotel is so peaceful, yet so close to the hustle and bustle of the town, it really is perfect.

The service is absolutely second to none - all members of staff were incredibly polite, attentive and respectful. They go above and beyond, however, they are in no way overbearing.

Breakfast is amazing - lots and lots of choice on the buffet with cooked-to-order options as well. The room was beautiful too! I couldn't say a bad word about this amazing hotel - I hope to visit again one day!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1732,Our 8 day getaway with junior,40,October 2016,"Perfect location
Service
And value for money .
They team just did everything we asked for . Nothing was to hard .
The nanny service was excellent as well.
We had the opportunity to do things during the day and evening that we would not have been able to do if not for the support of the hotel team .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1733,Perfect Honeymoon!,50,October 2016,"From the second we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and relaxed. All staff throughout the entire holiday were polite and happy.

The room was beautiful and comfortable. It is a very relaxed atmosphere throughout the premises which is great for sunbathing by the pool which overlooks the beach and sea.

It is a five minute walk into the town which is full of shops and bars/restaurants. We stayed for 10 nights and still didn't use half the restaurants available in town.

Dining in the hotel was a pleasure with very attentive staff and a great range of food.

We highly recommend the hotel for a relaxed holiday and Bali/Seminyak has plenty to offer in terms of sight seeing and activities.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1734,Beautiful hotel,50,October 2016,"We stayed in the suite for 16 nights and it was absolutely beautiful. The jacuzzi bath was incredible and we had gorgeous ocean views. The grounds were kept beautifully and you can enjoy some stunning views whilst sipping on delicious cocktails at one of the two fabulous pools.
The staff were extremely sweet and very helpful.
I highly recommend this hotel, the one thing I think could be improved upon is the room service menu and food but other than that it was a lovely stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1735,Wow!!!,50,November 2016,"What a resort. I have only amaxong things to say about this place.We took the garden view villa, definitely better than the seaview villas as they afford mire orivacy. The villas are beautifully maintained with a private pool, outside dining area, complete with expresso machine.The mini var was well stocked with goodies which are on the house ( once u finish the supply they refill and from then on u are charged). Spacious room, lovely bathroom all immaculate and welk maintained. Excellent service, from all the staff,.Breakfast is great with a wide variety and Illy coffee. Free meditation classes each day were a great way to detox. The resort infinity pool faces the sea,the pool is a great size. The resorts grounds are well maintained adding to the overall all feeling of a wobderful five star hotel. Would definitely give this resort my highest recommendations. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay memorable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1736,Astonishing Resort! Worth money spent!,50,November 2016,"I was highly recommended by friend who stayed there before. The resort is incredible and deserve the monies spent.

Details:

Check-in:
Smooth and fast, flower ring, welcome drink and cold towel. Was advised due to renovation I was given an upgrade (yay!) Throughout the stay, could barely notice the renovation they did across the street.

Room:
Huge, clean and tidy. I stayed in the suite with garden view. Huge lounge area and huge bathroom area with two large sink, large shower area and a two-person spa next to it. Offered some tropical fruit upon check-in. Supplied with 6 bottles of water daily. Room serviced twice a day.

Pool:
Infinity pool worth a thumb up. Nice pool area built elevated right next to the beach. You can easily enjoy beautiful sun set from the pool and not worrying about people walking on the beach . Pool is also close to most rooms that we can observe.

Facilities:
Garden sun beds and we could enjoy them without worrying about insects or bugs. I could smell the incense used to keep them away. Same to most other outdoor facilities. I would say The Seminyak has done a good job maintaining pleasant enjoyment in a tropical area.
There is also a glass chapel, which could be used for wedding and romantic dinners at reasonable price in my opinion.
For the travellers, whose tour guide took you to tour other hotels where some celebrities had their weddings in Glass Chapels, etc. I would confidently say that The Seminyak is about the same standard to those resorts, only you won't worry about tourists from entire Bali come and look at you everyday. I feel awkward for people who paid double or triple just to have their privacy exposed to tourists from all over Bali to look at.

Restaurant:
We had breakfast. Little pricey (AU$36.00 pp) however worth the money spent. It offers great variety of food from Balinese cuisine and western cuisine. All food prepared are very tasty and nice. Beetroot juice is a MUST TRY.

Staff:
Staff is generally well trained, helpful and friendly. Very speedy response to the request.

Summary:
Would say it was an excellent experience with The Seminyak. It definitely worth the money spent. If you manage to book in low season or long in advance, I would highly recommend this resort.

Lastly something else worth to mention:
Do not try to use UBER from this resort. There is anti-UBER group stationed in front of hotel. We attempted to use UBER unaware of that. The UBER driver got kidnapped with the phone taken away, and forced to stop there. The group advised me not to use UBER but use the taxi instead. Local guide told me to use Blue Bird Group taxi as it is the only taxi that is regulated and metered. Otherwise the anti-UBER group does not both you. Above is current as of November 2016.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1737,Top hotel,50,November 2016,"Picture perfect with its infinity pool looking over Seminyak. Beautiful hotel with great staff. Not the cheapest but one of the best. If your rate includes breakfast it is fabulous, if not Kimsoo nearby is a great choice.

The hardest part is leaving the pool each day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1738,NICE but could find the same for less,40,October 2016,"This hotel is really clean and nice, but you pay for it. We did not feel like we got the best value here and i suspect if you look around you can find the same for less in the area. We did not have the breakfast included in our booking somehow and they wanted 30 bucks a person for the buffet. Seems a bit excessive. We ended up going into town for every meal, and were not disappointed once. Sisterfields cafe is an amazing breakfast spot. All the restaurants in the area were great. We also booked an oceanview room and if seeing about 3 feet of the ocean between palm trees qualifies then i guess we did get one. Felt a bit misled on this. The pool is nice however there is only one. So we did have a nice time the first few days but then people with kids came. We are not really kids people so being at a 5 star resort with children running around screaming and yelling was kinda a spoiler. The beach here is stunning, just a few steps down from the pool and you are on it. In the early mornings during low tide the views are spectacular.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1739,INCREDIBLE HOTEL,50,November 2016,I have to say this is the best hotel my husband & I have ever stayed in. For us it was the perfect finish to a fantastic holiday. This hotel is the perfect mix of traditional & modern. The position of the hotel is a huge bonus. Walking distance to so many great restaurants & shopping. The pool area is the best & you can choose to sit around the infinity pool or on of the cabana's with virtually your own private area. The rooms are spacious & beautifully set out with so many little extra's thought of. Breakfast is either buffet or your choice from the breakfast menu. Simply a lovely way to start the day. We only stayed 3 nights but you truly feel like you have had a holiday at this amazing resort. We stayed on the oceanside as we were lucky enough to be upgraded without a request. Thank-you to your beautiful staff this is a holiday that I will treasure forever. If you are thinking of treating yourself for a few days don't hesitate to book this hotel.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1743,"Resort living, great location",40,October 2016,"Amazing helpful staff. Great location in seminyak. Close to bars, restaurants and shops. Amazing pool that over looks the ocean and Ku are Ta and potato head only a short walk. Would highly recommend for your drag in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1744,We will return,50,October 2016,The property is of the highest quality beautifully looked after with finite attention to detail. Efficient staff whose only goal is to make your stay a perfect experience. Gorgeous. Cannot recommend the place highly enough,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1745,I will never come back again,10,October 2016,"A lot of bad things to say and nothing good to say

Our room wasn't cleaned else one time in 3 nights

Dirty robes wasn't changed
When the room is cleaned coffee bar wasn't re filled

We booked an ocean view suit but what we got is a view of one tree covering our room",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1746,"Refreshing, restful, reviving holiday",50,October 2016,"We have just returned from our first trip to Bali staying 7 nights at Seminyak Beach Resort. We were treated like royalty in every instance. Our room faced the ocean with a balcony and the beach and pool only steps away. Breakfast was divine, pool loungers or jacuzzi areas were readily available. Attention by staff to greet, serve, clean rooms , desk and bell attention or staff merely saying hello was genuine and do friendly. Would thoroughly recommebd this hotel .. afternoon tea was a bonus and enjoyed.. we were treated to a surprise birthday cake as well. Thankyou very much ...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1747,Best breakfast buffet,50,October 2016,"Came to this hotel for my 5th wedding anniversary and was not disappointed. Arrived at 2am after a late flight and the staff were absolutely lovely and couldn't fault them throughout the whole week. Plenty of smiles and nothing was a hassle.
Breakfast was included in the room and it was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had. Different Balinese and western food as well as exotic fruits, pastries and even sushi. The coffee was so nice it didn't even require sugar (and that's big for me!). As well as the buffet you can order off the menu for different omelettes, pancakes, waffles etc. Amazing!
Beachfront room was impeccable and it was so nice to wake up to the sound of waves as soon as you open your sliding door. Multiple bottles of water are supplied every day.
Pool is amazing and staff super accomodating. The only thing I didn't like is that the swim up bar is seperate to the main pool and not a lot of atmosphere. Probably would have had more drinks if they were together. You pay more at the pool/Resort for food and drinks but this is to be expected.
Would definitely recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1748,5 Stars. Magnificent.,50,October 2016,"Fabulous. Excellent service and beautiful accommodation. Great location. Would definitely stay here again.
We stayed on the beach side which was great. We were on the ground floor with close access to the pool. We didn't experience any noise from other guests. You only need to think of something that you might require and it was provided. Lovely welcome when we arrived at the hotel even though it was 10pm.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1749,Beautiful short stay,40,October 2016,"In my previous post I had mentioned about the bad hospitality of kutapuri. We checked out and booked ourselves at the seminal beach resort and spa. & I think was the best think we did to selvage the trip. This is a lovely property with villas and rooms, situated right at the pristine semanyak beach. The staff is lovely, very service oriented and smiling. The pool extends into the sea for a view, the lawns and corridors of the hotel, resound the sea at all times. It's so beautiful, we were the entire day in the sea, and sat at the lobby for the sunset & back at the beach for early morning walk.
It's in the city, barely two kms away from the main action and good restaurants. And trust me you wouldn't miss the buzz of Kuta, seminyak has enough happening on the streets and has all the lovely Botique shops and restaurants lined up.
We had an enjoyable vacation and a good ending to the Bali trip.
The rooms are 3 storeys. Each room has a lovely ocean view, I think the villa would also be an enjoyable experience. Next time for sure, I will be back here.
Every thing went as expected except that booking.com tricked me again, we didn't get a breakfast inclusive rate. But anyhow, wasn't a big issue. And there was a lizard in my room that the staff was very helpful and tried to get it out, though well no one could find where it went üòÄ
The spa is expensive as compared to quite a few just walking distance from the hotel.
The hotel, beach, pool, service, bathrooms, beds everything makes up for it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1750,One of the bests stays I've ever had!!!,50,October 2016,"I don't know much about the other hotels but I can speak for this one... one of the best hotels I've been so far! The service and staff will do everything you need to make you happy and smile. The best thing is that they are always smiling and this brings me so much happiness inside! I also don't know about the other hotels' pools but this one at Seminyak Beach Resort is AMAZING!!!!! Seriously, you won't regret it. It has the best view and it will bring you so much peace.

The beach right in front of it is pretty good. It's clean and you can swim when there's no red flag.

The breakfast is great, the drinks are great, and everything they offer at the hotel is great. Every single day at breakfast this lady came to us to ask personally how we were doing, how was our stay, if we needed something else.. this type of treatment is so valuable that made our stay even better.

Also, it is side by side to KU DE TA, which you should go watch the sunset there. The hotel can be distance walking from many things. Otherwise, get a cab with taximeter and go explore!

We won't ever forget our 3 days at this paradise. I would definitely recommend you to stay there! You will love it!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1751,Best Trip ever!,50,October 2016,"The Hotel and all their employees will do their best to make your stay as good and as comfortabel as possible, The location at the beach and the wonderful infinity pool make the stay so much better. When we return to Bali, the Seminyak will be our place to stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1752,Beautiful,40,October 2016,This resort is beyond beautiful. The beach is the best we saw it Bali compared to kuta and gili t very clean and not too busy. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The only downfall was during our check in. We were there to celebrate our honeymoon and seminyak was our last stop. When we got there they told us they only had a two single bed room available. There were villas available but we would have to pay 300$ extra per night! After I told the lady we were on our honeymoon and only has a couple days left nothing was done about our room situation. It would have been nice to give us the villa at a lower price. We did not receive anything not even flowers on the bed or anything special for our honeymoon.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1753,A delight to stay in Bali,50,June 2016,"This resort is a real luxury to treat yourself. Great facilities a including infinity pool, gym, and pagolas to relax in. Great buffet breakfast. Great service.
If you can, stay at the main resort. When that's full, they will book the overflow across the road in a building which they also call a part of the resort, but it's just across the road.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1754,PERFECTION!,50,October 2016,My husband and I had the most enjoyable 7 nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort! The staff were absolutely fantastic and we were always greeted with the most genuine of smiles by each and every one of them. The turn down service was such a treat! The infinity pool was magic too & everything about this place was perfection. Will recommend this to everyone we know and hope to come back someday soon. Thank you!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1755,Very nice hotel,40,September 2016,"The hotel is very nice and the personnel really friendly and helpful. However, the hotel is divided into two parts, one at the beach, the other is called ""Garden View"". We stayed at the Garden View part of the hotel. The rooms are nice but the view and noise from the street was a little bit disappointing. Hence I could not rate 5/5.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1756,Good cleaning service for room,50,October 2016,"Your knid staff makes me happy. If I have the chance to visit Vali again, I'd like to choice your hotel.
Thanks to your good service, I can make memorable event with my wife.
But, if spa service in hotel is better than outside service, I am happier. I am sorry about that.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1757,Amazing Hotel and the best place to stay in Bali,50,October 2016,"Most amazing hotel within lush gardens, gorgeous main pool and a breathtaking Ocean View Villa. Waking up every day to see and hear the ocean and have a cup of tea on the day bed was a highlight for us. Not to forget having our own pool to dip in whenever we felt like it while having the most delicious room service meals delivery certainly made us feel so spoiled. The room was always kept perfectly clean and tidy and the night-cap tea tray services was always a warm and fuzzy for the end of a fun filled day. I would highly recommend this Hotel for all its features it offered and for the friendliest staff to look after you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1758,Short but perfect!,40,October 2016,"My partner and I stayed for just a short two nights as part of a bigger trip of Bali. I loved staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. It had great views of the ocean and the sunset, especially from the pool. I loved our private Jacuzzi in our room especially for watching the sunset. The breakfast was great with mixed options. The staff were very helpful and best of all it is only a short 5 minute walk to Seminyak Square.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1759,Excellent,50,October 2016,"It's expensive but worth the money with a beautiful ocean view, infinity pool, and cafes and massages starting right outside the hotel. Almost each and every staff will greet us with warm smile every time. Buffet spread is delicious too. If there's chance to revisit Bali/ seminyak we will consider to stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1760,Our amazing honeymoon,50,October 2016,We stayed here for 9 nights it was absolute bliss could not fault the hotel. Staff were absolutely fantastic a credit to the hotel. Food was beautiful and our room was gorgeous especially the bathroom. One evening we came back to our room to find rose petals in our bath stunning. Would definitely come back. Breakfast was fantastic always looked forward to that as it was a fantastic selection of all foods especially the cooked breakfast. Not only that but they had complimentary afternoon tea from 15.00 to 17.00 that was a lovely little treat. Thank you seminyak for making our honeymoon unforgettable.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1761,"The Great, the Good, and the Ugly",10,October 2016,"We booked the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa after what we felt was an extensive amount of research on Bali.

By all accounts the facilities, rooms, views, staff, spa, security and dining options were said to be 5 Star, but unfortunately this was not the case.
The Resort is 30-45 minutes northwest of Denpasar Airport and north of Kuta the major/chaotic tourist destination for most Bali visitors.

We intentionally booked in Seminyak because it was said to be quiet, peaceful and less dense, for those that have been to Bali, one of the more chaotic places I have been in Southeast Asia, you know this is relative.

We Booked a second floor Ocean View Room and were elated to visit one of our dream destinations (I have been to 61 countries), but unfortunately it turned into a really bad experience because of just a few events.

The Great
The Grounds, rooms, spa, food , views are all incredible.

The Good
The staff for the most part we incredible ‚Äì until we had a problem, then things turned - but for the most part amazing people.

The Ugly
LOCATION and Noise.

Now let me explain we prepaid and booked an Ocean View Room, which did have spectacular views. The issue became two fold
1. The hotel is built on road that has 24 hour traffic. While the hotel has great views and incredible interior grounds the rooms are basically on the street. The noise from the traffic was ridiculous and we asked to move after one night of honking, yelling, engines revving to a quitter room off the street. Except for a select few rooms and the bungalows on the interior property they are all on the street. They said don‚Äôt worry we will move you immediately to one of the quiet rooms (acknowledging this was a problem they had heard before).

2.This is where it gets interesting‚Ä¶so the ‚Äúquiet room‚Äù they moved us next to was next to a very cool and famous bar/restaurant called Ku de Ta. Ku de TA is amazing, and was there well before the Seminyak Beach Resort was built, so I don‚Äôt fault them. It is basically an outdoor club that goes until minimum 2AM every night, playing house music. We could literally watch water in bottles shake with each hit of the bass all night. We tried two nights and didn‚Äôt sleep at all ‚Äì even after surfing and excursions all day‚Ä¶we asked to be moved.
They said we could pay an additional $3000 USD to move to a bungalow or else there was no option. Since we had 5 days left on the trip we asked to get a pro rated refund (subtracting out what we had already used) and we would just head further north - somewhere outside of the urbanized area.

The night manager refused (since we prepaid with a package of breakfast, spa, and room). I then spoke to no less than 7 people over the next two days about my options and was finally told there is nothing they would do, but if I would like a dinner voucher or airport transfer (it was part of package) I could have one‚Ä¶I politely refused.

Because of the way we were treated (I will add I do believe many of the employees cared, and had heard all of this before), the absurd level of noise, the cost of the hotel, and the way it was handled I would recommend not staying here...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1762,Photos don't do it justice!,50,October 2016,"The Seminyak is a beautifully kept resort and in a great location! Prior to our stay we looked at reviews on Trip Advisor and the photos (and The Seminyak website) have failed to do it justice!!

We stayed in a Beach Wing Garden room and the room was spacious, clean and well appointed with views through the garden to the ocean (it is on the beach side of the road) - the bed was great as well! We also recieved 3 bottles of water each per day as you can't drink the water here (expect to buy water where ever you eat).

The surrounding garden areas are immaculate and the infinity pool is perfect with a separate pool/swim up bar which both look out over the ocean. The resort also have friendly security stationed at all entries/exits - a common theme as you walk past all of the hotels.

The buffet breakfast includes everything you could think of from fresh fruits, baked goods, pastries, juices, traditional indonesian sweets and soups, cheeses, cold meats and salads as well as hot indonesian dishes and the standard bacon, mushrooms tomato etc. In addition you can order waffles/muslei/pancakes/eggs which are all made to order (and all included!)

The hotel restaurant/s have delicious menus however prices are comparable to hotels in Australia, with cheaper eats being readily available within Seminyak village.

The hotel also has a small shop, decent gym (with free weights too), money exchange/business centre and spa.

All staff are extremely friendly and nothing is too difficult for them.

We highly recommend The Seminyak and would definitely return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1763,First Bali Experience,50,October 2016,"Amazing experience with such excellent service, the in-room dining experience was incredible and I would highly recommend spending that little bit more for the romantic experience. The room was clean and welcoming as well as the grounds. Spa treatment is a must while you stay, simply the best massage of my life!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1764,Great Holiday,40,October 2016,"Stayed for 10 nights B&B in a Beach Wing room overlooking the sea. Spacious clean room, great bathroom with separate bath to shower. Lots of choice for breakfast and very good.
Staff very friendly. Pool overlooking the sea is a great to cool off in. Would recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1765,Beachside relaxation,40,October 2016,Fantastic place to relax by pool and enjoy the sounds of the ocean. The waves and undertow were very strong when we were there so take care as you can easily be pulled under. The infinity pool is beautiful and watching the waves from there was so relaxing.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1766,Perfect premium beach front resort that has waves,50,October 2016,"Perfect location only steps to the ocean. For me I like to surf while my wife prefers sunbathing and the pool. Overall we had a Suite with Ocean side and views. The room everyday was cleaned. Overall all staff had superb customer service, the team at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa were more than accomodating to our needs. I believe the hotel owners need to give their staff a pay rise.. Definitely it will be my hotel choice for when I visit Seminyak next.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1767,Beautiful hotel,40,October 2016,"Highly recommend this lovely resort having just spent 7 nights here.
The staff, room , pool area are all great. Plenty of sun lounges and a swim up pool bar make spending time by the pool which overlooks the ocean, which is clean and uncrowded, are magnificent.
Laying in bed and hearing the crashing of waves is also a plus. Very little road noise in this resort.

If I had to 'pick' I'd say the food choice by the pool is limited and expensive.
Two alcoholic drinks and a panini will cost around $40 AUD.
You won't find any nasi goreng or sate sticks. More spring rolls and bruschetta, pizza etc.
Breakfast buffet is the usual cereal, pastries, bacon, chicken sausages, yogurt fresh fruit with a separate menu given to order eggs, pancakes, waffles etc.

These a gorgeous wedding pavilion set overlooking the ocean

Overall a lovely place to stay. I love seeing the ocean from our room and being to access the beach straight from the pool.
Staff are friendly and speak god English and are there to help whenever needed. Nothing is too much trouble.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1768,"AMAZING LOCATION, POOL, FOOD AND STAFF",50,October 2016,"WOW! what a place, the rooms and pool were absolutely incredible!! and the breakfast buffet was delicious, staff went above and beyond and made the stay that much more enjoyable. my partner had his phone stolen prior to arriving and when we asked the staff where the nearest police station was they said they would have a staff member escort us and translate for us complimentary given the circumstances, the police station was a 45minute drive and they went at a time that suited us without any hesitation. If you want to feel like a king and queen stay here!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1769,Loved this amazing place!,50,October 2016,"From the amazing service, to the delicious breakfasts to the spectacular infinity pool! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to relax and unwind, couples, friends and family friendly, located right along the beach and close to local attractions",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1770,Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,October 2016,Fantastic service and extremely courteous and helpful Staff. I could not have asked for a better resort. Everything was spot on. The grounds are extremely well kept. Has good security on the front gate. Meals are great and well prepared.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1771,The best hotel we have ever stayed in,50,May 2016,"The second half of our honeymoon was spent here. I don't think we could've picked a better place. The location, the staff, the facilities and the food, all top class.

It's the room we'll remember the most, unlike anything either of us have ever stayed in before. The glass wall between the bedroom and the bedroom was stunning. The high level of fittings and decor was so far beyond what you find in UK hotels. We felt closeted in luxury.

I had let it slip that we were on our honey moon and when we got back to our room later that day we found the bath filled with rose petals.

The next day we found a chocolate cake. Not some tiny gesture, this thing was a choice-aholic's dream.

Seriously, this place was amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1772,Old and tired,20,October 2016,"I had booked the Garden wing without realising it was not part of the main building. So whenever we wanted to use the infinity pool, we had to walk or buggy across the road.
The room smelled musky and the shower area stank of sewer.
On the 1st 2 days, we had to request for the staff to top up the complimentary water and toiletries.
The room was nice but the furnishing seemed aged.
The staff was very helpful though. They helped us with dining reservations etc.
I have stayed at The Legian, Samaya and Anantara and I must say that The Seminyak fared the poorest.
the property really needs an overhaul. Not worth the price they are charging.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1773,Well located with beautiful infinity pool,40,October 2016,Great location on the beach close to shops and good restaurants. In need of some minor maintenance and average food which was expensive. Best to go down the road and eat at amazing restaurants for better value. Best infinity pool in Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1774,Heavenly chilled holiday,50,October 2016,"Really great resort. We walked the strip and checked out the others and couldn't fault it.

Sure the chapel in the middle is super cheese but the rooms, pool, breakfast and staff rock. Really nice feel.

Super central also but quiet in a beach side room

We walked the beach most nights to cool bars and dinner spots.

Would come back for sure",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1775,Refer to below comments,40,October 2016,"Refer to below comments about our stay

We received an upgrade to a suite with beach view which was wonderful however it would be great if the tree tops were pruned in order to see more of the ocean

1776,Perfect stay,50,September 2016,"Really loved staying at the Seminyak beach resort hotel. The hotel was wonderful, the sunsets from the pool were something special and the breakfast was top notch. It was in a great location too; away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and not far from Seminyak Square.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1777,Perfect!,50,September 2016,"This quiet oasis in the midst of Seminyak is superb. Indulgent double room, with beautiful views over the hotel gardens, an infinity pool looking out across the Indian Ocean with the option to stumble onto the beach within seconds, and exceptional service.

The staff at the Seminyak are like none I've experienced anywhere else. Very friendly, and very attentive, they remembered our names and would always go out of their way to assist you the best that they could.

The room was turned down every morning and evening, with the occasional sweet treat appearing in the evening too.

Fantastic experience, and would highly recommend this stunning hotel as your Bali retreat.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1778,Delightful hotel right on Semnyak Beach,50,October 2016,"Comfortable rooms, great service and a terrific location. Within walking distance of some superb restaurants. The breakfasts which were included in the tariff were more than we expected - the selection of food and fruit was really very good and the changes made daily to the buffet were refreshing. You can also order a la cart at no extra charge. The coffees were excellent too, also included in the costing. Would highly recommend this property. Make sure your suite is ocean side not on the other side of the road.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1779,Brilliant spot for relaxing and quiet(er) location; attention to detail and hotel staff service/friendlienwere fantastic,50,September 2016,"A wonderful location on the beach near, but not too near, the hubbub of Seminyak.

Luxury double room in the separate wing - this seemed quieter and had its own pool, though meant we had to walk across the main road to the main area with the 2 pools and breakfast buffet. Room amazing with all mod cons, space, balcony (albeit with limited rear facing view) and spectacular bathroom.Air con almost made the room too cold and didnt seem to be able to change the temperature - so had to turn off on occasions.

Main complex has amazing grounds and lush surroundings. Pools were amazing especially for the sunset, and the beach front is right there for convenience and special walks. Amenities lovely although ordering anything from the hotel itself was as expected expensive. Afternoon was a nice touch although not really much to have there - tea and coffee in that heat is a little bit much.

Breakfast was the BEST. The options available were so wide ranging that one could probably eat there 365 days a year and not have the same thing(s) - a such a variety of options and cuisines, freshly made or baked as appropriate AND an a la carte menu of hot options (eggs, pancakes etc). So so good and a must to get included if visiting.

Staff were excellent - although when we tried to booked a surfing morning, even though the morning was confirmed, no one showed up (the Rip Curl school - don't bother and use the Odyssey one): this was an error at the school end not the hotel. Everyone was extremely welcoming, polite and helpful - even the security guards!

Travelled early September and suspect it was much quieter than earlier in the year - a great place to be able to chill out as well as travel around and/or do activities such as surfing, bodyboarding and baby turtle releasing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1780,"Beautiful Hotel in Seminyak, and Pool on the Beach",50,October 2016,"My friends and I enjoyed a great stay at The Seminyak, which has a beautiful pool right by the beach. The service by the hotel staff was very professional and everyone was always full of smiles (including the security). We love the convenient location to the great food around us, in particular Petitenget Restaurant (10-15 min walk), Kim Soo (5min walk) and Sea Circus (10min).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1781,Honeymoon stay at Seminyak,40,September 2016,"The stay was generally fantastic, the staff very polite and they remembered our names. They turned down the bed every evening and also served tea and some small desserts on the second night we were there.

The pool was a little too crowded at lunch time, but mornings (9am) and night time is empty.

Only complain was that the side of the jacuzzi had cigarette ashes left by previous occupant =( and when jacuzzi is switched on, it let out a funny smell...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1782,Just a sleeping place,20,October 2016,"This hotel is good for only sleeping. The pool is unusable by 10pm which makes no sense keeping the pool bar open beyond that time if you do not like the smell of chlorine with your martinis. Neighbouring beach front hotels have restaurant facing the beach, here the restaurant faces wall, which makes no sense as the hotel is conveniently by the beach. Staff pesters you to drink and eat at the lounge and restaurant which are devoid of patrons. Who would after all since the venues makes you feel caged within walls when there are lovely open beachfront places nearby such as Ku De Ta and Potatohead. Don't add breakfast or airport transport in your booking, they're not worth the prices. Walk to La Lucciola nearby for nom noms and flag blue cabs for moving places.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1783,ON THE BEACH,50,September 2016,"this is what it says ""5 star"" the hotel is on the beach and close enough to the the town bars and restaurants. the staff are very polite and make you feel most welcome at all times. we had dinner in the hotel on the beach front on the first evening and you could not fault it, not cheap but what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. lots of places to eat close by and also a day market to do some haggling in also some cheap eating and drinking local places in a small square next to the local market worth checking out. we stayed in the garden wing over the road from the main hotel but dont let that put you off the garden view rooms are all the same size, if you can afford it a sea view room would be the one but as i said the rooms are all very nice. we used the hotel laundry once (can be cheaper in the town) and i left ¬£500 cash in my back pocket (hic) and it was returned to us asap with great concern from the management (very honest) thank you.afternoon tea is free for all guest and the poolside food is very good. would we return...yes",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1784,Rode way of treating their guests,10,October 2016,"I am a guest at the hotel on my first anniversary and i send the email way back from mid of September and they delay so much with there reply, i asked the that am on my honeymoon and i want you to treat me and my wife very will and make it an forgetting memory, and the reply in real one nights by not allowing our personal driver whom drive us everywhere to enter the hotel and they ask him to drop us in the middle of the night in the street and walk into the hotel. I spoke with there night manager and he laughed in my face saying that we will never allow you to enter the hotel with your personal driver so don't try to convince me. I spoke with there morning manager and I threaten him that i will check out of your hotel for your rode treating with your customers and i will write bad comments in every hotel sites and in TripAdvisor also, he laughed and say do whatever you want we will not allowing you to enter the hotel in the night with your driver whatever you do or threaten us.

I would like for all the guests whom thinking of booking this hotel to change there minds and choose another hotel whom respecting there customer",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1785,As Advertised,40,October 2016,"Just what you would look for in a beach resort hotel. On the ocean, fantastic pool, extremely friendly and helpful staff and a central location where you can easily walk to most places.

The breakfast was extremely good with plenty of food options and good open air location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1786,Blissful stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa!,50,September 2016,"Had a wonderful stay at Garden View Room at the Beach Wing with an excellent access to the pool area and the beach. The rooms were tastefully done with huge bathrooms, must say that the same really had an oomph effect on the entire stay.. The breakfast being served in the garden restaurant made it even more relaxing and joyous experience... The infinity pool area in the evening provided for a perfect set up to sip on some beverages while enjoying the sunset.. Would definitely go there again while in Bali...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1787,Nice and relaxing stayed in the garden view room,50,October 2016,"We stayed in the Gardenview room, My husband and I came here for three nights. Really nice stay great massages!! We booked two massages and they were both great! Staff are friendly, great location, i highly rate this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1788,Great value for money in the mid (A$500) range,50,October 2016,"If you can't afford Ayana, but still want luxury, this is a great choice. The key feature is a beachfront infinity pool.

The beach rooms are have a nice traditional feel (lots of oak) mixed with nice modern features such as large LED TVs, premium bath tub.

Service is friendly, and they are well staffed. Avoid the pitfall of staying in for meals however, as they are poor value compared to some very high quality local restaurants within a 5 minute taxi ride away",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1789,Excellent service,50,September 2016,"Had the perfect start of our honeymoon at this beautiful resort. Fantastic breakfast, the staff were so nice and gave the best service 24/7. Spa was amazing. Beautiful pool area. Would absolutely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1790,Just Beautiful,50,September 2016,"Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel end of August/beginning of September for our anniversary. Hotel is located in the busy seminyak area full of tourists, shops, resorts and restaurants. Greeted straight away by very friendly staff and a nice refreshing drink, check in was swift and we were showed to our room which was on the ground floor, make sure you check when booking that you're room is in the main building and not across the road. Room was spacious and clean. Pool area was clean and tidy with a nice pool garden for those who don't want to be directly in the sunlight. Buffet breakfast was nice with a range of different foods as well as authentic Balinese cuisine, although I didn't fancy eating noodles/rice for breakfast but it looked and smelt great. Infinity pool was very scenic overlooking the beach with a stairway leading straight onto the beach. We weren't all inclusive only had breakfast however no need to go all inclusive or half board here as there are so many lovely restaurants and cafes just outside the hotel. Hotel food is expensive but that's too be expected for a 5 star hotel. Highly recommend visiting Ku De Ta restaurant/club right next door to this hotel which has a chilled out vibe. For a more exciting fun vibe best to go to La Mexicana, great food and reasonably priced, both within walking distance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1791,"Lovely hotel, but stay in the main complex.",40,September 2016,"I spent 10 days at the hotel and got a room in the garden complex. The room was spacious with a lovely bathroom, comfy bed and everything you would expect for the price per night. The breakfast was simply fabulous and I enjoyed it every morning - in particular as the staff was very friendly and really up to their feet. Extras were taken in without hesitation and fulfilled in the blink of an eye. So kudos to the restaurant staff here! The concierge was also very helpful and friendly and I definitely enjoyed my two spa appointments (a massage and a pedicure). The spa is rather pricey but they are a million miles ahead of the many street shops when it comes to mastery and cleanliness.
So why not 5 Stars? After a day or two it became a bit annoying to move over to the main complex for breakfast and to enjoy the great infinity pool at the sea. And second the room was not thorougly cleaned during my stay: bed and bathroom was spotless, but the floor got rather dusty so you could the your footprints all over the room for a couple of days. Would I come back: yes, but would not stay in the garden complex anymore.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1792,Relaxing resort,40,September 2016,"Staff are exceptionally good and the resort is impeccable. Rooms are nice but getting a little tired. The spa nozzles had so much mould we were not keen on using it, especially when I turned the pump on and we got a stench of stagnant water. Otherwise a very pleasant stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1793,Mediocre The Seminyak,20,September 2016,"We were disappointed with The Seminyak and won't be recommending it.

We upgraded to a beach front villa on arrival, after being shown the beach facing room, where the beach could be made out through trees.
I'm sure the beach front villa was stunning a few years ago, but clearly aging now. The plunge pool needed a really good clean. The villa was serviced well daily and overall cleanliness of the villa was adequate.

We dined in the Hotel Restaurant once only, as the meal was expensive and not enjoyable. I ordered a chicken dish, which was presented to the table like something my teenagers would quickly cook themselves, really basic!

The pool bar staff were pretty much not overly interested in serving guests, you had to really seek them out. The actual beach front pool was not what we would call sparkling, full of black spot. We honestly felt it was best not to go under the water.

To top off a very ordinary stay, on our last day, despite the hotel having our luggage in the storage room and is having a car booked through the hotel, they charged the entire room bill to our credit card, before we had even a chance to look over it!! I said surely you know guests need to check these charges!
As it was the car was never booked and we were only
sitting waiting in the foyer.
Very disappointing stay at The Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1794,Can't recommend this resort enough!,50,September 2016,My partner and I have travelled around the world and I must say this is the best resort we have stayed. Good value for money too. The staff was genuinely friendly and helpful. I felt the hotel must have treated them well for them to be in such good mood all the time. In comparison we went to the W hotel for dinner and drinks one night and staff was walking around like zombies and had no idea what they were doing! I think when the staff are calm and relaxed the energy in the resort is also calm and relax which makes the stay very pleasant! Good location too with Ku De Ta right next door and walking distance/short taxi ride to many good restaurants and bars. The infinity pool on the beach was amazing ‚Äì we never had any problems with getting a lounge chair! I would suggest go to the pool later in the day ‚Äì more lounge chairs available and the pool is nicely heated during the day. Their breakfast is not cheap but if you can get it as part of your package I‚Äôd say go for it. It‚Äôs well worth the price tag.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1795,Sublime,50,September 2016,"We were here for our honeymoon and it was absolutely sublime. The staff are there for your every need and some of the friendliest I have ever met, beach is picturesque, shopping a stone throw away and the rooms are amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1796,Highly Recommend,50,September 2016,"We stayed on the beach side of this resort and wow what a resort.
Location was perfect.
The staff were friendly. The place in general was clean and the gardens amazing.
Will had to cut our stay short due to personal reasons and they gave us a credit to come back at a later date.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1797,Amazing,50,September 2016,"Truly amazing! We booked three rooms as part of a family reunion and we absolutely loved our stay there and didn't want to leave. The location, the gardens, the facilities but particularly the staff, who were fabulous. Breakfast is delicious with so much in offer. The breakfast staff are wonderful and they even came and one day they found me to tell me they had just put out more mango and they wanted me to know first! I didn't even realise they knew who I was! What service! We had one unfortunate hiccup which might have resulted in a different review when one of our bookings was not honoured on our arrival. This meant we were forced to compromise the first day because we wouldn't accept a downgraded twin and didn't feel we should have to pay for an upgrade. However, the following day, following a conversation with 'Gloria' and the delightful Sura, the duty manager, we were upgraded to a twin room. This made such a difference to the rest of our stay and in fact we even booked another room for our son and his new wife as a treat for our last night there together. We wouldn't have done this if we hadn't received the twin room which we originally booked. I was sad to leave and would happily return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1798,Amazin staff,50,September 2016,"We stayed her for four nights at the start of our trip in Bali. The staff are amazing, every single one! They are just so polite and helpful. We stayed in the garden wing across the road which really was no issue. It has its own pool and bar and is very quiet if you want a quiet pool day. The main is amazing though as it looks on to the beach.

The food and drink are expensive but that's to be expected. But it is so close waking to so many great restaurants and bars.

The room was massive, really nice and spacious. Only thing is with the air con on it smelt a bit damp but it wasn't too bad.

Would defo recommend staying here for the pool views alone, even if it is for only a couple of days!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1799,Wonderfull,50,July 2016,"I've spent 2 nights of my honeymoon there and it was amazing at the privat villa. The service, the atmosphere the view i loved everything. Special thanks for the cake so delicious . It was an unforgettable days that will always keep it in my heart",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1800,Wedding,50,September 2016,Had our fairy tail wedding in this amazing tranquil resort. Staff were extremely accommodation to all our needs. Everything from the setup to dinner was more than we could ever imagine. Can not wait to get back there next year for our anniversary.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1801,A bit to perfection,40,September 2016,"Magic location, best sea front.
Peaceful and relaxed. Close to shops and restaurant. Price is reasonable compared to adjacent resorts. Room is quite and private. Only improvement is the humidity in the room with some light smell of dump. I believe they should do something with the Aircon for dehumidifying the room rather than freezing only :) but I recommend the place indeed. Nice experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1802,Seminyak Beach Resort,50,September 2016,We thoroughly enjoyed the week in Bali at Seminyak Beach Resort. Service was exceptional and very friendly. Food was good. Pool and Restaurants great. Internet connection was erratic however. We had a great time and highly recommended.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1803,Beautiful beach hotel & outstanding pool & perfect spot for a luxury stay in seminyak,50,September 2016,"Hi Guys, we loved this hotel from the very first impression. The hotel staff is more than friendly and helpful. The room was very beautiful, with a beach view & a great jacuzzi (the only annoying thing was that the jacuzzi needs more than one hour until you can use it). We booked the 75qm room & I think this is perfect for two.

The Hotel area is beautiful and in a very good shape. We loved the breakfast menu, but it's way to expensive (20 Euro p.P.). In my opinion the better alternative is one of the caf√©s in walking distance, there you get a perfect breakfast for the half of the price or even less (i can recommend the organic cafe). That's one more advantage of the hotel. There are so many restaurants and bars in walking distance, that you have a wide range of prices, views, styles etc.

Outstanding for the hotel is the beautiful pool, which is located directly on the beach of seminyak. The hotel staff on the pool is friendly and service orientated but never sales oriented.

To summarize, perfect hotel to relax, explore seminyak & have a nice beach holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1804,Superb,50,September 2016,I stayed in a room overlooking the beach. It was a very peaceful location and hearing the ocean was a wonderful way to fall asleep. The room was top quality and the hotel spa one of the best I've ever been to. The wet edged swimming pool was very pretty alongside the beautifully manicured gardens.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1805,Beautiful Resort and Beach,50,September 2016,"Great stay at the Seminyak Beach resort. Lovely facilities, great back, beautiful grounds.
We found the location to be perfect. We honestly didn't need to leave the resort much.

Note that some of the garden rooms, are actually across the street. They take you over in golf carts and have security who let you in and out and direct traffic. You have your own pool/bar there as well. Not a bad thing, just wasn't aware until we arrived.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1806,Best hotel ever,50,September 2016,"I don't have one negative thing to say about my stay there. Everything - and I mean EVERY SINGLE THING - was great. It is expensive, can't deny it, but it's worth every single penny. Definitely recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1807,Got sick from the food at the hotel,20,September 2016,"The hotel is nice, good rooms and nice people. Just be careful with the food. I got sick from the hotel food and although reported it to the food service manager and eventually the manager, no action was taken to look into it. It surprised me for a good hotel to not take food poisoning more seriously as getting their guests sick ruins their holiday as it did mine.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1808,Must Stay!,50,September 2016,"The 30 hour journey from New York was worth it to arrive at this amazing resort! Thanks to tripadvisor we picked one of the best locations! The infinity pool is amazing just as in the photos looking out to the ocean. Get breakfast included with your stay because it is delicious. The staff is so friendly. We booked beach wing and ocean view because the beach wing wasn't available for the entire stay. Rooms are clean and the ocean view is definitely amazing. The location is great because you can walk into town to get food, drinks, and shop in the market. The local market won't haggle as much as the Ubud market. You can buy sarongs in the pool as locals walk up and down. It's not overwhelming or annoying though. Try to only pay 40,000 Rupiah for a sarong according to some tourists that frequent the area. I'm definitely coming back!

Tips: The minibar is expensive so if you want to save money go to the minimart that's a 5 min walk away and stock up on beer and sodas.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1809,Impeccable Service,40,September 2016,"Can't get much better than the service at this place. We stayed in the garden room wing which was fine. Its outside of the main resort complex but only by about a two minute walk which is what you would expect at any other large resort. Room was super clean and crisp. Great reception staff. Ordered burgers from room service when we came in tipsy one evening, very tasty. Pool and pool bar sufficient and clean in the garden wing. Large pool on beach front is gorgeous. Many other places to chill around the resort and GREAT wifi. Would stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1810,Beyond Fabulous and Authentic! Must-go-place,50,September 2016,"I have been to other luxurious hotels such as Alila or Double-six hotels, but I loved this place the best. The reason is that the facilities and surroundings are not only impeccably managed but also, it still has authentic quality that makes you FEEL you are in Bali in addition to luxury. Service was fantastic, the room was beauuuutiful, the pool right at the beach as well as the free yoga classes or afternoon tea/coffee were just PERFECT. Very authentic and beautiful place that makes you feel the nature as well as the luxury. Especially if you are couple, I recommend this place 200%",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1811,love this place!,50,September 2016,"We stayed at the resort for our honey moon and loved it so much that we will be back next year! Perfect location, so close to the best restaurants,shops and activities.
The staff go out of the way and beyond. We were upgraded to a suite which was such an amazing surprise the room was absolutely stunning!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1812,Loved this hotel!!!,50,September 2016,"We loved everything about our stay!! The service was perfect and the resort was beautiful. We stayed across the street in the Garden rooms and absolutely loved it, we basically had our own private pool. The hotel is in a perfect location, and we walked to lots of amazing restaurants, bars, and shops. Can't wait to come back!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1813,Good hotel with small drawbacks.,40,September 2016,"Good hotel, not the typical Balinese style with very courteous staff. Very good breakfast with plenty of choice. It is close to many restaurants and shops that are ideal for shopping and going out. The airport is about 45 minutes.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1814,Thank you,50,September 2016,"We were here for part of our honeymoon and we adored everything absolutely everything about the hotel. From the warmest of welcoming check in, the smiles, the flowers upon arrival, the WOW pool our room. For our room we recieved best surprise gift of our honeymoon, they upgrade our stay from the suit to the Villa. The congratulations dark choclate cake was very delicious too. Seminyak Beach Resort, you've made our stay unforgetable for the rest of our life. No doupt, we will be back here someday or anniversary perhaps. Love you & Thank you.
What",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1815,Great View Pool but Too Expensive,40,September 2016,"The pool view is really Great but the room is not that Great.
The service is also Good but not Excellent if considering the expensive price.
My overall opinion is that the Resort is Great but Expensive.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1816,Very nice,40,September 2016,"A great hotel which offers an escape from the busy area of Seminyak. A wonderful long infinity pool overlooking the sea, amazing sunsets, fantastic food, great service, lots of sun loungers.
I have only one frustration and that is the accommodation in the 'garden block' which is actually not on the main site, its situated across the road. It has some benefits though i.e a small pool and pool bar which is quiet and private but the hassle factor of not being on the main site was initially annoying but we got used to it. Some advise - check where your accommodation is situated before booking and perhaps ask for a discount if you find you are across the road.
The gym could do with a rowing machine and is not exactly private. It has glass walls, so slightly off putting when you see guests walking past when you are drenched in sweat :)
Teh wine is very expense. I wrongly presumed that we would find good Australian wine at good prices. It was more expensive than a central London bar (including room service) for a glass of wine.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1817,Lost in paradise,50,September 2016,"Lost in paradise is not only the name of a delicious drink at this hotel but also sums up our stay at the resort!! The staff goes above and beyond, extremely friendly. Centrally located to many other bars and restaurants but the food at the hotel is very good too. Buffet breakfast have so many food options. The infinity pool over looking the ocean was pure bliss.....Can't wait to go back and visit. It's definitely more of a couples or family resort which was perfect for us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1818,Paradise personified,50,September 2016,This resort was enchanting... beautiful ..more than we could have ever hoped for.. the staff especially the manager Sigoff was exceptional. The breakfast was amazing with so many delicious choices and we hope to return one day in the future..Five stars to the seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1819,Picture Perfect for a Wedding,40,September 2016,"Went for a wedding as guest. The ceremony was held in the chapel next to the infinity pool, and the reception was in the beachfront garden next to the pool area with huts. The sunset view is so beautiful both in the chapel and at the infinity pool. This is definitely the picture-perfect place to have the wedding.

Nothing exciting about the food, below my expectation for a fine dining banquet, and now I can hardly remember what I have had that night except the mini tapioca pudding dessert.

Staying in private villa is nice, which has small private pool and all the amenities you need. The staff are very professional, and meet the 5-star standards.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1820,Beautiful hotel and grounds,50,September 2016,"We stayed here just for one night but had a great time! The pool area is gorgeous and the beach area is a long stretch in which you can take long walks. It is safe for surfers but a little too strong to swim in. The breakfast was Amazing! We also lucked out because there was a baby sea turtle release while we were staying there that we got to take part in. There are some beautiful spots to sit and have a drink and watch the sunset. Great location too, walkable to a lot of bars and restaurants and shopping. Staff is very friendly! Would highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1821,The Perfect Wedding at the PERFECT RESORT,50,September 2016,How the title states!!! The perfect Wedding at the Perfect Resort. We couldnt have asked for more. Our wedding consultant (Monika) at The Seminyak was outstanding to say the least. We cannot be happier with how everything turned out. The Villas and the Ocean Front Rooms were superb to say the least. Morning Breakfasts were unreal. Basically we were speachless leaving this place and was the hardest goodbye we had to say for the whole trip. We are coming back for our 1 year anniversary.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1822,Beautiful property with lovely staff,50,September 2016,"I had a fantastic and relaxing stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The staff was welcoming, the room was beautiful, and the facilities were quite impressive. I went to the spa on the last day of my trip and wished I'd gone every day - really nice jacuzzi area that makes up for the small gym. The price is high, but I loved it and would do it again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1823,"Good marketing, didn't really meet my expectations",30,September 2016,"Unfortunately from the moment that I arrived this hotel was below my expectations. The images on the website portrayed it more luxurious than it was and I was expecting better ocean views and to be closer to the ocean than we were, particularly for the price we paid. The service wasn't as good as I have experienced in other Bali hotels and the food quality also wasn't as good either. The bar facilities were also a bit unusual and lacking in atmosphere.

The best part of the resort is the pool and we really enjoyed the yoga glasses, particularly from the Pavillon with ocean views. Overall the staff were very friendly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1824,'Dirty Sock Syndrome',20,September 2016,"After traveling along the world for many years, we've seen all the places... The last three weeks we were in Jakarta, Gili Trawangan, Lombok, Komodo and Bali and stay in the best resorts.
The Seminyak Beach Resort was one of the worst resorts. Very bad value for money!

We booked an expensive garden wing room, and these are NOT in the main building. The rooms are across the street in a separate building.

When we try to book an upgrade to the main building, they say it takes several hours for the room is ready.

Our garden wing room (5207) smells very musty (mildew?). It's like a ""Dirty Sock Syndrome"" from an air conditioner. After a few hours you feel ill.

The afternoon tea was great with very good food and snacks. But after that there was live music at the beach.
80% of the guests at the beach were between 25 - 40 years, and the band plays 'French chansons' and the Love Boat genre...

Every time you order something, it takes 10 to 15 minutes minutes before it is served, because the bar is so far away??

I have my own business, so I need to do some work in the evening, but that's not possible because the wifi is so slow.
WIFI was totally unusable !!!
When you managed to connect it was so slow I couldn't even load my facebook, let alone make calls through skype as i need to when travelling internationally.

Overall experience was poor for a 5 star hotel and the customer service (the girls!) in the garden wing also. Security guys and bartenders are doing fine. Great job!

The breakfast is very very good! Superb

We initially wanted to stay longer, but after these experiences no longer...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1825,Very nice infinity pool,30,September 2016,"We paid around ¬£330 for one night at a beach wing room which included breakfast. For the price I think I was happy to spend a night there but I would probably not repeat my stay.

They've got an amazing beach-front infinity pool which makes it worth a visit. The food that we ordered from the poolside was alright. I have had much better food at other resorts.

The service was good and friendly and resort was very pretty but I found it not easy to really relax there. There were two issues with our room - the bathtub did not drain very well and there was an unpleasant odour from the shower drain which we could not understand.

Overall we had a good time but for the price I don't think we got what we were expecting. The pool is definitely very nice though.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1826,Good not great,40,August 2016,"5 star hotel with all the amenities and a beautiful pool. I enjoyed the stay in the suite but the ""oceanside"" is no where near the ocean and the taxes and costs on site of the hotel were extremely high for instance drinks, breakfast and massages were quite overpriced",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1827,Perfect stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort,40,September 2016,"It was our first time at this Bali resort and return in the future.The staff service was excellent, always polite and warm, never failed to smile and greet on every occasion!
It was a short 3 nights break, stayed at the garden wing which faced the quiet villa surroundings, away from the main road. The main infinity pool view facing the beach was just awesome, the pool surroundings very well managed and the pool was a decent size with 2 separate locations.
The daily breakfast consisted of buffet spread and ala carte egg and healthy breakfast orders. I found the hot items lacking in variety that could be improved. Aside from that, it was a fabulous stay and with the hotel located centrally in Seminyak , you will never be bored or hungry being minutes away from the attractive shopping and F&B outlets!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1828,Great Location,40,September 2016,"If you're looking for a resort on the beach amazing pool and walking distance to the fabulous restaurants in Seminyak then this is ideal. Rooms and amenities are great, friendly staff and very helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1829,Great place to chill out and totally relax!,50,September 2016,"This was our second visit to this hotel and we loved it as much the second time as the first. We splashed out and stayed in the beach wing rooms this time rather than the garden wing. The garden wing rooms are situated across the road from the hotel in s separate building. The rooms on both wings are the same but we preferred looking out onto the garden rather than the road. The rooms also appeared lighter.

The rooms are nicely furnished, very clean, comfy beds and pillows. The sheets and towels were good quality too!

Breakfast is great with so many choices. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant in the evening as there are so many restaurant choices in Seminyak.

The staff are extremely professional, helpful, friendly and always greet you with a smile and a hello - something I always appreciate. The service is good.

The grounds are beautifully maintained and the infinity pool right on the beach is the icing on the cake.

This is a really great hotel and we hope to visit again in the future for another week of R&R!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1830,Fabulous hotel!,50,September 2016,"The staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Beauitful grounds and great location. We will definitely come back and stay again at the seminyak. The second building was lovely and felt very much a part of the resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1831,Wonderful relaxing vacation,40,August 2016,"We spent 12 nights with 2 adults and 2 kids in the hotel. The rooms are very nice, service is great. We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.
Special highlight is the infinity pool directly at the beach side.
One needs to know that the Garden Wing is seperated by a street from the main pet if th hotel. You might want to chose it if you expect a very quiet stay.
The Beach Wing is towards the large garden and beach.
Prices for drinks and delicious food are rather high.
In the afternoon the hotel serves a complementary tea and coffee time with some sweet and salty snacks.

We only can recommend the hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1832,Excellent Hotel!,50,September 2016,"The hotel was one of the greatest parts of my stay at Seminyak. The views, the cleanliness, the food, the pool, the staff were all top notch. They have a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach which was an amazing view! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I recommend having their breakfast buffet which was incredible. I highly recommend The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1833,Magnificient stay at the Seminyak,50,September 2016,"We really enjoyed our 6 nights at Seminyak beach resort & spa in beach wing room. The hotel is located in the center but in a calm corner near kudeta. The pool is breathless with the view on the indian ocean.
The staff is clearly what this resort has the most as they are very kind, very helpful.
If you're staying at Seminyak, i would recommend you this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1834,Amazing place! Great staff!,50,September 2016,Amazing place! My boyfriend got extremely ill with fever on the first day! The staff could not have been more helpful. The onsite medical team made a difficult time as easy as possible. The staff did everything in their power to help make us as comfortable as possible. Really recommend. Beautiful location and place as well,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1835,Glorious,50,September 2016,"We had an ocean view suite, with great views, the staff and people were extremely good with high levels of service. It was tranquil and simply lovely. ""The piece de resistance"" was the infinity pool, where you could see the pool flow into the ocean waves it was something you could never get bored at. People would simply walk around the pool and read books it was outstanding. Around the pool was pure pleasure where you were looked after like family. It was very close to Nirvana",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1836,"Upmarket, great facilities, location and a service!!",50,September 2016,"My wife and I booked in here for a short break and were not disappointed. We had a ocean side room which is generously spaced with a decent size balcony on the top (3rd) floor. The resort is not huge but certainly big enough to have all the facilities you would want and at a very high standard. The location is AAA within 500m of local vendor markets, Seminyak Square, plenty of the best Bali restaurants and on the beach, next to Ku De Ta.
The breakfasts are great and the beachside restaurant is worth a sundown dinner too.
Would stay here again for a couples break.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1837,Looking for paradise? You will find it here!,50,May 2016,"We did lots of research before we booked the hotel and it did not disappoint. We were met from our taxi to a flower lei, it was such a nice touch. We checked in and had an issue with our room. Twin beds instead of a double. (Turns out my partner booked us in to a twin by accident) anyway the hotel sorted it out quickly even though it wasn't their fault! The manager who dealt with us was professional and friendly and couldn't change our room as the hotel was fully booked! However he sourced a double bed from a show room, and they put the twin beds in the show room. Really thoughtful and so helpful. All of the staff were lovely and they really do make the experience at the hotel amazing.

The room was spotless and had lots of little extras. The beds were comfy and the room was cleaned daily. There is a mini bar with prices that can be charged to your room and room service available to be charged to your room. The room service menu is good and the food is lovely! We were in the garden wing across the road from the hotel, these are the newest rooms and are in a separate building to the main hotel. This was not an issue at all, and it didn't change our experience at the hotel at all.
At the garden wing there is another pool and bar which was empty most of the time, it was a really nice and relaxing.

The main pool was amazing! Absolute paradise and everyday I didn't want to leave! There are beds and umbrellas. There is waiter service for drinks and pool snacks to be charged to your room. When you arrive at the pool you are supplied with a towel and that is yours for the day by the pool. It's a really good system as no one can reserve beds early in the morning. Every time we went to the pool (8,9,10,11 or even after we have been out in the morning and after dinner) we never had an issue getting a bed by the pool. We travelled their in May.

The breakfast is really nice! On the buffet there is a selection of fruit, cereal, cakes, Indonesian cuisine, sausages, bacon, fruit juices and toast! Then there is a menu for ordering eggs or waffles. Poached, scrambled, fried, omelette, waffles, pancakes, french toast. I loved the poached eggs and always had fruit to start. You can have coffee and tea or water. We always enjoyed breakfast and it's open till 10.30.

The main restaurant (same as the one that serves breakfast) also does lunch and dinner. This is Asian food and it's so nice! We only ate here once as we wanted to go out and explore Seminyak but the meal was lovely! We had spring rolls and then salmon and steak. It was really good but quite pricey compared to the restaurants on the main road of Seminyak.

The pool snacks are very pricy and we didn't enjoy them as much as the room service and the meal at the hotel restaurant. The pool snacks could be improved but it's no big issue as you can eat in the restaurants if you want to as well.

There is also a smaller restaurant near the pool that serves Western food such as pasta, steak, chicken, salad etc and this is lovely! Really enjoyed the food from here.

While at the hotel we paid to attend a special moon party at the hotel. This included food, dance show and a lantern we can set off on the beach and make a wish. The food was a buffet and we tried loads of different food. It was a good night and we enjoyed it.

We also visited the spa and it was good. We are quite spoilt as we went to a lovely spa in Mexico last year and were disappointed this one wasn't as good. When there are so many cheap massage places in Seminyak that offer good massages, I am unsure why you would pay more for the spa at the hotel. It is quite a lot for the hotel spa then the ones in the centre of Seminyak. We were disappointed we paid so much for a massage when we could have walked down the road and got a similar one for ¬£40 cheaper!

Overall this hotel is amazing and we would 100% recommend! Lovely staff, clean, ideally located and amazing hotel! Book now!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1838,Perfect in every aspect,50,August 2016,The hospitality of the hotel staffs as well as the hot breakfast to chose from their menu list amazing and beyond my expectations. The proximity to the beach and the view from the ocean front pool of sunset was priceless advantage to stay here. Their location is also wonderful with a few minutes walking distance to the main street of Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1839,Amazing! Such genuine hospitality!,50,August 2016,"I have never experienced hospitality quite like this before! (Even though my husband works in hospitality in London!) Every single staff member is genuine, friendly and contributes to the wonderful culture at this hotel. We loved everything about our stay and our room was perfect but it was the staff that really stood out for us. We stayed in 2 other hotels during our trip to Bali (including 2 nights at the Viceroy for a treat) and we can honestly say that the Seminyak surpassed both in terms of service. Thank you so much for such a special holiday! We will certainly be recommending you to friends and will be back soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1840,Great beachfront hotel in Seminyak !,50,August 2016,"If you are looking for a beautiful beachfront hotel in the quieter parts of the Kuna-Legian-Seminyak beach, look no further !
This hotel is within a few minutes walking distance from the shops & restaurants of Seminyak, with a beautiful infinity pool right next to the beach.
There's a vast green garden, the restaurant serves excellent food with a very friendly service (like is always the case on Bali !)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1842,Fantastic Place,50,August 2016,"Good place, clean, lovely staff, beautiful SPA.
The swimming pool it's a real plus. The beach is very long, so you can take long walks on the shore The only flaw is that it's no possible to sunbathing on the beach because the sea has many weave.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1843,Great relaxing escape,50,August 2016,"Excellent experience with everything you may need during a great holiday.
Great buffet for breakfast with local and international things to taste and huge selection of tropical fruit.
Really recommended",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1844,Sunset infinity pool bar & stargaze,40,July 2016,"Been to seminyak resort for honeymoon, which is really close to the main tourist street with lot of restaurants and shopping stores.
The pool bar has to be mentioned here.
The infinity pool with bar overlooking the ocean is the best spot to be for the sunset.
The premises is very neat and well maintained and they have got evening free snacks which was another relaxing time. Night start gazing on their lawn is a wonderful experience.
overall it has been a lovely experience. The food was good with all varieties and very warm welcoming staffs.

Best wishes to the team who made our stay memorable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1845,Amazing Honeymoon,50,August 2016,"The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa was truly a great experience. We stayed in an Ocean View room. They offered us an upgrade to a private villa with its own pool. We opted not to upgrade and were glad we didn't upgrade because the view of the ocean was much better from the ocean view room we stayed in. Not all Ocean view rooms are made the same here. Some come with better, clearer views. They gave us a room with a perfect complete view of the ocean. The staff was very warm and welcoming at all times. It was a real treat to stay at this hotel. I looked at a lot of Hotels (The Oberi, The W, etc..) before deciding on this one. Yet, I must say that this resort beats the rest by meeting our needs of having a great location, traditional Balinese influences, and being right on the beach. The Oberi's location is not as great as this resort's and as for the W. Some people may like the W better than this resort. But my wife and I certainly do not. The W is way too crowed and modern for us. The Seminyak has a great mix of modern and traditional Balinese architecture. Moreover, it's infinity pool beats the W's pools hands down in my opinion. Most importantly, there are a number of great quit places for couples to be together next to the pool at the resort. On Thursday nights there is also the opportunity to watch a Balinese dinner show the hotel offers. The dinner and show was great if you are interested in experiences traditional Balinese culture. The staff also, helped us book a snorkeling, parasailing, and flying fish water sports package. From the moment we arrived until we left we throughly enjoyed the resort. They even give guests a necklace of flowers upon arrival and they gave us a small congratulations cake for our honeymoon. The only issue I had was that I found ants in our bed a couple nights. I don't know where they came from. We certainly weren't eating in bed. However, despite this, the resort was truly wonderful. Thank you Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for helping contribute to our great honeymoon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1846,Honeymoon,30,August 2016,"I was on my honeymoon with my wife and we stayed at the seminyak beach resort for 4 nights. We did 3 nights before in Ubud, which was amazing! Was very disappointed with this hotel, as the room we was given was on the balcony next to the main road. They was alot of sounds of cars and people during the day and evening. We did ask to be moved, as we wanted some peace, as we were on our honeymoon. They didn't move us! We asked to upgrade, they offered silly prices. I had already paid daft price for this hotel, so it looks like the agent took there cut, but be very careful when booking through hayes jarvis, all they want is there commissions and forget about there customers! I would be careful when booking your room, as it could be on the beach side or on the main road view, not nice when you come from a 5 star villa pool in Ubud!! To try and be positive, they had a pool view, which was open to the whole hotel, and view of the beach and sea. But again the room we was in, was across the road from the main hotel, which we had to cross the road everyday to get to the main hotel entrance and then walk through the hotel to get to the pool! Only thing we was given, was a small cake saying happy honeymoon, same cake they use for anyone's birthday or any type of celebration!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1847,Excellent,50,September 2016,"Very comfortable, well located, near the Main Street in Seminyak and next to Kudeta. The staffs are so helpful and smile all time. Great breakfast with big fruit variety, and the infinite pool, are the best things here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Excellent buffet breakfast and delicious choices on the dinner menu. Friendly helpful staff who were happy to help in any way they could.

1861,service with a smile,50,August 2016,"fabulous hotel - the staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. location is great right next door to KU De Ta and right on the beach. We had a suite which was really large and luxurious - the only down side was that although one side of the room had an ocean view, the room backed onto the road so was noisy at night. Ask for a room away from the road. The only other negative is that we paid extra for a suite with a spa bath but the water ran very slowly it was impossible to fill the tub up! so we never got to use it! The 2 negatives wouldn't put me off staying at this hotel again we thought it was really lovely and definitely one of the best we have stayed in Bali",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1862,Amazing!,50,August 2016,"Resort was beautiful, not too large. The grounds were very well maintained. Rooms were lovely, although a little dark.

1868,Great location,40,August 2016,"Hotel is well located to restaurants, beach bars, shopping and the beach. All in walking distance or short taxi ride.

Hotel grounds are well kept, great service from the staff. We had a few issues at first but the staff did all they could to rectify these issues.

We stayed in the rooms/building across road, I would recommend asking for a room not facing the main road due to the noise we experienced (before we requested to moved).

Fantastic pool...highly recommend watching the sunset here. It was quite amazing. The gym was quite small.

Breakfast had a large variety, we did not eat dinner in the restaurant as there are so many fabulous restaurants on offer in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1869,Amazing pool,40,August 2016,"The pool in itself is worth going to The Seminyak, it was just beautiful~ KuDeTa is right next door but we didn't even need to go. I hate crowded places and waiting for things, so staying here (for us) eliminated the need to go to KuDeTa, Patato Head, or other beach clubs. We stayed on the beach wing.. the room, although a bit small was sufficient. Breakfast was a vast spread, but to be honest nothing stood out, apart from the french toast. Service was ok, what you would expect at such hotel. Overall, I would go back just for the pool, but other than that nothing really stood out compared to other hotels of the same class.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1870,Very poor resturant,40,August 2016,Had tea last night at resturant food was served up cold taken away re heated came back there was no spice taste at all qaulity of seafood very bad would not eat there again 3 times price of good food outlets just outside gate.staff were very good out of 10 i would give it 3,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1871,Great location and setting,40,August 2016,"The grounds are gorgeous and beautifully maintained. It's right on the beach so you choose a day by the sea, by the main family pool or the more relaxing garden pool. The hotel is quiet and doesn't seem busy which is great. The rooms are spacious and, I suppose, a little tired in places but not grim in any way! It is very expensive though. Dinner in the main restaurant was a lot - especially the wines. Poolside service is a cool touch but you pay considerably for it! I appreciate a nice hotel = high prices but when you consider how cheap food and drink is for the locals, it's a bit steep. All the staff are helpful and polite and the breakfast is vast - my husband reckoned the best array he'd seen.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1872,Perfect,50,July 2016,"It was our Honey Moon trip, first time in Bali.

Will be back for sure!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1874,Excellent place to stay in Bali,50,August 2016,"In the very busy Seminyak, an hotel that is of the right size (a little more than 100 rooms) and well located a little off the busiest areas. Rooms are large, well equipped and beds are extremely comfortable. Breakfast buffet is great, as well as afternoon tea. Restaurant are OK but it is probably better to eat outside in the great places recommended by the hotel staff. All the staff is helpful and very dedicated to providing excellent service. I definitely recommend it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The staff were amazing and so accommodating to our every need.

1877,great hotel resort,50,August 2016,"been here last week for 5 days. I usually don't love spending time in resort, I rather go to the beach, but this place is just amazing. The pool is just right on the beach, great and very friendly staff working here. Pool food is good. Buffet breakfast is amazing, I am pretty boring having just muesli fruit and juice but the buffet it's so big, there is anything you need, from eggs on toast to indonesian food, curry, rice, pastry and cakes, 10 different type of fresh fruit and 4 juices. Also the spa is great, had massage there, probably the best I had in Bali, great experience. Our room was just fantastic, ocean view, shower and spa with window ocean view, balcony. The resort is just 2 min walk from the ku de ta, great spot for sunset drink; very good restaurant and shops just 10/15 min walk or few min by cab!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Pool was fantastic.. breakfast was very nice. Happy to stay there.. next time, I'll be back with my future wife. Thank you The Seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

None the less I wanted to let myself for my 40th and the staff did an amazing job to make it great . An upgrade to a suite and a birthday cake surprise at dinner . Furthermore they had a cultural night on my birthday which we booked and we go to light up lanterns on the beach which was a first time experience .
If you love your breakfast the choice is endless and you will love it . Buffet and a la carte option also . Free WiFi too . Also walking distance to Ku De ta bar and Seminyak square.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

1882,'This Slate Has Soul!,50,August 2016,"I spent the first three nights of my fortnight holiday at The Indigo Pearl. In between my travels it was rebranded to The Slate, keeping in line with its rich history of the Tin mining era. I fell in love with the resort so much that I ended up booking a room to use for the day prior to my departure night flight!
I've been fortunate to travel a lot and this resort is at the very top of my list. It has a beautiful ambience and the resort grounds are nothing short of spectacular. It oozes class and a sophistication rarely seen, it's a true 5* property. The slate offers warmth and breathes a beautiful soul, I've never been so relaxed whilst staying there, when I arrived for the 2nd time I truly felt like I'd returned home!
My only regret now is that I did not stay there for my entire holiday. Next time I will not make the same mistake twice!! Once you're experienced it you will not want to be anywhere elseüòä A big thank you to 'The Slate' for making my last day in Thailand a Magical Experienceüòäüòäüòä",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1883,Amazing Stay...beautiful property on Seminyak Beach!!,50,August 2016,"My girlfriend and I just stayed here last week during the first leg of our vacation. It was the perfect way to start the trip. The rooms are spacious and it doesn't look like there is a bad spot on the property! The pool is by far the most amazing from what we saw on Seminyak Beach when we took walks up and down Seminyak. The staff are all so kind and helpful with anything and everything. I recommend getting the breakfast each morning. It's buffett style but gourmet and is well worth the extra $15 per person, per day. The food is better than other breakfast places we tried around town and there is so much variety.

Location was great as well. We liked that we could walk everywhere and not have to be in traffic if we didn't feel like it because day trips can take it out of you. We are beach people so it was great to be able to enjoy the infinity pool on the beach, surf, swim, and enjoy cocktails!! Excellent stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1884,Absolutely womderful,50,August 2016,"Staff customer service is great. Balinese massage was the best I've had.

Room was ocean view suite very clean spacious and huge with amazing bathroom so comfortable",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1886,Great Spot to Stay,50,August 2016,"Fantastic spot to relax, great food, view and facilities.

Local area has heaps of quality bars and restaurants with in short walking distance and quality shopping as well without being hassled like you would in Kuta.

Pool and beach facilities are also great with daily activities like yoga, surfing and afternoon tea to keep everyone happy",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1887,Beachfront location within walking distance of the shops & restaurants :),40,October 2015,"The hotel is ideally located away from the town centre so that it peaceful and relaxing yet close enough to the many shops, bars & restaurants of Seminyak.

The walk into town takes approximately 10 minutes. My wife and I found the area to be safe and had no issues whatsoever with the roads being busy or difficult to cross.

The hotel grounds are quite luxurious. There are two pool areas (both amazing), one is exposed and the other offers some shade in case you want to get out of the sun for an hour or two. Both ""infinity pools"" are have direct views over the beach/ocean and are a great place to grab a cocktail and watch the sun go down.

As you would imagine the hotel has direct access onto the beach. There are a couple of surf shacks close by where you can rent a board and enjoy the Bali Surf.

As you walk along the beachfront you will naturally see the other hotels that you were considering and hopefully (as I did) come to the conclusion that the Seminyak Beach Resort has been an excellent choice.

I was in contact with the hotel a few weeks before arrival and arranged a taxi transfer from the airport to the hotel - The taxi driver (Sammi) was a top guy and we ended up using him for our onward trip to Ubud and again from Ubud back to Denpasar.

The rooms are modern and extremely clean with all the facilities you would expect from a hotel of this standard. The staff were really friendly and always on hand for when another Cocktail or Bintang was required :)

The hotel really has no negatives, it does everything rather well and gets a strong 8/10 from me and the Mrs.

My only criticism/advice would not be about the hotel but Seminyak it's self.

It's essentially a coast line densely packed with modern hotels and doesn't omit much of the Bali vibe that you will be expecting or have seen in the brochures.

Don't get me wrong, it was the perfect start to our trip but i'm glad it was just the start and that the best of Bali was yet to come........

We stayed at the Seminyak Beach resort for 3 nights which was just right.

1888,"Utterly charming, so pleased we chose here",50,August 2016,"The hotel is much more lovely than its website photos suggest. Rooms are really well appointed, we had an Ocean View suite with a jacuzzi bath which had floor to ceiling windows you can open, bliss. Staff are all very sweet and nothing is too much trouble. Menu choices are extensive and well executed. The spa was great - we tried several treatments and all were great. Highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1889,Delightful and divine!,50,July 2016,"The beachfront infinity pool is to die for! The hotel service is excellent and the hotel grounds too beautiful. The rooms are spacious, and very upmarket.
I would definitely recommend if you want something special, luxurious and decadent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1890,Good stay,50,August 2016,"We liked the pool area particularly . Generous balcony with view comfortable bed and pillows. Staff very friendly! Generous afternoon tea only had food at the pool, which was excellent! The restaurant is in a weird location , we did not use it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1891,Amazing,50,July 2016,"Amazing resort - beautiful rooms and gardens. Breakfast is delightful. Clean, well kept and a wonderful environment. Swimming pool and facilities are breathtaking. Staff are exceptionally polite and attentive. A super place - can't wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1892,"Nice hoel,Great Location",40,June 2016,"Seeing all other reviews on this hotel already mirrored my feelings for our stay in June 2016. Best buffet breakfasts . One advice for when you first come to the hotel: either leave your carry ons w front desk or give most of your luggage to porter. They literally walk you to the pool amd point out the grounds,etc....As we had just driven from airport and i had a little bag, it was a little tiring to walk around in the heat w that bag.
Only a tiny issue but i wish i had thought of leaving it w front desk!!!
Everything else is perfect...Location is superb,close to everything yet also secluded from all the craziness...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1893,Mind blowing,50,August 2016,"One of the best trips ever. It was my wife's birthday and we got a surprise upgrade. Staff is extremely nice. Location is great next to kudeta and sea circus. Infinity pool is very relaxing and rooms are spacious,",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1894,"Great location, hotel garden grounds and pool",40,August 2016,"Loved the pool right on seminyak beach and the serene garden grounds. Very helpful and friendly staff. Particularly Retna from guest services who was very willing to help with our itinerary, restaurant reservations and all of other needs, and very friendly and gave us a great insight into local and Indonesian culture.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1895,Nice Food and location,40,August 2016,"Nice service.
Food is good (esp. breakfast). Fresh and lots of choices.
Near downtown (less than 2 minutes) and beach.
Good for shopping and hanging out with friends.
Staff are great.
Bugs-free.
Good experiences.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1896,Good resort but poor building and room arrangement.,40,July 2016,Nice beach and pool but room was a disappointment. They gave us a garden view room on 3rd floor with no elevator and on top of that it was on a separate compound. This required us to cross a street to go for breakfast and enjoy the facilities. There was no clear explanation on booking. Not very pleased with that. Service was good in general.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1897,A Beautiful Place,40,July 2016,"This hotel has a truely Balinese feel with beautiful gardens and gracious people who looked after us superbly.
It is very relaxed with a good size pool for swimming. A great position overlooking the beach and very central position.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1898,"Stunning, ideally located resort with gracious friendly service",50,July 2016,"We spent 9 days at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa - we couldn't fault it. It is an easy walking distance to Seminyak Shopping Village and Flea Market, great restaurants, local sate houses, upmarket massage parlous and nightlife. Ku de Ta is right next door for some great food, drinks and tunes, but not so close that it can be heard from the resort. Potato Head Club is also within walking distance, via beach or footpath. The resort is big enough and comfortable enough to not have to leave it at all. There are plenty of uncovered and covered deck chairs around both pools and indeed, comfortable cabanas to relax in throughout, all with wait service. The daily buffet breakfast, including ala carte choice is exceptional and changes daily. The dining area is spectacular, alfresco, light, cool, bright and airy. We stayed in an Ocean Side room which was very roomy with a king bed, full bathroom and bar fridge. The black-out curtains really did their job at night and it was very peaceful, too. We were also impressed with the security measures taken at the resort. Finally, I reiterate the service of all staff is the best we have experienced anywhere. The cleanliness of the resort and its grounds is impeccable - no expense is spared on cleaners or gardening.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1899,2 night stay.,40,July 2016,"We found the staff and the propert amazing. Nothing was too hard and every staff member helped us when we needed it. One issue we did have when booking was after booking we were told that the king bed we selected was not available and we had to have 2 single beds. I made a call after receiving this via email and after 45 min they ""found"" a bed so it was all good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1900,A holiday from hell!!,10,July 2016,"Smelt a rat before we even left the UK... but our holiday company, Travelbag, who had completely mislead us were not prepared to make good their lies once they had received full payment for the holiday. The big problem - Hotel Semenyak Resort and Spa has 2 sites - the beach front which is all you see in advertising and the 'Garden Shed', which is across a main road from the hotel proper. Noisey as hell during day and night and a very poor alternative to the main site. Full complaint made on arrival. Hotel Manager too much of a coward to confront us ... we are still awaiting his email in response to all our concerns.We have flown half way around the world when it would have been more relaxing staying at home - disaster!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1901,"Beautiful hotel, right on the beach in the center of best shopping in Bali",50,July 2016,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend away. We thoroughly enjoyed the in-house spa treatments, (loved the scrub). The room was very comfortable, quiet, and had everything we needed.

The grounds and pool area were very spacious and permitted privacy and beauty.

The breakfast was wonderful as they had all the typical choices available, as well as some local items that added interest, such as rain forest honey, and coconut toast.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1902,Enjoyed every minute!,50,July 2016,"We had a very relaxing 5 nights in the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. It was over to soon. The breakfast was fabulous. The staff was overwhelmingly friendly. Views over the pool to the see were stunning! If we visit Bali again, we certainly will come back!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1903,Lovely stay,40,July 2016,My partner and i enjoyed a seven night stay at the Seminyak in a beach room. The staff were attentive and friendly and went out of their way to help with any matter. The rooms were quiet and well serviced. The buffet breakfast was large and a tasty way to start the day. This resort is so close to the shops and some nice restaurants. Will visit again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1904,Fantastic visit,50,July 2016,"Amazing trip to this hotel....just the right size to give you amazing facilities, staff and location....but not as big and bustling as some other places here.
We will def be back....lovely friendly staff, delish food and afternoon tea, great yoga& pilaties and great location....my pics show how much the family enjoyed their time here üëç",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1905,Excellent resort,50,July 2016,"We cannot fault this resort! Our room was clean and spacious (we were upgraded from the garden wing to the beach wing upon arrival), the staff were absolutely delightful, the grounds were lovely and the pool was amazing! The breakfast was great with a huge selection to choose from. We found the lunch/dinner menu slightly pricey but, being a short walk to Seminyak Square, there were many other great options right on the doorstep. We had a wonderful time at this resort and would not hesitate to stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1906,Couldn't fault it,50,July 2016,"As seems to have been the case throughout our holiday in Bali the staff here were extremely welcoming and continued to be pleasant and helpful for our whole stay.

The rooms were very nice but I would definitely recommend staying in the ""beach wing"" rather than the ""garden wing"" if the price difference isn't too great. The ""garden wing"" is situated on the other side of the road which isn't far but having your room right next to the pool on the ""beach wing"" is much more convenient. I actually stayed in both so like to think I'm qualified on this subject üòä

The breakfast was worth the additional small investment and the lunches we had by the pool were always good and not too expensive.

The pool area is fantastic right on the beach with a lovely infinity pool. It's a great place to watch Bali's beautiful sunsets. Also it was always easy to get a sun bed.

The hotel is situated only a 10 minute walk from Seminyak Square and the main street with plenty of good shops and restaurants. If you want to venture any further taxis aren't expensive.

Overall my experience here was great. I'd definitely come back if I ever visit Bali in the future.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1907,Fantadtic,50,July 2016,"Great, well priced luxury. The staff couldn't be friendlier and the pool outlook more amazing. This hotel is beautifully positioned along the golden mile, in great condition though quite ""authentic"" in its approach, and quite good value for money compared to its peers. Breakfast divine! On the surface it's not overly kid-friendly in that it charges heavily for additional bedding and doesn't offer any entertainment at all. But our son had a ball in the shallow pool and additional pool bar area with bridges and overwater gazebos. Bring a sleeping bag and use the outdoor lounge mattress as your ""existing configuration"" for kid/s üòâ",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1908,Amazing Hotel,40,July 2016,"The pool was really nice and relaxing, the food (breakfast) was really good with the wide variety of choices and the staff was really nice, friendly and helpful. However, the lunch was unpleasant and we complained but no one did anything about it. In addition, the room (at the separate building) had this extremely bad smell sometimes. The housekeeping staff seemed a bit lazy too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1909,Dream Holiday,50,July 2016,"Nothing to complain about. We had a nice room in the beach wing at first floor with ocean view. Breakfast is just perfect. The fresh fruits and juices are delicious...
During the day you can have a nice time at the infinity pool where you can order drinks and some food. Price is ok. We booked only breakfast so that we can try some restaurants in seminyak. Thats no problem. There are many bars and restaurants. For Example ""Chanti"" is very good. So again. The trip was perfect!!
Greetings",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1910,Great quality hotel on the beach,40,July 2016,Very clean. Great location for beach walks and access to Seminyak restruants and shops. Very friendly staff. Quieter and fewer facilities than other comparable hotels. Good for couples looking to relax.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1911,Amazing winter escape,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the resort for 6 days, the resort was simply gorgeous, staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us, we felt special from the time we arrived until we checked out. We stayed in The Suite Ocean Side room and it was amazing ! the room had everything you could ever need, down to the Jacuzzi in the bathroom, the balcony and the beautiful topical fruits in the room. The location is perfect, walking distance to great restaurants, shops and amazing massage places, no need to jump in taxi's as you can walk everywhere. Buffet breakfast had a great balance with lots of healthy options to choose from. We spent a lot of time lounging by the infinity pool overlooking the ocean....so peaceful. We wouldn't hesitate recommending to our family and friends and would come back here when we are next in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1912,GREAT STAY,50,July 2016,"We had a wonderful time here. Staff were great and food and accommodation was first class.
would definitely recommend. The position of the hotel is good too, close to shops, restaurants, bars etc. The grounds are also beautiful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1913,Amazing hotel,50,July 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak! The pool and rooms were very nice, the food was delicious, especially the breakfast buffet was great and the staff was very friendly. The hotel is located at the beach so the view is amazing, beautiful location for a beautiful hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1914,Lives up to it's five stars,50,July 2016,"This hotel was basically faultless. We were hesitant when booking as we could only afford the 'garden wing' room and were worried about the negative comments on TripAdvisor, but it really isn't a problem at all! It's literally across a small, two lane street from the main building and the security guards will stop the traffic if it's busy in order to help you cross. There's also a 24hr buggy service, which we used a few times after a big breakfast üòä. The garden wing has its own pool, which we actually preferred by the end of our trip as it was much quieter and we could easily get a shady day bed with an umbrella.

The room was beautiful, huge comfy bed, large TV with lots of channels, nice bathroom, big bath, decent balcony and wardrobe. You get 4 bottles of water as well, which they replenish each day. We asked for a room away from the main road as others suggested and wewere put in level three, facing the back which was very quiet! There is no elevator so if that's a problem be wary. We didn't mind at all.

Location is on point. We were able to walk to Kits via the beach and get a drink for sunset which was very nice.

The staff really made it for us here, we knew exactly who to approach should we encounter any issues (which we didn't) and they happily helped us to book a fast boat to Gili T. All of them greet you with a smile and make you feel very welcome.

The buffet breakfast is great; good coffee that's made to order and an a la cart menu that is included in the buffet price. There's eggs every way, loads of fruit, cold cuts, bakery items, Asian foods, yoghurt, fresh juice, crispy af bacon and even sushi! For the Aussies - they had VEGEMITE!

We got room service one night and the phone service was great. Meals were Round 200-300 thousand rupiah each and while a little bland, was decent for room service food! we ordered the Angus beef burger and beef rendang.

This hotel was everything we expected, there was not one dissapointment. I highly reccomend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1915,Superb,50,July 2016,"Very good service, friendly staffs, terrific location and view. Will definitely visit again.
Used hotel private transfer service and I am glad I did. Everything was smooth and ready so I could relax which was the most important for me.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1916,Simply Stunning! Amazing resort in a great location,50,July 2016,"Simply Stunning Resort. We stayed at the Seminyak Resort and Spa for 5 nights and cannot have asked for better service. From the moment we arrived to the day we left we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The resort is located close to the famous KuDeTa bar and a 2 minute walk to Seminyak Square which was Ideal for shopping and eating at the local restaurants. The staff at the resort were excellent and were always on hand to help. Overall the resort grounds were immaculately maintained and the pool is something truly beautiful.
We Stayed in the Garden wing (across the road) and had no issues as its was just as beautiful as the main area and we had a pool with a swim up bar in our section also but could use all the facilities that the resort had to offer in the main building. I would definitely recommend this resort to couples and also families. I would also recommend the buffet breakfast as a must!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1917,Family Holiday,50,July 2016,"It was our very first trip/holiday to Bali as a family. We booked a 2 bedroom garden villa with a pool, back in May 2016; the only one in the resort. Unfortunately, between reservations at The Seminyak Beach Resort and our travel agent at Flight Centre (who use Infinity Travel for their on-bookings), the room and our booking hadn't been confirmed/reserved for us. So when we arrived we were expecting the 2 bedroom Villa and weren't able to stay in it as it was double booked. Thankfully, reservations at The Seminyak Beach Resort worked very hard to accommodate us and we were fortunate enough to stay in 2, one bedroom villa's side by side. It worked out in the end and thankfully our children are young adults and we could leave them in the room by themselves, otherwise it would've been disastorious.

I have to applaud the reservations manager at The Seminyak for being honest about the mistake on his behalf and double booking our Villa. The service at The Seminyak and the care factor they have for their guests are amazingly wonderful. They work endlessly to ensure all guests are happy and the resort is spectacular. It's even better in person. It was located so close to the lovely Seminyak strip shops and restaurants. You could walk to everything or catch a bluebird taxi if you wanted to explore beyond walking. The gorgeous infinity pool overlooks the sand and beach............sunsets were beautiful of an evening. Buffet breakfast was delicious, so much choice, one had to really tried hard and pace themselves! Yummy afternoon tea was served between 3pm - 5pm every day, it was a refreshing welcome. We also experience the Spa..........what angels those girls are!

However, I would also like to express how disappointed I am with our booking via Flight Centre who use Infinity Travel for all their on-bookings for not notifying me or giving me heads up about the accommodation issue (which they knew about) and for lying to the reservation mananger at The Seminyak Resort about speaking to me.

Shame on you Infinity Travel.........this could have turned out to be a very stressful situation.
As an agent and one the client has emmense trust in, you need to ensure all is 100% on the clients behalf, when it comes to the duty of care.

I will definately stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa again and make a direct booking next time we visit Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1918,"Lovely hotel, amazing villas",50,June 2016,"Beautiful boutique hotel. Wasn't sure how child friendly it would be as there were just a few children, but our stay was lovely. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Villa facing the sea, it had a good sized private pool, outdoor living area and large bedroom. Bed was really comfy. The staff were really friendly and they were great with kids too. A really enjoyable stay. Perhaps more than a handful of nights with kids there wouldn't be much to do but we enjoyed swimming and easy access to the big beach where we collected shells.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1919,"Nice room, great location",50,June 2016,"The room is spacious and really nice, I stayed in the beach wing. Price is not that cheap but worth it because the location is great. Breakfast is really nice, they offered ala carte and some buffet. Service was really good. Would love to come back there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1920,Location and comfort,50,July 2016,"We came with our family of 4 here, what a beautiful place, very friendly staff, great location and nice rooms, definitely go back again. Not too many families there, mainly couples, but all the staff were very interactive with my kids. Also right next door to ku de Ta, which was Handy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1921,Quality beachfront Bali hotel with options!!!!,40,June 2016,"Stayed 7 nights recently in a 'garden view' twin room with a friend. This hotel was excellent for a number of reasons. Beachfront location, close to all Seminyak shopping and restaurants and most of all the choice of rooms. We stayed in the building behind the main hotel in the garden suites. A cheaper option than in the main hotel, but nothing wrong with these rooms. Well maintained, clean and fully serviced by hotel staff. Less than 2 minute walk across the road to all hotel facilities. Staff at hotel were always accommodating and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again...with pleasure! Recommended to all travellers....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1922,Fabulous -,50,July 2016,Fabulous hotel with very friendly attentive staff. Lovely welcome and intro to hotel. We had a room in the Beach Wing which did cost a little more but was well worth it. The layout of the resort is very well though with great with landscaping. The beach front enables unbelievable views of the sun sets with the option to eat or have a drink.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1923,Very good !,40,July 2016,"This hotel we stayed 5 nights in he garden wing. Which is just located opposite the road to the main hotel
It means you have to cross the road for main pool , breakfast , and the beach. I didnt mind this.
It was within my budget but if you can afford then the beach wing rooms are just a bit more convienent.
The hotels location is excellent.
Not far from shopping , bars , restraunts , cheap massages and amenities.
The breakfast is fantastic with made to order waffles and pancakes and various types of eggs along wih the main buffet which is extensive ! And surrounded by a lovely koi pond
The main pool is a lovely infinity pool and be beach is just steps away.
The garden wing has a Small pool. But it was unused during our stay so if you want your own private swim its ideal to be in the garden wing.
The only downside was our room was close to the road that dissects the two wings so it had some traffic noise at night.
A tip ask to be away from the road!
The staff are fantastic and genuinly pleasant and helpful and polite and always smiling.
The room was fine. The main hotel had lovely gardens and well makntained spaces!
Definitly a solid 4*s",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1924,Excellent Hotel,50,July 2016,"We stayed prior and after my daughters wedding July 2016. The hotel, staff, service food and location were excellent. We simply cannot fault anything. The welcome greeting was second to none and was the best in the three hotels. If you are looking for a hotel with high standards you will need this one !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1925,Great hotel,50,June 2016,"My wife and i went on our honeymoon and stayed at seminyak beach resort for the last part of our 2 weeks trip for 8 nights. We stayed there in an ocean view suite and it was amazing. The view from the rooms is average as it's not very close to the beach and it has only 3 floors. The hotel was more than i expected to be, as i read some bad reviews before our stay, the staff was very friendly, the pool area is amazing, the location is top location in seminyak, you have Ku De Ta and Potato Head Beach very close in walking distance, you have good restaurants, shops, spas, everything you need, just exit the gates of the hotel turn right and walk for 5 min, everything is there.
I would surely come back in the future.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ The breakfast is absolutely amazing, it's a must.
‚Ä¢ Location is very good
‚Ä¢ Friendly staff

Cons:
‚Ä¢ The only bad thing about the hotel i found is that there's a bad smell from the pipes when you flush the water but they are aware of it and i think they're trying to take care of this in the future.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1926,Relaxing stay,40,July 2016,"Last hotel of our 3weeks stay in Bali,great service , nice room with ocean view , excellent breakfast a la carte and buffet. A short walk to Seminyak square with many restaurants and shops,we never eate at the hotel,more fun and ambiance in Eat Street!
A struggle to have a place at the pool and so you you have to rent a sunlounger at the beach by locals,‚Ç¨12 .
We had a great time but afterwards our conclusion was that we paid too much (‚Ç¨350/night) for only a great view ,a good breakfast and a good bed ! We had the same at other locations,with bigger room,at half the price!
Thanks to the very friendly staff !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1927,Awesome,50,July 2016,"The hotel had all the facilities we wanted for a relaxing holiday. The room was spacious, with an awesome bath tub. The grounds immaculate with lovely pavilions scattered throughout. The pool is massive and has several sections to it all located right on the edge of the beach, awesome setting. The food and drinks were second to none as was the service from all the friendly staff. Have to mentioned the spa, very ornate and the rooms themselves were an experience with excellent views. The spa treatments were the best!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1928,Seminyak Stay,50,July 2016,"It was the greatest experience so far! We really appreciated the facility, the room service, the workers at the hotel. They were nice and pleasant, and the hotel was amazing! thanks for all the service!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1929,OUTSTANDING!,50,July 2016,"We have stayed at this hotel for the 2nd year running in June/July and absolutely love it. The position right on the beach is amazing and the location is the best, walking distance to restaurants and shops. The hotel staff are just lovely and make your staff memorable. Our daughter had to go to hospital and Dewi at reception organised the car and spoke to the doctor, no problems at all and was all good. The grounds are beautiful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1930,Beautiful Resort,50,July 2016,"We were there last week with our 2 teenage children, They stayed in a garden room and we stayed in a beach suite (well worth the extra price, we had ocean views and loved listening to the ocean waves from our balcony). We loved the resort, the rooms were stunning, the grounds and pools were beautifull. We had come from a large 5 star resort in Nusa Dua and loved the feel of this smaller resort, we felt the quality of service & room amenities are far better at this resort. Considering its right next door to to Ku De Ta, we thought it may be noisy but suprisingly you cant hear the music from Ku De Ta at all, coming in after eating out or shopping in Seminyak, we loved returning back to our peaceful serene oasis.
The only down part of our trip was our daughter splitting her head on her surfboard while surfing out the front of the resort, the staff couldn't have been more kind and helpful, they have a nurse on site who escorted us to a nearby clinic where my daughter needed 3 stiches. The Seminyak arranged free transport to and back from the clinic and were so wonderful ensuring she was ok.. As surfers these things can happen and we continued to enjoy the rest of our trip, but I would recommend the resort let surfers know (particularly kids) about the dangerous dumping waves on a sandbank where the board can just bounce oft it and deceptively dangerous when the tide goes out. It is much safer surfing at Legian which was just a short walk to the left of the resort (my husband surfed there everyday for the rest of our trip).
The best part of our stay was watching the sunset while listening to the ocean and sipping our cocktails, one night they had a fantastic dj playing great music which only added to the ambience. Also we loved the staff who were so kind, warm & wonderful. We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Seminyak and will definitely be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1931,"Absolutely stunning, worth every penny",50,July 2016,"Absolutely amazing hotel. We had a fabulous time, service was impeccable. Loved spending mornings at the pool and then a day of adventure. The restaurants on site were great and we especially enjoyed our room :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1932,Very good,50,July 2016,"Stayed here with my husband for three nights.
Lovely room, really large and well appointed, although a bit of a disappointing ocean view as we had to squint a bit to see it, but no big deal.
Pool and common areas are beautiful. Breakfast fantastic. Staff super friendly.
Well located, ten min walk to Seminyak Square. The beach is to die for!!
Small gripes....we could not fill the basins as no plugs, safe had to be replaced and we gave up on the jacuzzi as we had the water running for half hour and barely covered the first two inches, by our reckoning it would have taken two hours to fill. However, none of these minor things would stop us going back and thoroughly recommending this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1933,Lovely mid size beachfront hotel,50,June 2016,"We enjoyed our stay at Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. It has that nice balance of being large enough to offer a wide range of facilities but small enough not to feel bustling or impersonal.
The rooms are beautifully appointed and spacious ( we had an ocean view suite). The food is of high quality and the staff are friendly and helpful. You would be hard pushed to better the location which is on the beach and a short walk to shops, restaurants etc.

There were some renovations going on when we were there so there was occasionally some noise but nothing too annoying. I believe it was the function room and lounge which was having a makeover.
My son would have liked to have been able to rent a surf board but the rental hut on the beach seemed to have closed down. This probably wouldn't suit families with very little children as there isn't a playground or kids club. My kids 16 and 12 thought it was great and they are well travelled.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1934,Stunning!,50,July 2016,"This hotel is simply Stunning - in every single way! Staff - Amazing, Service - Amazing, Breakfast - Amazing, Room - Amazing, Pool - Amazing, Spa - Amazing, Location - Amazing.

We stayed in a Garden Room (building across the road) & were not disappointed at all. This wing has its own Private Pool & sunken bar that guests have access too - was always v.quiet & often we were the only ones using it as everyone uses the main pool (also stunning) on the beach. Crossing the road was no hassle whatsoever (they even offer you a golf cart ride for the 20 second walk if you want it!) & would thoroughly recommend the Garden Rooms for those wanting extra peace/exclusivity.

Cannot fault this place one bit & would 110% stay there again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Fantastic! Friendly, helpful and always smiling. Advice on where to eat, all wearing traditional Balinese dress adding to the rustic feel. Security at both the main hotel and the garden rooms, always smiling and helpful. Housekeeping could not do enough for you and everyone is professional yet happy. Excellent service.

The Garden Room:
We stayed in a garden room which is a separate building to the main hotel. I would strongly recommend booking this!! It was much quieter and feels more private and bespoke, with the garden rooms having its own pool / swim up bar, sunbeds and lounge area. We had access to all of the main hotels facilities, just by crossing a road. It takes all of 2 minutes and two security guards helping you! You could even get a golf buggy to take you across the road if crossing bothers you. It didn't bother us at all and we loved having the choice of both complexes and the peaceful garden surroundings.
Clean, rustic feel yet modern bathroom with all facilities / amenities you need. Lovely balcony and being British a good brand of English tea provided! Plenty of hangers and storage space.

The facilities:
Infinity pool is simply wow! Jaw dropping and would highly recommend going swimming at sunset.
Swim up pool bars are fab and great service of food and drinks.

I had a facial at The Spa, this is not advertised enough as it was incredible! Wonderful treatment and beautiful surroundings. There is also a sauna and hot tub in the spa which hotel guests can use at any time!

We attended a Balinese dinner and dance one evening at the hotel, 500,000IRD pp (38USD) truly magical! The musicians and all the dances were in the traditional dress, a great atmosphere! Fabulous performance could not take my eyes off them! The food was all traditional Balinese - I can't recommend it enough.

I also attended a meditation class - complementary! Fabulous a great teacher with the Beautiful hotel grounds as our surroundings. Highly recommend.

The one negative I have to say is, although comfy, there were not enough Sunbeds. One morning we put our belongings on a bed with a provided towel and I was told by staff I had to return within 30mins. Sadly - It took away the 5 star feel to the rest of the hotel and service. One day we used a private sunbed on the beach as there were not enough at the pool, this cost 300,000 IDR (22USD) for 4 hours. There are plenty of people selling them on the beach and although expensive was nice to spend a day on the beach.

The food:
Breakfasts each morning were amazing! Great variety of western / asian and local Balinese food. Would highly recommend going to the 'Balinese Corner' to taste! Great coffee excellent tasty food every day.

The Location:
Great location on the beach, beach walks were great and can get to other restaurants / beach clubs from here.
5 mins walk to Seminyak Square with plenty of shops and places to eat - spoilt for choice!

Overall: a peaceful boutique feel to the hotel, wonderful facilities and surroundings. Feels like Paradise! I would most defiantly stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1936,Great couples getaway!,50,July 2016,"My boyfriend and I felt like we were in paradise here! Friendly staff, amazing food, even better service. If you want to relax and be pampered, look no further! Tons of nice and casual restaurants nearby. We will return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1937,What a Fantastic Place,50,July 2016,This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in and we travel a lot. The location was great the room was so big and had Two TV's the bathroom had a jacuzzi which was fab and the staff were very happy and helpful at all times. The pool was right next to the sea and the sunset from the pool was so spectacular. I would recommend this hotel it was first class all the way.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1938,Fantastic place and amazing service!,50,July 2016,I cannot rave enough about this place and the service. Can't wait to go back!!! The room was beautiful and clean. Food was wonderful and location was great- easy walk to shops and restaurants. Pool was stunning with comfortable lounge chairs and relaxing environment.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1939,Comfortable and Relaxing,40,June 2016,"The hotel is clean, comfortable and right on the beach. There is an excellent pool overlooking the beach, with great service of cocktails and food to your table. These are pretty pricey by western standards and are exorbitant by local standards. The waves are quite high, with strong currents, so swimming is not recommended unless you are very capable. Water temperature was beautiful however.

The staff are excellent. Never does any staff member meet a guest without greeting them warmly. The service at the restaurants couldn't be faulted. Likewise the room service is discreet and thorough. Very well trained and attentive to detail. One of the strongest points in favour of this hotel.

The facilities and cleanliness were excellent. If there was a fault to be pointed out it was the air conditioning. It can be quite noisy, and seems to be limited to a minimum of 22 degrees. This is ok, but if one turns it off (to stop the noise), the room gets quite warm and it takes a long time to get the room back down to a comfortable temperature. We left a key in the power socket all the time so the aircon would remain on whilst we were out.

The food in the restaurants was pretty good, but way overpriced for the quality. Breakfast averaged ‚Ç¨25 per person, and was the best meal of the lot. There was a very extensive spread of high quality food to choose from, and the juices were genuine and fresh. Dinner was not good value for money, and this was borne out by the empty tables every night. Good food, but terribly pricey. We ate there on our first night, and there were several things not satisfactory. The cheapest wine was ‚Ç¨50 per bottle, and whilst not plonk, it wasn't great. This seems to be partly caused by a high government tax on alcohol. Off-licence prices run very expensive also. There are many excellent dining options within a 10 minute walk uptown, so that's what we did every other night.

Regarding Bali itself, it is important to be careful when changing money. There are many moneychangers around, but the exchange rates vary widely. Some of them will try and cheat you out of the correct sum of money. Count carefully!! Do not let the teller handle your money after it has been counted as he may flick some of it away when your attention is diverted. They are highly skilled at this. If he handles it at all, insist on counting it again. The hotel changers are safe, but the rate is poor.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1940,5 star All the way,50,July 2016,My girlfriend and I enjoyed 4 days at the resort and we had a wonderful experience. The resort was absolutely beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly going anove and beyond. We booked an ocean suite with a private plunge pool that was absolutely stunning. We will definitely be going back!!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1941,Amazing!,50,June 2016,"I stayed here with my boyfriend the last week of June and first week of July, this hotel is amazing. The staff were incredible, couldn't do enough for us. The grounds and hotel itself is beautiful, and the location is perfect for everything you would want to do in Seminyak. I would definitely return to this hotel and recommended to others. Thank you Seminyak beach resort and spa for making our two weeks in Bali so special!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1942,Terrific Medium-sized Luxury Property in the Heart of Seminyak,50,July 2016,"Recently stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, a medium-sized luxury property in the heart of Seminyak. The resort has a lovely garden, a beachfront infinity pool (good for lap swimming) and is close to shops, restaurants and bars. Breakfast is extensive and of good quality. Personnel is very friendly and very helpful.

My room was large with queen bed, a shower, bath and had a shaded patio. Perfect for a solo traveler like me. A free fruit bowl was present on arrival and daily complimentary water bottles were provided.

If you are looking for a luxury stay in the Seminyak area, but prefer a somewhat smaller resort I suggest the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. You will not be disappointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1943,Terrific Resort,50,June 2016,"Recently visited for a week with my husband and 18 year old daughter and her friend. Great resort and super friendly staff. Recommend staying on the beach side as the other side looked like a pain having to cross the road to get to breakfast. Lovely pool but only gripe is that there are not many sun lounges and some people go down to ""reserve"" them before breakfast by putting their stuff on them then don't return until a couple of hours later and so on during the day. There should be a ""use it or lose it"" rule so that reserving is not allowed and everyone can enjoy the lovely pool amenities. Would have liked more Indonesian food on the pool menu - would have loved a Mi Goreng by the pool ! Great location - walking distance to everything. Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1944,Mr & Mrs Nash,50,June 2016,We travelled to Bali for our honeymoon and stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort for two weeks. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful which made the occasion even more amazing. The hotel was stunning in all aspects.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1945,Excellent ‚ù§Ô∏è,50,June 2016,"Awesome stay, its a great location for exploring and shopping in seminyak, the rooms and hotel were great, with perfect views of the pool and beach. The staff were all super friendly. Will be back here soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1946,Perfect!,50,June 2016,"We stayed in the one bedroom beach front villa and it was beautiful and always spotless. The staff here are so warm and welcoming and really do bend over backwards. Nothing was ever a problem. Breakfast is very nice, beach was lovely. This is a great location. Cannot reccomend enough!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1947,Close to everything.,50,January 2016,"I loved this place, it was on the beach, close to the restaurants and shops. Breakfast each morning was a delight. I especially liked how they had two sections to the hotel, the front part which was where the main lobby was, and the back part which was across the road. Both sections had there own pools which was handy.
Staff were friendly and very accommodating. I'll definitely return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1948,Over expectation,40,June 2016,"I chose the hotel on 16 to 19/6 considering on the review provided in tripadvisor. In fact, all was good mostly on the infinity pool, except every day i should activate our key room in the reception even though they should already knew that i was staying 3 nites - this was reducing our convenient. The pool bed were also not sufficient to us for sun bathing. The other advantage is that the hotel is near to the famous restaurant.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1949,Could not ask for more,50,June 2016,Have to agree with all of the other excellent reviews of this hotel. The grounds are lush and inviting. Surroundings tranquil. Beautiful pool with access to the beach. Location perfect - quick walk into town. Food at breakfast and in the restaurants was well prepared. Service throughout the hotel was great. Perfect experience.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1950,Wouldn't stay anywhere else!!,50,June 2016,"This was my 7th trip to Bali and definitely my best trip! Like many people out there I do a lot of research before I book a holiday and a hotel, I trawl review after review on multiple sites until I believe I've made the right decision... And then I still stress that I could have found somewhere better for my money or that it might not be as good as it is in the pictures. I hit the jackpot with choosing The Seminyak!

The Seminyak is not only the best hotel I've stayed at in Bali but also the best hotel I've stayed at anywhere in the world. It's a peaceful paradise inside the hotel walls but you can choose to be apart of the hustle and bustle of trendy Seminyak right on the front doorstep.

The pools are amazing, the breakfasts were unbelievably good, the rooms were beautiful, and the staff are the most beautiful, kind and helpful people I have ever met. We felt so lucky to have such wonderful hosts.

The best compliment that we can give to The Seminyak is that we will be back again. We've found our home away from home.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1951,Absolute tranquillity,50,June 2016,"I think my title says it all. One of the best holidays we have had. Amazing resort, cannot fault the staff in any way and the location was spot on.
The pool is amazing and having KuDeta next door was the icing on the cake.
I will be coming back ... Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1952,Great Hotel,50,June 2016,"Great location right next to the beach - I could hear the waves from my room! Hotel room was very nice, and very spacious bathroom. Nice and clean and comfortable bed. Staff were all very friendly. Located close to Seminyak shopping area. Restaurant within hotel was great, Cu Te Da restaurant next door was also great too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1953,Gorgeous property with amazing bar staff,50,June 2016,"As a travel agent, and after doing a lot of research, I chose this property for me and my fianc√©e. We stayed in the Garden wing for 6 nights and we really enjoyed our stay. This wing is located over the road to the main wing, but we didn't mind as there is a quieter pool area with swim-up bar.

It's in a great location: close to shopping, restaurants, and next to Ku De Ta.

We could also use the two other main pool areas overlooking the beach, one with another swim-up bar, which are also beautiful, but it was sometimes difficult to get day beds unless you get there before midday.

Complimentary afternoon tea is offered between 3-5pm which is an enjoyable bonus. This is offered in the chapel between the two main pools.

For us, one of the main highlights was the amazing and very accommodating bar staff. After getting to know most of them (all of which were very friendly) they created drinks especially for us, and we were not disappointed. They were by far the most lovely and skilled cocktail makers I've ever encountered.

Some of the things that they could improve on was the breakfast and the housekeeping of rooms. While the buffet was great, they were inconsistent in the al a carte breakfast- one meal was undercooked, and another didn't show up. Also the amenities were not consistently restocked, and while admittedly we could have called reception, we ran out of some things. These are just minor issues, we expected these from a 5 star property.

While there is no departure lounge, after we had checked out,the lovely staff allowed us access to a room to freshen up before our late night flight.

I would stay at this property again as we had a wonderful time overall.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1954,"Beautiful hotel, very good location, quiet",40,June 2016,"Nice spot, all restaurants & bars in Seminyak with walking distance, but still quiet location
Beautiful spot for sunsets
Clean
Friendly staff
Very good breakfast, with a wide range of food and drinks
Good massages",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1955,Very good service,40,June 2016,"Well located, terrific pools and breakfast area. having been a Bali regular for 30 years, the Seminyak is a great choice in the busy Sreminyak district. Walk along the beach to many of the main restaurants and bars.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1956,Beautiful and Relaxed,50,June 2016,"We had a beautiful 4 nights. Our room overlooked the sea which was fantastic, we watched the sunset from our balcony and listened to the waves from bed at night. The staff were lovely and helpful, amazing breakfast and perfect saltwater pool to swim and lounge by. We'll definitely be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1957,Lovely hotel but deprecate across a road?!,30,June 2016,"The hotel itself is lovely, the staff are all really welcoming and friendly. However we were really disappointed when we've gone to check in we weren't aware their 'garden wing' is infact over the road. It secludes you from the hotel and it just feels like you've booked an apartment. We advised the manager of this but he was far from helpful and was happy for us to just move hotel.

I would recommend this hotel but only if you book to not stay in the garden wing, I wouldn't return to stay in the garden wing again.

The only other thing I felt it lacked was that there was no sort of atmosphere of an evening, just a small bar area would have been great. But if you want to just chill and be in bed for 10pm this hotel is perfect - and the pool is stunning!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1958,Honeymoon Heaven!!,50,June 2016,"Stayed here for one week as leg 3 of our honeymoon and my wife and I loved it.

The hotel grounds, the pool and the room are all lovely and well kept. Everywhere is spotless and well maintained. Each and every staff member we encountered on our week made the stay what it was, they are so friendly and helpful. I literally can't praise the staff enough.

Another joy from our stay was the breakfast, the buffet choice is wonderful, the tea/ coffee lovely and they give you a menu of different cooked eggs and fresh pancakes/ waffles which are all amazing. I had waffles with Nutella and marshmallows 5 days out of 7 and pancakes the other two.

The pool food is also wonderful, great choice of starters, sandwiches and burgers. (The Mozzarella fritters are quality).

The location of the hotel is superb, amazing walks along the beach in either direction and only a 5 minute walk from Seminyak square and other restaurants and boutiques. We ate out every night and the food was simply amazing at each place we went, also so cheap. You should checkout Sisterfields, Cafe Bali, Motel Mexicola, Char Char grill, Sea Circus, Ultimo and Ginger Moon. All were brilliant.

We also had a day out with ""Bali Traditional tours"". We went to Ubud, visited the monkey temple, a waterfall, a coffee plantation, rice terraces, a Hindu temple and had lunch out. It was a great trip out which lasted about 7hrs before we went back to the amazing hotel.

If you book the Seminyak Beach resort and Spa you honestly won't regret it, it is paradise and we will definitely return one day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1959,Disappointing and noisy,20,June 2016,"I must say staff are excellent. Customer service is amazing, apart from we had to wait over an hour in the sun to get into our room. I like when you come back to your room at night there is a flask of herbal tea and a little sweet treat. Beautiful shower products in the bathroom. It's right on the beach and with the infinity pool, you can just sit and watch all the hawkers go by and people watch. Breakfast is nice being able to order most hot meals off a menu and have it made for you. The resort has amazing gardens, thanks to the friendly gardeners. It was my birthday and they made me a fabulous cake and sang Happy Birthday at breakfast, very nice touch.
Down the road to your left it doesn't look like much but keep walking down the road and around the corner. Some really nice little boutiques and art shops including sea circus.
What I'm disappointed about is the noise! Not a lot of sleeping done. We bought a suite and our room was on the busy road, so you hear the cars and bikes at all hours of the night. We unfortunately also had other noise room, scrapping and banging from upstairs every morning just around 6.30am, then throughout the day and night. Also the beds were very uncomfortable. We also spent time down in a cabana for the day, we asked for a menu and went back to look at it. One guy came up to ask us if we wanted anything and we said just in a minute. He didn't come back, they seemed to interested in what their other colleagues were talking about to bother with us. Wifi was bad! It continually cut in and out. You can find something a lot cheaper with as much customer service and a lot quieter in Semiyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1960,Beautiful,50,June 2016,"Large beach front hotel where you have a feeling of privacy. Beautiful grounds and pool. Amazing ""free"" breakfast. Nice large rooms with gorgeous bathrooms and decks. The staff were without exception warm, friendly and efficient.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1961,Simply stunning.,50,May 2016,"First off when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded, which was a lovley surprise. And it was a real upgrade. Beautiful amenities. Could not fault our room, the staff were amazing, knew us by name on the second day. I cannot express how lovley the Indonesians are. Very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The pool area was amazing, and you just had to pick up a menu and someone was there to see if you needed anything. I felt very spoilt. The breakfast was delicious and very generous. The location of the resort was excellent, you walked out of the resort and you could literally walk to everything. They had security guards that made me feel very safe and would even stop the traffic so you could cross the road! All in all I have to say our stay there was pretty much perfect. The reastaurants around the area were fabulous. Taxis so cheap if you didn't want to walk home. And don't believe the hype about not being safe, I was there with only my daughter and never felt threatened. I would highly recommend staying at this particular resort, it ticked all the boxes. Thanks guys T the ""Semniyak beach resort and spa"" for making my stay a delight.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1962,Excellent Resort,50,June 2016,"The resort is huge and very beautiful
The room was a good size, clean and the bed was very comfortable
The staff couldn't do enough for us, they are amazing
Location was perfect. I would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1963,Honeymoon Last Stay,50,June 2016,"Fantastic, tranquil hotel - perfect for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel and facilities were fantastic. Definitely recommend. One point to note is that there are a number of rooms in a separate campus a short walk down the road with buggy transfers if required. I think paying the extra for the beachside rooms is well worth it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1964,Luxury. Hospitality.,50,August 2015,"Went there for 3 nights during my honeymoon. Deserves 5 stars easily. Spa is fantastic. Pool view is excellent. Food very delicious. Staff very well trained and prepared. Breakfast very rich (international indeed with a wide variety). Rooms are large and ideal for couples. Sunset is easily and observed in a romantic view from the pool.
Thank you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1965,Impressive Good Service,50,June 2016,"We visited Bali a second time and chose to stay in The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. We were glad that we chose to stay there as we were really impressed by the helpful and friendly staff. Upon our arrival, the front desk staff helped us check in very promptly. They also gave good advice as to where to go for good food and provided us with a detailed map of the area to guide us.On the second day when we asked for their help to book a spa, they could not get through the first time but advised us that they would keep on trying till they get through and would inform us once the booking is done. We were really touched by their helpfulness and excellent service attitude. The staff at the cafe could remember our names and addressed us warmly too.

In addition to the warm and excellent service, we find the rooms to be very clean and spacious. We especially like the big bathroom where we can either choose to soak ourselves in the bathtub or relax under the rain shower. Besides the daily tidying up of the rooms, the attendant went another round in the evening time to ask if we want anything e.g bottled water to be replenished. We really felt pampered and with the level of attention given.

I find that Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa has a very good location, it is close to many good restaurants and clubs. The rooms are very comfortable and clean rooms which we feel very happy about. However, it is the intangibles qualities that it has; helpful and warm staff and an excellent level of service which made this holiday a memorable one for us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1966,Dream Resort,50,June 2016,My friend and I stayed for 3 nights and absolutely loved this Resort. I am quite fussy and the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa catered to all of my desires. The room ( Ocean View Suite) was spacious and spotlessly clean. The infinity pool & surrounding area was beautiful & the staff looked after us all day bringing us a delicious & extensive food menu & cocktails (Yum!!) What more can you say about this resort - The Staff are the most polite I have encountered anywhere in my travels. Well done and next time I come to Bali I will spend the whole of my holiday at this Resort.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1967,5Star on The Beach,50,June 2016,"From the moment we were greeted by The Reception Staff, we knew we were in for a memorable stay. As we had arrived close to Midnight, the Night Manager a Mr. Sura was very courteous, professional and all of his staff gave you a sense that your comfort was their priority.
Our room was a Ocean View Suite, beautifully spacious and very clean.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1968,Perfect Place for short Getaway,50,June 2016,"I dont know where to start, but it was a perfect short getaway for me in this hotel. Room beach side where I stayed definitely stunning. Landscape is full of greens and big trees that make the ambience feel so nice. Afternoon tea in the glass house (they called Chapel) with over looking Seminyak beach view is wondeful. Swimming pool is awesome, even sometimes needs to wait a bit longer for the sun lounger, however I still happy to enjoy swimming and drinking by sitting under the water in the pool bar. Staffs are very friendly and always smile and greets us from the entrance to wherever we met. Feel to much greetings in a way, ahahahaha .... But that feels so good!
No doubts to come back and stay here again and booked the same room (if possible) for next booking!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1969,Best Hotel in Seminyak!,50,June 2016,"We stayed here after a lovely stay back in January. Cannot fault this beautiful hotel. We have stayed in many 5 Star hotels however the service here is impeccable. The rooms are spotless and the most comfortable bed. Anything you need the kind helpful smiling staff will get it for you.

The breakfast caters for everyone - it is delicious and in a gorgeous setting. The complementary afternoon tea by the sea is good too!

Next to to Ku de Ta and walking distance to fabulous restaurants. Seminyak Square is a 5 minute walk.

Nothing is a problem at this hotel. You will not be disappointed. Looking forward to our next stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1970,Great place,40,June 2016,"Stayed here for 10 nights in June 2016
We had a ocean view suite and it was class
The garden view suites were across the road from the main building and infinity pool etc
breakfast every morning was great. Everything was fresh and individually home made.
The staff were incredibly polite
Used the gym most days and it's good.
We wanted to use the spa there but the prices were extortionate compared to across the road.
5 good spas within a few minutes of the main entrance.
Only one menu used by both restaurants for lunch and dinner. The food is really good though don't get me wrong. There is also a pool side menu for sandwiches etc.
Sadly my watch got taken from the room. I didn't put it in the safe one night. That's the only down side.
Very little sympathy from the manger either or any form of compensation. We were just told to go to the police.
Overall we had an unbelievable time.
Well worth spending the extra money to get the ocean view suite.
We looked at the villas down the front and they are on another level.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1971,Perfect when need of a relax üåû,50,May 2016,"Beautiful hotel right on the beach. Very clean and well maintained. Staff warm and helpful. Beautiful grounds with plenty of places to relax in the sun.The hotel has two parts beach and garden wing. We stayed in the garden wing , not a big problem but did have to cross the road for breakfast and the main hotel. The garden wing had its own private pool and bar which was so peaceful as most went across to main hotel. We had a few early starts, staff extremely helpful providing take out breakfast.
Good location with a short walk into Seminyak. Would go back tomorrow !!üëçüëåüëå",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1972,Great escape,40,June 2016,Will definitely be coming back! Me and my friend had a great few days at the resort. Shame about the King tides! Spectacular by the pool though. The swim up bar is definitely relaxing and the bar men really know their stuff!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1973,Good Location & Pool,40,June 2016,"Travelled as a couple with teenage daughter & her grandma. Stayed for 4D3N in 2 beach wing rooms.

Happy:
* Convenient location to shops.
* Polite security guards.
* Helpful & friendly staff at the front office especially Mr. Fendy.
* Beautiful landscape surrounds the hotel compound.
* Clean & spacious room.
* Nice pool in good size with good view of the beach.
* Separated swim-up bar serves its purpose well.
* Good selection of breakfast menu and attentive staff at the restaurant.
* Impressive turndown service on last night.

Not-so-happy:
* We were addressed with the wrong name on the card by the Manager.
* Lack of effort from the office as none of my request on rooms were fulfilled (given king size bed instead of twin beds which I can accept but 2 rooms were a distance apart is disappointing knowing we traveled as a family).
* Lack of attention from staff at the main pool (we have to approach them for towels even they saw us sitting at the sun deck).

Overall we enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak and would recommend it if one is looking for quiet stay, nice pool with beach front view & close proximity to shops & popular restaurant.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1974,Excellent holiday,50,June 2016,"Beautiful grounds and great location, staff cannot do enough to help you - including running your car keys to the airport after you've left them behind! 2nd visit and will be returning for a third!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1975,"Wish we had booked longer, 4 nights not long enough - loved this place, exceptional service",50,June 2016,"Everything about this place from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave was exceptional. It standard of accommodation is very high, food is great, views superb, free transport into town great and timely. People exceptional, totally relaxing - loved everything about it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1976,"Wow, what a lovely place!",50,June 2016,"Recently stayed in the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa with my partner. On arrival we were really made to feel welcome had a lovely chain of flowers presented to us and a cooling welcome drink.
The staff at the hotel are the main reason we had such a great time. They simply cannot do enough for you day or night. To come back at night from an evening out to be made to feel so special with the entire reception team welcoming you back is pretty good! Every member of staff acknowledges you at the hotel when you see them from reception to the restaurant staff housekeeping, pool staff, gardeners....I could go on.
The hotel is perfectly positioned on the beach, the pool area is lovely and the hotel grounds cared for by some expert gardeners.
The seas were quite rough whilst we stayed and we had quite a lot of sea water splashing into the infinity pool and decked areas but, the hotel team just calmly dealt with it and sorted it out.
Our room was on the second floor was lovely, everything you needed was on hand with the exception of an iron. (When we rang reception for an iron and ironing board it arrived straight away)
Turn down service was great and housekeeping spot on.
Breakfast was fantastic......anything you wanted was a available and delicious!
We only ate at the hotel of a lunchtime and the food was good. We ate out of an evening as we like to dine at different locations.
All in all a great 10 days in Bali, great people, great hotel and lovely location.
Thanks for making our stay so special. Adam & Jayne (Wales UK)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1977,AMAZING ROMANTIC GETAWAY,50,April 2016,"Had a week stay in a beachfront pool villa, was absolutely faultless. Room had everything you needed, clean and comfortable. Having your own private pool was a bonus. Resort was well maintained and staff very friendly and helpful. Food was great, breakfast buffet was more than you really needed but yummy, room service top notch and pool side service superb. If you plan going make sure you get a pool villa..they are the best.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1978,Honeymoon experience in SEMINYAK,50,June 2016,Would definitely return ! Amazing resort - one of the bests in Bali. The food was incredible and the service was top notch. They were so respectful and would stop what they were doing just to say hello. They were not in your face but at the same time you knew you could just stand up from lying on the pool chairs and someone would promptly serve you. We loved our stay there and extended one day there and took a day off of ubud and it was well worth it!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1979,Perfect,50,June 2016,"Was there for 2 nights. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and service was immaculate. Room is huge with a balcony and jacuzzi. On both days, we lounged at the pool, had tea and cookies (delicious) and watched sunset. It was a short but perfect experience at this hotel. Breakfast buffet was really good with plenty of options.
The only drawback was the view from the room. Wished the ocean view wasn't blocked by trees.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1980,Unforgettable Holiday - will Definitely Return!,50,May 2016,"After recommendations from a friend and some good research I am so glad we booked this resort for our 9 night honeymoon. It is so beautiful and clean, the location is right on the beach, close to shops/restaurants and the service and ambiance around the resort made our stay one to remember. After booking the garden view room we luckily enough got upgraded to the beach wing during our stay which I would recommend if you can to pay the bit extra. The garden view room across the street is still a beautiful room and only 2 minutes walk to the main lobby but it was really nice being that extra bit closer to the beach hearing the waves crash at night. The staff at the resort are so friendly and buffet breakfast was absolutely delicious where we loved the coffee and being able to also choose a few options off a menu plus the magnificent buffet. If you are like us and like eating at nice restaurants there are so many options close by within 10 minutes walking distance which makes this location very convenient. We spent everyday lazing by the pool and loved being right on the beach. We look forward to returning in the near future!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1981,Superb 5 star stay!,50,June 2016,"we really had a great holiday time at seminyak beach resort and one of the most beautiful hotel ive ever stayed in! To highlight the things that amazed me the most were : friendly and very accomodatng staffs , cleanliness is excellent, stunning view with matching crashing waves at the bay pool restaurant, food was delicious, ( but really recommend to have more options of halal food ) , relaxing spa a must try one, walking distance shops! Overall review was amazing! Thank you for such an unforgettable experience!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1982,Fantastic stay in Bali,50,June 2016,"The staff at the seminyak beach could not be anymore friendly or attentive . Our room was very comfortable and very well appointed . When we return to Bali we shall definitely stay here again without a doubt . Breakfast was the best we have ever had anywhere in the world .
A big thank you too everyone at the seminyak beach resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1983,Another great stay,50,June 2016,"This is the 3rd time staying here and Id have to say its an amazing spot on Seminyak beach, the staff are great and always friendly, the breakfast is also at a very high standard, its more suited to couples rather than families unless you have very young children as the main thing is the pool and beach plus location to good shopping. If you want to just surf or be by the pool reading a book then this is the place to be.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1984,enjoy seminyak at its best,50,April 2016,"This resort in seminyak is amazing, it is set directly at the beautiful seminyak beach. There are a lot a fantastic restaurants and bars near by like Kudeta or potatoe head beach club. We enjoyed every second.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1985,Heaven on Earth.,50,June 2016,"It seems unfair to reviework such hotels alongside others, since places like this clearly need a category of their own.

It was a five star experience from the get-go, & it just continued to improve during the stay. It is unquestionably one of the most stunning resorts I've stayed in, with luscious yet not overstated beauty in the form of gardens, outdoor pools, seafront restaurants. The service is unfalteringly helpful & polite, with a relaxed, serene atmosphere to boot. Free tea, cakes & biscuits served every afternoon in the seafront tea house. Very reasonable (given the sea views) options for couples dining; lobster and champagne overlooking the ocean for ¬£150 each. Room service has an extraordinary meny at no extra cost so naturally we 'ordered up' for 2 nights and drank cocktails in the suite,s jacquzzi, whilst listening to the soft jazz waft up from the beach.

A glorious, serene visit. From the delightful, local & fresh breakfast buffet to the stunning Spa, with treatment rooms overlookibg the crashing waves...It was like having our honeymoon a couple of years early!!

Fantastic. Keep up the authenticity Seminyak we left as soft as jelly but very very happy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1986,Hotel was good in general,50,June 2016,"Enjoyed our stay here at the Seminyak. The area is nice too. Not to far from shops, nightlife and restaurants. Thee pool is wonderful and the hotels amenities are great too. I would recommend it if you are staying at the seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1987,Amazing Amazing Amazing,50,June 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for three days on our vacation to Bali. The moment we got out of the car to be greeted by the staff we knew it was going to be an amazing experience with the sincere welcome we got. We got got sweet tea drinks while waiting to check in that were refreshing after traveling so far. Also, we got upgraded to a garden view room where we were able to walk straight out to the pool from our sliding glass doors. As we walked into our room there was music playing, the AC was on high, and it was spotless clean. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet every morning because they serve you french press coffee which is literally the best coffee we had the whole trip. The pool was very secluded over looking the roaring ocean. We enjoyed their fresh coconut drinks by the pool. The staff were all very sweet and friendly, Great experience to have my first time to Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1988,A wonderful holiday,50,June 2016,"Good service, friendly staff, wonderful breakfast (especially yummy Egg Benedict), fantastic beach and fascinating/mesmerizing waves. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1989,The closest place to the Garden of Eden,50,May 2016,"There are few places in the world that is a true oasis. The Seminyak Beach Resort is one of those places. I consider three items when rating any hotel: Service, Food, and WOW factor. These may seem simple enough, but it is often hard to find a location that can meet all three. This was not an issue for the Seminyak Beach Resort.

I arrived at Bali a bit after midnight and got to the hotel around 1 am. The moment I laid my feet on the grounds, the entire staff made sure I knew my vacation has started. I was met with a lovely glass of Lemongrass Iced tea. I have to admit after flying for 25 hours, it was quite refreshing. My bags were escorted to my room while I was checking in. Most hotels have you complete the check in process before they will even touch your bags. The entire staff ensured that anything I can think of was handled. They learned my name and would ask if I have any plans for the day each morning. They made recommendations on places to eat and visit on the island. We ended up visiting the Uluwatu Temple based on the recommendation of the front staff. They set us up with a driver and helped plan the day. This location has some of the most beautiful sunset and vistas that I have ever seen. The entire staff was committed to my vacation.

Food and Dining were another home runs for the resort. The Santan restaurant always had a unique mix of local fruits and excellent breakfast options on the buffet. One could taste the freshness in each bite. The breakfast buffet has many of the breakfast standards: waffles, eggs, bacon, etc‚Ä¶ There was also a section for Asian breakfast options and it is simply divine. The soups and rice were full of flavor. All your sense will be entertained as you enter the dining area. Your eyes will be met by an open and airy space cut from white marble. Your nose will embrace the rich smell of Asian spices. Your pallet will burst with flavors not seen in a typical Western diet. The food is great, but the drinks are amazing. I also recommend hitting the bar. It is fully staffed with top shelf options. I enjoyed lying by the pool ordering drinks made with a mix of Balinese fruits. Just a quick tip, visit the pool bar and get the best of both worlds.

The final piece in this story is the WOW factor. There were so many moments when I stood back and the resort took my breath away. I stayed in an Ocean View Villa which I highly recommend. The room was immaculate with an amazing view of the beach. There were a few mornings, I would wake up early and listen to the ocean. I fell in love with my private pool in the room. Another item you will notice on the resort is the grounds. The grounds are kept in excellent condition. Not a single leaf is out of place. Most of this work is done while you are sleeping or during meal time. The single moment that combined dining, service and WOW was my candlelight dinner on the beach. I don‚Äôt want to give too many details, but it was one of the most memorable experiences that I have had in twenty years of travel. Another element not to be overlooked with the resort is simply its location. It is walking distance to Kudeta, Potato Head, the local flea markets, and other great tourist sites. All these locations become part of the resort. As they say in business, ‚ÄúLocation is everything‚Äù

Seminyak Beach Resort‚Äôs attention to detail, food, and embracing of the Balinese culture make it a gem in the heart of paradise. There are many resorts that dot the beaches of Bali, but there is only one Seminyak Beach resort. If you are reading this review, chances are you are thinking about staying in Bali. You have just found a place to call home in of Indonesia.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1990,5th stay for the month of May!,50,May 2016,"Obviously we like to stay here as its our 5th year running at The seminyak! There were many 'old' faces on the staff and the welcome and service they give us every time was as always just amazing! The only thing which hugely marred our first week was that the owner held his unseemly opulent birthday party and the construction of the set took 3 days behind a horrible black cloth obscuring the bar and sea view from our room and barring all 'paying ' guests from using the sanje lounge for lunch and to have a sundowner cocktail... We then had the very noisy party and some drunken ibu on the kareoke to endure until midnight the evening of the party plus the events team banging all night once the party was over deconstructing all the steelwork which meant no sleep for us jet lagged guests in the Beach Wing! I know he owns the hotel but this flaunting of his wealth whilst depriving paying guests of the facilities is really not on.....
Not helped by the fact that the lounge next to reception was also under refurbishment so therefore no residents tea in the afternoon during that time! We were disappointed that this area was stil under construction and remained so throughout our stay despite our hope we might see the new cocktail bar and lounge before we left! This should be a big asset if it has been designed well - we shall see....
Many thanks to all the teams in reception, concierge, housekeeping, breakfast, kitchen, sanje and bar, poolside, spa - you all know we appreciate your wonderful smiles and service at all times - sometimes it's not always perfect but you all try so hard to give every guest the best experience during their stay!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1991,Semfriendly staff,30,June 2016,"This hotel has many good features, friendly staff, close to the shopping area in Seminyak but i didnt like the beach. During our stay we couldn't swim due to the rough waves they have here in bali. Overall i enjoyed the stay, i would recommend this hotel for couples and families. Nothing special though.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1992,beautiful,40,May 2016,"A very nice peaceful hotel a great location has good service and breakfast was nice
love the infinity pool looking out to the ocean. would not recommend for family with kids
wouldn't hesitate going back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1993,Great location wonderful breakfast,40,April 2016,"Great location in Seminyak.
Amazing breakfast something I have never experienced before, you can choose breakfast from the ala carte menu which is far better than the traditional Buffett style you would normally get. Although you can still eat from the buffet. Beautiful food daily!
Room was sufficient ,comfortable & roomy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1994,Great experience,50,June 2016,Wow where to start. This place is better than the W and right up there with the St.regis if you ask me. The rooms are incredible and the service is unparalleled. We arrived and were greeted with welcome tea the staff is always smiling and greeting you. We sat at the outside bar in the pool and had a wonderful time speaking with a Bartender named Wera who was so helpful in giving us recommendations and making sure we had a good time. I will say we moved rooms to the other side (the main resort) I think that is totally worth it. Much more convenient but no complaints at all with this place. For the price you pay you get everything and more. I will come back!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1995,Amazing experiences,50,June 2016,The hotel and staff were amazing - the detail and customer service mind blowing. Highly recommend. Infinity pool and sunsets are fabulous. We spent four nights and did not want to leave. Will definitely be back!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1996,Exceptional 5 Star Stay!!,50,May 2016,"After stalking the reviews for this resort for months it was finally time to experience it for myself. Well, we just returned and I have to say we are so glad we chose to stay here. It was a magnificent experience from check-in to check-out.

ROOM: We arrived a little after midnight, but despite the time the hotel staff was extremely welcoming. The Lemon Grass/Ginger welcome drink was so refreshing. They escorted us to our one-bedroom Oceanview Villa and we were floored by its' beauty. Looks just like the pictures. The sound of the huge ocean waves was just divine. We loved getting the afternoon tea and dessert treats every day. That was a nice touch. As other guests mentioned it does take a long time to fill the tub (1.5 hours to be exact) so plan accordingly, but the water stayed extra hot the entire time. I am so happy I decided to wait as it was very relaxing. Especially when I opened the doors to the little outside area as it made me feel like I was in a Balinese jungle. The bath salts and rose petals were also a nice touch. Love, Love, Love!!!

FOOD: The all-inclusive breakfast was included in our package. It was the best breakfast I've ever had at a resort. They had a bread/dessert/pastry area, traditional Balinese items, International cuisine, fruits, fresh squeezed juices, and you could order items like omelettes and French Toast from the menu. Everything tasted so homemade. We attended the Barong Dance Dinner one night and they gave you sooo much delicious food, but it was so much we couldn't even eat it all! My Honey arranged a candlelight dinner for me one night which was one of the most beautiful setups I could have ever imagined. I was amazed at how they transformed the space. Again the meal was outstanding! The hotel has awesome drinks too. I am not much of a drinker, but all of their drinks were perfect and so full of flavor I wish I could have brought a bartender home with me!

GROUNDS: The staff works day and night to keep the grounds clean. I woke each morning around 4am and watched the ocean waves and would always see someone cleaning the pool which is likely why it always looked so stunning! I love the authentic nature of the statues and carvings around the resort. It was truly a selling point for me. While it was modern and chic, I still wanted to stay somewhere that incorporated the culture and Balinese art and I feel like this hotel delivered. It was so quaint and beautiful. I could not ask for more.

CUSTOMER SERVICE/STAFF: The entire staff gets an A++ from us. Every time we turned the corner we were greeted by name with a warm welcome. They always took the time to ensure we were OK. They helped us book excursions that we previously researched upon arrival and they recommended some fun things for us to do while visiting. The housekeeping staff was also phenomenal. They would clean our room during the day and we had turndown service at night. We were never short of towels/wash clothes and never had any issues.

SPA/MASSAGE: We did utilize the spa facilities one night to use the jacuzzi. Just like everything else it was spectacular. The jacuzzi was very large so you didn't feel confined and then they had a smaller hot tub that was a bit cooler. They also had a water cooler in there in case you got thirsty. I booked a 90 minute full body & foot massage which occurred outside in a gazebo. I loved every minute of it! It was the perfect amount of pressure.

Overall, I would highly recommend this resort to anyone staying in the Seminyak area. The wifi was always strong. It is within walking distance to the town full of shopping, bars, dining, and more. The staff cares about their guests and you do not just feel like a number. The food is phenomenal and you will not regret your decision.

Thank you Seminyak Beach Resort for making our accommodations in Bali so memorable!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1997,Bali at its best!,50,May 2016,"awesome resort!! we will come back as soon as possible! very friendly people, nice and clean as well as spaceous rooms. the entire environment ist just great and we enjoyed a wonderful vacation at your resort. only bad point: due to the limited numbers of chairs at the pool, guests seem to set their alarm clock to six in the morning.. go to the pool area and put towels on 'their' chairs...reserved for the rest of the day although the guests leave for breakfast - or whatever - and return to the pool hours later only!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1998,Amazing,50,May 2016,The resort itself is beautiful the grounds are amazing they have beach huts everwhere. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The staff are amazing very friendly always willing to help.i will return to the wonderful resort.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
1999,5 star stay!,50,May 2016,We stayed at the resort at the end of May and enjoyed it very much. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

2000,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"If you want to combine high level of comfort + unforgettable ocean view + reach breakfast + local traditional entertainment + lovely relaxing infinity pool then Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is your place.
Best location in Seminyak being on the beach and in the same time walking distance from the best restaurants, shops and bars. The Ocean view Suite is so big and comfortable that even with extra 3rd bed in the room we enjoyed our 8 days with a lot of space and convenience. Staff amazingly careful and polite starting from security guards through reception team and all restaurants hostesses and bar tenders. Lovely!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2001,Great location & service but a bit old,30,June 2015,"The hotel is conveniently located 10 minutes by foot away from Seminyak Square and the main street in Seminyak where all the shops and food places are. The service quality from the staff is also quite good and room service was quite prompt as well. However, the hotel is a little bit dated and old and could probably do with a revamp to update it a bit. I had a ocean suite room which is very spacious but the bathroom had a slight dank smell that's probably from water leakage issue. The Jacuzzi in the bathroom with a window view was also not very well kept as I saw some dark algae on the tiles and ended up not using it. The photos on the booking website for the rooms actually look more modern than the actual. I'm into the sleek modern hotel room type of accommodation so the traditional wooden feature heavy feel here didn't quite do it for me.

The pool, however, was quite nice though. There's enough sun beds and we didn't have to get up early to get one and it's literally just next to Kudeta if that's your kind of scene.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2002,Beautiful place in great location,50,May 2016,"We stayed across the road , 2 minute stroll to the fantastic breakfast where you are individually served from a menu and also enjoy the buffet , the pool areas were divine , loved the infinity pool , our room was spacious clean and modern , the staff were all very friendly and helpful , restaurants and shopping were a short stroll away , could not fault",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2003,Perfect stay! So relaxing,50,May 2016,"Wow! Stayed at the Seminyak for 3 nights and the only regret is that it was not longer. From the warm and welcoming reception to check out the whole experience was great.

Room's were well decorated and as you would expect for a 5 * resort. Pool area was magnificent with an infinity pool overlooking the Indian ocean. Above all the staff were fabulous - attentive and exceptionally friendly - a credit to the resort.

Overall a great place for a relaxing break.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2004,Great time - good service and good value,50,May 2016,Nice property with great location right at the beach next to Kudeta. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Do not recommend to stay across the road though. Staff is very friendly and trying to accommodate to provide personalized service and welcomed ambiente. We will definitively come back.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2005,Great Resort with Fantastic Location,50,May 2016,"Prior to picking this resort, I did a lot of research on Trip Adviser for our 11 night stay in May. The Seminyak Beach Resort ticked all my boxes. In terms of location, service, room, right on the beach, and a fabulous infinity pool. I have to say that from the moment we arrived and following our smooth checkin we were shown to our room I knew I had made the right decision.

We originally booked a Premium Beachside room but on arrival where advised that we would be given an upgrade to the Ocean Side Suite. Wow, what an awesome sized room with a Jacuzzi. We were very happy with the room which was located on the 2nd floor. View was set back from the beach and was of the garden, but that was fine, we had a lovely balcony we could sit on and enjoy hearing the the noise of the waves crashing on the beach. Note there are some rooms which are located on the other side of the road, these rooms are a little cheaper, so please be aware of when you do book which side you purchase.

Staff in the hotel are very friendly and hospitable, the security on the entry gate were always friendly and greeted us each time we left and welcomed us back each time we returned. There is also a security guard at the entrance from the beach. At all times we felt very safe.

Infinity pool was great, loved sitting in the water and watching as the waves crashed on the beach. Yes there are hawkers, but if you are not interested they soon walk away, just do not make eye contact. This did not bother us but others may not like it.
The only dislike (and it's only a small one) I had was if you come to the pool in the afternoon beach towels were always not available. Not sure why, but maybe it would help if the hotel introduced a system where guests are accountable for each towel they take and return, as when we we there guests do not need to sign for the towels and they are just easily given out.

Breakfast was included in our package and it was up there as one of the best breakfasts we have had and my husband and I have traveled quite a bit to compare.
To order any eggs you would have to order off the menu, my favourite was the poached eggs and also the omelette. The buffet consisted of a variety of foods, from juices, cereals, pastries, hot western and asian food, fruit and cheeses. A lot to choose from.

Overall we were extremely happy with the Resort and looking at returning to Bali and staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort again on our next stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2006,Wonderful all around!,50,May 2016,"Stayed for 4 nights at this lovely resort. Wanted a location on the ocean and their pool area did not disappoint! Was able to easily walk to several different shopping/dining streets in Seminyak.

Service was also great, very attentive and helpful. Will definitely be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2007,Magnificent / Out of World Experience,50,May 2016,"I stayed at this resort for my honeymoon, and honestly, i've had the most memorable and a very fantastic time ever!

The resort is located near the famous KU DE TA club.

First off, you'll be greeted by the most cordial and hospitable staff ever in the world. every where there were only happy smily faces and good manners.

The rooms were truly jaw dropping. I opted for a garden view room and it was just amazing. All amenities were present and room service was efficient and caring.

The backyard of the hotel is the indian ocean!! . the hotel is directly open to the beach and the scene was just marvellous!

pool side was amazing as well with most tasty and beautiful cocktails to order along.

I recommend anyone to stay at this hotel, you'll never regret it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2008,Great location and hotel,50,May 2016,"We were very pleased with our stay at the hotel. They have an amazing infinity pool and great location to the beach/ shops. We checked out a few other hotel pools and I do have to say theirs is the nicest one around.

I do suggest using the spa during the day. I booked my appointment at night and a portion of the massage was overlooking the ocean which would have been better during the day.

The staff is amazing. They greeted us with drinks as soon as we arrived to check in and we were able to book tours and services with their team.

The rooms are very modern and sleek with a touch of Balinese charm.We originally were booked to be in the garden but the week before our stay we got an email relocating us to another hotel. They made up for the inconvenience by booking us in the ocean view suite at no additional cost. They also provided a nice bottle of wine.

2009,The Seminyak Ocean Suite,50,May 2016,"This place is just amazing and words cannot describe the feeling you have swimming in the pool watching the waves crash into the beach directly behind you.
This was the only resort we found with a swim up bar in a second pool which meant we could entertain without disturbing other guests.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2010,Poor for a five star hotel,20,May 2016,"I really tried to like this hotel but the more I tried to like it the more I disliked it. We arrived about 10pm and was given a very short tour of the breakfast area and the foyer area where the ATM machine was. Whilst during our stay we seen other people getting a full tour of the hotel and premises. We was staying in the garden wing which we was taken to in a golf buggy across a road which can be very busy at times then passed security to the open fronted entrance. Our rooms was situated on the ground floor and had a balcony but across from the room was a pavilion which cut out a lot of natural light to an already dark room. There is no main light in the room just wall lights and a couple of lamps which didn't give off sufficient light to brighten a dark room. Everytime we got changed we had to have the lights on so had to draw the curtains so no one walking pass could look in. The bathroom had a slight smell of sewers and when I mentioned it to our friends they also had the smell in their bathroom. Breakfast was a chore as some mornings there was no security at the gate so had to pull open the heavy gate and then close it behind us. Then it was across the road and about a four minute walk to the main hotel. The breakfast area is outside but undercover no option of sitting in a air conditioned room. Your shown to a table and given a menu and drinks orders taken. You have to order your eggs and mushrooms off the menu but are not told how long it would take so ended up waiting for them to be brought out then going to the buffet to get the rest of my breakfast. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the breakfast items or the whole breakfast experience to be honest and only ate here the first and last days of our stay. While returning to our room after breakfast I was nearly run down by a manic moped rider. If your lucky security might stop the traffic as you wait to cross the road but thats only if they are there and aware that your returning to your room. They also do a take out breakfast but this is hit and miss as some mornings while we waited for it to be cooked after ordering the night before we ended up with three types of bread that just ended up in the bin. The infinity pool is right on a public beach and we used it once for about twenty minutes. In this time I was asked if I wanted to buy fake sunglasses, watches etc etc by about half a dozen hawkers. I think they take it in turns to hassle you because as soon as one goes another turns up. Even if you use the sun loungers and look out to the sea you get the hawkers waving their wares at you. This is not what I expected while staying in a five star hotel and using their infinity pool. So I only used this pool once. Again not a enjoyable experience. The pool in the garden wing is small but then you have to put up with the road noise. The hotel location is very good and not far from shops, bars, restaurants. This was by far the worse hotel of our stay while touring Indonesia. Would I stay at this hotel again the answer is NO not even if I won a two week stay. Its not a place I found relaxing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2011,Made to feel special,50,May 2016,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in for attention to detail, cleanliness of rooms and grounds, excellent food and choice of food, entertainment and security. The staff are friendly, learn your name very quickly which helps to make you feel special, nothing is too much, very caring but not in your face , they just seem to appear when you need them. Rooms are spacious and ours led on to a terrace which overlooked the central garden on the ocean side of the hotel. If you want to eat out very wide selection within in short distance of the hotel , good area for bars and music although we couldn't hear anything in the hotel grounds. Also very good for shopping in the area.Very peaceful at all times even in the pool area. The infinity pool overlooks the beach and even though vendors come near the pool they are not in any way a nuisance. There is a lovely area for drinks and food overlooking the beach and to watch the sunset. The breakfasts are amazing with a very wide choice, no rushing to grab things as food was always being replenished, beautiful freshly squeezed juices and freshly made yogurts too. A very special place and well done to all the staff who make it so special.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2012,Great location and pool,40,May 2016,"We loved:
the pool area overlooking the beach
fabulous breakfasts
location in walking distance to shops and restaurants, and a short cab ride to other restaurants.
room comfortable and clean but not up to the standard for the price

We were disappointed in:
size of the room
lack of service around the pool area ( had to go and ask for water etc., nobody came around filling glasses or asking if we wanted to order anything to eat or drink )
lack of attention to detail (e.g. only received treats on pillow once all week, when they were meant to put something there every night )
Hot water not really very hot
no beach bag in the room
slow to make up room ( rarely done before mid afternoon )
only one morning yoga class a week

Normally we stay at the another luxury hotel on the beach, close to this one. We thought we would try the Seminyak for a change, although it was a similar price. We were disappointed. Although it is a lovely hotel, it just wasn't the same overall experience as next door. We didn't feel special, and the staff, although lovely, were just not as well trained to attend to the guests' needs. The little touches that we are used to just were not there. We will probably go back to the other hotel next year. Feedback to management would be to conduct more/better training for your staff. Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2013,Dream holiday,50,May 2016,"A wonderful holiday, the resort is beautiful and the staff are just so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The pool area is gorgeous and cocktails by the pool at sunset is something tourist flock to see and you can get the view from one of the best locations. Breakfast is not your normal crazy buffet, table service is included and is relaxing with good coffee, lat√® and tea! Staff speak English really well! I'd recommend you spoil yourself, you won't be disappointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2014,Amazing!,50,May 2016,"My husband and I spent the first three days of our honeymoon in Bali here. The rooms are beautiful and clean, the pool has the most incredible view and the employees are helpful and sweet. Seminyak is a great place to relax and the hotel was in the center of it all which made it easy to check all the cool restaurants lounges and shopping off our list. And the food... The breakfast buffets are incredible and different every day. Everything is fresh and delicious.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2015,Always great!,50,May 2016,"Bed, facilities, breakfast, staff is always fantastic here. Particularly a great choice if you don't want a hectic breakfast time or you are looking for a break from kids as there's very rarely kids here. The infinity pool is gorgeous looking right over the ocean. Great location too!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2016,"This is 5 star, but...",50,April 2016,"I caught a lucky break in this hotel, on checking in I went through all the rituals of getting my room and just as I was being ushered to it, I realised they were bringing me across the road, watch out! I was able to negotiate a beach view room for a small amount of dollars and it made a huge difference. Service, pool, beach in front, sundown drinks, all good. Moment above and beyond, I booked 3 days beginning Friday in error, I meant to book beginning Saturday, no charge. Location, I had dinner in the W, Fire, walk from hotel. Drinks in Ku de Ta and Potato Head, walk from the hotel. No taxis all weekend, great location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2017,Relaxing and wonderful holiday,40,May 2016,The beach front location is definitely a big plus point to enjoy the beach and the surf anytime. The place is well maintained. We like the breakfast and the a la carte buffet menu! The staff are friendly and helpful! We have an enjoyable and lovely stay at this resort!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2018,Fantastic. Best hotel of my whole trip!,50,May 2016,"I spent the first 3 days of my 11 days in Bali at this gorgeous property. Staff was 10/10 helpful and friendly, taking care of my every need from the minute I arrived. Food was also excellent, and fast. Coffee was ordered and arrived in under 7 minutes! The grounds and pool are fabulous too. Gorgeous sunsets and epic beach walks, felt very safe. All around exceptional stay, highly recommend this classy spot!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2019,Paradise,50,May 2016,"The hotel grounds are tranquil and lush and have a perfect vista of the ocean. The staff were professional and treated us with genuine friendliness and care. Watching the sun go down, drinking an awesome mojito helped us unwind like never before. The breakfasts are elegant and plentiful, each day there were new choices of exotic dishes. The spa was beautifully appointed and meticulously clean, the masseuse was strong and gentle at the same time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2020,Exceptionally stunning. Great service. A flawless hotel.,50,March 2016,"I honestly couldn't fault this hotel. We were picked up from the airport by one of the hotel drivers, he was very friendly and chatty and helpful. Transfer from the airport was only 40 mins (usual traffic) and he gave us a tour guide introduction to Bali after finding out it was our first time visiting.

Arrived at hotel around 1.30pm, had to wait a little to check in but was given a delicious non-alcohol cocktail/refreshment and cool face towels whilst we waited. Our 1 bed villa was ready by 2pm. All the staff were really gracious hosts and attentive.

The 1 bed villa/complex with private swimming pool is simply stunning and offers maximum privacy. Room service was always very quick to deliver and house keeping was often completed in the time we went to breakfast. Breakfast option were great, eggs to order or pancakes or french toast and an interesting international buffet selection. We spent most of our time in our villa and private pool but really enjoyed going for 4pm Afternoon Tea on the terrace overlooking the beach, watching the surfers. Theres a surf school near by and the beach is very long so great for walking. In either direction you will come across other beach bars, right next door is infamous Ku De Ta and a 15 min walk in opposite direction will take you to Potato Head.

The hotel is right in the heart of Seminyak, the highstreet is a stone's throw and has a massive selection of restaurants and quirky bars and coffee shops. Wonderfully cosmopolitan and unexpectedly trendy. Think London's Shoreditch or NYC's Meatpacking district. Very cool.

We also sampled the hotel's spa which is serene. Prices are high but not unreasonable for a 5 star resort. There are loads of spas in the area if you are looking for something cheaper, but the spa in the hotel is gorgeous and the spa staff offered us special discounts. The treatments themselves were wonderful, if not a little firm! We had our treatments on our first evening,so was a perfect way to begin the holiday.

Eating and drinking out was good quality and also cheap so we didn't dine at the hotel too much besides the odd lunch ordered to our villa. Selection of the lunch/dinner menus could be improved.

The hotel was exactly what we wanted for our week away to truly relex. Highly recommended for couples. Not sure that it caters to families too much.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2021,10 days in Bali,40,May 2016,"Enjoyable stay, very comfortable & spacious room, excellent breakfast buffet, unfortunately there was lack of good service around the pool...one had to look for assistance rather than the pool staff approaching guests to provide service.
All guest services staff, were very polite , helpful & willing & overall our stay was very nice.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2022,The best of Seminyak,50,May 2016,"We loved this place.
Total luxury - right on the beach - and with fantastic surf. A fantastic place to explore Seminyak which we loved - the spas, coffee shops, eateries etc.
We also made the most of the complimentary yoga and pilates classes.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2023,Great location in Seminyak. Directly on the beach,40,April 2016,"Good location, close to everything. Hotel grounds are interesting and pools and gardens are very nice. Incredibly comfortable beds and quiet rooms.You could hear the ocean. Atttentive staff made you feel very special. Rooms where incredible. hops within walking distance

Dinner restaurant and food very disappointing. Restaurants poorly positioned. Wi-fi was poor",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2024,Amazing stay in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"Amazing stay in Seminyak, gorgeous rooms and pool. Breakfast was amazing! The staff literally can't do enough for you. Location is perfect, easy to walk to all the bars and restaurants but quiet enough to be away from the noise! Will definitely be visiting here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2025,Stunning Seminyak Beach Resort!,50,April 2016,"Loved our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort. We were holidaying in Bali for our wedding and honeymoon and stayed in Seminyak for the first few days as easy access to the consulate for visits for our legal paperwork etc required for our wedding. The location was stunning beachfront with infinity pools overlooking the beach, beautiful tropical gardens with bales everywhere for yoga, meditation or ust a quiet spot to read, relax or soak up the atmosphere with a drink. The food and drinks menu was impressive and great standard and variety. The service was amazing from checkin, everyday service and all the small extra touchesthat made us feel very special like the flower bath - amazing! Thank you for looking after us!!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2026,Excellent location,50,May 2016,Having this been our second stay here still can't fault this place. Accommodation is perfect. Clean comfy and air con üëçThe staff here are always so happy and willing to make our stay memorable. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2027,Excellent place & service,50,May 2016,"An excellent location in Seminyak area to spend your holiday & enjoy the sunset.
Very good service. Warm welcome from security, Front office and all waiters / waitresses. Very nice pool bar & swimming pool area facing the ocean.
I certainly recommend this resort to all my business colleagues & friends to stay in this resort hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2028,Outstanding on every level,50,May 2016,"This place has everything going for it. It's location right on the beach and next door to Ku De Ta and a short stroll along the beach to La Lucciola was perfect as we really just wanted a place to stay put and unwind. Boutique with gorgeous gardens complete with outdoor pavilions to rest in while having lunch, the pool is simply stunning and right on the beach front. Even though we had our own pool in the villa, we still spent time in the main pool as it was so beautifully done. The staff are extremely friendly and very attentive. Our 1 bedroom pool villa had everything you would expect of 5 star accommodation, but most importantly it was private and quiet. The bed was a joy to sleep in with comfortable mattress, pillows and crisp sheets. Everything was perfect. The spa is a jewel in their crown with a wonderful array of quality treatments performed to a very high standard. The food was good but occasionally a little on the bland side; which is really the only area for improvement I can possibly think of. Well done to the team at Seminyak Beach and Spa. Our experience here has been unforgettable. We will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2029,Could not have loved this hotel more,50,May 2016,"This hotel was just incredible from service to food, to facilities.

The main pool was just amazing, looking straight out onto the beach, and a very chilled atmosphere. The staff went out of their way to be polite and helpful, always waiting on our every need. This indeed felt like a 5* beach resort, and I would be eager to go back again.

Our room was a garden facing view, which was just across the road from the main hotel, although this didn't matter one bit. They transported you everywhere in buggies (if you were feeling lazy to walk).

We had advised it was our first wedding anniversary, and they did our room up to an immaculate standard, even providing a rose petal bath and a cake to celebrate our anniversary.

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2030,First class,50,May 2016,Great location on the beach yet still close to everything seminyak has to offer. Breakfasts are great quality with changes everyday. The rooms are spacious and well maintained snd i like the balinese styling compared to the modern style u find in all capital cities. The service and friendly nature of the staff is the standout of this resort and coildnt be faulted.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2031,Good location,30,February 2016,"-The resort is actually split into two areas by the road. So I highly recommend travellers to double check with the Resort about your room location. As the room we first got was ""garden view"", the room was filled with humid and moldy smell. But the Resort helped us to change to another room and we really appreciated it.
-The beach pool is excellent.
-The service and the staff is excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2032,Great Location,40,April 2016,"I choose the resort for its location, the proximity to the beach and the local shops/restaurants. And the location did not disapoint.

5 minutes walk to nearby seminyak Square which also has a complimentary buggy service to take you home. Easy walk to all ""eat street: restaurants. The other direction you can also walk to restaurants such as La Lucchiolla, motel mexicola, sea circus & potato head.

The resort was lovely. Be very careful when booking to choose the beach front location. I noticed the two locations when booking and reading reviews I notice a lot of people did not notice this and were unhappy on arrival. There is another location across the road, the rooms are cheaper. I believe this should be made a lot clearer than it actually is, I am very careful when researching so I knew but made note that it was a bit confusing to would be guests. And the reviews here reflect this.

Hotel food was too expensive, just eat down the street. On arrival our room wasn't ready so we were taken to the pool side restaurant, 2 small burgers & 2 Cokes over $50 AUD. The breakfast buffet is great, made to order eggs/pancakes/waffles & coffees are included.

All hotel staff are very friendly and very attentive.

We were offered the hotel car to take us to Kuta one day as we were waiting for a taxi, for the price of 200,000 RP. The staff member told us a taxi would be more, but I knew otherwise. We declined and the taxi was only 70,000 RP as excepted. This left me feeling a bit off, as I knew the hotel staff member was trying to rip us off.

WIFI in the resort is perfect, room was clean, well appointed and spacious.
I would stay here again, however its not cheap.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2033,Massage in a tranquil location,50,May 2016,This place is amazing located in the Seminyak Beach Resort. If you are looking for a relaxing massage in a tranquil location then this is it. Yes more expensive than the ones on the street but worth it. My friend and i payed $100 AUD for a 90 minute package which included a 1 hour body massage and 30 minute facial which was cheaper than what we would pay in Australia. We will definitely book in again before we leave.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2034,"Amazing, tranquil experience with attentive staff",50,May 2016,"You feel pampered in every way, great food, very friendly and very capable staff. Amazing views, great location on the beach , 5 minutes walkable vicinity of Seminyak main shopping, beautiful accommodation- am surely coming back!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2035,Excellent,50,April 2016,"All services excellent, the best hotel I have been, perfect breakfast, perfect situation, employees really look after clients every moment, perfect place for a perfect honeymoon, suggestion to have a balinese m√°s saga there",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2036,Luxury vacation,50,April 2016,This was really more than I expected! We felt warmly welcome by the nice and friendley staff. We stayed in the private pool villa with seawiew that we can really recommend. The hotel was right on the beach and just 10-minutes walk from Semanyak square. Would definitely go there again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2037,Very relaxing,50,May 2016,Great attention to detail from all the staff at this hotel. The mangers & staff should be very proud. The room was 10/10 food 10/10 location for us 10/10. We will be back for another stay. The beach side pool is fantastic and gardens perfect.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2038,Amazing long weekend at the Seminyak Beach,50,May 2016,"We had a lovely stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. Starting with the welcoming reception staff, the check in process was incredibly quick and smooth. We arrived very late on the Friday evening and were glad to be in our room, unpacked and in bed with an hour. I was delighted to receive a room upgrade in order to accomodate our request of two beds. This was very kind and much appreciated.

The breakfast buffet was lovely with your choice of perfectly poached eggs, delicious waffles, pancakes, the lot!

The view at the infinity pool is just as beautiful as the photos. We had many blissful hours lying by the pool, enjoying the cool ocean breeze and sampling the cocktail menu.

I cannot recommend the Kahyangan Spa more highly. You will receive world class service and a luxurious experience that is well out of reach of the other local spas in the area. My first top to toe treatment was so blissful that I returned for a 90 minute massage. Flawless!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2039,Best break I've had in years,50,May 2016,Too short a trip for such a magnificent place. Loved every minute of it. Staff were very friendly with no task too great for them. Rooms were superb! Breakfast is very good with a great a la carte menu included in the room fee. A must stay in Bali!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2040,Blissful stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa.,50,May 2016,"First stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa but definitely not our last.The resort is a boutique style, not like the big resorts which offers so much more detail to the guests needs and wants. The attention to detail from the rooms to the grounds to food and beverages was second to none. The staff were absolutely incredible, they made you feel like family, nothing was beyond them. So incredibly relaxing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2041,Excellent!,50,May 2016,"What a lovely place to stay!

The rooms were perfect for our needs. The hotel facilities were lovely - the restaurant food was delicious, the pool was spectacular, The staff were friendly and would go above and beyond our expectations.

Definitely coming back soon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2042,Be careful with your belongings!,30,February 2016,"We went down for sunset. Was very picturesque the seating umbrellas and so on. My husband asked me to look after his wallet. I stood up and it must have fallen out of my pocket, in a flash someone had grabbed it. There are many hawkers on the beach flogging all sorts. Anyway even though we were surrounded by our friends nobody seen anything. They were bloody quick!
So big lesson learned do NOT take any valuable items.
Very disappointing.
Sad as you can see beautiful scenery at sunset but I cannot remember that only being robbed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2043,Fantastic hotel,50,April 2016,"We stayed in the ocean view villa for 2 weeks. The villa is truly stunning. Every member of staff at the hotel was friendly, welcoming and they all came across as very genuine. I didn't think the service would be better than some of the hotels we have visited in Thailand but it was, by some distance. The stand out member of staff for us was Nika. We had a minor issue with the villa one night which the GM and her staff corrected quickly, plus the issue wasn't really their fault so I can't complain. Every meal, including the free breakfast, was great. The f&b manager even took the time to meet the guests to check they were happy. I will definitely visit this hotel again later this year, probably at Xmas. I can't think of anything to critique other than the lack of EPL football on the hotel tv channels, but I wouldn't be surprised if my other half had paid them to have the channel removed from our villa. I highly recommend this hotel and I'm very fussy!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2044,Beautiful people,50,May 2016,"Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is in the perfect location. Right on Seminyak beach and close walking distance to all of the best cafes, restaurants and shops if Seminyak.
The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed (we were lucky enough to receive an upgrade).
The hotel's amenities - from the amazing affinity poor overlooking the ocean to the beautiful gardens were complete luxury.
The breakfast is delicious!
The best thing about this hotel is the amazing staff.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2045,Good Hotel,40,April 2016,My husband and I spent 5 nights in a Seaview Villa in April to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel is in a great spot so you can walk to the shops and restaurants easily. The Villa itself was very nice with a lovely pool. It would have been nice to have the sea view without having to stand up to see it though. All they would have to do is cut the hedge a bit lower and it would be a perfect view. Every day fresh fruit was provided in the room and complimentary afternoon tea was served by the beach. The breakfast was included and was good. The only downsides we found were that the air conditioning units in our room dripped due to condensation and I don't think much can be done about this as the units were above the doors so every time they are opened they are subjected to hot air hence the condensation. My husband apparently ordered a cake for our anniversation and they forgot and it came a day late. We did mention these things on checkout and the hotel were very apologetic and and we have been suitably remunerated. I can't comment on the shared pool as we went out on day trips and used our own private pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The staff were excellent and it was very clean. You can sit by the beach for cocktails and watch the fabulous sunsets.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2046,Good Choice,40,April 2016,"We chose to stay in Seminyak this time because we would go for eating, shopping and feel the festivity of night live of Bali.

I am impressed when entering this hotel, because I can feel more resort than any other hotels in Seminyak. Friendly staff since entering the gate. Very helpful reception staff.

The room was great!! With private terrace, clean,modern and spacious bathroom, complete amenities.

What most interesting, this hotel has private beach at back of the hotel which not many hotel in Seminyak has it.

The egg benedict for breakfast was perfect!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2047,Beautiful,30,April 2016,"I patronised Seminyak Beach Resort with my girlfriend for 3 days and 2 nights few weeks back. Luckily we booked ""beach wing"" that is actually closer to the beach (was not specified clear on booking.com that garden wing is located across the road). Lunch is quite decent. A ""free"" afternoon tea was ok on the first day, however on the second day savoury part of food was not served (only cakes were there). We visited hotel restaurant on 1 night, the menu is quite pricey compared to nearby restaurants (ku-de-ta, etc).

The major disappointment was ""The Cellar"" that is supposedly featuring over 150 labels - in fact it was an empty room with less than 20 labels of wines, also its a not shop to buy wine but just a wine cellar of the hotel restaurant.

Room service was not consistent - first day and night it was perfect, the second day i had ants around the bed - upon informing room service was quite active to come in and offer us a spray, however they did not change the bedsheets and did not make up a room in the evening.

Staff was friendly and welcoming though.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2048,Great hotel!,40,May 2016,"The hotel and staff were great. Food was a 3 star, especially the pool food. Love the beach and hanging by the beautiful infinity pool. Very helpful concierge. Location was great.. Right next to ku de ta",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2049,Easter break,40,April 2016,"Room was excellent although we were staying at the annex across the road from the main complex which was a little inconvenient. Staff were all very helpful and facilities were generally first class.
Very handy location near to bars, beach and many restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2050,Perfect Resort for Adult Travelers,50,April 2016,"Upon checking in we were upgraded to 2 bedroom garden villa which was perfect for my travel group of 4. Garden villa had private pool and lounge area with table, bar and sofa to hang out. The room was spacious and bathroom was huge. The only minor issue I found was there there weren't enough electrical outlets in the room and there were no electrical outlets for the hair dryer in the bathroom but we got by. The infinity pool was beautiful and breakfast was fantastic. There were buffet table items (pastries, fruits, bacon, Asian food, etc.) as well as items like pancakes, eggs, etc that you can order from menu. Was a very elegant breakfast vs some of the more cheap breakfast buffets you get a some of the ""luxury"" hotels. Another item to note is that all of the guests were adults and there were no families with kids. So if you are a family with little kids you may want to look for different option. However, if you are an adult traveler looking for some peace and quiet with no kids running around, this place is perfect. Location was great and staff was fantastic.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2051,Review After Stay At Hotel,40,April 2016,"All staffs are very friendly. Room is acceptable though not very spacious in Garden Room.
Location is very good, easy access for food, massage and shopping.

Proper beach, good for walks to the Bars for Sunset.
Great waves.
Room is verry comfort, clean, great service.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2056,Incredible Getaway! Absolute Perfection!,50,April 2016,"After my second stay at The Seminyak Resort & Spa I cannot give it a better review. The first time I went with my partner and stayed on the main side of the resort and the second time across the road with my sister. I thought it would phase me being across the road but it really was not a problem at all! The rooms across the road are newer, and it is literally SO close! The infinity pool is incredible, the grounds are stunning, the traditional balinese rooms are immaculate and super comfortable (love the balcony either looking over ocean or onto grounds) there are barely any children, staff are beautiful, massages are fantastic, and the restaurant is delicious (had a traditional balinese on our last night).

If you are looking for a resort that is right in the heart of Seminyak. Walking distance to all the major cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping then you have found your place. I have stayed in Seminyak and Legian multiple times and this is BY FAR my favourite resort! Ticks all the boxes! Thank you again to the wonderful team at The Seminyak Resort and Spa! Cannot wait to come back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2057,Fairly cheap rooms very clean and quiet good location,40,April 2016,We will defiantly be coming back here very good location near Seminyak square but very quiet. Rooms are very clean and neat and new wifi works everywhere and is fast enough to watch YouTube etc. Breakfast is very good although lunch near the pool is expensive 2 small burgers and 2 cokes was over $50 aud! Other then that it's awsome!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2058,Convenient Luxury,40,April 2016,Comfortable bed. Clean room. Nice pool. Nice beach. Next to Ku De Ta. Convenient location 7min walk to the hustle and bustle of Seminyak Square. Quiet. Friendly staff. Stay at the Beach wing. The garden wing is across road but 30sec away and buggies available. Villas available. Nice glass chapel that free tea is provided. Staff are well trained and well spoken.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2059,"Nice hotel, even tho expensive by Bali standards",40,April 2016,"Nice hotel. Facilities very good, pool area right on beachside which was nice. I had suite in the main hotel building which had ""ocean views"", in fact the hotel is set quite far back from the beach I could only just sea the ocean over the tree tops. Breakfast excellent (tho pretty expensive by Bali standards!) I'd happily stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2060,Peace and Tranquility at the beach,50,April 2016,"If you are looking for peace and tranquility this is the place. The security can not be beat! The staff were friendly and personable. A previous review had mentioned that the constant greetings of the staff seem contrived but we felt that the staff were genuine even if it was scripted . The pool is amazing, great view, calm environment, fresh towels always available, and great service from the staff (drinks and food available). The food was good quality and we ate at the hotel for breakfast and pool side lunches. The rooms are air conditioned and nicely appointed, loved the stand alone bathtub and rain shower. Be aware that while the room is air conditioned the rest of the resort, including the dining room, are not. The resort has beach access and we found the beach to be un-crowded with surf access immediately in front of the resort. We will stay at this property again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2061,We had a wonderful time!,50,April 2016,"We had an absolutely wonderful time, the service was great and the views are absolutely beautiful. Our room was lovely and the pool is idyllic. We would highly recommend this hotel, we might even go back next weekend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2062,Piece of Peace,50,April 2016,"Hopped on a plane to Bali for the weekend and stayed at this wonderful hotel. The quality of service was superb and the staff constancy smiling.
Perks? It's got a lovely infinity pool and its next door to Ku De Ta.
They also have a in house spa and you can chose to have your massages out in one of garden gazebos and slip into spa heaven listening to the sound of waves ceasing on the beach just beyond",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2063,Perfect location and stunning resort,40,April 2016,"This was our first stay at 'the Seminyak' after a few trips to Bali and was stunned how beautiful the gardens and rooms are.

I could spend all day at the amazing infinity pool which over looks a surf break at Seminyak beach. Once you hit the beach from the pool it's a very short walk to KuDeTa or La Lucciola.

The staff are the hotels best assets!

We were at the hotel celebrating a special occasion and the hotel were subzero ensuring it was a night to remember.

We planned to got to KuDeTa for subset cocktails but the view from our room was so good that we just ordered drinks to our room to watch the sun go down.

Will stay here each time I come to Bali.

Only considerations is that you pay for things as go. Hotel does have atm on site so not a huge issue.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2064,Small Resort with Great Service,50,March 2016,"We've usually stayed at larger resorts. This smaller resort was a nice change, at least if you are more concerned with relaxation in a nice environment with good service, rather than partying.

It felt like all of the service staff knew us, and they were all very nice. Food was good. We would definitely go back here!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2065,I want to move here,50,April 2016,"Great service, great breakfast, outstanding staff. Stayed at seminyak and then went to ubud. Cut the ubud trip short to come back to seminyak beach resort because we missed it so much. Can't recommend highly enough.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2066,Loveky,40,May 2015,I came here on a week holiday with my boyfriend. The hotel was nice- the foyer was nice and so were the rooms. The grounds and pools are well kept. Staff were polite. The buffet breakfast each morning was delicious with so much variety. 2 minute walk to seminyak beach. Would stay here again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2067,This place is amazing- luxurious yet relaxed,50,April 2016,"My husband had been stressing to find a place in Bali that was luxurious and ideal for a much needed romantic getaway and boy did he get it right! Our beach front private villa with its own pool and spa took my breath away. The area is so spacious and the attention to detail including providing sandals, hats, fans, hairbrushes etc is amazing. The food so far has been extremely high quality and the service 100% 5 star. We've stayed in some of the most beautiful places throughout the world but this place is in the top 5- will be definitely be coming back!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2068,Great location and nice rooms,40,March 2016,"Decided to try a new hotel in Seminyak and stayed here for 4 nights.

The best part of this hotel is the location - very convenient to get around Seminyak and close to nice restaurants and shopping. Pool is relatively nice and the hotel has a nice breakfast spread.

Staff are generally friendly and courteous although we did experience some problems during check out who insisted that we used the phone for a local call when we didn't.

Rooms are large, clean and nicely decorated.

It's a nice hotel although I won't rate it a 5 star. It's more of a nice slightly upmarket boutique hotel in a good location. If you are looking for a more posh 5 star resort - the W hotel just nearby this location is a better fit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2069,ONLY THE BEST WILL DO! SEMINYAK BEACH RESORT HAS IT ALL,50,April 2016,"From the minute you arrive at the front gates until the day you have to depart the Seminyak Beach Resort has it all.
After spending many holidays in Seminyak and Legian areas I decided to try a new resort.
We all read reviews as I have many, yes there is always a few people have a unpleasant time, but when you read its normally something petty. Well let me tell you this 5 star but no Bling resort it just fabulous.

The rooms are clean and large, with everything you will need during your stay. House Keeping goes out of their way to make everything possible, from the minute you rise and wander out for a nice fresh Latte, to the end of the night your chasing a nice cocktail it‚Äôs all there. The grounds are lush and Immaculate!!

Breakfast has a large range of fresh fruit, juices and cooked breakfast that has an extensive selection.

Then there is that most amazing pool; endless looking over the ocean with ample sunbeds, fresh clean towels and umbrellas after you has had too much sun. The ocean in front of the beach club has its own lifeguard and has safety flags.

The staff by the pool offers you a full option of well-priced drinks and quality food to help you enjoy your day.

If you get a chance to stay in a suite, you will not be disappointed, we got the chance for 2 nights out of our 7 and its amazing. It was a perfect way to say thank you. Seminyak Beach Resort, we will be back. To Maria and your staff I say thank you for making myself and Monique welcome.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2070,The Stay and the Pool are Superb!,50,April 2016,"My second time staying at The Seminyak. Perfect location to roam in the chic and hip Seminyak area. The resort is just in the middle of all the shopping and restaurant in this area. You feel welcomed in this resort. It shows from the staffs whom make sure that your stay is perfect and enjoyable. It was! And, the pool by the beach! Oh, you should try it. I am not a sit by the pool and read a book type of person, but this pool is just so nice to just sit and relax a bit. I enjoyed my stay here, though the resort needs improvement to stay competitive from many new resorts nearby, but the persons inside whom I really appreciated.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2071,Quality & Location,40,April 2016,From the moment we arrived we were greeted with efficient & smiles. The check in was fast & we were accompanied to our room but on the way to the room we were given a short guided tour of the hotels grounds. We loved our room it was spacious & so was the toilet. My Favourite of the hotel is the infinity pool by the beach. It was beautiful & has a great view for the famous Bali Sunset. The staff at the poolside was extremely helpful & polite. The happy hours from 5.30-6.30 was only offered when you sit at the sofa & not at the pool bed. That I think is not fair especially when there were limited sofa & chairs. I wasn't going to move just to get a discount. This is something that is unheard off just for an hour! Besides that it's a beautiful hotel even the pool bar was cosy in the corner. What can I say? I'll be back again to stay but next time it will be the villa.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2072,Dream pool,50,March 2016,"Right on the beach watching the world go by with good service and maybe staff, what better way to spread a week.
Locally close to main drag 5 mins out and right but nicer entertainment turn left or jump in a 1.5 cab and find restuarants and bars.
Bali trying to be up market with new shopping centres but are they all fake?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2073,Seminyak's Lina saved our life,50,April 2016,"this hotel is really really wonderful, ashamed that we did not really could enjoy everything, since my son was really ill, but the Lina, the receptionist has been the best. She helped us wherever she could, offers administrational help, gave us hopes and hugs whenever needed and surprised us with small things to bring a smile on our face... Wonderful! all the staff are really nice, open and helped... thanks for you all... and there was mr. superman who always tried to let my son forget his pain for some minutes... thanks for this, Superman!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2074,Beautifull compact resort,50,April 2016,Great location within walking distance to town cendere friendly staff and an exelent breakfast bufet . The sea is just right for the surfers wonderfull sunset view would definetly stay again. Recomend to allah c√ºmlesi at allah ages,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2075,Peace and relaxation at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,April 2016,Last week was our second trip this year to The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. This has to be one of our most favorite resort spots in Southeast Asia. The rooms are delightfully relaxing and calm. The infinity pool right next to the ocean is just what we needed for a time to relax and enjoy the sounds and sights of the ocean. Seminyak Beach Resort's staff couldn't be friendlier and helpful. The Spa is a must during your visit!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2076,Great hotel for honeymooners,50,April 2016,"My husband and had a very pleasant stay here. We got a free upgrade to a nicer room. The staff is the best I have ever seen! Very good selection of breakfast, (fresh juices, fruits, pastries, etc) If you plan to stay here you must try the French toast!!!! The pool and beach side is beautiful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2077,Amazing Resort with Excellent Service!,50,April 2016,"The overall experience of the resort was somewhat 'magical' from the prompt arrival pick-up from the airport to the resort with a smooth check-in experience. F&B was above average from presentation, from taste to quality and freshness of the ingredients. Most of all, the service was excellent! All staff were genuinely warm, helpful and friendly. The pool area was mesmerizing with its beautiful and relaxing set-up facing the beach and private surrounding cabanas. Location is convenient as well within walking distance to an array of cafes, restaurants and shops. I would definitely recommend the resort to anyone who is looking for a good quality stay in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2078,Luxury-Location-Tranquil,50,March 2016,"Wonderful stay, the day starts with a buffet breakfast of variety from around the world and a different surprise each day. Coffee is good. Staff are professional and friendly. Room service is good. Pools are fantastic especially the private cabanas near pool bar. The restuarant near the pool bar food selection, quality and price was not to same standard as the rest of the establishment. All in all fantastic location and luxurious stay. We will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2079,Great at the 60% off rate!,40,April 2016,"I rate all my reviews based on price versus value for money versus expectation (other guest reviews).

We stayed here at a 60% discount rate in the Garden Wing (around 140 GBP per night), and I must admit we did have a wonderful time. One down side was that we arrived at 1.30pm to check in. We were told that check in was between 2-3pm, and we would need to wait for a moment (the website states 2pm). We were fine waiting, except we ended up sitting in the waiting area for around 1 hour before we decided we should probably just eat lunch instead of waiting there - we just didn't expect we would be waiting so long.

We stopped by the pool to eat. I ordered some food and my partner ordered a salad. Neither was fantastic - the menu was pretty limited. The coffee was good though.

The pool itself is just heavenly. The water goes onto the sand which goes into the sea and then the sky. It was large enough to accomodate everyone. We went here every day.

Going back to the room, which was across the road: the room itself was quite nice - attentive toiletries (a range of things available) as well as some nice teas, though unfortunately no nice coffee. Neither was there any fresh milk to go with any of the tea or coffee, but we ordered this okay. The hardwood floors were beautiful and the television system was great - we often travel with a USB stick of things to watch and the LG TV they have there is perfect to run. Some hotels have their own android system which blocks the ability to plug in your own content - so very happy with this. The balcony was good - it overlooked the street and the mini pool that was in the Garden Wing.

The hotel was pretty great on all fronts except on check in, and then again on check out. For the price I paid (60% of the original) I was pretty pleased with the offering. However - had I of paid full price I would have expected a lot more. It was certainly grand - but about as grand as I would expect for that price range in Bali.

Would I stay here again though? Yes, definitely! For the right price. If you're looking for a fantastic pool and a great location this is a wonderful choice, but at normal rate it seems a villa could be better value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2080,The best,50,March 2016,"My wife and I absolutely loved our stay at The Seminyak! The staff were exceptional, extremely efficient, polite and friendly, great service with a smile (thank you Titra for being so friendly the whole time we spent in the pool bar, best caipirinha's). The resort is a beautiful manicured oasis, the facilities were outstanding especially the pool overlooking the beach. The room was comfortable and spacious, included a turn down service each night which was a nice touch. The buffet breakfast was one of the highlights, delicious fresh food with an array of different options to choose from. We stayed for 10 nights and couldn't fault anything, we look forward to going back next year. Thanks again for making our stay so enjoyable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2081,My favourite hotel,50,March 2016,"My wife and I have stayed here once before and had to come back. We usually don't book our whole tripe here as we can't afford it but its definitely a must for at least three or four nights to end the holiday. This time round was amazing as usual, the staff are the most friendly people i have come across. My favourite thing about this hotel is the pool looking over the beach... absolutely amazing! sit back on your reclining pool chair looking over the pool and beach while ordering a cocktail or bintang.. doesn't get much better. also the pool food menu is great! rooms are also amazing and comfy",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2082,The villa,40,March 2016,We stayed in one of the villas at the seminyak for three nights. Gorgeous villa. Only a couple of small things were annoying. We turned ourmake up room sign on at 7.30 one morning and got back to the villa in the afternoon to spend the rest of that day in the pool to find the room not done.a small thing I know but it took precious time and privacy away. The other thing bewRe of the tiled floor when you get out of the pool! It is unbelievably slippery when wet! Quite dangerous. The breakfast at the resort is boring so we went elsewhere but I would still go back and stay at the villa!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2083,H√•kan,40,April 2016,Exellent service. Good located. Fantastic breakfast! We loved the pool area located direct at the beach. The offering and the set up for the lunch resturang could be much better. Missing also an evening bar/lounge as meething place in the evening,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2084,Beautiful beach resort IF you are on the beach,40,March 2016,"This is a beautiful resort but we were disappointed our rooms were on the other side of the road to the main resort building, since we chose it as a beachside resort. We booked ""on line"" and were disappointed once we paid that the description then said it was part of the resort but over the road. We emailed to check, but were told the price would be an extra $100 per night to stay at the main resort. Despite this, our room was lovely and we especially enjoyed the wonderful breakfasts US$15 pp. Ideally this should have been included, but wasn't. Overall, lovely stay, very good staff, but next time we would stay on the beach side for the same luxury and price elsewhere.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2085,Luxurious Beach Resort,40,March 2016,"This resort ticked all of the boxes, it was quite fancy, the staff we always so welcoming, it was right on the beach and it was next to Ku De Ta! The only thing I will say is the food is a bit expensive.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2086,Lovely stay,50,April 2016,The welcoming is a celebration. The Balinese people at the hotel are delightful and accommodating to your needs. I enjoyed the fitness amenities as well as meditation session. The neighborhood walks are great filled with wonderful shops and restaurants. I'm very grateful for this extraordinary stay while in Seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2087,Just Perfect,50,March 2016,"Our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort was incredible from check in until departure. The location is perfect, staff are wonderful, breakfast is delicious, and the rooms are beautiful! We will definitely stay here every time we return to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2088,Wonderful,50,April 2016,"We had a really lovely stay at the Seminyak. The staff were lovely and the facilities were always on point. Our only regret is that we didn't get to spend more time in the resort, as we were always out doing things.

Thanks for having us! Will definitely be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2089,Amazing,50,April 2016,"We ended our 3 week vacation at The Seminyak. Friendly staff, amazing location, lovely food. Just one thing to point out: the grass outside the infinity pool has to be removed so that it is, in fact, an infinity pool. Would go back any time!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2090,Susu,50,March 2016,"very exotic hotel. I had a room with ocean view and I felt like I am in heaven. I did enjoy every single moments of my stay. The view, the view, view is divine. the hotel team are super friendly. I highly recommended this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2091,Beautiful stay,50,April 2016,"The Seminyak is a fantastic hotel in an amazing location.
It's just off the beaten track so you don't hear traffic, but super quick (5 mins) walk into the main part of Seminyak town with all its shops & restaurants.
The staff was faultless - always friendly, attentive and helpful.
We spent some time trying to learn local Balinese language which I'd urge others to do; you are after all visiting a country full of culture and lore.
We had a suite with a beach view - would definitely recommend. Nothing better than hearing the sea at night and seeing it first thing in the morning.
Great facilities; it has a spa, is one of the few hotels that is right on the beach. And you're far enough away from Kuta to avoid the noise/bustle. It also has morning classes of yoga/pilates/Indonesian classes!
And a great breakfast to boot.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2092,"Lovely Location, Super Staff and Brilliant Buffet Breakfast",50,April 2016,The room was tastefully decorated and clean. All staff were a delight - they give us a typical Balinese welcome. The pool is fabulously located virtually on the beach giving you the best of both worlds. Loved the afternoon tea and the buffet breakfast was fantastic. Will definitely return!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2093,Beautiful hotel,50,March 2016,We used the hotel pool and bar for the evening. They have great views of the beach and a beautiful pool. We experienced a gorgeous sunset there. Good drinks and food as well. And they didn't charge us for towels unlike Some other really poor places. Highly recommended,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2094,long weekend,40,March 2016,"My Partner and I really enjoyed our stay at the Resort, with friendly, helpful and polite staff it was the perfect accomodation for our long weekend trip. We found it perfectly located for all our needs, eating beach and shopping.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2095,perfect position,50,April 2016,"Well i witnessed some thing amazing, this resort is right on the beach, sunset is truly a site to behold, beautiful, in the pool watching the sun slowly slip down,and then with all the security and lifesavers, who you think are so bored and falling a sleep, i watched an amazing rescue, the lifesaver rescued a man in very dangerous surf,the lifesaver in the Seminyak was the only one to see this man in distress, i was very impressed with little more than a rescue board, Well Done.
The breakfast is amazing with anything you want catered for, staff are amazing always respectful, and management very helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2096,Fantastic hotel!,50,April 2016,"My husband and I had a fantastic honeymoon here. The service is impeccable and we felt like royalty. The location is great, right near Seminyak square and next door to Ku De Ta. The swimming pool is a great spot to relax as it overlooks the beach. We would highly recommend this hotel to our family and friends.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2097,The best hotel experience,50,March 2016,"I stayed the first 2 nights at the beach wing, the staff is very helpful and is smiling all the time, the hotel itself is amazing and has a beautiful infinity pool. The location is in the heart of Seminyak. I left after 2 nights n went to ubud I had a bad experience there so me and wife decided to go back to Seminyak beach resort and when we told them that they were happy and upgraded us from a beach wing to a beautiful suite!!! Overall it's been a gr8 experience and I recommend everyone traveling to Bali to stay in that hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2098,Honeymooners,50,March 2016,"the best location in seminyak, its just a few minutes walking from the downtown. Suepr friendly staff and great breakfast. I loved their infinity pool. The room is big and beds are comfortable. Will recommend it to anyone visiting seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2099,Great location,50,March 2016,"This place is well located with just a short walk to shops/restaurant's, which is so important as the traffic in Seminyak (Bali in general) can be horrendous at times. I have stayed at many places in Bali and this is right up there with the best. The main pool is awesome and there is also another pool with a swim up bar which is a great place to relax by.
The rooms are a good size and nicely fitted out. My only criticism would be that I thought the breakfast selection and service was a little disappointing for a resort of this quality, it certainly wasn't bad but it just wasn't great either as I would have expected. The gym was also very small with a lack of equipment.
Overall all though I would highly recommend the resort especially for couples and I would personally return again. The staff were friendly and helpful as you would expect.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2100,Friendly staff and beautiful setting,40,March 2016,"We stayed here for over 8 nights and is our first visit to Bali. Location is good central and very close to trendy Kudeta. The rooms are nice but could use with an upgrade on the finishings. The staff are the pinnacle of this place and are always friendly with the best service I've seen so far. The beds were so comfortable so sleeping was a breeze. The breakfast buffet was delicious with so much variety and quality was good- hands down best buffet breakky I've had! Anyone who complains about breakfast at this place has lost their mind and shouldn't be relied upon!

Like most resorts be careful with mini bar, pool side food and drinks as they are generally much more expensive than elsewhere and add up!

Would stay here again definitely but maybe not in Easter - the weather was too uncomfortably hot and humid for our liking :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2101,AMAZING,50,March 2016,"Would stay there again, again and again.....Amazing surroundings, even though its one of the larger hotels on the strip, you still felt very isolated. Staff were brilliant, they were prompt with all our requests and there were a lot given we had our 5 month old in tow! Heavenly experience can't wait for our next trip.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2102,Nice rooms but service lets it down,30,March 2016,"We visited seminyak beach resort for part of our honeymoon and sadly it was our least favourite of 4 hotels. We booked an ocean view suite, on arrival they had reserved a standard room. They said they would need to look into the confusion. After two hours (already after a long car journey) we were finally in our room. No apology. Our luggage was no where to be seen, but after an hour of chasing we finally got it. As it was our honeymoon we did get a jacuzzi run for us etc in the room, I jumped in to find broken glass in it. The room itself was very nice, and whilst you can glimpse the ocean through the trees, I would say calling it an ocean view room is a bit of a stretch.

Staff all very friendly but ineffective for anything you need/ask for.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2103,Stay in paradise,50,March 2016,Clean and inviting rooms. Marvellous infinity pool with great view. Wide and delicious breakfast spread. Ferry service upon activation. Polite and courteous staff. Truly and amazing experience and will definitely stay again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2104,Extremely pleasant,50,March 2016,"The people of Bali are the most gentle and kind people you will ever meet
Don't miss their breakfast - well worth it. Good location. Pool is awesome. Dinner on beach front was superb with exceptional service and very reasonable price",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2105,Spectacular,50,March 2016,"Located at Seminyak beach area, the resort offers spectacular sea view and I particularly like the infinity pool. Breakfast was substantial. We stayed at second floor which offers partial sea view and I think it'd have been better off if we'd stayed at garden view room because it makes little to no difference. Staffs were helpful and attentive. Overall, the experience was great and we had fond memories of the resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2106,Memorable mini-moon,50,April 2015,This is a late review but we were there in Dec 2014 after our wedding. It was a short stay to celebrate our mini-moon in Bali and we chose The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. We stayed at the pool villa and we thoroughly enjoyed the sea breeze and listened to the waves without having to leave our villa. The service was excellent. I don't normally fancy the drinks or snacks at the bar or in their mini fridge but the fact that we could enjoy any of them for free was welcoming. We were greeted with f fresh coconut drinks and canap√©s. We enjoyed the local cuisine via room service. The rest is history but no regrets staying there at all.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2107,luxurious relaxation,40,March 2016,"immaculate rooms, beautiful setting, complete relaxation. Cant say its good for kids as no activities for them but if your looking to be pampered and want to relax in beautiful luxurious settings then this is the place to stay. Friendly and exceptionally courteous, professional staffing, thumbs up all round.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2108,An oasis on the beach in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"We have just returned from an eight day stay at the Seminyak resort. We stayed in the beach wing and had a wonderful room near the pool with a sea view and terrace so were very happy! The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Breakfast was lovely although the scrambled eggs were not great, nor the omelettes (overcooked and dry). The gym was small but sufficient. The pools were beautiful with no problem finding a sun lounger. The biggest highlight for us was the staff who were happy, smiling and couldn't do enough to help in any way. Our late checkout was much appreciated and offered at check in as our room wasn't ready. We would be happy to return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2109,Great location and hotel,50,March 2016,"Our family of three stayed at The Seminyak for 5 nights in mid March.

We really enjoyed our time, while the hotel would be classed as a medium size the personalised service from the staff really made it feel like it was a small boutique hotel. The location is perfect with Ku Da Ta next door, La Lucciola a short stroll along the beach and access to Seminyak within easy reach by foot or a short cab ride.

Positives:

- location right on Seminyak beach and handy to everything
- beautiful established gardens
- ocean suites are a great size for three and really comfortable and well appointed
- breakfast options were fantastic,really good quality and well prepared at your request
- the pool overlooking the beach is a great spot for lounging around and watching the spectacular sunsets
- the staff are the hotels biggest positive. Friendly and relaxed and nothing too much trouble

Negatives:

- some more shady spots around the pool via some trees or man made structures would be good
- maybe due to current lounge renovations, but the cold drinks (beers) at the pool need to be cooler
- a couple of light salad options on the dayside pool menu would be good as well

We really loved our short stay at The Seminyak and hopefully we can return soon.

Daniel, Fiona & Joshua",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2110,Awesome Resort,50,March 2016,"Made feel very welcome. Top notch service and even special preparations in our room. Good location with a relatively uncrowded beach-side.

Only complaint is that the shower area had a smell upon switching on the water. Likely due to some air currents from the plumbing. But the excellent service, good food and location made up for it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2111,"Peaceful resort, great location",40,March 2016,"Nice to get away to Bali without the kids for a change.

It was our first time staying at The Seminyak and we would certainly be happy to return (without them!).

Stayed in a beach wing suite on the second floor, had the option to wait for a third floor room but we're not difficult people so happily took the room with the lesser view. Beds were firm but comfortable, room was a good size, ginger tea with the turn down service was a nice touch.

Pool area was beautiful with very few children while we were there which was nice for us on this occasion. Breakfast was nice (coffee was as per Bali standard - go to Sisterfields if you need caffeine) service was outstanding, drinks around the bar were pretty good but a bit hit and miss.

It's a great location - right to Jalan Kayu Aya (eat street), left to Jalan Laksmana (more food and shops).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2112,Beautiful digs in Bali,50,March 2016,This hotel is really well done. Beautiful rooms on a great property. The breakfast was delicious there are sunset spots next door and lots of very shishi places to do. You do have to rent the chairs on the beach which offends my sensibilities but so be it... It was amazing,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2113,find sand beach and beautiful sunsets.,50,February 2016,"We stayed here in Feb 2016 during construction for the last two days of our honeymoon.

First off, the construction was very well communicated and arrange so that it did not disturb the guests. They were very courteous.

The rooms here are absolutely gorgeous and big! We had an ocean view room from the 2nd floor that was stunning. The staff was very friendly and pleasant to talk to.

The location is very closely located to shopping and dining. You can get a cab for pretty cheap to anywhere nearby. There are lots of signs in the area protesting the use of Uber in the area. They want to keep the business with the cab drivers.

We loved the dining area and bar just off the beach. Gorgeous sunset views and nice cocktails. The breakfast here is also good, we recommend including it in your daily charge.

The beach here is really nice. Fine sand, big waves and miles to walk. There are lots of vendors o the beach, but you can get surf lessons just down the way.

Little info about our trip: We stayed at Sofitel in Nusa Dua for 6 days, then at Kupu Kupu barong in Ubud for 4 days before coming to the Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2114,Luxury at its best !,50,March 2016,One of the best luxury hotels in seminyak area.. The breakfast spread is good and the staff is extremely friendly.. The room service is also very prompt.. The villa is very spacious and luxurious.. It was a very memorable trip for us..,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2115,Wonderful stay,40,March 2016,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel in March 2016, and really enjoyed ourselves. It's a tranquil quiet oasis in the heart of Seminyak. Staff were very friendly and always accommodating. We booked breakfast at the hotel for the duration of our 5 night stay and we loved it. A lovely array of food on offer. The infinity pool was stunning and we enjoyed watching the sunset every evening. Before we booked this hotel, we were thinking of the W Hotel and having stopped by there for a drink, I'm glad we booked The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. This is just my opinion but the other hotel had lots of tourists milling about and very busy. We loved returning back to our oasis every afternoon. The only gripe and it's small but they supplied one black tea bag in the room with no milk. In order to accommodate international travellers, I would of thought supplying such items was standard. We loved this hotel and will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2116,Beautiful hotel,50,March 2016,"Lovely hotel and facilities. Great pool on the beach overlooking the setting sun. Breakfast options plentiful, good coffee. Gardens well maintained and beautiful. Hotel is next door to Ku de ta - very nice restaurant and bar. Potato head is a walk along the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2117,Amazing Stay,40,March 2016,"Firstly i must say i was booked in a garden view room, after some investigation i was told that it was across the road from the main resortm yes it is only 10 sec between places but what ihad found that the garden rooms do not give me the feel of a resort holiday and paying that much for a room i probably would have payed for a villa next door for half the cost.But you do get to use the resorts facilities such as the loveley pools and restaurants.
All that being said we upgraded to the beach front room and it was everything that we wanted, the room was amazing large,clean and comfortable.
Not enough can be said about the staff, they were all so friendly, and ready to help.
The resort it self is lovely, we were there in the low season so the occupancy was probably around 40% so we did have space to move around with out feeling over run with guests.
The Breakfast was one of the better ones we have had with a wide selection of international foods.The beach along the resorts in that area is very clean and the ocean is relatively safe but you must check to see when it is safe to swim there, i did see a couple of young lads pushing the envelope and they got into trouble and had to be rescued by a couple of surfers, overall the beach is safe but be carefull and not go out to far.
The resort is only a 5 - 10 minute walk to the main shopping strip, with many amazing restaurants at fair prices.
So summing it up if you can afford the beach front rooms, the Resort is a place i would highly recommend.
Once again thanks to the staff who made it a pleasurable stay, not to forget the maintenance and gardeners who keep it immaculate.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2118,Beware Ocean View Suite,40,March 2016,2nd floor Ocean View Suite does NOT have a sea view. I had to make a fuss to be moved to a 3rd floor Ocean View Suite to be able to see the sea & watch the sunsets. I think their website description of an Ocean View Suite is misleading - I expected the suite to be close to the beach - it is not. All the staff are very friendly & helpful.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2119,"Fantastic Resort, excellent staff",50,March 2016,"Was a family holiday (wife, toddler, myself). March 2016, so my review,
(1) First, the Excellent parts: Staff were wonderful, they were attentive, friendly and always happy to help, the staff always stopped to talk to my toddler and make him feel special, fantastic resort pools, the resort is on the beach and i must say seminyak beach is much nicer in real life, choice at buffet breakfast, location is an easy 10min stroll (with stroller) to seminyak, 2 mins stroll to Ku De Ta restaurant, separate & fully tiled spa in our room was a nice touch, incredible views from our balcony, room was huge and nicely finished, had 2 flat screen TV's

(2) Improvements; If i can suggest, a small playground in the corner somewhere would be awesome, also a line or somewhere to hang wet bathers on the balcony, and i'm just being picky now, but maybe the lunch menu at the restaurant could have more western choices.

(3) What i didn't like; The road behind the hotel Jl Lasmana Oberoy wasn't busy, But you get some loud motorcycles every so often, i think all the resorts will have the same issue.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2120,Big Celebration,50,March 2016,"I have had a Fantastic 50 Celebration at Bali, and Seminyak Beach Resort played a main role in making this a once in a lifetime experience. The planning of my Birthday Dinner was Smoooth- My emails was answered polite and positive. The Gazebo was reserved for us, and we enjoyed a magical evening watching the sunset, enjoying a lobster dinner.
We wanted a late check out, and the staff bend their backs to fulfill this. I am over the moon happy about my special celebration and I would like to say thank you to all the staff that were involved in making this Perfect!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2121,Nice stay,50,March 2016,"We stayed only one night at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.
The hotel is very nice, good location next to bars and restaurants, the pool in front of the beach is amazing, staff is hepful. Good place to stay if you want to chill.
I would recommend to stay in the building next to the beach/pool because it is closer to all the facilities.
Breakfast is very good and diverse.
To note : some troubles to access wifi in the hotel and the rooms.
I would definitely go back there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2122,Amazing resort to stay,50,March 2016,"My partner and I spent 6 nights in an ocean view villa. I was blown away when I first walked in. We had an amazing pool area with lounges that sat in the shallow water, a gazebo to lay in, and outdoor table and chairs and a lounge. And you could see the ocean when standing up looking over our fence.
The king size bed was comfortable, however the pillow cases could have been changed as they got a musty smell quite quickly.
The bathroom was amazing, huge, hot water, clean, lots of goodies in case you forgot yours and had the feel of being outdoors without actually being outdoors.
The room came supplied with robes, thongs, hats, umbrellas, after sun lotion, fan, iron and ironing board, DVD player (which was handy being that we were there for Nyepi Day) fruit each day and the best little outdoor fridge. Kept our drinks icy cold - something that you appreciate on the warm days.
Breakfast was enjoyable with a large selection of options available. Staff were always friendly and attentive. Egg menu was classier than anywhere else I had stayed in Bali and the morning latte was delicious. Only gripe my partner had was that he always had to ask for some butter. By the time they would bring it, the toast was cold. He worked out to ask for the butter before he made his toast. Sometimes its just the small things.
We spent Nyepi Day in Bali which meant we had to stay in the hotel grounds and eat at the hotel. This was the day that my partner started to get an upset belly. Not sure which meal may have upset him but he wasn't right for about a week afterwards. Meals were not anything to rave about.
Also, the hotel really needs to look at supplying its guests with cold Bintangs. When we were by the pool, the Bintangs that were served were warm. They did put them in an ice bucket so they eventually got cool, but I would suggest they look into a well stocked freezer for their drinks. People will order more if they are cold.
Overall hotel was a winner. Staff were friendly and helpful, grounds and rooms were immaculate and being right on the beach allowed us to watch some beautiful sunsets.
Would definitely recommend this Resort to friends.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2123,"The best Hotel in Seminyak area, will back definitly",50,February 2016,"I would always come back as this has never let me down before, the hotel and staff awesome, love to stay here in near future. I don't see many faults compared to other areas that surround north part of Bali.

Would totally recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2126,Amazing resort,50,March 2016,"Had Amazing time here,hotel staff very attentive and great room size and decor .

The spa massage is awesome too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2129,Not worth,20,February 2016,"We booked one beach wing room as an advance payment.But on reaching we were told that there is no room available so they upgraded us to Suite. Now this suite had nothing great. We reached late at night so slept. Next day morning we saw the fruit basket only had one fruit which we dint eat. We requested them to change it but it can not be changed is the answer we got. Then in bathroom jacuzzi was not working. We registered a complaint and went out. Engineers came and we were told in the evening that it has been repaired. But it dint work next day morning also. We anyways had to check out so we preferred to ignore and leave.

Overall Boring atmosphere, Staff not helpful. Disappointing. I felt like we were staying in a 2 or 3 star hotel.

Ohh BTW breakfast was pathetic. So many options but nothing was tasty.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2130,Holidays,50,March 2016,"Pleasant and relaxing with good service

They have keept our suitases with full attention during a couple of days when we have had and excursion",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2131,Amazing!,50,March 2016,"My friend and I stayed in a suite for 3 nights and it was wonderful! The staff are excellent and very friendly, the rooms are stunning! We would definitely stay here again! The spa is definitely worth a visit too! It's in a great location right on the beach, next door to KU DE TA and close to Seminyak Square!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2132,Seminyak Beach Resport and Spa,50,February 2016,"I spent a long weekend at Seminyak Beach with my girlfriend. I could not recommend it more highly. Superb hotel , right on the beach , great pool and garden area , superb and friendly staff , magnificent breakfast spread , great bedroom , great location adjacent to the town within easy walking distance to shops , pubs etc. I'm going back again soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2133,Average,30,March 2016,It is a nice location and has a very nice pool - but then so do 10 other hotels along the same beach. Breakfast was fine but nothing special. Food round the pool was a real mixed bag....my 7 year old ate burgers and they looked great - i made the mistake of ordering salads and they are a total rip off. The hotel itself is also good but nothing special - we had a suite...it was like so much else just average. The whirlpool bath is pointless - we had the taps running for an hour and still there was only inches of water.....a real joke frankly. The hotel was quiet and yet they couldn't accommodate a late check out which is unacceptable. I am going back in 3 weeks which I now regret. Before this stay my last trip to Seminyak had been to the Legian......Any future trips will be back there as there is such a big gulf in class between these 2 properties......They really both should not be 5 star. Either give the Legian a 6th or take one of this place.....no comparison.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2134,The most luxurious stay in Bali,50,March 2016,"We truly would not have changed anything about our stay at The Seminyak, the personal touches of frangipani leis & complimentary drink on arrival and thorough room detailing with an even turn down each day made staying here so comfortable. Not to mention the incredible facilities of the resort that were always pristine. The staff here are simply amazing and genuinely interested in how you are enjoying your time in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2135,MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS - Quality place but you want to stay in the right building,30,March 2016,"When I checked in I was told I was located on the second building away from the beach and the main part of the hotel. I was never warned of this before. It was quite disappointing and told I would have to pay extra to move to the main building. I was located across the road from the hotel, down the street in a small block away from the main hotel. I missed out on everything the hotel offered and felt distanced by this to the hotels amenities. This was the only problem for me. Service was great, venue looks amazing (on the good side of the hotel) and location is pretty good as well. If I knew from the start where I was staying I would have upgraded. If I was part staying in the main part of the hotel I am sure I would have rates this 5 stars and excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2136,Absolute bliss,50,February 2016,"Couldn't fault hotel, it was absolute luxury. The hotel was right on the beach with beautifully maintained gardens. The breakfasts were excellent and there was complimentary afternoon teas. All the staff were so attentive and would do anything for you. Would definitely go there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2137,My Travel Review for Seminyak Beach Resort with Colorful Vacations,50,December 2015,I am recently visited Bali to celebrate my marriage anniversary. I booked tour package from Colorful Vacations. I get complete itinerary from the company. We fully enjoy our trip as we hope before the trip. No doubt Bali is a beautiful destination for vacations. our accommodation booked at Seminyak Beach Resort. The Seminyak Beach is so wonderful. the food served to us were delicious. We stayed in fully AC room along with wi-fi facility. Seminyak Beach Resort is nearest to beach so we we can take pic while we are in the room. I also thanksful for Colorful Vacations to suggest this destination & hotel. Thanks to all.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2138,Bali Getaway,40,February 2016,"We stayed in an ocean view suite for a 6 night getaway from our kids and loved staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The location was great, the resort was beautiful, clean with very friendly and helpful staff. Would definately recommend couples to stay at this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2139,Pleasant stay and helpful staff.,30,March 2016,"Overall, not a bad stay but we were glad we enjoyed a room at a discounted rate with some additional benefits.

The jacuzzi was a the highlight for my wife which we didn't use in the end. We tried to fill it and the water turned out to be running out nearly as quickly as it was filling. We had a new seal put in eventually but be aware that you should allow around 4-5 hours to fill as there is no high flow fill. The mood had passed for a relaxing spa by the the time a foot of water was in there.

In relation to the spa we were offered a room swap to another suite and the move was also related to road noise. The suites are close to the main road through Seminyak and while the noise it not really bad, it is noticeable and can disturb you if you are light sleepers like us.

The other reason we chose The Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort was it gives you close proximity to the shopping and restaurants in the area. We didn't eat at the resort for any other meal other than the breakfast. The breakfast is not the best but not the worst either. It s adequate for most dietary needs and tastes. The one thing I would have liked to have seen was some better cereal selections. Pre packaged small indivual serves of All Bran, Weetbix, Nutrigrain or Just Right for example.

The staff were particularly good during our stay and were always willing to help where they could.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2140,Coudnt have asked for more!,50,March 2016,"This hotel and resort was literally the most amazing place I have ever stayed at. From the friendly staff, who always greet you so politely and there for you for anything you need in your room or on the compound, to the food and the atmosphere. The place is so big, and so beautiful. it offers so much that we didn't even leave the place because everything you need and want is there already.

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone for that matter. I will be coming back here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2141,Cleanliness,20,February 2016,"Garden view has no lift. I had to climb up to the 3rd floor. Rooms are too dark. I moved to beach view. The blankets etc felt damp. Floors were sticky. Too many flies at breakfast area. 1st day we had breakfast, my husband had a bad stomach after that. Ants were crawling on the spoons at the chilli sauce area. Nevertheless the pool is in a good location. Good beach too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2150,"Great hotel, staff very accommodating, beautiful pool",50,February 2016,I stayed in the garden wing of the Seminyak for 2 nights as part of a flying weekend trip to Bali. I had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to others. The staff are very friendly and accommodating - nothing was too much trouble. The pool is beautiful with direct access to the beach. The 4pm afternoon tea was a nice touch! My only (very small) gripe - the hairdryer provided comes with a UK plug but the only UK power sockets in the room are nowhere near a mirror! Otherwise everything was excellent.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2151,Highly recommend this hotel,50,February 2016,"I stayed this hotel for 4 days and highly recommend this hotel.

2155,Stunning!,50,September 2015,"We stayed here at the end of our month trip to Malaysia/Borneo/Bali and it was worth the extra money. The place is paradise with its infinity pool right beside the ocean. Staff were great and the drinks and food were amazing also.

As you can see from the pictures the room was stunning and we were lucky as our room was booked up so we got a seaside room (lucky us) plenty of cool shops and places to eat nearby.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2156,Seminyak is the best,50,January 2016,Always will go to Seminyak over Kuta. So good for families and young couples. Would always come back as this has never let me down before. I don't see many faults compared to other areas that surround.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2157,"It was okay, but improvable",40,February 2016,"The room is way too humid if aircon is turned off. Because of the humidity, the pillow is abit smelly. The amenity needs to be updated. Nobody has iphone 4 anymore, the ipod deck is out of date. Beach front pool is undeniable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2158,Terrible staff,10,February 2016,"I have NEVER encountered such rude over bearing snotty staff in all my years travelling ! Over priced pretentious vibe. The beach was so full of used nappies, rubbish and sanitary pad we would never swim in it for fear of infection! So many other wonderful hotels to chose from !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2161,Beautiful hotel but a bit old,30,February 2016,"It was our first time at Seminyak beach and we stayed for 5 nights. We picked this area of Bali because it is less busy and we wanted to stay away from the noise.
The location is great. I like the beach front view and the pool is excellent. It is not too close and not too far from the beach. The sunset view is nice although it has been quite cloudy throughout our stay.
We got the spa package and I believe this is the best deal. The spa treatment last for 4 hours and it was one of the best spa treatments I have had (I am a seasoned spa visitor). Service was attentive and the spa room was clean and well decorated.
The breakfast is excellent. There was literally too much food. It has a good selection of western and Indonesian food. Must try the french toast...yum.

The only setback is the bed. I have had back pain after the first trip. It may have been the yoga I did beforehand but I believe it was the bed. It is too soft. I believe it is time to replace a new one.

The other setback is the check out service. As my flight was at 6pm so I asked for a late check out at 1:30pm and it was rejected.... but while 10 mins later some other guy at the reception was offered late check out at 2pm... it was not very nice. While i was packing and ready to leave, they called the room and checked to see if we have left...at 12:05, 12:08, 12:15...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2162,Amazing beyond all expectations,50,February 2016,"Friendly staff, lavish facilities and just a general good vibe!
Would definitely recommend this hotel to couples or families. The infinity pool straight onto the beach is a must see!
Buffet breakfast was delicious!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2163,"Pool is nice, but the service is not up to par!",30,February 2016,"We spent 3 nights here. We used the cutlery and it was good that they took away to wash them; however, they never return back or leave a new set for us afterwards. When we called to ask for a new set, the delivery was taking forever for such a simple request. The AC kept dropping water droplets onto the desk, and right onto my laptop overnight. It was fortunate this time that they did not ruin my laptop. The fruits was only given the 1st day and will never refill afterwards.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2164,A little bit of heaven!,50,February 2016,"Amazingly friendly staff, the best breakfasts ever, pool views out to sea and rooms so big and beautiful you want to move in permanently. The couple of afternoons it rained we headed to our garden pagoda to read, relax and wait for the sun to return - just bliss! Thoroughly recommend this relaxing, grown up hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2165,Such a relaxing experience,50,January 2016,What an am axing hotel so relaxing and the staff can't do enough for you. We have just returned after staying for 9 days. The staff were so helpful. Free afternoon tea was amazing such lovely sweets. The rooms were lovely we stayed just across the road which wasn't a problem. Lots of security and everyone is always smiling. The pool is just on the beach . Can't find anything negative to say it was all good.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2166,High expectations not met,30,January 2016,The location of the hotel is special. The views from the garden room which we had are great. Having said that there were a few disappointing things. For one when people spoke of the beach being dirty I just didn't comprehend the extent of it. The beach and water are terrible and thus walking along the beach isn't great. This may not the hotels fault but it affects ones stay. The service is okay but not exceptional. Two days in a row we had to ask for our pillows to be changed because they smelled stuffy. Overall not a terrible experience but certainly not 5 star and maybe not even 4,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2167,Absolutely not worth the money,10,January 2016,"I've held off writing this in the hope the hotel would've been fair in resolving the issue.

We paid over $700 AUD for 2 nights not including breakfast for a room not in the main hotel. We were then charged for a room on the main side! They did cancel the $40 'upgrade' fee.

Air-conditioning was faulty, no TV air towels, called maintenance - nothing.

Wet floors in the hallway and my partner slipped over. Faulty electrical in the room with loose wires.

Absolute rip off given the cost.

No service or assistance.

Totally mislead in booking also via Prestegia.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2168,Great Hotel,50,February 2016,"My husband, daughter and I recently spent a week in a 2 room villa, which was extremely luxurious with 2 private pools. The staff were helpful & courteous at all times, and the hotel grounds are kept immaculately. The food including the complementary afternoon tea was delicious. I would have no hesitation in returning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2169,Downhill,20,January 2016,I have always stayed at the Seminyak when traveling to Bali. I have never been so disappointed in their service. There must have been a change of ownership because it has really declined and will never be staying there again. Room was never cleaned or ready when arriving (we changed room twice and it was never ready even after the check in time of 2pm) yet they would harass you prior to check out time to leave. They pretty much charge you to breathe in the place now which is also disappointing. Late check out should not be charged especially when you're a regular customer. I'm sure the Legian would love my business from now on ( I am there 5-6 times a year),The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2170,The best 5 star hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2016,"We are family of 5, and had a great weekend escape last week in The Seminyak Resort. The hotel was fabulous with great pools and direct access to Seminyak Beach. The top of all is the people there are really welcome, warm and eager to help. Their attention to our kids when the afternoon tea was a superb. Even they don't have ice chocolate in the table, but the waitress offered that to kids and they really loved that. I truly recommended this hotel if you willing to stay at Seminyak area, the surrounding was easy with many restaurants, cafes and spa. Over all I give The Seminyak 4 thumbs up!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

PERFECTO",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2172,Amazing,50,January 2016,"This is our return trip to Bali since November and the only place to stay has to be Seminyak Beach resort and spa. The thought of trying another hotel does not even spring to our minds. We never tire of the amazing service, the grounds are kept immaculately and the lovely infinity pool. The hotel maintains excellent standards and all the staff are extremely attentive and friendly. My advice to anyone choosing a hotel in the Seminyak area is to make this the only place they stay. This will be our fourth visit and my daughter and myself never feel tempted to even try another hotel when we know that the Seminyak will tick all the boxes.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2173,Room for customer service improvement,30,January 2016,It's a great hotel. However there is room for improvement in customer service. The check in and out process took a long time. Also there was no housekeeping done in the morning even when occupancy rate of the hotel is low. Room service was extremely expensive!0,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2174,Exceptional Hotel,50,January 2016,"We came back last week from staying for 5 days at this wonderful hotel - nothing was a problem. The staff go above and beyond. The location is perfect. Loved the afternoon tea this was treat. The pool is fabulous, plenty of sun beds.

Infiniti pool was wonderful. Beach cleaner than Sanur but strong current for swimming.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2176,Best resort and Spa ever!,50,January 2016,"We stayed here for 3 days in January 2016 in the ocean view room. The place is like heaven on earth seriously. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive (especially Rori and Bogus) at all times. We have never met more polite and respectful people in our lives. They would accomodate all requests.

The buffet breakfast was amazing and quite extensive.

The room was large, modern and very clean. The facilities were fantastic and the daily afternoon tea and coffee was delightful.

The grounds and the pool were stunning. If you want luxury this is it. Perfect for couples, families or simply on your own.

The pool is located on the beach which is very convenient and has lovely views.

Daily activities such as yoga and pilates which helped to burn off those extra calories from breakfast. However, the only downside is you may never want to leave this place!

We will definitely be back to Bali soon and know exactly were we will be staying when in Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2177,High standard,40,January 2016,"The staff are friendly and make you feel like royalty and try their best to accommodate you ,sometimes try too hard
The restaurants in the hotel are excellent,but the only thing was that they were empty,we were on half board and often we were the only ones in there.The egg menu at breakfast was top notch",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2178,Fantastic resort,50,January 2016,"Stayed for 6 nights in early January, this place is truly fantastic. Got an ocean facing room, and from the moment we were shown our room we felt pure luxury. Breakfast in the resort was amazing. Everything you could want. And the pool is so big and spacious. Even though there were people around we didn't feel like we were stepping over anyone. Beach right at the doorstep.
It's also super close to Ku De Ta, and a short walk to all the shopping and massages you could ever want.
Fantastic resort. Well worth the price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2179,Excellent Service !!!,50,January 2016,"Best hotel in Bali were all requests are accomplished and amazing beach and infinite pool !

Nice bar on the pool ! Two bed room villa was awesome !

Worth for all the money paid !!!

Customers are always King here !!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2180,"Lovely Hotel, All The Staff So Helpful And Friendly",50,January 2016,"The room we had was cosy, well furnishe and just what we needed. The staff were friendy and helpful, the caf√© provided excellent breakfast, this is my fav hotel so far in Bali. Looking forward to stay in this hotel next trip..",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2181,Beautiful Beachside Resort,40,November 2015,"My husband and I stayed at The Seminyak in November 2015 after getting stuck in Bali due to the volcano. Our room was perfect, spacious and on the ground level which made access to the grounds very easy. Pool area is gorgeous and the staff very efficient and friendly. Food was good but not great. Overall good value for money when compared to the other beachfront hotels in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2182,Beautiful sunset views from the infinity pool,50,January 2016,The best hotel alongside the beachside. You can spend all day at the sunlounge peoplewatching and not get bored from it. Way better than going to kudeta or potato head or staying at the W. Service is tremendous.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2183,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,January 2016,"Fantastic, Only comment was the music drove me crazy at breakfast & especially at night in restaurant so I only went once as played same 4 minute tune ova & ova & ova again like chinese water torture prefer 100 songs easy listening 1970s to 1990s music.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2184,Pure Bliss,50,January 2016,"The Seminyak really gets everything about luxury resort hotel right. They are ready to greet you during check-in, your luggage is taken care of and the whole check-in process was really smooth. Really makes you feel like you picked the right hotel.

I stayed in the king suite room of their additional building, which is set across the road from their main building. Admittedly, it is a bit inconvenient to be placed in a room there, but the hotel does offer free buggy charter to-and-fro. The independent building does have its own pool, but it is not THE infinity pool.
Room amenities in The Seminyak was perfect, we don't have any complaints. They offer free water bottles (take note all other hotels!) and tropical fruits are available too. The bathroom was extremely luxurious and well appointed. If they could just offer bigger trash cans, then it would be perfect.

The infinity pool located in the main building was my favorite part, the views are truly breathtaking and the pool staff are attentive. The beach that it overlooks is very well-kept and clean. I didn't try the breakfast, as many other restaurants are available within walking and/or biking distance.

Overall, this was an enjoyable stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2185,Perfect Honeymoon resort,50,January 2016,"The moment you arrive, you immediately think ""damn, i made a good choice"". Everyone in town knows this place as ""THE Seminyak"" because this place is 5 stars. My wife enjoyed every little bit of this, as she and i both have never really splurged on vacation but man - the spa, the restaurants, the high tea, the scenic views, the pavillion (Chapel), the sunset view; everything was amazing and so well kept. One thing to note is that you probably wont be able to enter the beach directly in front of the hotel because of the nature of the waves; just walk a few more feet to the other hotels and you're gravy. The other plus is that its so freaking quiet and quaint, no rowdy behaviour. If something is wrong they correct it right away, and the staffs english is pretty good too! You all must try the waffles in the morning and the nasi goreng in the evening.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2186,very nice place for a nice vacation,50,January 2016,"Perfect location on the beach with very nice seating area and 2big pools , Very nice staff kind & helpful ,you feel welcomed in this hotel . We really enjoyed our vacation . The suite was clean & big with very nice view on the ocean .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2187,EXCELENT PLACE,50,January 2016,"We had a very good experience at the SEMINYAK Beach & Spa. The staff was very efficient, Cortes, friendly, and always helpful. The room was beautiful. The food excellent. We defenitily recommend for your next trip to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2188,Extremely memorable holiday thanks to this gorgeous resort,50,January 2016,"From the moment we arrived the service from majority of staff was fabulous, would like to make special mention to Suri on reception he was a wealth of knowledge and nothing was too much trouble, always happy and smiling. Also our pool waitress and special Balinese dinner waitress Ami was amazing, pretty sure she will remember Mr John . . . The room large, very comfy bed although the AC could have been a little cooler in the hot summer weather. Bath salts and rose petals for the large deep bath very much appreciated. Love the pool setting, right on very clean beach, great people watching. The breakfast was very good and changed daily, fresh juices and a great variety of western and Balinese dishes. We are already planning our return in May The main reason we booked this resort was it does not cater for children. There was only one kid there to my knowledge and he was bored, very loud and extremely painful . . . Silly parents ! Great wine bar very close called Vin + and many fabulous restaurants within walking distance, can highly recommend newly opened Tiger Palm recommend by Suri, our favourite of all restaurants we had the pleasure to dine at.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2189,Amazing!,50,January 2016,"We had 5 nights in a sea view suite! It was almost perfect. Great view. Breakfast was very good! Room service came twice a day... Unfortunately not everyday.. But all in one this hotel was very nice!!

Hotel is on the best location! Beach in the front! Only a few minutes to the seminyak square/bars/restaurants/shops.. KuDeTa beach club is just 2minutes...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2190,"""Amazing resort""",50,December 2015,"This place is incredible!
One of the few places where the pictures match the views!
Besides the great facility the staff and people were amazing!
In fact the Balinese people are now our favorite in the world.
They are so genuine really want to please and are just so nice.
The whole island is incredible this way the matter who you run into .
All the staff extra efforts in particular Ayuni went out of her way to make sure extremely happy. Their executive head chef David was absolutely incredible.
The spa was amazing and we are gladly going to go back when we are in Bali next!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2191,9 out of 10,50,January 2016,"We booked this resort as my wife is pregnant and we were hoping for a well kept high end experience. We got so lucky! The staff were lovely, the restaurants served nice food, the rooms were very comfy with firm mattresses, comfy cushions, large king size bed, spacious bathroom, 2 room services daily. We felt truly pampered.
Breakfast included a large yummy buffet plus fresh cooked items to order as well.
The direct beach access made for some beautiful sunset dinners, strolls on the beach, surfing the waves.
The proximity to Seminyak square and village also meant great choice of food and shopping nearby.
If you stay here, make sure to visit Ku de Ta for dinner one night which is next door and pop into one of the many massage parlours in the neighbourhood.
We stayed a week and still don't know what a Bali Belly feels like. Which was paramount with a pregnant Mrs.
Having more shade at the pool would give them 10/10",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2192,Great staff and beautiful resort.,50,January 2016,We stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort in early January and couldn't be happier. The staff were incredible and did everything they could to make our stay comfortable. We stayed in the garden wing (across the road from the main facilities) which was very peaceful and had a beautiful pool. There was a little golf buggy to shuttle you back and forth if you couldn't be bothered with the 1 minute walk! Breakfast was lovely- heaps of choice and the food in general was great.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2193,Romantic and luxurious,50,December 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for one night before we returned back to Australia after a holiday in Nusa Lembongan. It was perfect, food was excellent, service was very attentive, the pool area was stunning. The food is expensive for what it is but isn't everything in Seminyak. The breakfast was lovely and such a nice setting. We would definitely return and recommend to friends.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2194,Bali Bliss,50,December 2015,Stayed at this hotel for 11 nights over the Christmas and New Year period . The location was perfect with so much just on our doorstep - and sunset views to die for . The villa was wonderfully equipped - we felt so spoilt . The food and events organised when we were there were amazing - all with great taste and thought . There were so many little extras that kept appearing - I have no hesitation recommending this hotel . The staff were all so accommodating and professional in their work . I can fault nothing - and look forward to another visit if In the area again .,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2195,a Break - Just what we needed !!,50,December 2015,"Firstly, the staff were just great !! Special mention should be for Ayuni who looked after us New Years Eve and most of our daily breakfasts.
We arrived Dec 27th and left Jan 6th, thus enjoying New Year Celebrations at the hotel. We really enjoyed the food and had a great time with our fellow guests !!
We would highly recommend this hotel !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2196,Relaxing days at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,40,December 2015,"We stayed at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for a week at the end of our Bali trip. When arriving only one of our two booked rooms had been registered but this was elegantly and flexibly solved by the frontdesk manager and led to an upgrade for the first nights. We found staff extremely helpful, serviceminded and friendly. Rooms are elegant, clean and of very good standard. The beachfront villas are spectacular! The whole resort area is both beautiful and quiet. The location is perfect with walking distance to many nice shops and restaurants and also with some great beach clubs very close (such as Ku De Ta and Potato head). Breakfast is very nice whilst pool area food is overpriced and mediocre at best. This is very unfortunate and a missed opportunity for more income. Eventhough we would happily have stayed in the resort area sometimes we chose to leave the hotel for all meals after two disappointments at lunch time. Other than that we had a terrific time at a really nice and superfriendly resort. Top scores to all staff!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2197,Honeymoon to remember,50,January 2016,"We spent the first three days of our honeymoon at Semenyak. The accommodation was ultra luxurious, spotlessly clean and contained all the ""bells and whistles"" expected of a 5 star hotel. Staff are friendly and accommodating as well. Overall we felt well and truly spoilt",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2198,Wonderful experience,50,January 2016,"The staff was very welcoming and accommodated all requests. The food and service quality are great. The spa is too expensive compared to Bodyworks, but that's typical for hotel pricing.
One thing I'd suggest improving is managing the pool temperature because it heated during the day and felt like a hot bath instead of a refreshing experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2199,"Great hotel, would highly recommend",50,January 2016,"We loved our stay here and would have no issue recommending this place to friends or family. Just perfect!
The beds were so comfy, the breakfast was amazing.
Perfect location on the beach!
Restaurants all within walking distance.
We would love to come back some day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2200,Unbeatable Location,30,January 2016,"The resort has a fabulous location surrounded by shops & the best restaurants. Ku De Ta, Mexicola & Potato Head are all walking distance. Further in town (10 mins walk) are Mykonos for a lazy afternoon mediterranean meal & Zappas for a rocking evening with a live band! There are hole in the wall coffee shops like Revolver & many outlets tucked away along that stretch. Just outside the resort are clean & good massage parlours & nail salons. There is a scooti rental at the doorstep too. The resort has a beautiful stretch of beach & infinity pools overlooking stunning sunsets.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2201,R&R at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,January 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed our R&R trip to The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. All staff personnel were truly accommodating and gracious. Our room was relaxing and comfortable--great amenities. Spent a lot of time at the pool area and walking along the beach. This was exactly what we needed and plan to return in April!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2202,wonderfull hotel,50,November 2015,the room was excellent the location of the hotel is perfect for getting to the beach or getting to shopping.. near central seminyak.service is incredible the staff here are very well trained.highly recommend this hotel,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2203,exceptional service,50,December 2015,From the moment we arrived at the hotel we knew we were in for a great stay. We were greeted with a fresh flower lei and welcome drink and cool towel which was great. The hotel room was clean and comfortable. All staff were fantastic and nothing was an issue and they were very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was great. Pool amazing. Great location and close to everything. We will definitely stay again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2204,Stunning pool & surrounds.,30,January 2016,"When you're paying five star prices, expectations are high. The highlight of this hotel is the spectacular pool area facing the ocean - the pool is infinity style, so you sit in it whilst looking sure you at the beach & ocean.
The rooms are in a large building sitting within expansive, lush green gardens. The beach rooms don't face the beach - well the wing I was in didn't anyway. That was disappointing.
The rooms themselves are modern & fresh. Stunning bathrooms feature a large shower, separate toilet & huge bath. Rose petals & Epsom salts are a nice touch. A sexy window/glass panel from the bathroom onto the bedroom is a gorgeous feature for lovers.
Each room has a generous balcony, providing a calm place to wind down or start the day.
The breakfast buffet is fabulous & plentiful - although coffees are not great & served cool, even after multiple requests. The international New York Times is available.
Other food in the hotel is ok - and there are clean, healthy dishes available such as the Ni√ßoise salad, which is served deconstructed - all of the ingredients are presented in a platter. Super healthy.
Don't stay across the road - there's a wing of accommodation there that is frankly, depressing & over priced. Only stay in the main building.
The staff are ok - wifi is terrible, but it is in many parts of Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2205,"Stunning hotel, amazing stuff and wonderful grounds",50,December 2015,"We stayed here as part of a tour of the Far East, this was the first part of our tour in Bali.

I really couldn't fault this in any way. A special mention to Fazil (apologies if I spelt your name wrong!) at check in, he was absolutely excellent, gave us some background about the local area, good places to eat etc and showed us up to our room.

The hotel itself was stunning, the grounds were beautiful, it felt like you was in a tropical paradise, especially at night and early morning with the sound of the birds and other natural species.

Our room was supposed to be in the building across the street, but we were given one in the main building which made a difference as you could literally walkt 1 minute and you'd be by the infinity pool. We did see the other building which would have meant just having to cross the road to get to the main hotel, which wouldn't have been the worst thing.

The breakfast selection was amazing, so much fresh fruit. In addition to the buffet breakfast, you're given a menu where you get to choose freshly from a large selection of items that are freshly made. I had the most amazing French Toast ever!

The hotel itself was in an ideal location, you're literally 3 or 4 mins walk from the main street in Seminyak with all the restaurants, shops and bars.

The only negative thing I have to say is the beach area wasn't very nice as it was quite dirty. Especially in comparison to the beach in Nussa Dua.

The pool area was amazing, a wonderful infinity pool with plenty of loungers. The view by the pool at sunset was also amazing.

I also used the spa area, the jacuzzi and sauna were wonderful, very relaxing and clean.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2206,One of the best resorts in Seminyak,40,December 2015,We stayed two nights around christmas. The rooms are huge and fresh - we had a jacuzzi but it took so long to fill it so we decided not to use it. Very nice breakfast with a good selection of fruits. The poolarea is very nice and quite. The sunset is to die for. Resort is a little quite if you like action.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2207,Affordable luxury,50,December 2015,"Stayed in a twin room over Christmas 2015. Carols at breakfast. Garden rooms were fabulous and just as good as the main hotel for half the price. Spitting distance from main hotel so Very easy to get from room to breakfast. Stunning hotel and the staff are so friendly. Had such a wonderful stay we then decided to come back after a trip to Gili T and they happily accommodated us. We decided to go for the ocean suite, spacious as there were now three of us.

The food throughout the hotel was delicious. Will definitely be returning soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2208,Average at best,30,December 2015,"For the price you can do better. We stayed in the ""garden wing"" across the road which was fine and a stones throw from the main hotel. We paid $320 a night which was quoted as ""half price"". Rooms were large and bed comfortable but not worth $320 a night. I could only imagine how disappointed people must be paying the full price tag across the road. Location is right at the top end of seminyak near Petinget and some great restaurants like Sarong and Bambu, but the hotel is well away from ""eat street"" and the beach bars and holiday feel of Double 6 beach. The hotel itself is pretty boring and not worth the $600 a night price tag. The pool is nice, however completely ruined by the extremely dirty and littered beach and the constant barrage of hawkers that come right up to the edge of the pool to sell you stuff. After about 20 ""no thanky-ous"" we gave up and left the pool. The constant ""boss you buy"" completely ruins the ambience. Drinks poolside are Perth prices and not great. The beach really is disgusting and nothing on it. I wouldn't recommend coming here as there are better options around, especially for the price. We also stayed Double 6 hotel in Seminyak and had a much better time in Double 6.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2209,Seminyak resort,50,December 2015,"My stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort was excellent. The room was lovely and well kept. The highlight was of course sunsets by the infinity pool, where I spent each afternoon. The service was all very attentive.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2210,Excellent property!,50,December 2015,"Stayed there in Dec 2015. It is an awesome property, special mentions for the infinity pool, over courteous staff and the pool bar.
Staying in the beach wing is preferable.
It is highly recommended...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2211,"Nice, very pleasant staff, well located, pricey",40,December 2015,"I have stayed in this resort with my brother and his family over the New Year's. The fireworks were splendid! The rooms were spacious and very nice and clean. Well equipped; the only things badly missing were hooks for towels and racks for drying bathing suits. Apart from the ever so friendly and hospitable staff, the best features of this hotel were: 1) the infinity pool (don't believe any criticism of the pool; it is one of the best designed pool I have seen in hotels where people can both lounge and swim and they are not in each other's way; excellent length and depth; 2) breakfast which is hard to match (second only or at par with the Hyatt in Beijing), offering both a buffet with meals from at least three continents and la carte choice, with divine waffles!; 3) location if you care to experience the bustling street life of Seminyak, with a fantastic choice of restaurants, bars, shops, massage parlors, etc. Our room had a fabulous ocean view, so we could watch the picture perfect sunsets from the comfort of our own balcony. Now a bit of a reality check -- I did not mind the steep price tag too much, as my brother paid for the room for his daughter and I was just a fellow traveller. It is a bit pricey compared to other places I have stayed at around the world. The spa for example (which is beautiful) has prices for a massage not twice but about 6 or 7 times the price you get by walking out of the hotel for about two minutes in either direction. And also, if you want a romantic kitschy picture style beach, this is not for you. This is a surfers beach, where you can play in the waves, but not really swim. But I assume many if not most beaches in Bali are like that. But you get compensated with the incredible sunsets!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2212,Everything is amazing!,50,December 2015,"The pool is excellent!
I love the lemon grass tea that served at the counter!
The location of the hotel is very convenient for those who travel to Bali for the first time.
However, I think the opening time for the pool and bar should be extended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2213,Good But Over-Priced,30,December 2015,"We are staying in this hotel now to celebrate NY and booked 2 rooms for 3 nights. We understand it's peak season's period and initially did not mind to pay $420++/night/room, hoping that the room & services should be same like standard 5-star hotels. Unfortunately, we got 1 of the room with broken AC. Called thru the Reception/Housekeeping to ask for AC repair and it took more than 30 minutes to wait for this person to come and fix it. Repairmen told us that they still have to come back again tomorrow to fix the AC. Wifi is always on and off, pretty much all the time. From the photos, we thought that their infinity pool looked huge and apparently not. We will consider other options with this kind of room rate, for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2214,Happy to be back,50,December 2015,"This is our second time at the Seminyak Resort, and yet again, they did a great job. Rooms were in good condition, beds extremely comfortable, and toileteries excellent!! The hotel is in a fantastic location, right between Potato Head Beach Club and Ku De Ta, and only a short walk from the center of Seminyak. The staff were incredibly friendly and looked after us well. We'll certainly be back....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2215,Excellent Staff,50,December 2015,"Staff not only welcoming, but couldn't do enough for the guests.
I was travelling on my own and the staff made extra effort to talk to me and make me feel safe and welcome.
I had got a nasty insect bite on my foot and they arranged for a doctor to come to the hotel to see me and I was seen within 20mins. Clean facilities and rooms. Toiletries very luxurious. Spa lovely and again staff very good. Would definitely stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2216,"Good, but maybe not worth the price",30,December 2015,"Though the staff, breakfast, location and pool are all good, the hotel and room felt slightly dated and we were left feeling a little disappointed. And definitely not the 5* concierge service you expect at similarly priced hotels. Events organised by hotel were nice. And overall staff and service was fantastic. At $300/night were would've been quite happy. I know it was high season, but at $600 you expect a lot more. Would I come again? For under $300, maybe. Because of service, great location and awesome breakfast (which is def. better than loads of 5* hotels around the world) i give it a solid 3.5, but since i can't and it's not really a 4 it gets 3.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2217,Christmas 2015,50,December 2015,"Wonderful stay at Seminyak Resort. The resort is beautiful. We had an ocean view suite with a full size jacuzzi, awesome!! The staff an service was excellent. Breakfast buffet was great lots of food choices. This is definitely a 5 star resort in every way!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2218,Excellent Hotel!,50,December 2015,"Arrived at hotel when there is a heavy downpour for the day, was prompty greeted by concierge staffs @ reception area. Checked-in was a breeze and even offered us a early checked in when it was pouring heavily outside. All staffs in the hotel are always there, ready to assist you in every ways they could! Room was clean, tidy & comfy! As we booked a garden view room, there wasn't any garden view for that stay as we were facing a wall of creepers after stepping out to the balcony! Overall experiences was awesome!!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2219,Garden of Eden,50,December 2015,"It was great place for honeymoon
Super friendly stuff always smiling and greeting
Location is also great
Of cource very effortable bali massages
Facilities were great and garden of Eden
Just you sd be careful for misquitos",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2220,Best hotel ever,50,June 2015,"This is my second time in Bali, last year I stayed in Sanur and this is my first trip to Seminyak. This really is second to none. It is fabulous. Right from the start of check in where you get a guided tour of your bedroom and detailed description of the buttons in the room and of the hotel too. Breakfast is stunning, giving such a fantastic choice from both menu and buffet which is all included. The pool is a bit busy especially in the best sun lounger spots. The hotel grounds are beautifully kept and all the staff are so helpful and friendly. We took a day trip out to Bali Safari which was such a great day out. We also took a walk everyday down into Seminyak onto the main road. The hotel is located perfectly.
I would most certainly stay again and 100% recommend it to other (already have!).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2221,If the beer by the pool was cold it would have been perfect,50,December 2015,I have stayed here 4 times. I love it. Had a poolside villa which was amazing and the option of the stunning beachside pool. Breakfast was fantastic other than the awkward size ( looooong ) shaped plates. The only real complaint was warm drinks by the pool. This is not uncommon in Bali but not good enough from a 5 star hotel. Here's a tip: turn up your fridge temperature!!!. This might sound petty but I have had the same complaint every year and nothing has changed. Pool service is also pretty slack and if down far end of pool you have to yell out and wave to get attention. I will go back but hope drinks are cold by the pool. Last chance. Staff were amazing but manager could loosen up a little and even consider saying hi to guests once in a while - especially those dining alone.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2222,Great hotel!,50,December 2015,"Spent a week at this amazing hotel. The staff were lovely and friendly. My siblings and I had a great time. The hotel is clean and in a great location. About 45 mins from the airport, an hour from Ubud and 30 to 45 mins from Kuta. Thank you for a lovely stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2223,Amazing hotel,50,December 2015,"Supposed to stay for 2 days, ended up coming back at the end of holiday for another 2 days. Staff were incredible and bent over backwards to help! Would come back in a heartbeat!! Visited the spa twice, had a lovely massage and then facial. Cannot recommend this place enough!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2224,honeymoon,50,December 2015,"beautiful getaway, prefect service ! Resort had amazing facilities with very welcoming and helpful staff. Would definitely stay at this resort again and will also recommend it to others planing to travel to Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2225,Fantastic stay,50,December 2015,"We're staying for 4 nights and it's an incredibly relaxing resort with really top notch facilities . A bit pricier but the experience is worth it. Large rooms with excellent bathrooms and comfortable beds. Great breakfast selection and nice dinner menus complement the excellent staff. Complementary yoga and meditation classes, DJ and music by the infinity pool at sunset. Would definitely stay here again. The location is good with shopping, restaurants and bars within walking distance. It is quite a distance from kuta owing to the heavy traffic but I would definitely pick this hotel again within Seminyak. Our last night should be treated with a massage to top off a great getaway .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2226,very good,50,December 2015,"There is very wonderful pool and scene.
Staff also very kind and always smiling.
Spa is very good facilities and skill.
There is many kind of food every day in the morning in buffet.
I want to go there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2227,You simply have to...,50,December 2015,"An outstanding hotel, the pictures and reviews simply cannot do it justice ‚Äì this is something you have to experience for yourself. I had been to Bali two times previously and not enjoyed my stay on both occasions, so this time I was determined to research a hotel which met my requirements exactly. It had to have more than one swimming pool, superior dining options, a spa that could rival those in large cosmopolitan cities and most importantly direct beach access. This hotel provided all this and so much more. Everything is first rate, the luxuriousness of the accommodation, the genuine pleasantness of the staff on every level, the food, the gym, the spa, the gardens, the rooms, the everything. This hotel has the best housekeeping services I have experienced anywhere, the attention to detail is meticulous and it makes an obvious impression to seasoned travellers. The facilities where second to none and my partner and I hardly moved from the swimming pool, unless it was to the beach and then back again. Food is reasonably priced and service is great ‚Äì friendly and non-pushy. You are left to relax and when you need something it does not take long for a member of staff to almost magically appear. The airport transfer was effortless and so well done. I also cannot mention enough what an awesome location this hotel has, not only being right on the beach but close to wonderful restaurants and night spots. Wi-Fi coverage extends across the complex and by Bali standards it is reasonably reliable, more than the cellular signal. You cannot go wrong staying with them.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2228,Perfect tranquil resort in Seminyak,50,December 2015,"I stayed her unfortunately only for one night with my friend. We were I prssed from the moment we checked in. The staff bed over backwards to help and serve you in any way. The two poles are divine, and we mainly spent our time at the infinity pool. There are several hits with billowing curtains and beds - perfectly decadent for an afternoon nap or meditation. We enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast in the divinely serene reset arrant, which is surrounded by ponds. Because we had a late evening fight, we were able to use the spa facilities to shower and prepare for our flight.
I wish I could have stayed longer at the Seminyak, and I will definitely be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2229,Great resort & beautiful beach and sunset,50,December 2015,"It is a very nice resort with big room & beautiful beach & pool, the service & breakfast is very good, staffs are very helpful and provide excellent service. I went with mum with old age and they alway come to help my mum and give very personal service by holding her hand n help her walk up to stair...

The beach & pool is so beautiful and is the perfect place to watch Seminyak sunset, the pool are quiet n no kids shouting around and breezy...the only thing is I noticed there are some bite seem from sand flies that very itchy which I suspect I got it while I relaxed at the pool side. Apply your insect repellant will safe you from mosquito or sand flies...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2230,Awesome from start of trip to departure !,50,December 2015,"Breakfast - fantastic with freshly made pancakes, waffles and French toasts not to mention the extensive Buffett section !

Infinity pool - one of (if not) the best amoungst other comparable hotels along the beach.

Rooms were fantastic - cleaned in the morning and beds prepared before our return at night. (With a different 'sneaky' bedside treat to indulge in before calling it a night) - nice touch Seminyak resort :)

Gardens immaculate and setting in true Bali style.

I would recommend this resort & are already looking foward to our return !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2231,Excellent stay at The Seminyak,50,December 2015,"I recently stayed in one of the Suites at The Seminyak and i must say that i had such a great experience. Everything was perfect from the Suite and the amenities, the very kind and helpful staff, food and drinks as well as in-room dining were just superb. I can only recommend The Seminyak to anyone who wants to spend a marvellous stay in a wonderful property right at the beach in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2232,Excellent,50,December 2015,"We have a wonderful stay, the location was perfect, walking distance to everything we needed. The room and view were was amazing. We couldn't fault anything. When we got stuck at a restaurant in Jimbaran Bay on the last night due to flooded road and wasn't able to get back in time for our transfer to the airport and would have missed our light the hotel collected our bags from the storage and drove down to get us and made sure we got to the Airport on time. Thank you so much for a wonderful weekend in bali",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2233,Great position on the beach,40,December 2015,"Fantastic spot on a quiet stretch of beach, close to shopping and restaurants. Lovely staff throughout although the pool staff seemed timid to offer drinks /menus etc..you had to ask. Divine infinity pool..the hotel tolerates hawkers selling while you are in the pool which at first surprised me but guess whatbit didn't take me long and I bought things so thought it was quite fun and harmless. Sunsets here are incredible! The gardens are lovely and rooms modern..we had very whiffy pillows but just used the spare ones..not sure what goes on there as I read someone else's review stating same. Sure I could have complained but who wants to bother when you are relaxing. I would have no hesitation in returning here if the price was right..we got an excellent rate so very happy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2234,fantastic relaxing break,50,December 2015,"We stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for 6 nights. We had booked the Garden wing but upgraded when we arrived - glad we did because our room was beach-front, first floor and fantastic. (Did not view the garden wing so can't comment further).

Breakfast was excellent, great menu, great service, great location

Pool was clean and overlooking the beach so spent hours just relaxing. beds very comfortable and again the service was great. poolside food and drink good value. water was very warm, but then so was the weather!

Only ate one evening in the hotel, but meal was good standard and value.

Overall staff were friendly, reception and door men could not do more for you.

Great stay, thoroughly recommended... enjoy!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2235,"Romantic Honeymoon, Gorgeous Pool, Great Staff",40,November 2015,"We spent the first week of our honeymoon here. The Staff was amazing from the time we checked in, at the restaurant, and concierge assisting us with all of our travel deals. Room was gorgeous and comfortable with amazing views. Breakfast was so good every day with a main entr√©e and endless buffet. The pool was the best part overlooking the ocean and the spectacular daily sunsets. We liked that the hotel was located on a remote section of the beach so it was peaceful and clean. Good swimming and surfing right in front of the hotel. Plus it was only 10-20 minute walk to all the major Seminyak shopping and restaurants.

We would definitely stay here again, but we would look for a room away from the dining area as it was noisy in the morning. Also, we would probably not book a driver to see the sights (e.g. Tanah Lot) with the hotel as it was more than twice as expensive as you can get in town.

And take advantage of the spa. We did a two hour couples massage which was amazingly relaxing. It is more expensive than the streets, but the facilities are much nicer!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2236,Excellent hospitality,50,December 2015,"Everything is good,service excellent, Problem with vegetarians ,no choice,specially for Jains ,all staff are very well cultured, spa is also good, Breakfast quality is also very good, all seasonal fruits are available",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Great hotel and friendly staff. Definitely going back again next year for a longer stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2238,Relax in luxury,50,November 2015,"I stayed 9 nights in a beach wing room. Everything was perfect from the welcoming checkout process to the luxurious spa treatments and spectacular infinity pool. Would definitely return if possible. All staff were friendly and very professional. The king size bed and beautiful bathroom made my stay very comfortable indeed. I spent every day relaxing by the pool and enjoying the peaceful surrounds. As a solo female traveller, I always felt comfortable and safe at The Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2239,Bali holiday,50,December 2015,"We stayed 5 nights at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa in a Ocean Suite. We could not fault anything at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. For start, we were picked up at the airport by the resort's car and were greeted by a smiling staff, at the resort all the staff are very polite and always smiling, the resort itself are clean and well kept especially the infinite pool which is beautiful, the resort location are close to the shops and the Seminyak Square about 10 minutes walk, the room is huge with all the amenities which are available in a 5 star property, the bathroom and toilet are huge and beautiful. Probably I could only fault them is their breakfast it lack bit of variety, even though we could order instant cook breakfast. Other than that, we would definitely will be back. PS. be very careful with the money exchange on the street of Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2240,"Lovely rooms, great service, top location",50,December 2015,"Had a sensational stay at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. Friendly and ever present service, facilities excellent, location excellent and the rooms were magnificent.
On the pricey side but looks like one of the top resorts in the area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2241,Rest and relax,40,November 2015,"Stay 2 night in The Seminyak and find the staff service to be very friendly and prompt. Room is spacious and breakfast buffet spread to be very good and the food is nice as well. Not to mention the nice pool to relax and watch sunset in the distance. As our flight is late night, the staff even offer us to take a shower before we head to airport. This is a really nice gesture of the staff. Thanks.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2242,Wonderful days at this great beach resort,50,November 2015,"A beautiful hot right at the beach, their infinite pool is amazing and you will have a very pleasant stay here. Their garden is very nice and the SPA facility is very nice as well. Music at the pool at evening was a very good compliment when watching the beautiful sun-set over Indian Ocean from the pool area. Their food is very good and you can enjoy a good pool menu when you look out over the ocean. It's very good location in Seminyak and the personal have very good tips on where to go when you are in Seminyak. They are very service-minded and treat you very well when you visit their hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2243,Home Away From Home,50,November 2015,"This was our second stay here. We just love it! We actually just walked off the street without a booking this time and were in our room within half an hour. Again we stayed in a Beach Wing Room - room was clean, well appointed and the bed super comfortable. Turn down service each night left a small edible sweet treat. Staff were all so friendly, making a point to say hello, ask how we were and welcome us back every time we returned to the resort. Nothing was ever too much trouble and each request was met with great service and a quick response. Love the changes to the breakfast buffet - you order your eggs, omelette, pancakes or waffles off a menu now, with fruit, breads, Indonesian foods, juices etc still being available in the buffet. Breakfast quality was very high and well worth including into your accommodation. There were a number of free activities provided each day - made use of the free yoga offered and wish I had managed to make some of the meditation sessions - next time. Equipment in the gym was well maintained and the infinity pool just beautiful with great pool side service (hawkers on the beach are a bit off putting though). Location is perfect, a short walk to eat street, right on the beach and plenty of shopping nearby. We will most definitely be back again next year.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2244,Amazing hotel,50,December 2015,Perfect hotel fantastic views across to the sea from the grounds and pool. Staff exceptionally polite and attentative. Amazing breakfast. Rooms stunning. No complaints at all. Definitely recommend this hotel.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

All room clean and friendly staff with good services for my family.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2246,Fantastic Holiday,50,November 2015,"An amazing location, fantastic service and awesome pool. The only negative would be that the restaurant is a bit pricey if you don't have breakfast included in your stay. Not that this is a huge issue as there are numerous breakfast options a short walk away at local restaurants. Overall highly recommend and would not hesitate to stay again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2247,Holiday,50,November 2015,we unfortunatley only stayed one night but the hotel is stunning from reception to the room to the staff to the pool and to the beach!! Welcomed by lovely staff from the moment we left our taxi outside. We will be back......as soon as possible I just need to save some money!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2248,Very nice service and view,50,November 2015,"We went for honeymoon. They had great service. The swimming pool was beautiful.
The food was excellent. If I have friends who want to go to Bali, I will recommend to stay at this hotel. I will go there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2249,Great romantic holiday!,50,November 2015,"Perfect for couples looking for a quiet retreat with everything in arm's reach. Lovely spacious room, gorgeous grounds, perfect location (bars, shopping, good restaurants close by), incredible beach-front/sunset view, great food, and overwhelmingly warm and attentive staff. If you occasionally want more of a raucous atmosphere, it's just a short walk down the beach. Also, everything people said about the breakfast is true! OMG! It's awesome!

This was our first time to Bali and my husband and I normally like to get out and about when we travel but we were totally content to stay around the resort for most of our week on the island.

Breakfast: The days started with breakfast... and the breakfast buffet is pretty incredible. If you're a latte drinker like me, they'll make you a pretty incredible latte or whatever else you want. From there you can order any number of items off the menu (lovely waffles, french toast, eggs, etc.) and/or you can pick about the buffet that has a lovely selection of juices, fruits, breads, cereals, and pastries, as well as all of the indonesian/balinese favorites you've been told to try (all very good). My favorite was actually the balinese rice porridge. Have one of the staff make a bowl for you and you'll be set. They also have a station that has a fruit of the day (prepared several ways) and balinese favorites that also change daily. I guess what I'm saying is that whether you want to try the local food or stay in your comfort zone, you'll be very happy.

Pool bar & Cabana Scene: We stayed poolside most of our days there. The drinks are a little spendy by balinese standards but still fairly cheap by American standards. The bar staff are super accommodating and friendly and the bar food isn't too bad and also quite cheap. We ate and drank poolside for 5 days (ALL DAY) and accumulated a bar tab of less than US$300. We looked around and you can get food and drinks cheaper elsewhere but we didn't see the point since the location was so incredible.

Time of year: We went in November, which is the tail end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season. That said, it didn't rain a drop while we were there and the resort was blissfully empty and quiet.

Restaurant: We ate at a few of the high-end places around the resort strip and all were pretty mediocre, especially compared to the Seminyak's in-house restaurant. Comparably priced to other resorts but way underrated food. We loved everything we ordered there! Great food!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2250,A place to relax,40,November 2015,"During the stay of 3 nights there, I would recommend this place to mature adults who is actually looking for a quiet place to stay. 10 to 15mins walks to shopping/dining places. But it is a great place to catch up with friends, partners or elderly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2251,Superb choice for stay,50,November 2015,"An excellent pick for a hotel if you want to be in the midst of great restaurants, bars and shopping as it is cocooned by a wide variety of outlets. Situated in a choice location, the hotel has rooms that face the sea and our room was one of them. The room with its contemporary settings was large, clean, well kept and very comfortable.

We thoroughly enjoyed the view from our room, the sunken jacuzzi bath and the balcony where we sat soaking in the atmosphere of the Seminyak beach. There is however a need for the hotel maintenance crew to take note. The jacuzzi releases an odd smell when it is turned on. We had to quickly shut the jacuzzi function in the tub.

As the hotel is situated next to Ku De Ta (on the left of the hotel), we had our evening drinks there after setting our cameras on the beach to capture the beautiful setting sun over the horizon. We also had a most pleasant and fun walk on the beach towards our dinner spot for the evening, La Lucciola, which was just 10 mins away from the hotel. The hotel location is simply superb.

Staff service is excellent. Always greeted by smiles and assistance in every way. Breakfast is sumptuous with a wide variety of healthy and tasty foods. The infinity pool with its well thought designs to enable sitting in the pool, is to die for as it located where it faces the sea. The grounds of the hotel are well landscaped and encourages lounging around in the day bed/pavilions placed around part of the smaller pool. The hotel as a whole is kept in pristine condition.

We would definitely stay there again on our next visit to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2252,Wonderful,50,November 2015,"Excellent. The service was great, the room as described and well maintained. The breakfast was excellent. The arrangement of trips and advice on local things was excellent.

The swimming pool was really nice but lacked sufficient shade and the pool menu restricted and did not change. Access to the beach was good but it would have been nice if they had deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach.

Check in was very smooth but check out was not the greatest. The bill slipped under the door overnight was one day out of date and nobody came up to collect our bags even though it had been requested twice.

It was an important trip (Honeymoon) and it lived up to expectation. We got a good deal on the price so I have no issue with it's cost. We would definitely recommend",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2253,Enjoyable Stay,40,November 2015,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. Our room was located across the street from the main property, which wasn't an issue cause the walk isn't very far but for the price it's quite steep for not staying on the main property. The main strip where restaurants and shopping is located is about a 5 minute walk and taxis are available everywhere.
The room itself is spacious, the washroom was a good size as well as the patio. We had to get our pillows swapped the first night as it smelt like mildew. The shower also smelt like rotting eggs whenever you turn it on but the smell will eventually go away after you run the water for a few minutes.
The infinity pool overlooking the ocean was amazing. Sun beds were always available as well as cabanas. We did not eat any meals at the resort but that's cause we wanted to eat out and try local restaurants.
Service was typical and friendly but nothing spectacular. Overall, our stay was enjoyable. The pool was the best part of the resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2254,nice n clear for stay,50,November 2015,"Great service, friendly staffs every where.
Our flight arrive hotel in the morning around 9am, Room was available and they let us check in early, so we don't need to wait until hotel check in time in the afternoon. Appreciated it.
Good location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2255,Paradise,50,November 2015,"This is a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy a resort and spa. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and clean. Loved the modern bathroom with a fabulous soaking tub. We had a nice outdoor space that was semi- private. The pool had a ton of amenities and the beach is close. We ate a perfect lunch by the ocean and had dinner at the main restaurant which both times were very good. We also had treatments at the spa which were professional and just what we needed. The town is within walking distance and has shopping and restaurants. I definitely would like to return to this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2256,PARADISE IN BALI,50,November 2015,The ocean veiw room with a private pool the sunset the perfect getaway for a romantic week or two or three and so on.If you can't afford the ocean veiw room with the private pool the main pool area is also amazing at sunset,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2257,"Beautiful property, stunning pools and view, great service.",50,November 2015,"What can we say, direct access to a clean and calm beach, well-maintained grounds, gracious staff and a prime location on Seminyak's best stretch if beach. The view alone from the negative edge pool is worth the stay. Rooms are in beautiful hardwoods with lovely carvings and details. Seminyak's best restos are a short walk away. The hotel breakfast spread is gorgeous and staff are attentive and proactive. The poolside bar in the quiet pool beside Senja resto is lovely and secluded if you want more privacy. Value for money!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2258,Excellent pool but just not what I expected...,30,November 2015,"The Seminyak Beach hotel is on a great location. The pool is probably the best pool in the area with shortest distance to sea compared to the other 5* hotels on the beach. It's a short run from your sun lounger to the ocean and back to the pool. In the evenings it's a short stroll to loads of restaurants, bars and to the center of town.

The service is a bit disappointing. Yes, they have the staff educated in the customary greetings and stuff like that but when requesting something outside their usual practise it's difficult and almost impossible to get it done. We asked for a late check out and only after pushing back we managed to get it agreed. Not a massive issue but these kind of conversations happened a few times during our 3 days stay and then it starts to get annoying... first world problems...

The food isn't any special either. I'd recommend to go somewhere close in town where Seminyak has some pretty amazing places hidden away.

Over all, it's a good hotel but overpriced and underperforming in current state.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2259,Beautiful Stay at The Seminyak,50,November 2015,"Stayed in The Room Garden Wing, November 2015. Room was gorgeous and very spacious, very comfy king size bed. Grounds are immaculate and we spent every day at the infinity pool. It only takes a minute to walk to the main complex - for those who claim it's necessary to stay on the beach side I wouldn't totally agree. We saved a lot of money booking a room across the street (the room itself is exactly the same as the beach side rooms). If you don't want to walk over the road the golf cart service is very handy and simple to use after a long day of swimming! Staff are exceptionally well mannered and helpful. The bathrooms in the rooms are only semi-private. The glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom does have a blind you can roll down for some more privacy but the doors are not solid! Food and drinks by the pool are not cheap but were very good. Would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2260,Great stay,50,November 2015,"Loved our stay at The Seminiyak. Great location, wonderful service, omg - the breakfast feat! And most of all the ocean views. You can hear the waves. Brilliant.
Cannot find anything to complain about............looking forward to another visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2261,Only there for one night but will definitely book again,50,November 2015,"We stayed at the Seminyak for one night before finally being able to get home from Bali after volcanic activity. In hindsight I wished that we had booked there previously for a lengthy stay. We had a garden room and we were very happy with the room the friendly staff and service. Having previously stayed at the Samaya prior to this stay, you would think that this would be of lesser quality but that would be a mistake. Grounds were immaculate, staff extremely helpful and willing to start up a conversation to make you feel at home.

We're already planning our next trip to Bali and the Seminyak is on our list to stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2262,A perfect place to stay.,50,November 2015,"Good location, perfect staff and very nice rooms. The perfect location for a quiet and relaxing stay.

2263,Nice getaway place in Seminyak,50,October 2015,"This resort is just perfect, not too big and not too small. It has beach access and close to all hip locations in Seminyak. The service, room and food are excellent. All fun places in Seminyak are either walking distance or a minimum cost if you decide to take taxi, The room is very spacious, clean with nice modern decor. The free wifi connection is great so you are always connected.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2264,The very best Hotel in Seminyak! Highly recommended.,50,November 2015,"This is the best location ever- Right next door to KU-DE-Ta and Potatoe head.
The infinity pool was amazing, and sunsets were the best from the hotel.
Beautiful grounds, amazing rooms, the very best service and assistance.
Free afternoon teas for guests everyday, conducive to meeting other guests while drinking fab coffee and high tea! yes please.
I have travelled to Bali 10 times, and this has topped it!
Even though we were stranded in Bali, this magical place made the world of difference. we are already planning our next holiday there!
Highly recommended",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2265,Top hotel,50,November 2015,"I think we chose a great hotel for my first trip to Bali. It is in a quiet location on the beach, but only a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of the main town.

The room was beautiful, the staff friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was truly excellent.

I would stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2266,Outstanding,50,November 2015,"We stayed in the garden rooms in a ground floor room facing the pool. We were very happy with the generous room size and the outlook over the pool. The rooms are nicely appointed, clean and the bed was very comfortable. The garden rooms have their own reception, pool and afternoon tea is served for free. If you are not getting a beach front room I would suggest save your money and stay in the garden wing.

The short walk across the road to the main facility provided breakfast which was a good standard hotel buffet. The pastries are amazing!! The pool area overlooking the beach was sensational. The sea was clean and I swam everyday. This is the first time in 6 visits I have felt it was clean enough.

Service was excellent everywhere. Always hellos and smiles every single time we saw a staff member.

I would recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2267,"Great location, beach front",50,November 2015,"Got upgraded to the pool villa by the ocean. Fantastic location, superbly clean, professional and great amenities.
Restaurant value was a little disappointing but there are lots of great restaurants nearby.

Will definitely stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2268,Amazing Resort!,50,November 2015,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this resort for about a week in November and we have nothing but great things to say about this resort. The grounds are stunning. Very clean and very well manicured. The infinity pool located right on the beach is stunning and a great place to watch the sunset every night. The staff was top notch. Always so friendly with genuine smiles every single day. Food was also very good, but a little on the expensive side in my opinion. We did get a room with breakfast included and the breakfast was really outstanding. Overall, great place to stay and I would definitely stay here again if I ever end up in Seminyak again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2269,Paradise,50,November 2015,"Stunning hotel, perfect location right on the beach and amazing staff. This was our second stay here and will definitely return. Madi Adi's attention to detail and presentation within our room made our stay exceptional.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2270,The ultimate beach vacation,50,October 2015,"This is our second time here and we love it even more. We stayed here for 3 nights and we got upgraded. My 3yo son enjoyed every inched of this resort, the beach front, and he also loves the breakfast food which made our vacation seemed easy and relaxing. The staff were very friendly. it feels like our home away from home.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2271,One of the best in Bali!,50,November 2015,"Me and my wife stayed in this hotel for 3 days...I wish we could stay longer, and here is why.

GOOD
The service is the top quality. Every staff is so professional and attentive, remember our names.

Our ocean view villa is incredible. We are right behind the public swimming pool and the beach. We can hear the waves and the pool is very quiet surprisingly.

The room is very big with high quality details, the bed is so comfortable. Our private pool is right outside the room and it even has two day tanning benches and a huge day bed.

The breakfast is the best in town. It has a great combination of local and western food. Both are in top quality in terms of tastes.

Our villa has very good privacy with the plants and trees separating us from the public pool in front. We have no issue with no noise from other guests.

BAD
The hotel is a bit off the main street, but there is like 5 min walk.

The spa is quite pricy, but I will definitely try it next time we go back.

I will recommend this hotel and definitely will come back next time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2272,Paradise!!,50,October 2015,"I went in sept for a long weekend and then again in October. I have previously stayed at Oberoi... And I have stayed in Kuta. By far this is the best. The beds, staff, infinity pool, location and best breakfast and plunger coffee ever. I will never stay anywhere else. But I would say... If u have kids... I would stay at a place that has a pool with a slide... It was great with my 16 year old.. But my 9 year old would have missed playing with other kids.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2273,Resort by the Sea,50,October 2015,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is a great location on the beach with fantastic facilities. Stayed in a beach room, very spacious, clean with all amenities. The pools are amazing with the best view of the sunset. The surrounding gardens were wonderful. Restaurants that cater for all. The staff were always available to assist and very friendly. This was an ideal location & resort for travelling solo. I would highly recommend and can't wait to go back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2274,Infinity Pool and Beyond,50,August 2015,"We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of our holidays and we got upgraded to a deluxe room when we checked in. The hotel decor was top notch throughout with lovely wood carvings and shiny marble. The room was huge and had a large bathroom with a hot tub. Be warned that it takes hours to fill. The highlight was the pool, the bar in the pool, the beach and the restaurant overlooking the beach. We spent hours there. The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2275,Amazing Hotel,50,October 2015,"Went for 10 days with the Mrs, from start to finish the hotel was superb, an excellent location right on the beach. Service was superb and the staff were so keen to do anything for us. We booked breakfast only and chose to eat out and night. The range and quality of food in the mornings was excellent and couldn't ask for more. The hotel grounds are spotless and the hotel itself was peaceful and not over crowded with plenty of sunbeds loungers and gazebos. The beach comes right to the hotel pool and is relatively quiet. About 800m towards kuta there are a few beach bars which play live music to watch the sunset too but you do not hear them at all due to the distance. One of the best hotels I have been too. I also booked a romantic meal for the Mrs bday which came at an extra cost, we had our own gazebo and waiter and 100 candles in a very romantic setting, they even made her a bday cake as well and fine dining food was delicious. Weather was also sunny everyday with the odd bit of haze and a slight breeze. Plenty of things to do in seminyak and plenty of nice restaurants with great value for money. Was surprised how many Ozzies there were in seminyak as I didn't realise how close it was to Australia. Seems a lot of ex pats reside there and I don't blame them as its so nice. Also recommend the white water rafting was amazing to see the monkeys and big lizards in the jungle while dodging the Rapids. Definitely recommend the hotel and area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2276,Perfect hotel for a luxury relaxing stay,50,November 2015,The staff is very friendly and extremly helpful. The rooms beach side are perfectly equiped and provide anything you might need. The pool area is a dream during day and night a pleasure to walk through.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2277,Gorgeous view of Seminyak Beach!,50,October 2015,"The hotel looks very new....beautiful. Location is tops, just next to Kudeta and The Legian. U can walk everywhere.
Everything looks very beautiful, room was spacious, toilet was huge...the jacuzzi was a little ridiculous though. We used it and had to wait almost an hour for the water to fill, definately needs some work.
Breakfast was a little mediocre. Selection was not very impressive considering this is a 5 star hotel.
The pool was lovely...just about as close as u can get to the beach!
I guess the only thing i found lacking was the feeling of opulence...which i think this hotel has great potential to be. Its a fantastic hotel...just that i think theres room for improvement in terms of adding value to ones stay:)
Oh and the staff definately deserve a mention, true proffesionals, always friendly and helpful!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2278,"Fantastic location, beautiful rooms and a great night sleep",50,November 2015,Wonderful stay at a gorgeous resort. The rooms and facilities are beautiful. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. The staff also organised us a private driver for the day. Would definitely recommend this resort.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2279,Perfect escape oasis,50,October 2015,"Wonderful friendly service in an outstanding location. Retna in guest relations was a delight from the moment we arrived and always happy to help, she is a real gem. Our room was clean neat and well appointed. All the staff went out of their way to make our stay most enjoyable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2280,"Fabulous hotel, lovely staff.",50,March 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend. It was perfect. We stayed across the road and would happily do this again. The infinity pool was simply amazing and over looking the beach and ocean. Location was spot on for restaurants and shopping. Thank you to all the staff, especially 'Red' the Manager, she was so helpful with suggestions for places to eat, even making the bookings for us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2281,Amazing infinity pool,50,October 2015,"We very much enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak hotel, specially the infinity pool which is amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful!
We had a room in the building across the street, which was ok except that it was a bit loud, as our room was facing the street. The room had a beautiful big bath tub and the setup was fantastic.
Its quite expensive compared to other hotels in Bali.
The hotel is about 15min walking distance from the center along a very busy but dark road.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2282,The most incredible resort we've ever stayed at!,50,October 2015,"Ok, everyone, if you're looking for an amazing resort DIRECTLY on the beach in Seminyak, look no further than the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. My husband and I have stayed at a few resorts in the US, Japan, etc. and this is BY FAR the best we've EVER had the pleasure of staying at. The entire resort is built as an indoor-outdoor experience so you always have open-air hallways and feel connected to the outside. The grounds are spectacular-- beautiful water features, cabanas to sleep in, and an incredible infinity pool that directly abuts the beach. They even have a a swim-up bar and multiple smaller pools (sort of like man-made rivers) to swim in if you're not interested in the infinity pool. The beach in front of the resort is very well maintained and clean and we weren't continuously harassed by vendors hawking their goods. The staff at the resort were amazing and always greeted us with smiles. When we checked in the manager at the front desk upgraded us to a suite for free, which made our experience absolutely incredible. For those of you who are looking for a resort with a good location, you won't be disappointed with where this resort is in Seminyak. We could walk to the busy, shop-filled, downtown area in about 10 minutes. Perfect! Cannot say enough about this resort!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2283,Nice hotel,40,August 2015,"We just had the basic room across the road from the main hotel and we were quite happy. The room was a good size and it was quiet so we slept well. The bathroom was great it had a walk in shower and huge bath tub. It didn't bother us not being in the main part of the hotel you just have to cross over a road and they have a security guard stop the traffic for you. Breakfast was lovely a large selection to choose from. Staff were wonderful and go out of their way to make you enjoy your stay. Lovely big pool. Great location for the beach, short stroll to the shops and good restaurants, bars near by.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2284,Great Stay,50,October 2015,"Great stay at the hotel, did not eat in the hotel ever apart from a few pool snacks. Spacious, clean, friendly and super location for dining/shopping/trips.

We would have added breakfast upon arrival, however it was 30US$ pp, which we could not justify paying that amount for. However we are now glad in hindsight, since there were some fantastic breakfast restaurants within 2-10 minutes walk, at a much more reasonable price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2285,Perfect,50,October 2015,"We booked in for the final night of our holiday and couldn't have been happier. Beautiful hotel, great location, great room and lovely breakfast. The free afternoon tea was a really pleasant surprise! We didn't have dinner in the hotel as there are so many good restaurants to choose from nearby, but the breakfast buffet was brilliant. We would love to come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2286,Best Stay Ever,50,November 2015,"I am in love with ""The Seminyak"" and I am missing it already. The hotel service was excellent, rooms are clean (thanks to the housekeeping). Hotel staff are professional and friendly. You can see the sea and waves from the pool. ...what a lovely sight ‚ù§ The breakfast is good üëçüëçüëçThis is my first trip to Bali and I really enjoyed it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2287,Perfect relax vacation!,40,October 2015,Excellent location! Close to many restaurants and shopping district. The resort is very nice and the staff are so nice and attentive to you. I was alone and booked a room in the building across the street and it was just fine for me.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2288,Great stay,40,August 2015,"Pleasant staff, wonderful buffet breakfast, great room and location. Only complaint is that the room was not very well soundproofed as one night the you could hear the extremely loud music from Ku De Ta until 3am.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2289,Beautiful experience in Seminyak!,50,October 2015,"Located in the heart of a wonderful shopping and dining district, but a quiet and beautiful getaway!

Seminyak just does it RIGHT. We were ""leied"" with Balinese flowers as we stepped out of the cab, and the experience was top-notch from there. Our room was quiet, comfortable, and spacious, and the bathroom was a dream! We had a balcony that had a wonderful view, and bottled water was continuously supplied by the staff.

Seminyak is within walking distance of several notable restaurants, as well as plenty of boutique shopping and a market. On the beach, there are surfing lessons and boogie boards for rent. The pool is gorgeous, and there's a lounge area specifically for watching the sunsets.

Packing tip: Seminyak provides bottled water, coffee, shampoo and conditioner, body wash, razors, toothbrush/toothpaste, and several other small things that were helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2290,Stunning,50,October 2015,"Perfect, great staff, on the beach, beautiful pool. Everything you could need.. In the heart of the best shopping and eat spots. There are many rooms there but you wouldn't know it, plenty of space and what a great pool with two options including a swim up bar.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2291,Perfect place for a wedding,50,October 2015,"Our daughter chose this place for her wedding,coming from Adelaide most of the guest didn't know what to expect.
They were all amazed at how beautiful the setting was, how great the food was , and how professional the staff were.
The most common phase we heard was,THE BEST WEDDING WE HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
Our wedding planner MONICA was excellent ,and made it all so easy for us, she had everything under control and nothing was to much trouble for her.
The food in this place is amazing , the food prepared for the wedding was spectacular ,but it is fantastic food everyday from morning till night ...thanks to their French chef DAVID who is not only a great chef but also friendly and concerned as what every one would like to eat and if they are happy
All the staff here are great and to a amazing job ..nothing is too hard.....the rooms are awesome and so are the room attendants....special thanks to ours...
MadiAdi....who made our towels into swans and left us a handwritten note hoping we have a nice day and a wonderful stay ......which of course we did.....but it's little things like this that make this place special
THANKYOU TOO ALL WHO MADE MY DAUGHTERS WEDDING DAY THE BEST DAY EVER FOR HER!!!!!!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2292,Beautiful Pool.,50,October 2015,"There are the Garden view rooms and beach rooms.
We opted for the cheaper garden view room. Which is literally a 30 second walk across the main hotel. You just cross a small road. It‚Äôs a lot cheaper‚Ä¶ and technically who spends the whole day in their rooms when you have an amazing pool and you are in BALI!! So save the money

The pool:
Simply amazing. Breath-taking. Luxury. Service is top.
Breakfast: Fantastic.
Location: excellent. Walking distance to everything.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with the hotel. It is simply wonderful. The people, the food, the services. They serve afternoon tea and coffee with some snacks which is great as it‚Äôs complimentary. It was just perfect.

Cons: I don‚Äôt have any. If I‚Äôm being really picky and must pick on something maybe the lighting of the room could have been better. Or the room a bit bigger? I don‚Äôt know really. I just made those up. There are really are no cons with this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2293,Great location in Seminyak,40,October 2015,"I stayed 3 nights for at The Seminyak. Great location, easily walkable to all the restaurants and bars. Beautiful beach and pool area. Great for sunsets. Food was above average both at the bar and at breakfast. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice, clean, slightly higher end place in Seminyak. Staff was amazing too!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2294,Fantastic beach hotel,50,October 2015,"Excellent location near shops and bars.
Fabulous infinity pool right by the beach.
Great breakfast with freshly made a la carte hot choice and fresh coffee.
Good pool lunch menu.
Friendly, nothing too much trouble service.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2295,Great End to Honeymoon Trip,50,October 2015,Perfect place to end our two week honeymoon in Bali. The staff is amazing and the rooms are beautiful. We let the hotel know it was our honeymoon and they put gorgeous roses in our room and made sure we had a wonderful ocean view room. Perfect walking distance to Seminyak Square for shopping and bars/restaurants.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2296,Honeymoon,50,October 2015,"We went here on Honeymoon. We stayed 10 days in a gardenview room. The accomodation, the food and the staff were superb!

We used the spa an it was delightful, we had a romantic candlelight diner and the atmosphere and food were great!

Kind regards

2297,Excellent Hotel - Honeymoon Stay,50,October 2015,"I'm typing this review on the night of 22/10/15 whilst laid on the 'King Coil' mattress in our room in the beach wing, our last night of our 10 day honeymoon at this hotel. What a bed!!!! Knowing what this hotels reviews have been like before we came...I can now absolutely confirm that the staff here are super, so friendly and helpful. The small touches made our stay that extra bit special. Our large and comfy room was excellent with air con on all the time, electronic safe installed together with a chargeable mini fridge... and it was cleaned daily. Wifi all over the hotel which included the infinity pool area which worked all the time with sufficient signal strength. The beach wing has a very calming atmosphere. The grounds are IMMACULATE. Gardeners working all the time. The view onto the beach front is BREATH TAKING. It's clean and invigorating. Sitting on your sun lounger, by the infinity pool, you look over a virtually empty infinity pool, a virtually empty beach and onto the crashing waves of the sea, watching the surfers. The hotel was full during our stay but never seemed busy at the pool area. There was no need to rush in a morning to reserve a sun bed. The beach in front of the hotel appears reserved for the hotel so there was no sun beds on it. The closeness of the sea was great with a 20 second stroll from the pool to the beach. The infinity pool was clean and very warm. Security staff on duty all the time at the hotel, both at the entrance and at the beach front. Breakfast good. Both me and my wife would recommend this hotel. We hope to stay again in the future. Well done to the management for running such a grand hotel. Special thanks to Rori at the reception and Supaman at the restaurant/pool areas, who are a credit to the hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2298,Perfect location and great pool,50,October 2015,"We recently spent 7 nights at The Seminyak and our stay was perfect.

The location is great. You can easily walk to the best cafes and restaurants, otherwise you can rent a scooter directly across the road from the resort.

The standard rooms are really spacious and the king size beds are very comfortable. The resort itself has a more transitional style and feel to it than some of the newer resorts such as the W. However I personally preferred this as it is in keeping with the natural environment and Balinesse culture. Make sure you book ""beach side"" as there are cheaper rooms across the road and it's not nearly as peaceful as being on the gardens and beach side. We had a ground room which was perfect - simply walk out to the lush gardens and straight to the infinity pool.

We booked without breakfast and I would do the same again. There are heaps of great modern cafes around which are perfect for brekkie and the breakfast didn't look all that great for $30 usd.

Staff are really helpful and very friendly.

For thre price this resort is great and to be right on the beach really added to the holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2299,Well positioned in Seminyak,50,December 2014,"We stayed at this hotel for 10 days over the 2014/15 Christmas period and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel is well positioned in Seminyak and is right on the beach. The infinity pool over looking the beach is first class. My 4 year old daughter had a fantastic time, and the staff made such a fuss of her. This hotel is not aimed at children, however the families that stay with small children are certainly made to feel very welcome. We stayed in The Suite Ocean side and the room was very clean and had lots of space for a little one to run around. Breakfast was good, though does have room for improvement. My husband had to reorder his eggs on several occasions. Room service was tasty and efficient. I really enjoyed the spa, though you are able to have treatments much cheaper outside the hotel. The location is walking distance to many wonderful restaurants. The staff on the front desk are very helpful and are more than happy to arrange taxi's and make restaurant bookings. If I was to holiday in Bali again I would certainly stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2300,Perfect location & wonderful staff,50,October 2015,"A brilliant place to stay in Seminyak. Close to everything! What really made this place though, aside from the beautiful rooms/grounds/pool area (which are all without fault!) was the staff. Super helpful and incredibly friendly, we absolutely loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to book again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2301,Sensational,50,October 2015,"Welcoming attentive staff, good food n great varieties, prime location, walking distance to local restaurant n shops. Sitting along at the beautiful seminyak beach with amazing infinity pool. Very comfy bed. Seriously can't ask for more!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2302,Honeymoon treat,50,October 2015,Stayed here as a part of our honeymoon. Perfect location and we didn't feel like leaving this beautiful place at any time! Breakfast definitely worth including (unless you wanna fit into your swimmers at the end of the holiday) as everything was an absolute treat! Can only recommend this place!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2303,Good Value of Beachfront Hotel,40,October 2015,"This hotel is a great option if you would like to stay beachfront in Seminyak but not pay the prices at some of the more popular hotels i.e. The W. It is slightly cheaper so you might be able to afford a oceanfront view. The hotel grounds are lovely and the infinity pool looking out to the ocean is a great place to enjoy Bali's weather. Additionally, there is a great view of the sunset if you don't want to venture to one of the packed sunset bars. The rooms were fairly updated and we especially enjoyed the complimentary coffee, tea, water bottles and comfy slippers.

The one qualm that I have is that upon arrival I was not treated as many other guests that I saw receive lei's and welcome drinks. At first I thought it was possibly just a honeymoon thing, but I saw multiple couples receive that treatment.

Great location, walking distance to everything happening in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2304,Great Hotel and Location,40,October 2015,Our room was located in the garden wing which was just across the street from the reception. It was cheaper to stay there however for a better experience stay at the ocean wing instead with the views of the ocean. Breakfast was good in a beautiful restaurant. The infinity pool was also nice facing the beach. Overall we enjoyed our stay.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2305,Fantastic hotel,50,October 2015,"Great hotel in a brilliant location in Seminak.
Staff are brilliant and extremely attentive.
Pool and spa are top class.
Only downside is the extremely over priced lifts the hotel arranges to the airport $53 vs $8 when you ring the taxi!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2306,Good Location but Refurbishment Needed,40,October 2015,"Stayed here a couple of nights before heading to another hotel to meet friends from Hong Kong.

Positives:
The room was huge. Even with an extra bed, there's plenty of room. And did I mention two TVs?
The room came with both a shower area and a jacuzzi.
The staff were uniformly courteous and tried hard to be helpful.
Fantastic location, right next to the beach for those pretty Bali sunset. And running barefoot on the beach is highly recommended.
Turning left at the beach will bring you to Ku De Ta which is 200-300 meters away.
Turning right, you will hit Potato Head in around 900 meters. The brand new Alina Seminyak is just before Potato Head and the W Resort just after.
Breakfast is par for the course for a resort of this class.
Free tea time with some snacks from 3:30 to 4:30.

And now the negatives:
The property definitely feels dated. A refurbishment is much needed. The electrical outlet resists any of our three prong plugs while the aircon vents tend to collect condensation.
The temperature control for our shower doesn't budge and hence we couldn't change the temperature, which was not a huge problem for us.
The sinks are jammed opened which means soaking anything is tough.
WIFI connection was ""iffy"" and limited to only a maximum of 4 devices per room.

Will we return? Nope, as there are other properties nearby that should fit our purpose when in the area. Did we regret coming? Also no, but for us, once is enough.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2307,Great location,30,September 2015,"The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is in a fantastic location, the rooms are clean and staff are fantastic. I also loved the free yoga & meditation classes held in a gazebo overlooking the ocean, alongside the ifinity pool - just magical. Our check in on the other hand was over 1 hour late and given the price of accomodation, we felt the experience of other resorts in Bali (e.g. Rimba / Ayana) was much more pleasant, perhaps they set the benchmark. This being said, you won't be disappointed staying here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2308,Best hotel in seminyak in all aspects!,50,October 2015,"We have come twice to this hotel.. And we like it more and more.. Stayed in the same room that gives us private balcony to watch the sunset.. The hotel offers best location, private beach access, excellent service and prime sunset viewing.. And all given without felling like you're giving away all your fortune :) hence very recommended. Area for improvement May be the kids area.. But again maybe the market segment for the hotel is for couples. Hehe",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2309,Love love love!,50,October 2015,"This was my first time visiting Bali and I had no idea where to stay. I checked reviews and settled on the Seminyak Beach Resort. They also had a really good deal on expedia when I booked the resort. This resort did not disappoint!! Loved that it wasn't a big resort, it had that comfortable feel of relaxation, beautiful scenery and especially, it did not feel too over-crowded like the big resorts. The infinity pool was gorgeous, over-looking the beach, with perfect water temperature. The staff was very attentive, always!! It is in within walking distance to everything. If you like going out at night, Ku De Ta is right next door (it's also the #1 nightlife spot in Seminyak), Potato head is a short taxi ride down the rode too. One thing that I really liked about the resort... It's peace and quiet :) We had a beach wing room, and listening too the waves crashing while you sleep was probably the best sleep I've ever had! Minimal kids around. If anything, this is how you want to experience Bali paradise!! Another big plus, is they replace your water in your room everyday. We only had to buy water once!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2310,Seminyak Beach Resort,50,October 2015,"What an amazing resort. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Hotel rooms were big, clean, and beautifully decorated. Also, hotel was close to dining, shopping, and just over looking the pool was the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2311,Great holiday in a well deserved 5* hotel,50,October 2015,"We have stayed in some amazing resorts/hotels and this hotel certainly didn't disappoint. We can't believe some of the negative reviews that people have written when they must have stayed at the hotel the same time we were there.
We stayed in the garden wing which we did not feel was a problem, we certainly did not need to use the buggy to cross the road ( it would have taken longer to climb into the buggy than it would to just walk across).The rooms were clean, luxurious, comfortable and quiet, what more could we need!
The breakfasts were lovely, really attentive staff and gorgeous food of which there was lots of choice.
The gardens were well maintained and the pool area was superb. We usually got to the pool between 9am and 11am and always managed to find ourselves sun loungers.
We loved everything about the hotel, from its perfect location to the great service from all of the staff. They went above and beyond to ensure their guests had an enjoyable stay.
Thank you so much for a fantastic holiday. We will definitely be back to stay with The Seminyak again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2312,Pretty Good!,40,October 2015,"We stayed in a ""Beachfront Villa"" for 5 nights in October. These villas overlook the hotel main pool to the ocean. The view is obstructed by vegetation so (unless you are standing which whilst on holiday is a rare occurrence) the hotels photos of the view are not ""totally"" accurate. I guess as a positive the vegetation provides privacy from the many hotel guests crammed in around the main pool.

Although we received a 50% discount on the villa which still meant we were spending near $1,000AUD per night I feel there is better value elsewhere in Seminyak like One Eleven Villas.

The hotel itself if in a great location and is one of its best attributes, is reasonably well maintained for its age and the staff although not overly well trained are friendly and will go out of their way to assist where they can. I do have concerns over security as when entering the hotel grounds from the beach the security simply ask ""you stay here""? Anyone can reply with a yes and get straight in.

The main pool is beautiful. Seems u need to get up pretty early to actually get a sun lounger as it seems there are more hotel rooms/guests than sun loungers. Every day I walked passed all the loungers were full or had a towel draped over them. If I wasn't in a Villa I would be pretty annoyed about that.

The Surf out the front of the hotel is great and there are lifeguards and board hire stalls out the front.

Breakfast was reasonable but closes at 10.30am. The buffet food (by 9.30am) seemed that it had been sitting around for quite a while. A couple of the curries were hit and miss, I really think there is room to improve. The set menu was great the scrambled eggs and the eggs Benedict are a real winners, but after 4 days I felt like there needed to be some more variety and perhaps fresher ingredients and improved coffee.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2313,the best part is only the beach,20,October 2015,"1 the room rate of the garden wing which we have to walk across the road to the back building is very high. i felt like I was being cheated. So if you book, make sure it is NOT the garden view at the back building. it's a 3 floors building without elevator. With all those flaws I'd expected to pay at least 30 % cheaper.
2. Too many staff in the lobby but very few by the swimming pool and they stationed themselves under the shade all the time.
3. the size of the pool deck is way too small compare to the numbers of guest. So, if you came down at 10;00 am. all seats were taken and likely they're all stay till afternoon/evening.

After explored the Seminyak hotels. I would plan another holiday there but definitely not going back to this one.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2314,Regret to choose this Expensive hotel,10,October 2015,"There are 2 parts of building (across the road) where you will need to take a buggy service from the main building.
The amount of noise in the room is very unbearable, door slamming, wall knocking, motor cycle noised from the main road. The whole room n resort, services were overprice. Breakfast is lacking, long wait for our coffee have to chase many times. There is a lizard type of creature (see picture) living in our room. We couldnt sleep at all . We paid a lot of money for 2 nights and This hotel have ruined our honey moon. There are many choices in the area which have much better service and facilities. Please check all reviews before choose this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2315,Great location,40,October 2015,Lovely resort although beach wing not particularly close to beach and we did experience some noise from road and surrounding area. 5 mins walk to shops and bars. Breakfast service very good. Loungers on the beach for hotel guests would have been welcome as a bit crowded round the pool. Room and bathroom excellent and service from staff always smiling and helpful.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2316,Short Winter break,40,August 2015,"We opted to stay at the Seminyak Beach resort as it had some good reviews but the rooms were grossly overpriced although the location is closed to Seminyak square (5 mins walk) and right next to Ku De Ta.

There are two options for rooms, try to avoid the garden wing as it's across the road.
The breakfast was supposed the be the highlight of the meals but really was quite ordinary.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2317,"Charming, restful resort in heart of Seminyak",50,October 2015,"This lovely resort hotel is ideally located on the beach at Seminyak, has extensive gardens and plenty of pool options. My room was first rate, with a large balcony, ocean views and large spa.
The staff are charming, competent and helpful.
It is well located for restaurants and shopping. Highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2318,Amazing Villa Room in great location,40,November 2014,"We stayed in Sept 14 - didn't get around to writing a review so here it is now.
We decided to upgrade to a VILLA room on arrival. Yes the cost was pretty $$$ but we only stayed for 4 nights and decided to splurge, We were very pleased with our room.
Breaky was average at best but the service from staff was great. The pool and beach lovely and a really good location in Seminyak. I have heard from others the hotel resort rooms are a little worse for wear but the villa room was amazing and we couldn't fault it al all. Would stay here again I suppose, but I like to try new places so maybe we wont. I would recommend it though its lovely :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2319,One of the best position in Seminyak,40,September 2015,"The position is one of the best in Seminyak-Bali.

The infinite pool is great for swimming and relaxing.
Recommended 100%.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2320,Memorable experience,50,October 2015,"Loved every minute of my stay at this magnificent resort. The property is absolutely beautiful with a private beach.

2321,"centrally located, great pool, bad experience",30,September 2015,"location of the hotel is great, with the best pool on seminyak beach.
On arrival we were upgraded from a normal room to a suite, which we appreciated, although the beds were twin beds.
The AC did not work well at all, the room was really warm, the insect repellent plug did not work, hence my wife was bitten heavily on the face. The manager in the morning was kind enough to call a doctor.
I would certainly not stay here again, we moved to the W the next day, and the stay was much different.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2322,Stunning sunset views....,50,October 2015,This hotel is situated on the beach in Seminyak. It has a beautiful stretch of beach to the front and is the most amazing place to watch the Sunsets. Stunning views across from the Infinity pool..... and a gorgeous place to sit and sip a cocktail whilst watching the sun go down.... Magical....,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2323,"Beautiful resort with good location, worst costumer management",10,October 2015,"I am very sorry but I have never experienced a more worse custumer management than in this resort. The location in Seminyak is pretty good, the rooms and the resort are beautiful.

2325,Awesome,40,September 2015,"We loved this resort. The service was great, the staffs were truly helpful and great hospitality too... the only issue we had was that the water supply in the room tends to smell at times. Thumbs up to everything else and we'd highly recommend it to anyone that wants to spend quality time in a high end resort with beautiful sunset views!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2326,"Pricey, but worth it.",50,September 2015,"My Lady and I stayed at this resort for only two days, but found the accommodation, Resturants and food, staff and the resort generally to be excellent.
The room was expensive, but was beautifully appointed and immaculately maintained with sweeping views of the ocean. The grounds were equally maintained in an immaculate condition and wonderful gardens and swimming pools integrated within it.
It is expensive, however we think, worth the extra cost and we will be back

2327,overprice for very average service,20,September 2015,"we were very disappointed with the room that was given to us. the bed and the pillows were smelled, the rate of the room is expensive we expected the service and room should have been immaculate. Disappointing!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2328,Amazing Hotel,50,September 2015,We absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms are spacious with all the modern fit outs. The service is excellent as is the breakfast in the morning. The hotel is perfectly situated in the busy town of Seminyak which has loads of restaurants and bars. For me the infinity pool which looks out over the ocean is the hilight. I could lie there all day!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2329,"great location, great service",40,September 2015,"we've been upgraded to pool villa, so it was a pleasant surprise for me and my husband. The service was excellent from the moment we arrived there. Overall wonderfull stay. We already made plans to go back there with the whole entire family next year üòä",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2330,Good location,20,September 2015,"Good location but the room need a lot of improvement like renovation , air con too hot and room a bit dark. Price this your hotel no cheap so need to improve the interior. My shower was broken. Location is good",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2331,Awesome Hotel,50,September 2015,"We stayed at this resort for 6 nights. Its very central in Seminyak, its a short walk to the shops and restaurants and its right on the beach. the location is great. the view is amazing. We got upgraded to a suite on the 3 floor and the room was amazing, huge and watching the sunset from it was beautiful. the breakfast had a huge selection and the restaurants at the resort were also good. everything was a good price.
I highly recommend staying here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2332,Worse stay in my life,10,September 2015,"For a start i wasnt going to write a review cause once i checked out from this hotel i thanked god for leaving then they sent me an email reminding me to rate them here so i gave them what they want !!

I came to this bad hotel after ritz carlton which they are in the same price range so
I excpect them to be same

First the hotel smell really bad cause they
Are using something that burn and gave you a really smell that keep me nauseated
.. Then the room compared to other hotel like ritz carlton and W hotel is nothing .. Old furniture .. Small rooms .. Smelly ned sheet
And the worst thing was the street noise from motorcycles that keeps awaking you up all night ... The only good thing in that hotel is thier manager "" shes the one who changed our rooms to one with LESS noise but not conpletely quite and she was so kind"" the hotel breakfast is not yummy at all
.. And thier pool is very small and the bed is very limited compared to the hotel guest ..
Really guys compared to thier price they are overrated and i think those who says WOW about this hotel they never been in something thats a REAL WOW
Please revise your decision about this hotel
Cause its really not worth it go to The W seminyak "" if you want the seminyak area "" same price range and much cleaner and higher standard i stayed in both

Real bad hotel
And thank you seminyak hotel for reminding me to write about you a very bad review

2333,Just book!,50,October 2014,"Pure bliss. Luxury. Amazing pool, lovely grounds, great service.
So close to so many shops, bars and restaurants.
The best holiday ever. Cannot really fault, other than perhaps learning to ignore local sellers on the beach! Not the greatest of beaches, but pretty - and we just viewed it whilst lying by gorgeous pool.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2334,"Delightful. Location, service, food, dayspa all A+++",50,September 2015,"We stayed for 5 nights as a group of 3 friends reuniting from America and Australia.
Wow. Just wow. To start with the welcome service is lovely and the room was stylish roomy and beautifully appointed with super comfy beds, crisp linen, gorgeous batik robes and luxe toiletries in the spacious twin vanity bathroom. Oh. And an enormous jacuzzi set adjacent the full length bathroom window.
The location. Right on a clean fairly quiet stretch of Seminyak Beach adjacent the Oberoi. Infinity pools in excellent sparkling clean condition.
The most amenable delightful enthusiastic French chef David chatted to us several times and oh boy is he on his game. The selection at the breakfast was beyond anything I have ever seen. All delicious. A choice of Indonesian and western cooked items. A la carte and this incredible buffet were on offer every morning. A gorgeous patisserie carte with pandan croissants and black pain au chocolat and too many delights to try in 5 days.
I must also thank Suparman who was our lovely smiley helper at the pool where we enjoyed club sandwiches, a lovely surprise bottle of prosecco from my friend and delicious mojitos daily.
It would be remiss of me not to mention also Desay and Dyan at the day spa. Thanks to my lovely American friend's generosity I was treated to the ""September Delight"": a 2 hour plus extravaganza of massage, body scrub, wrap, facial in a beautifully appointed annexe of tge hotel with the sounds of waves crashing lulling me to sleep.
Thank you so much also to Rory the gorgeous guest relations officer who secured a booking at our request for Merah Putih Restaurant which we all enjoyed very much. And to Oka our lovely driver.
Thank you for spoiling us all. Real life was very hard to countenance after such a superlative experience. Much love and we will be back,

2335,Post Australian Winter Holiday in the Sun.,50,September 2015,"My partner and I have spent a lovely 6 nights, 5 days at this wonderful hotel. The gardens, the pool, the beach, the staff, the location, the food and the rooms were of a very high standard. This hotel offers a lovely place to unwind and as a guest you a very well catered for. Break buffet is brilliant, pool side service and the menu has lots of good choices. Sunset drinks by the pool bar is a must do, and of course the infinity pool that looks onto the beach rounds this all off perfectly. A good mix of people across all demographics stay at the hotel which was good to see and tends to attract less young families, however given the beach that fronts the hotel, the hotel seems to cater for all. Some highlights for eats were Ku De Ta, Chandi, Sea Circus, Motel Mexicola (which was brilliant) and Hanks Pizza. Mixwell Bar and other bars, a taxi ride away from the resort was also a great night out and lots of fun. In short, this hotel is perfect, we will be coming back again for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2336,Sunsets on the Beach,50,September 2015,"Great spot in Seminyak to stay, walking distance to most of the great restaurants, Infinity pool on the beach was good except for a couple hawkers walking past daily.The staff were fantastic some of the best we have come across,Good breakfast to start the day and there is a great spot to have a bintang or cocktail to watch the sunset nightly",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2337,Nice but bit over priced,40,September 2015,"Lovely location and great pool area. Service at the pool a bit lazy.
The room had ocean view like promised but it was further away from the ocean that we expected. The jacuzzi took over an hour to fill, so it was a bit of a disappointment.
The quality of the breakfast was a pleasant surprise.
Over all nice hotel but expected a bit more luxurious for this price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2338,"Unbelievable experience, the best hotel I've ever visited!",50,September 2015,"We went here for our honeymoon. Literally from the moment we arrived, this place felt special. They ring a gong when you arrive and bring you a lemongrass juice when you're checking in. Everyone is so genuinely nice and smiley. It will automatically put a smile on your face. This isn't just a show for check-in. We stayed for 7 nights and they were consistently nice without being over-bearing.

The breakfast is out of this world and all of the ingredients for all meals are so fresh and relatively good value for a 5 star resort. The hotel is a very short walk from the main strip of shops, restaurants and bars in both directions. I also got to surf for the first time as you can rent surf boards on the beach in front of the hotel.

Overall, we just can't fault anything. A place we will never forget!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2339,"Location, a little luxury & lovely service.",50,September 2015,"Really couldn't fault this resort at all. The horizon pool overlooking the beach was amazing, the poolside service and swim up bar was perfect. The room was super comfy, the service from every single staff member we interacted with was superb. The breakfast buffet plus al a carte menu was so good we didn't even need lunch! The afternoon tea they offer was a great touch. We would happily recommend and return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2340,Good getaway,50,September 2015,Hospitable service. Rooms facing garden are very tranquil. Not much of a sea view but that's OK. The coast is featureless. Beds are very comfortable. Had great sleep. Dining options outside hotel may be better. Overall very enjoyable stay.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2341,Absolutely loved it,50,September 2015,Seminyak is a great place to visit and this hotel is 1st class from start to finish. Beautiful lobby area and a wonderfully warm welcome. Rooms are large and luxurious and staff are amazing. But the best thing about this hotel is the pool overlooking the ocean and a private beach. It has a brilliant atmosphere and the views are incredible. Cocktails brought to you by the pool....what more could you want! Loved it and can't wait to go back.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2342,Loved it!,50,September 2015,"This is about our 10th trip to Bali but first time at ""The Seminyak"". Wow what a truly fantastic resort. Definetly my new favourite, will be very hard to stay anywhere else! Position is perfect, easy walk to the best restaurants, shops and cafes. Staff were amazing friendly and always welcoming. Easily one of the best resort breakfast we have had. Loved the room, so spacious and comfortable. Gardens were beautiful. But the star of the show was the infinity pool overlooking the beach. Definetly one of the best pools in Bali. So relaxing. Thankyou to all at ""The Seminyak"" for a perfect holiday. Can't wait to come back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2343,"Nice for relax, and expensive",50,September 2015,"Everybody was very kind and helpful, the beachfront with infinity swimming pool is gorgeous.
Would rather use the pool service instead of breakfast (expensive).
The room & bathroom were quite big and nice, few rooms have good ocean views but we were given one as an upgrade.
We arrived early and had to wait 2h until the room was ready.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2344,First class.,50,September 2015,Just returned from five days at Seminyak Beach Resort. The room was large and well set out. All the staff were very attentive and said hello every time they passed you in the hotel. The pool area was clean and the pool staff looked after your every needs. The hotel was a short walk to the bars and restaurants. Taxi's are very cheap and plentiful if you need one. Hotel is quiet but plenty going on outside. You can swim in the sea when the flags are flying but waves are large.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2345,Beautiful stay on Seminyak Beach!,40,August 2015,"I stayed at Seminyak Beach Resort for 3 nights and loved this beautiful property right on Seminyak beach (also stayed at Nyhu Villas, Komaneka Rasa Sayang, Mulia Resort). The hotel is centrally located and walking distance to the best restaurants (Chandi was my favourite dinner spot), markets, and shopping. The resort has an elegant Balinese flare throughout the property and a gorgeous infinity pool with lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas for shade. The tropical gardens and landscaping are stunning with many cabanas to rest & relax at no additional fee.

The 'Beach Wing' king suite had a lovely Balinese feel and was extremely spacious featuring an extra large bathroom, walk in shower, giant view tub, double sinks, walk in closet, mini bar with complimentary tea/coffee/water, two flat screen TV's, and sitting area with fresh fruit bowl. We loved the authentic Balinese house robes to lounge around the room! My only complaint is the jacuzzi tub would have taken a couple hours to fill as it was SO big and the water couldn't stay warm at the slow rate it took to fill. I attempted to use the tub, but gave up once I realized how long it was going to take to be submerged in water! I also noticed the glass in the walk in shower area had visible soap stains, especially when the sun was shining through the window. They may have been permanent stains or perhaps didn't have the proper cleaning agents as everything else was spotless. Some very minor details would be the room floors had seen some wear & tear, but this wouldn't stop me from staying here again. Wifi was also included all over the resort and pool area!

I would not suggest staying in the detached part of the hotel across the street, unless you don't mind crossing the street and walking further to the main hotel amenities such as the pool & beach access. Personally, I would have felt frustrated staying in the detached building as you wouldn't feel like you're even staying at the resort.

We did not include the breakfast and found some wonderful breaky spots close by such a Sea Circus, Grocer & Grind and Sisterfields. Seminyak has some amazing foodie spots, if you take the time to read the reviews!

We also enjoyed our dining experience at the hotel restaurant over looking the ocean. Having this romantic terrace to watch the amazing Seminyak sunsets will make your stay incredibly memorable. Lots of dinner choices, reasonable prices and wonderful service. We had the pleasure of having Amy serve us a couple times, and her beautiful smile and top notch service was fabulous. I will note the alcohol prices were on the high side ($12-$15 for pool side cocktails and wine by the glass) but this seemed to be the norm at other Bali bars (Ku De Ta, Potato Head), restaurants, and hotels. Bin Tang beers are still your best bet!

Overall, I would highly recommend staying at Seminyak Beach Resort with the unbelievable infinity pool, gorgeous landscape, breathtaking sunsets, and direct beach access you won't be disappointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2346,restful stay,50,September 2015,"only stayed one night, wish we could have stayed a week! peaceful setting in a great location, everything about the grounds and room was absolutely beautiful. the food was great and the service was impeccable",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2347,Beautiful place with excellent service.,50,September 2015,"I recently returned from a trip to Bali and spent 3 nights in this resort. I travelled with a sore back that progressively got worse (despite doctors advise that it will get better) and the staff at the resort were just exceptionally great. Accommodating and wonderful. The resort is amazing - close, within walking distance to the main strip in Seminyak and lots of great restaurants. I will definitely plan to go back there soon. Highly recommend it !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2348,Excellent and reactive service,50,September 2015,"Excellent hotel. We were upgraded at their own initiative due to room availabilities. Staff is very reactive, competent and friendly. The quality of the breakfast and food in general is exquisite. Only once the salad we took at the pool may have contained some dressing but that was just a detail and is certainly not the type of food they should be rates on.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2349,"Excellent hotel, nice location and great staff",50,September 2015,We have enjoyed staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and would recommend without hesitation.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here again, if the budget allows.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2353,Amazing Honeymoon Spot!,50,September 2015,"We had 8nights in the Villa with the ocean view as part of our honeymoon - It was absolutely stunning! The villa itself was well equiped with a kitchen area (including fridge/minibar), a dining area, lounge area & private pool. The bedroom & bathroom were stunning with Balinese woodwork giving it an authentic yet modern feel. Our room was right beside the beach & we could hear the waves crashing beside us. The sunsets are amazing from this side of the island! We ate & drank daily by the communal infinity pool which was priced very reasonably. There are a number of great shops/bars/restaurants only a short walk from the hotel entrance too. KuDeTa & Potato Head were definitely worth a visit! We would definitely visit again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2354,ANOTHER PERFECT STAY,50,September 2015,"This is our second time at ""The Seminyak"", this trip for my husbands 50th birthday. We had 10 friends join us and they were very very impressed with the property. Some had been to Bali before others not. They all said how beautiful the property and location is. The staff are truly wonderful. So helpful, polite and clearly happy in their jobs. The grounds and facilities are always immaculate with somebody always ensuring it looks 5 star everyday. Thank you again to you all for making this trip another one for us to reminder so fondly. Thank you all for your beautiful smiles everyday. Always something I miss about Bali - the smiling, happy faces",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2355,Seminyak resort.....Never disappoints...just amazing,50,September 2015,"I visited the Seminyak again beginning on September for 7 days and was last there in May. The hotel and its staff just never dissapoint you in anyway. We stayed in a beach wing room this trip and after staying in a suite last time and we were concerned that it may not be large enough for us. However, the room was very spacious and so was the bathroom. it was my daughters birthday and we had a lovely birthday cake delivered to the room....what an amazing personal touch by the hotel. We have now been to the Seminyak hotel three times in this past year I can only recommend the Seminyak highly. Trust me the amazing staff, great breakfast, poolside food, location and the infinity pool are just a few of the reasons why anyone reading this review should make this the only hotel they stay in.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2356,Great property,50,September 2015,"The property is well appointed and w/in walking distance to shopping and dining. The staff were most gracious. The breakfast menu was quite extensive. There was something for everyone

2363,Seminyak Beach Resort,50,September 2015,"The location of this hotel is amazing, right beside the beach with unbelievable views of the sunset! Staff are very helpful and courteous. Rori from guest services and Chef David in particular were excellent. The room was exceptional and serviced twice daily. Restaurant is delicious and poolside service is also excellent. The infinity pool is second to none and has plenty of sunbeds available for all guests.
Great location and very close to some good local restaurants and shopping. Security services around the hotel also make you feel very safe at all times.
Our only mistake was to leave the hotel for a day!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2364,One of our favourite places,50,November 2014,"Our Room had a beachfront view, the bed was comfortable , the bathroom had all amenities apart from a good hot water service when we were there. We really enjoyed the breakfast due to the ocean view and the extensive range of choices.
We went to the Yoga classes whenever they were held and they were excellent, not to mention they took place in a pavilion overlooking the ocean.
We always got a shaded bed to sit under to read by the pool which is located at the each edge. We loved the pool it was large enough to swim in and cool as well.
I am comfortable to recommend this hotel. We loved our time there and it was our second visit back there.
Easy to relax and unwind. The staff are always helpful and friendly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2365,Not very nice breakfast,20,September 2015,"You would expect to have a great food selection at breakfast at 5 star resort, unfortunately there was not much selection at all. Fruits, milk products were standing outside for few hours and were too warm to eat.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Book a couple of nights as a treat and feel like a rockstar...stunning! If you are looking for a 5 star relaxed hotel in Seminyak, steeped in tradition, I highly recommend the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2368,Absolutely amazing,50,August 2015,Such a beautiful resort the staff are so lovely and accommodating. Won't ever stay any where else. Location is perfect too.

2369,"A must stay in Seminyak, 5 stars all round!",50,September 2015,"From Day 1- I absolutely love this place! 5 star for impeccable service from staff, huge suite (bigger than my apartment) with endless ocean views, top notch clean & the restaurants are at most high standard my favourites- the infinity & bar pools with ku de ta next door and the beach on your door step how can you not go wrong.
Personal opinion I have travelled around Asia & South Pacific , thus far Seminyak Beach resort & spa is my favourite huge call, but true- Worth every penny! Bonus reason- catering for my anaphylaxis food allergy meeting restaurant manger & chefs. I was truly looked after! Walking distance to the Main Street if you want to shop , depends on what you like again, my hubby and I loved it! ( young married couple in ours early 30's)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2370,Felt like heaven,50,September 2015,"Bali was like a heaven on earth. Landscapes were so beautiful and our stay at the Semiyak made it more and more beautiful.
Service at Seminyak resort and spa was great, everyone was welcoming and kind hearted. The hotel concierge arranged most of our trips with an open heart. The food was beyond description and the breakfast is NOT TO BE MISSED.
The hotel villa was spacious and had a swimming pool. The resort was the BEST resort I wen to.
The manager of the hotel was so kind to ask us about our satisfaction !
If I were to visit Bali again (for a 3rd time) I would definitely choose Seminyak resort and spa for the 3rd time

Thank you from the bottom of my heart",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2371,First time in Bali!,50,September 2015,"It was our first vacation to Bali and I must say the hotel is clean, friendly, great location and good pricing for the hotel! The beach is connected to the breakfast buffet restaurant followed by steps away from the beach. You can see the view of the beach from the restaurant.
The hotel is located near other restaurants and shops within a less than a mile.

When we first arrived, we were greeted and was given complementary drinks and wet towels. It was perfect considering the airplane food and beverage supply was pretty bad especially since we were so thirsty. We were brought up to our room and I must say the room is clean and comes with bottled water. Very spacious, over looking the property with our balcony view.

Breakfast buffet was good too! They have a spa, gym, and other restaurants in the property where you feel like you don't have to leave the hotel! I just got a 60 min Balinese massage along with an aloe treatment for 30 mins (I was burnt from laying out) all for $43 USD. I must admit it's much cheaper than the US to get all of that done!

I recommend going here for those that are on a budget or not!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2372,Magnifique!,50,August 2015,"Nice hotel, great infinity pool at the beach with enough beach chairs for all, very gentle staff ready to help whenever asked and beautiful breakfast buffets managed by David Cailleba, the French chef, and his team. Can you ask for more? The hotel is located in walking distance of the Seminyak square and all its shops and exquisite restaurants as well as the Ku De Ta if you are looking for a hip beach place for a bite at noon.
We stayed in an ocean view suite where we had plenty of space despite of the additional bed for our daughter. Seminyak is in our opinion one of the best spots in Bali and this hotel in the cherry on the cake. Speaking of cake, you will get an exquisite chocolate cake if you happen to have your birthday during your stay :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2373,"Great location, beach side infinity pool",50,September 2015,"Great hotel, great views, lovely rooms. The beach front location of the infinity pool is ideal for waves and people watching. The separate pool with day beds are in a quieter spot, great to get out of the day's heat. The pool bar and breakfast are excellent. And it is right next door to Ku de Ta (top restaurant and beach club) and a short walk from another favourite local beach bar called Potato Head.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2374,5 STAR BUT......,40,February 2015,"Excellent staff and rooms, very up to date, excellent pool & bar staff.
If you pay by cash be sure you receive a receipt for every purchase made from room service staff as I lost a hundred dollars (NZ) I already paid which then I had to pay for again when leaving.

Other than that it was really good:)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2375,Honeymoon bliss in the most beautiful surroundings!,50,August 2015,"My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and from the minute we arrived until the last day, everything here was pretty much faultless.

We stayed in one of the garden suites and we were blown away when we first walked in. The private pool and garden area is gorgeous and the huge bathroom with massive bath tub was a real treat. The beds are also super comfortable and we splept well every evening as its so peaceful and quiet.

The main pool area is right on the sea front so a very tranquil and relaxed setting to sunbathe and swim in. The sun beds are also very comfortable which is a bonus.

The staff here are all great and very attentive, they helped us book various excursions and dinner reservations with ease. They are very organised here and you feel like you are in good hands. One watch out here though is they recommended we go on the Bali Hai cruse which was shockingly bad so don't go on this if you want a boat trip. Look for a private company for sure!

The breakfast each morning is great and they have a wide selection of traditional and also local dishes. As well as the buffet which offers a range of fresh fruit, juices and pastries etc, they also provide you with a menu to order eggs, waffles and pancakes etc. you won't leave here hungry that's for sure. The other food in the hotel is good but the lunchtime menu could have more variety and it's very expensive compared to restaurants outside the hotel. We didn't dine here in the evening as the restaurant was always empty and there is a wide variety of great restaurants on your doorstep which we took advantage of.

Location is great here. Only a ten minute walk to seminyak square where there are lots of shops and boutiques as well as bars and restaurants. The road that the hotel is on also leads to other cool and fun restaurants making it very easy to get around when you stay here.

Overall we had the best time here and would definitely recommend this hotel. Only negative is the price of food and alcohol but I suppose you expect that from a luxury 5 star hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2376,Beautiful Beach Resort!,50,June 2015,"Seminyak is the best and classiest place to be in Bali. This hotel is right in the centre of it, just a short walk to Seminyak Square where you will find heaps of wonderful restaurants to choose from.

The hotel is a beach front property, with a wonderful infinity pool. Rooms are large and well appointed. Staff are polite, attending to your every need without being intrusive.

Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2377,Stunning Resort.....relax into paradise!,50,August 2015,"With the warmest welcome you'll ever receive, you have entered that place in paradise to start your holiday. All staff are very friendly and will accommodate your needs with a big smile. We had a Beach Wing Room - which I highly recommend, great view and you can hear the ocean in your bedroom when you open the doors. just steps away from the beach, as youre literally on it. Room was very big, clean and had the amenities you need. Breakfast is lovely [the pancakes are to die for]. Some of the best restaurants and bars are literally walking distance, max walking distance is 10/15mins. KUDETA is next door - make sure to go, its great in the evening. Bambu Restaurant and La Lucciola - they were perfect! I would definitely come back and stay here and I have already recommended this to two of my friends already. I miss this place already! x",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2378,Good,30,August 2015,"We spent three nights here in August. It is nice and has all that one would expect in a large resort. When we stayed it was 99% full and It was impossible to get a lounge by the pool unless you staked a claim at sun rise, which was a bit annoying. On the positive side we had a midday check out and a late flight and they allowed us to shower and freshen up in the spa prior to leaving which was much appreciated.

We did have ongoing wifi problems for t that they tried to resolve but sadly couldn't.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2379,August stay 2015,50,August 2015,Quality low key hotel in a perfect location on the beach and adjacent to all the good shops and eateries..the very friendly and sincere staff make this hotel a real pleasure to stay in..nothing is any trouble to them and they are friendly all the time..the rooms are spacious and well planned..would definately stay again 10/10,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2380,High living in central Seminyak!,50,December 2014,"This hotel is so beautiful.
My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week over New Years Eve.
The hotel is located fairly close to the main street in Seminyak where all the delicious and high end cafe/restaurants are situated.
The staff were so accommodating and I simply do not have one bad thing to say about this resort!
The only downfall I can think of would be that the hotel is split into two wings.
We stayed in the garden wing (which was gorgeous and super quiet); however, to access the beach wing you had to walk across the road and down the road a few meters.
It was a little bit annoying because the beach wing was the main part of the hotel, where breakfast was served and where the main pool overlooking the beach was located.
The staff were always happy to take you from the garden wing to the beach wing on a golf cart but it was still a slight inconvenience.
We chose the garden wing though because we were told by a friend that the beach wing was a little bit noisy at night time due to the ocean waves.
But all in all was a magnificent stay! :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2381,Amazing Location,50,August 2015,"We stayed two nights and although the price is a little expensive you definitely get what you pay for. Incredible location literally on the beach, great ocean view and the morning breakfasts were the best of any Bali hotel I've been too. The best part is being able to step right onto the beach at sunset or stay in the hotel's infinity pool at the top of the sand. Amazing moments to be had. Will definitely stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2382,Second Stay - Better than Before,50,August 2015,"My husband and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa Christmas season two years ago. After our initial mix up of our room which was not on the compound, but was corrected, we had a very nice stay. Christmas was rainy season so we were a bit disappointed.
This year we decided to go back and noted that the hotel clearly explained the location of the rooms...we were probably not the only clients that had made that initial mistake.
I found the hotel better than before. The service was impeccable, the rooms were clean, the staff very friendly and accommodating. I noted the Manager was walking around, and was very present mindful of his staff. My only comment is that the ""free"" afternoon tea which is very lovely should be located in a better location.
We definitely plan to return to Bali next year and stay at Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2383,Luxury in a central location,50,April 2015,"Stayed for 5 days. Large, comfortable rooms but the biggest selling point is the pool area. There is an infinity pool stretching along the length of the hotel, looking out over the beach and sea. You can easily get onto the beach for a stroll or to surf or play in the waves (a word of warning: the waves can be VERY strong so take care when in the sea). Plenty of sunbeds were always available and staff are on hand to take orders for drinks and pool food. The hotel is very centrally located in Seminyak but still tranquil enough for a relaxing stay. It's definitely one of the smartest hotels in the area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2384,Paradise Hotel,50,August 2015,"My wife and I stayed in a pool villa for 4 days. The room was incredible! The bed was at least a king, there were 3 tvs, an outdoor AND indoor shower, in room jacuzzi, and plenty of space to sit, eat, sleep/sun, etc. around the private pool. Access to the beach is right on the property, and across the street are multiple delicious spots to pop into and eat. The Semaya itself was so amazing that we really only left to go out to dinner. In room dining was stellar. In addition, between 3PM-5PM, tea/coffee and snacks are provided. This is perfect for tiding you over until dinner, perhaps after a late breakfast and maybe skipping lunch. Staff is friendly, professional, and quickly takes care of any request you make. We also had a couples massage at the spa on the property. We had the option of enjoying the massage with the air conditioning, or opening the windows and taking in the sights and sounds of the ocean. We opted for the ocean, definitely the way to go! After traveling in Southeast Asia for 3 weeks, this was by far the best of our accommodations.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2385,Wonderfull place,50,August 2015,"This hotel is great great great!!! For every type of vacations you want to do. The best beach in front even for surf!!! Side by side with ""Ku de ta"" bar.. An amazing beach bar/restaurant. The breakfast is top quality. Rooms are beautifull and calm. And the people very friendly.

Top quality hotel!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2386,Bliss at the beach,50,August 2015,"An excellent hotel for a Bali beach vacation. Room was luxurious. Pool and beach were ideal. Breakfast has many Asian and Western choices. The service was impeccable. And the options for day trips within Bali were well thought out and executed.

If I could make one recommendation, it would be to strengthen the dinner menu. Bar and beach food, as well as in-room choices, were very good, but the dinner menu at the main restaurant doesn't compete well with the many excellent restaurant alternatives in Bali. This wasn't a problem, as almost all guests prefer the many nearby options in Bali. But it would be nice to have another option.

Again, an excellent hotel which I would recommend without reservation.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2387,Excellent holiday,50,August 2015,"Had a fantastic holiday and the staff are amazing and friendly. We came away co,platelet relaxed and had the best of both worlds. Had the relaxation of the hotel but could go out and enjoy Seminyak. Highly recommend",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2388,Cannot wish for more!!,50,August 2015,"We came to Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort for only 2 nights to celebrate my parents ' dual birthday. This hotel was perfect - it was like something you only see in movies. Our rooms were amazing, spacious, with jacuzzi with built-in TV (something that my parents could not stop talking about), and the window facing the beach so perfectly, you can watch breathtaking sunsets while enjoying your jacuzzi (that blew me away). The Hotel also offers wide range of packages called - Memorable Moments. For my parents birthday I chose candlelight dinner in a gazebo on the beach during the sunset. The setup alone caught my parents by surprise and brought tears of happiness. However the dinner that followed was equally impressive- our compliments to the chef. The staff that was serving us dinner was impeccable. It was truly a MEMORABLE MOMENT for us all. I could probably go on and on, how great this hotel is, but I don't want to spoil the surprise for these planning to visit. I'll just say - it worth every penny. It's beautiful and amenities are superb.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2389,Only place to stay in Seminyak!!!,50,August 2015,"This has now been our 10th stay at the Seminyak beach and spa resort! We keep coming back & we can't fault it.. We most look forward to spending days by the pool which has its own entrance to the beach, the breakfast is incredible so many fresh and delicious options! The rooms are spacious and well presented - very comfortable bed! the resort is walking distance to all the hot spots in Seminyak, thank you to all of the kind staff that always make our stay a good one! Highly recommend this resort!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2390,Beautiful Delight!,50,July 2015,"I stayed here for 5 nights. I wanted a place on the beach with a great view of the sunsets. I loved everything about this hotel! The hotel had every detailed covered, from providing complimentary water bottles near the bed to delicious food to exceptionally polite staff to turndown service. I stayed here by myself, and as a solo woman traveler, I felt completely safe the entire time...I think that's a very important quality. The spa was spectacular, it was so beautifully decorated. The massage was incredible. The infinity pool was delightful, especially with its beautiful views of the beach. If and when I return to Bali, I would gladly stay here again, and highly recommend it!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2391,everything was perfect!,50,August 2015,"my entire stay at the seminyak was delightful. from the room to the pool, location, and staff. everything was done to the T. upon arrival i was greeted by the concierge Rori. His authenticity, consideration, and kindness was an excellent reflection of the hotel and people. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you Rori!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2392,Seminyak stay,40,August 2015,"Pretty good, location was great. Probably a little over priced for what you get compared to a villa of the same price but over all nice Service and well kept rooms. If you want somewhere right on the beach this is great. Probably more suited to people over the age of 35. My partner and i are 30 and would probably stay somewhere a little more happening next time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2393,Amazing stay,50,August 2015,"Our standard room wasn't in the main building, but we can access to all the facilities of this wonderful hotel.
Poolside and the garden are sooooo good and nice.
The resort is well located and all the staff is so helpfull and kind.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2394,Bali Charm,50,August 2015,"We have just returned from 4 blissful nights in a garden villa which truly surpassed our expectations. The quality of the room was superb, with deep spa bath and spacious rooms. The plunge pool surrounding the room was our own little oasis away from a super busy beachside pool. Breakfast served u great variety and our meals were restaurant quality. We loved our stay and would totally return. My only criticism would have to be slightly too much attention from the staff... What a nice problem to have!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2395,Great!,50,August 2015,"Breakfast and resort facilities where great. We had a lovely card and flowers arrangement for our anniversary on arrival, lovely surprise. Special thanks to all the staff especially Rori! Amazing location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2397,Ocean Villa,40,August 2015,"We stayed in an Ocean View Villa for only one night as a special treat and it was magnificent ! We achived a great rate by walking into the hotel and ""pushing"" for the rate,(something that many people wouldnt do !) The location and beautiul Bali style of the building along with our generous sized private pool was luxury indead. Yes, not the cheapest room in the hotel, but the ""BEST"". Take your own French champagne, order room service and be engrossed by this beautiful place. 10 out 10.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2398,Classy & well located!,50,July 2015,"The hotel is beautiful, classy in appearance with an infinity pool looking out over a great surfing beach with lovely sunsets. We had a twin room in the annex across the street in a separate yet by no means inferior building. The beds were very comfortable and we had ""black out' curtains which made for an excellent nights sleep! The breakfast was superb because as well as all the usual help yourself buffet options there was an a la carte option too! The poached eggs with salmon and spinach and the banana pancakes were two of my personal favourites. Staff were friendly, attentive and informative. Pool side salads at lunch time were a little on the small side lacking in leaves yet when we mentioned this staff were happy to add additional leaves for no extra cost. Bar staff make a great gin & tonic or pina colada! The pool here is the place to be for a Seminyak sunset! Occasionally it took a while to be noticed by the staff around the pool that we wanted to get served with food & drinks, this seemed to me to be an under staffing problem rather than a lack of attentiveness by the staff, I would stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2399,Honeymoon - Friendley staff top notch hotel,40,August 2015,"We visited at beginning of August for our honeymoon. The drive is around 40 minutes from Bali airport (after a 28 hour door to door trip from Essex in England with a 5 hour stop at Hong Kong) we flew Cathway Pacific airlines standard economy which had OK leg room, each seat a screen with a choice of around 30 movies in english and a further 30 tv shows on demand as well as games like holdem polker so there was alot to do to pass the time including free earphones to use which is nice as im used to these being an added extra cost. We got five meals and around 10 free drinks on the trip. On arrival at the Seminyak hotel we were greeted warmly at the taxi with garlands of orchid flowers round our neck and a welcome drink. We checked in and a holding fee of $400 was taken to cover extras at the end of our trip. We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and was 'upgraded' from a 2nd floor room to a 3rd floor room which on entering the room i was extremely pleased about as we booked an ocean view but down on the 2nd floor you cant see the ocean because of trees and other buildings so that would of been dissapointing. We were shown around the room while our bags were taken up for us. We had advised them it was our honeymoon when booking and found flowers in the room along with a basket of exotic fruits and a welcome letter from the head of staff at the hotel. There was a safe in our room, hair dryer and 32"" tv. I was really impressed with our jacuzzi bath. If you have one in your room id suggest running the jets for a couple of minutes as the water goes stagnant whickly hear due to low water treatment so you need to get rid of the old water and smell of eggs befpre you fill up the bath! It takes atound 80 minutes to fill so start run it way in advance of being ready to get in lol. No ironing board or iron are in the room but the hotel provides on request but do offer a washing and pressing service for a fee. The bed is queen sized and huge, pretty comfy and the balcony is well sized. The tv gets 2 english movie channels so that was good to have and we watched a few good movies on the evenings we were back eary enough from dinner.

The hotel is immaculatley cleaned and i must say that every single member of staff from the maids to the reception staff to the maintenance men and security guards are all warmly welcoming of you. Hands together in a customary indonesoan welcome and a slight bow and a ""good morning"" ""good evening"" from each individual you pass and a ""welcome back"" from when you return after leaving the hotel. They make you feel important and valued.

We decided to go B&B rather than all inclusive as the 'strip' is full of bars and resteraunts and is only a 5 minute walk away and i like veriety rather than the same resteraunt every night, plus the cost is less if you eat out (the two of us having 3 course meal with soft drinks and a bottle of wine is approx 800,000 rupiah which is around ¬£40. Extremely reasonable as in england that would be double at least. It is worth noting that 10% government or VAT tax is added on to your end bill and many places add a 5-6% service charge at the end too so expect to pay 16% extra o your bill.

As this is a tourist hotspot there are plenty of good quality resteraunts catering for both eastern and western meal choices, i was worried all id find was rice, noodles and fish but that was totally unfounfed and realised that bali brings in tourists from mainly Australia as well as the orient and europe.

The swimming pool is a good size infinity pool directly facing the sea so very nice views. The sea always has waves even on a calm day so attracts surfers. The temperature stays consistebtey the same day and night and i found the tperature was between 27 and 30 degrees every day and night during our 2 week stay.

In this part of the world you do get many partly cloudy days where the sun is in and out and sometimes rains but thats rare and is normaly a short sharp downpour like ive found in Florida which dries off very quickly.

The hotel poolside menu offers snacks from 11.30am to 6pm eith a choice of salads, pizza, burgers, sandwhiches, cocktails and other drinks. An example of cost os 145,000 rupiah for a club samdwhich and fries (the hotel then adds on 10% Tax and 11% service charge to this) so expect to pay around ¬£10 for that and a coke is 35,000 before tax and service charge, so around ¬£2.30 for a coke, which to me is procey but is to be expected at most hotels.

Once a week the hotel also pits on a traditional evening with music and dancers as well as a traditional buffet for 300,000 rupiah each not inc tax and service and cost of drinks.

While we were here we took a personal tour guided trip to the butterfly park, feed wild monkies, visit the hindu lake temple, waterfall, coffe plantation as well as visiting an elephant safari where you can feed and ride rescused elephants from sumatra. All were really great to see and cost in total around ¬£110 per person.

Me and my wife (still strange to say Wife even after 2 months of marriage lol) loved the island, the people and the hotel and had a wonderful Honeymoon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2400,Family holiday,30,July 2015,"Enjoyed Villa Lalu . Spacious villas beautifully designed. Good location. Has seen better days no doubt. Staff are great...friendly and helpful. Mosquitoes easily taken care of by using repellents.

Netherlands",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2401,Not worth the money if staying in the building across the road.,30,August 2015,"The grounds were beautiful but staying across the road made you feel so separate, it's not worth the money. We stayed in room 5211. The room was nicely furnished and the bed was very very comfortable! But the room was dark even during the day with no view.

Not great for families as it's very quiet, so would be great for couples wanting a quiet relaxing holiday. The view from the pool to the ocean is picturesque but again more of a reading, sleeping, relaxing by the pool vibe which is great if that's what you're after. The pool is fabulous and the grounds gorgeous.

We paid $720AUD for two nights, which for us not worth the money when you're NOT staying on the main grounds. Especially when buffet breakfast was not included. We stayed at the Sofitel Nusa Dua prior to this (which was absolutely perfect), so it was a bit of let down when we arrived, as there was no atmosphere whatsoever in the building across the road.

So all in all, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you wanted to pay an extra $500USD/night for a villa or $50USD a night for the same room layout on the main grounds (we tried to move to the main grounds but they were fully booked out).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2402,High quality resort by the beach,50,August 2015,"Spent one night here before heading back home after two weeks in Bali, spent inland and at the north coast. Friendly and helpful staff, service similar to a top notch business hotel. Great location at the beach with easy access to KuDeTa,Lucciola etc. Fantastic drinks in the pool bar with view of the sunset. We managed to ge a flavor of this part of Bail - Seminyak in just a few hours.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2403,Great way to end the trip!,50,August 2015,"Having been stuck in Bali for the past 5 days due to the volcanic ash cloud, I was left stuck but with no choice to stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and was extremely happy I had done so! This easily has one of the best infinity ocean front pools in Bali. Located within close proximity to all great shops and restaurants, the location itself is excellent! Rooms were clean and spacious, great air con, bathroom and shower. I had an ocean front facing room on level 2 which had a beautiful view. Buffet Breakfast and food by the pool overall was nice. Hats off to the staff who always have a smile on their faces. 8/10",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2404,Overpriced but nice,40,July 2015,"The hotel is very nice, the garden is exquisite and beautiful. The location is also very good. One of the best restaurants in Seminyak is right next to the hotel
(Ku De Ta)

The personnel is very service minded and nice. The breakfast is very good - huge selection of food and excellent quality.

However the hotel appears old and outdated - especially the rooms and pool area. Some areas also seem slightly worn.

Some of the days the sun beds get occupied very early. Beds are reserved by other guests right after breakfast.
Sometimes it can be difficult to order food/drinks by the pool as the waiters are away a lot.

The WiFi is not working properly. The connection cuts all the time, and you always have to forget the network and log in after you have moved around the hotel area. We complained about the bad internet service twice, but nothing happened. WiFi at restaurants and bars nearby works perfectly.

Overall its a nice, but overpriced hotel. The daily charge is just too high for what you get.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2405,Best resort in Seminyak,50,August 2015,I had enough rest in this resort with good food and seaside location. I coud hear sea sound during the night and it's really romantic. The breakfast was very good. Near to the sea and downtown of seminyak.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Our daughters were sick and the staf was very helpful with doctor arangements, special food and other facilities to make us feel better. Excellent and helpful staf.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2407,Pricey but worth it,50,May 2015,"Booked the hotel after much research and wasn't disappointed. We got in late so felt a little rushed at check in but where happy to start our holiday. The rooms are great and we had a garden view with a little beach glimpse. We booked through Expedia (Won't do this again) as i feel every time we do they put you in the cheap room as the air-con made a rattling noise and had to move after two night of not really sleeping, to the hotel staff credit they where great after the third time I complained and moved me to a upgraded room.
Amazing pool and good pool staff, but like all Bali hotels the drinks feel watered down. They have a great breakfast which was included and the room/pool side service was ok.
Close to Ku De ta and Potato Head and the main strip in Seminyak this is a good hotel and i would stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2408,Very nice hotel,40,July 2015,"Great hotel, great staff. We had a honeymoon suit on the 3rd floor, great views of the sunset from our jacuzzi bath. Lots of lovely little amenities in the room too.
The infinity pool is a great area, but there aren't enough beds by far and too much bed reservation going on with no guidance as to how long is too long for the beds to be abandoned (some hotels operate a 30 mins and you've lost it policy, this place doesn't). Food was utterly excellent at breakfast, and we sampled a lot of the order menu as well as the buffet. Could have easily eaten it for breakfast lunch and dinner it was so good!
We very much enjoyed the Balinese meal and dance show that was put on by the hotel - a highlight for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2409,Very nice depending on room location,40,August 2015,"Stayed here for 3 nights after earlier stops in Sanur and Ubud and enjoyed it in the main. Our rooms were very clean, contemporary and well designed, with a glass partition between the bedroom and bathroom something I'd not experienced before. However, there was a blind if you wanted some privacy whilst using the big deep bath.

My main issue with our stay here was the location of our room in the Garden Wing. It's strange having the complex split into two either side of a busy road, but I knew that before I came. However, our room was right at the front of the garden wing facing the busy road, which meant we were very exposed to traffic noise. Anyone who's been to Bali knows how much drivers use their horns here, which combined with engine noises resulted in significant noise pollution. Therefore if you're a light sleeper this is a no go. I was always awake before 7am as a result, which was very frustrating. For the same reason the pool area for the garden wing is pretty pointless, as it's almost impossible to relax due to the constant noise. I didn't recall seeing anyone use that pool, I assume for this reason. Who can relax and enjoy being at a pool at the side of a busy road? The road was so busy that the hotel even have dedicated staff to help Garden Wing guests cross over to the beach side and back the other way. I would assume guests staying at the very back of the main beach wing would also be in a similar predicament, as they were also close to the main road. Compared to the hotels we stayed at in Sanur and Ubud, it was complete chalk and cheese, and I would be reluctant to stay here again for this reason, which is a shame as almost everything else about this hotel was very good.

Focusing on the positives the Seminyak Beach Resort does provide very good beach side panoramic views from its impressive infinity pool. My family spent most of our time here on the sun loungers watching the powerful waves and surf. The quality and cleanliness of seminyak beach was far superior to Sanur, but if you wanted to swim in the sea then Sanur is far safer. The beach area directly in front of the pool was relatively quiet, but it was continually patrolled by local hawkers trying to flog kites, watches, hats and sarongs. Whilst they were not aggressive they did become irritating if you were by the pool all day. However, even the hawkers couldn't possibly spoil the fabulous sunsets every evening.

We stayed here on a B&B basis and the quality of breakfast provided was very high. There was a good cooked to order menu for eggs, French toast and pancake options. Additionally the hotel also provided an extensive buffet area with lots of cereals, unusual pastries, fruits and other cooked options, which was updated every day. The quality and choice was very good indeed.

As others have mentioned the staff here are exceptionally polite and friendly, from security and reception to the cleaners and gardeners. Everyone you pass greets you with a smile and says hello or how are you, often putting their hands together in a praying position. Whilst this is nice to a point I did feel sorry if staff were told to this all day, every day to everyone they meet, as this equates to 100's of times each day. I know it's meant well and with good intention but after a few days it was beginning to feel slightly OTT.

The location of the hotel relative to the busy town centre and main restaurants/shops isn't too bad. It was a good 15 min walk to get to Chandi, Bali Cafe, Ginger Moon etc, but Ku De TA was literally just around the corner. Overall the Seminyak Beach Resort ticks nearly every box for an excellent hotel, but the busy road is not at all conducive to enjoying a relaxing stay if your room is facing it. If you're a heavy sleeper then it's not a problem.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2410,Lovely resort,50,July 2015,"The location of this resort is excellent - walking distance to everything.
The pool is amazing - very relaxing and good number of sun beds.
The only negative comment I have is that the prices at the Sanje restaurant are quite high compared to the quality of food",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2411,Another enjoyable stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort,40,July 2015,"This is the second time for us at this resort and we would definitely stay again. Great facilities and location, service very good, staff attentive and very friendly. Not cheap but good value compared to other hotels of similar quality in the area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2412,Fantastic location,50,May 2015,We stayed on the other side of the road but found it not only cheaper but much quieter. We could still use all the facilities of the beach side but with the added extra of another pool and the peace. Best location in Seminyak. Walking distance to everything. Really enjoyed it. Great staff.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2413,Had a great time,40,July 2015,"Pool was excellent, room clean and luxurious with friendly staff.

Would definitely return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2414,Excell,50,July 2015,we stayed in a beach view room and was absolutely beautiful and the grounds around the resort very clean and gorgeous looking at all times. The two pools are just lovely one with swim up bar. Breakfast was great and staff were always smiling,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2415,perfect start to our honeymoon,50,July 2015,"We went to Bali for our honeymoon and The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa was the our first of three spots. We had a fantastic experience there from start to finish. The staff, servers, and spa were incredibly welcoming and helpful, always pleasant, offering help and suggestions with a smile. The property itself is gorgeous and right on the ocean, with a beautiful infinite pool overlooking the sunset. The hotel is basically next door to Ku De Ta, a popular and trendy restaurant/lounge, and walking distance from many great restaurants, Seminyak square, and beach bars.

The rooms were spacious, clean, beautifully decorated with many amenities. We were upgraded to a suite with a gorgeous view of the ocean, a huge bathroom, and an incredibly comfortable bed.

The only negative to mention is the cocktails. They could be improved upon (sometimes not enough liquor, sometimes not well mixed, tasted off at times, etc.). This happened at other places in Bali so perhaps it is just the way that they're made and it's not what we're used to in the USA.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2416,"Amazing hotel, wonderful experience",40,June 2015,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon for 8 days. It is a brilliant hotel with beautiful rooms, buildings and grounds. The pool is lovely and there are plenty of sun loungers. The breakfast was good with a lot of variety, although service was a little disorganised and inconsistent (but friendly). The hotel staff are wonderful, really friendly and courteous, particularly Retno in reception. The hotel is in a good location, secluded but within a short walking distance in each direction of shops and restaurants. I would have awarded 5 stars but our first room was really noisy because it overlooked the road, which had a security staff member almost constantly blowing a whistle to try and control traffic. We asked to move room but were only able to do so after 4 nights.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2417,Great hotel on all fronts!,40,July 2015,"Wonderful service at this five star luxury Ocean front hotel.
Staff and service made this hotel special. Beautiful gardens and pavillions to lounge around on. Plenty of loungers facing the ocean around the infinity pool which was great to be in and watch the ocean and the action on the beach. Poolside food and service was also very good.
The position of the hotel is perfect with a short walk to shops either direction and close to all the restaraunts you need to go to. The position of the hotel is between The Legian and Ku De Ta and far enough to be totally private.
My only criticsm would be that the buffet breakfast was just okay as previous reviewers have said. It wasn't the quantity. There is an extensive buffet and you can order eggs,french toast etc. a la carte all included ...it was just the quality for a five star hotel. I am not happy saying anything negative but it is something management should address.
We had a wonderful week here and would not hesitate to stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2418,Fantastic Stay,50,July 2015,Family of four stayed in July 2015 for 6 nights in both a 2br Garden Villa and two adjoining rooms in the hotel. Service = Excellent; Facilities = Excellent; Location = Excellent. Staff = Excellent. Could not fault our stay in anyway. Were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. Extra thank you to Miss Uliya who went well above expectations for her service and support during our stay and assisting with flight changes due to airport closures. Seminyak is our preferred destination due to easy walking to great restaurants and the beach at this hotel location was just awesome for the kids - clean and good size waves. This is our new preferred Bali destination.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2419,beach front luxury,50,July 2015,"We Stayed for the weekend for a quick get away and could not have been happier. Our room was amazing, the view was excellent and the staff were very professional and helpful. the Resort is in a great location right next door to Kudeta although you don't get any noise from there. 5 stars!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2420,Great position,40,July 2015,Nice hotel. Great position . Easy walk to Seminyak Square and shopping/restaurants. We had a problem with our arrival date and they were very accommodating to adjust the dates. The pool is right on the beach . Perhaps a little tired especially foyer area but overall a very nice place,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2421,Excellent experience,50,July 2015,Overall an excellent experience. Arrived one day late due to the Bali airport shutdown and amendment was accommodated on arrival along with a room upgrade. Loved the infinity pool. Room was large and well designed. Fantastic ocean view from the balcony. The staff are amazing - helpful and always a smile on their face. Room service response was fast. Only thing that was not perfect is the breakfast. Omelette and eggs benedict was very average. Would definitely stay again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2422,Great Stay,50,July 2015,Enjoyed my stay of 10 nights great service value for money very up market perfect for what I needed...Close to local restaurants right on the beach. Enjoy breakfast lots to choose from my bed was so comfy staff very friendly and help full will definately visit again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2423,Beautiful hotel at a great price,50,July 2015,Excellent value! This hotel should be priced higher given it's beauty & location. My husband & I booked this hotel at the last minute and were concerned that we would have to stay at the building across the street. Let me tell you - it was such a pleasant surprise! The location is perfect and the resort is beautiful. Being across the street was no biggie at all and should not deter you from staying here. There is a separate pool with this building so you get pool views and it's super easy to walk across to the main building / beach / pools / etc. The room was very well done - modern and fresh / clean! The staff was friendly & eager to please. The free breakfast was exceptional (too many options!). You can watch the sunset from the beautiful pools & beach at the resort. I would highly recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2424,"Amazing location, but a little overpriced",40,July 2015,"Amazing location and lovely beachside swimming pool, but getting a bit tired looking. The garden wing rooms are pretty small. We were delayed two hours when checking in & weren't offered a thing (eg a complimentary cocktail) to compensate. The resort is looking a bit dated & I think its overpriced. I'm glad we got a 50% offer through Zuji, if I had paid full room price I would have been very disappointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2425,Beautiful and tasteful,50,July 2015,"Gorgeous resort right on the beach. Great infinity pool dropping off right into the ocean. Next to some of the hottest addresses in seminyak. Easy access to shopping and many great restaurants and bars. The staff are courteous and well trained, rooms clean and nicely furnished. I would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2426,"Fantastic location, excellent service and very helpful staff. Highly recommended!",50,July 2015,"We arrived late in the evening and after a long flight we were greeted by a team of highly proficient and welcoming staff. The check-in process was swift and we were in our room in no less than 15 minutes. The hotel amenities - beach, pool, gymnasium, spa, restaurants & pool bar, were all fabulous and the standards of service was impeccable throughout our stay. The only slight criticism would be the amount of sun loungers available around the pool. If you're not up early, then the chances are slim to non of having access to a hotel lounger.
From a location perspective, the hotel is ideally situated in the heart of Seminyak and is right next to Ku De Ta with a number of other sunset bars - Mr Potato Heads, Cocoon, La Plancha etc close by.
Overall, we were extremely happy with the hotel and would certainly recommend to family and friends who are travelling and staying in Seminyak to stay at this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2427,Great location,50,January 2015,"Had an amazing time, really loved being able to laze about on the outside huts while eating some delicious food.
The pools were relaxing, being able to order drinks and snacks while tanning is always a bonus.
Will definitely return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2428,Great staff and lovely hotel right on the beach,40,July 2015,"We had a wonderful 5 days here. The staff in all areas are excellent even when very busy, warm professional service. Lovely spacious room with an ocean view, all the amenities you need in your room, comfy bed, large bathroom. Only negative comment is that there was a bad smell from the drains in the bedroom when running water for shower or bath.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2429,Good Location and Hotel,40,May 2015,"I had initially written a less than favorable review. Credit goes to the GM for personally addressing it. Her passion showed in the manner in which she addressed it; and I'm only glad I was proven wrong.

I write to inform the prospective traveler, so that he/she can avoid the initial experience I had. When booking the hotel - there are 2 different rates. This is because the Seminyak owns a property, across the street. Hence the rate for that property, while 5 star, is considerably lower than the main hotel.

Helene has assured me that this property remains popular with some guests. It provides an intimate and cosy setting for you; and arranges a buggy ride into the main hotel grounds. Where the facilities, pool, beach, and breakfast is located.

And if you're wondering - it is kind of a distance from the main hotel (hence the buggy ride), and you need to cross a rather busy street, turn a little left from it.

My only other suggestion to the traveller is: there are 5 star hotels for this rate, but you won't have access to the beach. I won't say the other property looks bad; but the main reason why I selected The Seminyak was because it had a beachfront. OK

Now for the good parts of the hotel that proved me wrong.

Location is fantastic. It's literally next door to Ku De Ta. Some funky eateries (and breakfast spots, if you don't get the breakfast included in your package. You'll not be at a loss) nearby such as Sea Circus. You can walk to Seminyak square via a back alley. Otherwise, you'll get plenty of cabs horning at you - clamouring to pick you up.

The room we were staying at is fantastic. Spacious, and decorated with old school wood. They have a balcony/patio for you to chill out at; and the modern twist comes in the form of a glass bathroom wall. So you can get to know your partner pretty well :) (of course there are blinds to cover up). And it is cleaned well. Overall, it is one of the best rooms I've stayed at.

The hotel grounds emanate a rustic feel. Cabanas on a garden, with a typical Balinese pond, adds to your chill out options.

Their swimming pool is their winning factor. It's an infinity pool with an awesome view of the Balinese beach! If that is too open for you, try their beachside cabanas. A more secluded and intimate setting with F&B options to cool you down.

Last but not least; like a lot of Balinese hotels, they have a chapel overlooking the beach.

In all objectiveness, barring my earlier unhappiness, the hotel provides the famous Balinese hospitality you'd expect. The staff are courteous and greet your every entry and exit. If you're new to Bali - I do encourage you to ask them. Balinese would be able to tell you the best places to go depending on what you'd like.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2430,Great stay at The seminyak,50,July 2015,Lucky us! We had great 5 days at The Seminyak and were stunned by the comfort and especially the kindness of the staff. At all time we felt secure und all our expectations became true. Happy to be back again in the future!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2431,Perfect Location,50,July 2015,"loved the infinity pool, staff was very friendly.
You can walk to all the popular places, ku de ta , potato head and W hotel. Loved our experience staying at Seminyak.
Would definitely recommend, breakfast was really good too",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2432,Love it,40,July 2015,"The hotel is very calm with the sound of the sea and waves.. The breakfast is amazing and very rich and the staff is friendly. The rooms are really nice specially the villa wth the private pool, very romantic. The hotel has access to a very special and nice beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2433,Clean and Luxurious,50,December 2014,"The grounds were extremely well maintained, the staff were very attentive. Food was very good, but not cheap. Fairly close to some outdoor markets. The square is not far either. The pool was very nice. There were performances when weather permitted. Would definitely go back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2434,Great Holiday Experience!,50,July 2015,"The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa was an immaculate location! The staff went above and beyond for us, and the room and facilities were top quality. Pricing within the resort in regards to food and drink is a lot more expensive than other restaurants and bars in Seminyak but if you have the money to spend you won't be disappointed!
Very good location, 5 mins walk on the beach to potato head and 5 mins to Seminyak square.
Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful holiday experience",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2435,Excellent experience,50,July 2015,"This place was a very refreshing first stop in Bali after doing some more budget-type traveling in Vietnam on our honeymoon. The rooms are luxurious and the staff is ridiculously courteous. We knew we would enjoy our stay the minute we got out of the car and they put some exceedingly fresh flower necklaces around our necks. They have fridges with enough room for your own drinks if you want to try and save money on mini-fridge alcohol. Room service is very good with a limited menu in the wee hours and the price was about the same as nearby restaurants so we ordered in a time or two each day. Water, tea and coffee are free. The beach is nice and not crowded in front of the hotel. I would definitely spend at least one day at the pool doing absolutely nothing. Some of the rooms are across the street from the main lobby. I booked last minute and there was only two rooms at the whole place, otherwise would have opted to pay more for beachside rooms. That being said, I don't think it would have been worth too much money just for the convenience of not walking 50 yards... there are security guards 24x7 and they slide open the gate for you on both sides of the street as you walk across the rather unbusy road. There is a convenience store right next to the hotel and a couple restaurants/motorbike rental/travel agency. A short walk will take you to the nightlife. They have Vegas-style shades so you can accidentally sleep in very late.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2436,Secluded yet well situated,40,July 2015,"We stayed for one week here before moving onto our second hotel in jimbaran. Out of the two hotels we stayed in (both 5 star) this for me was the better one! We had an ocean view suite which was well worth the extra money, the plunge pool bath was awesome and the twin sinks were great to have at night when getting ready with the Mrs! The bed was comfy, memory foam mattress and soft pillows.
The breakfast at this hotel is amazing! Possibly the best I've had in any hotel ive stayed. You have a choice of eggs, pancakes and waffles from the menu along with a high quality buffet of cereals, fruits and pastries.
The pool area was gorgeous but get there early to get a bed! Beach is clean but has no sunbeds. People complained on earlier reviews about hotel prices for food and drinks but they are only expensive when compared to prices in the local supermarket. If you want to buy anything from a nearby supermarket go to K Mart as they are the cheapest. ¬£0.20 for a can of coke (2,000 rupiah)
We only ever had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and everytime the food was great, the one time they got a salad wrong they deducted it from our bill which was a nice gesture. On an evening we dined out, bambu and ginger moon were the highlights but cafe bali is well worth a visit too. Check out petite India too :-)
The only negatives from our stay here would be a slight smell from the toilet area which I can only imagine was the local drains as you got the same smell out and about. You are in Asia remember! Sights, sounds and smells here are all very different! Oh and we had a plug socket in the room that didn't work, plus a stain on one of the cushions in the seating area of the suite. It may sound picky but if your paying for a luxury hotel you do expect it to be faultless (which it almost was) ;-)
To conclude, overall our stay here was amazing and we would definitely come back. Thank you to all the staff who made us feel welcomed everyday :-)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2437,Seminyak idyllic,50,July 2015,"Great location and hotel. The infinity pool was brilliant as were the gardens leafing down yo the beach.The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble

2439,Recent stay,40,July 2015,"We loved our stay at the seminyak beach resort, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The resort was beautiful and our room was just like we expected. Breakfast wasn't included in our package, it was $35 AU dollar even though we found it to be over priced we wanted to try it one day in our stay expecting it to be lovely. Unfortunately it wasn't what we expected, we found the service to be very slow and my friends meal was brought out 20mins before mine. When mine was brought out my eggs were over cooked. We made a complaint to the breakfast manager and he was quite rude upon approach and never followed up our complaint. That was the only let down about our stay all other staff were great!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2442,Honeymoon stay,40,June 2015,"My husband and I stayed at the Seminyak beach resort for the first half of our honeymoon. Everything was wonderful. It is very romantic but not too secluded. The staff members were all wonderful and pleasant. We did book an ocean view and we had a room on the 2nd floor, but with all the trees there is not much of an ocean view. However, we did go up one flight to the 3rd floor, where there is a much better ocean view! So, something to consider to request when booking!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2443,An unparalleled stay !,50,July 2015,"Our stay at The Seminyak was indeed a memorable one! We later stayed at 2 hotels in Bali, but we were always comparing to The Seminyak. Great service, friendly staff, spacious villa (we received a free upgrade from suite to private villa upon arrival), delicious breakfast and beautiful infinity pool directly facing the sea. The Seminyak is at a feasible distance from many restaurants and shopping areas. If we ever come back to Bali, we will definitely stay in this resort again!

Thank you for everyone who shared in making our honeymoon stay such a beautiful one!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2446,Truly Paradise,50,June 2015,"Research paid off on this one. I cant say enough about this Resort. It was absolutely beautiful. We stayed in an ocean side villa and the room was actually better than the picture. Traveling all the way from the states was difficult but worth it when we arrived. We visited a few other resorts, tried their restaurants and so forth and did not find one even close to this in Seminyak. The breakfast was one of my most favorites memories..huge selection of food, good quality with homemade jams and bread. The resort is close to Potato Head and Ku De Ta, both worth checking out for lunch, dinner, and/ or drinks.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

There are two buildings, the main building is located next to the beach and the other building is across the street. I have stayed in the other building, which was nice since it was smaller. more intimate and you would have your 'own' pool! The breakfast was amazing, fresh fruits, local specialties and always a smile from the staff. The staff it was made our stay even more special. They where always happy to help you whenever you had a request or wanted to have some advice on what kind of excursions to do. I'll be back! See you next year :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

We are very sad cause the hotel is not worth it! We though we were in a garden wing, but i better can call it a Street wing. We most across the street in a litlle building. It feels NO luxery. The rooms als very beautifull but the building is so so sad. We have many friends and business collgues they realy wanted us to let them know what we though anout this hotel ( they always stay at the oberoi) We are here now and hoping some things are getting better but there is no
Place at the pool, and the service we used to received from the amazing bali people we didnt get. We told them our huge dissapointment but they couldnt do anything! It is so sad becausethe hotel

Fully booked. This is our honeymoon and we better could book a much cheaper hotel on the street site. Or book the Oberoi next time I guess we will. I hope
They still will come with a solution but I am afraid so... Spend this big money to another hotel at the beach and be carefull stay in a main building!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2451,Excellent Service and Location,40,April 2015,"Enjoyed the luxury of this hotel, especially after having come from the Gili Islands. I stayed in a standard room, main building, and found the bathroom and bed divine. AC and wireless were flawless. Pool was also lovely, overlooking the ocean, and service was fantastic in every area of the hotel. Location was excellent for exploring Seminyak.

Only two small downsides. One, guests were mostly couples and families, so as a solo traveler I felt a bit isolated (not the hotel's fault, but if you're single and wanting to make the acquaintance of other travelers this may not be the place for you). Two, other than being lovely and friendly, the hotel didn't have a particular vibe that I could draw a bead on. Not super modern, not trendy, not old-world Balinese. Given the price I was paying I would have preferred a bit more character/personality in the resort itself. Again, minor detail but something travelers might want to know.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The infinity pool is stunning to say the least.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

That in mind lets get started.
Back in Bali after 23years. Now obviously older and more discerning (some would say not!). The resort is on the beach. Breakfast inc. was a daily treat. Wide foods selection. Staff could not be faulted. Room VERY clean and serviced discreetly daily with a turn down service around 7PM. The room I stayed in did get a bit of traffic noise. But got over that. Pool and cocktail bar service around same was impressive. 8+half/10. Really nice place. Will return in 12months. Pepe.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2458,Gorgeous Get away,50,June 2015,My husband and I stayed at this resort for 5 days in June. It was beautiful and relaxing and is in a great location for restaurants and Seminyak Square. My only criticism would be the restaurant. The food was expensive and not quite up to the local standard. They would have a captured market if the food was better and reasonably priced. Other than that the staff were amazing and it was a very relaxing holiday.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2459,A wonderful experience,50,June 2015,"The staff were amazing, so friendly and very much wanting to ensure their guests were happy. The hotel is beautiful and I cannot fault the 6 night stay we had. Loved it! I stayed last year also given it was so good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2460,A delightful place,50,July 2015,"We spent nearly 3 weeks here and couldn't have hoped for more. From the moment we checked in after a long journey from the UK, we knew we had chosen well. All hotel facilities are spotless and well maintained, but what really stands out is the genuine warmth and friendliness of hotel employees. We were greeted by name by everyone after the first few days. Nothing was too much trouble, staff were focussed on making our holiday a real pleasure. Although the hotel has a bar, it isn't really a social focal point.

The hotel is set in lovely gardens and is right on the beach, which is kept clean at all times. The main restaurant street is just a 5 minute stroll away with plenty of dining choices. Turning left from the hotel, another resort area is an easy if slightly longer walk, again with many restaurants and shops. Local taxis are an easy option.

The beach is ideal for surfers, less so for a gentle swim! A major plus is a total lack of jet skis and speedboats, so the only noise is from the endless breakers. While there are occasional beach vendors, they are no problem at all.

All told, a really well run hotel, staffed by some truly delightful people.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2461,"Vicky, Western Australia",50,June 2015,"This hotel would have to rate as one if the best I have had the pleasure to stay in. The service was simply first class. Staff pre-empted your needs and could not have been more attentive. In every area be it poolside, breakfast, spa, dinner or any other part if the hotel, the staff were brilliant. Food and drinks selection was very good and quality first rate. Would highly recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2463,Honeymoon,50,March 2015,"As newly weds we stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa on our honeymoon. We confirmed a garden room accross the road and it was lovely. Beautifully furnished rooms and their was a pool and pool bar accross the road at the garden view complex which we actually loved as was much more quiet and handy to our rooms. We ended up booking over Nyepi Day (day of silence where no one is allowed on the streets or to leave their resorts) and were lucky enough to have been moved over to the beach side rooms for 2 nights due to this so we could use the hotel facilities on this day. The rooms were exactly the same but we had a resort view and I must say as much as I loved the garden rooms which I was most happy in, I LOVED the beach side ones with a resort view. The pool was also lovely with a beach view on this side. All in all it was a great stay, the breakfast was AMAZING and all the staff most helpful and friendly. I would stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Very nice set up with our own private pool... comfortable bedrooms, HUGE bathroom (I reckon the bath could easily fit 4 people in it).

2468,Absolutely fantastic holiday,50,May 2015,"Following 3 mad days in Hong Kong we arrived at the hotel and were given a lovely welcome and a brief tour. Then came to showing us our room, I had previously read to request for a sea view room and consider there are only 4 I think we were very lucky. Over the next 8 days we spent all but 1 by the pool,normally I am not a person who chills for hours by the pool or on the beach but this place just made me feel relaxed.I Spent hours in the pool watching the surfers, chatting to the guys who walk past selling stuff but who also do not pester you. The breakfasts are really nice and served by staff who are very helpful and always smiling.We did not eat in the hotel restaurant as there are so many restaurants near bye, I would highly recommend a few but Chandi which is in the main Part of the town was our favourite,Bambu which is 5 mins taxi ride was nice but you will need to book ,Petitenget a ten mins walk from hotel & Sea Circus a 5 minute walk from hotel, both of these were really nice and good value.

If you want a really good day out, this catamaran trip is a must, http://www.balihaicruises.com/aristocat-sailing-cruise.
One of best places I've been in the world and we will be back in 2017 and will be defiantly staying here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2469,Excellent!,50,June 2015,"Very nice hotel with excellent service. We had a large beachfront room with a beautiful and clean bathroom. Breakfast was very good, lots of things to choose from. The pool is very nice, right at the beach. They serve drinks and food.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2470,Good Hotel - Missing The Details,30,June 2015,"Firstly I would like to say that despite my constructive feedback below I would actually recommend this hotel to others, and stay here again in the future. Its a solid hotel, in a great location and the rooms are perfectly adequate. From a cost perspective its much cheaper than say the Legian hotel (just next door) so you get that beautiful sea facing location, but the service and food is not comparable.

Now the BUTs.....

Where this hotel falls down is that it misses the small details that make the rooms and the stay excellent rather than just good. For example, the swimming pool design is ridiculous - I think pretty much everyone who entered it for the first time nearly drowned themselves briefly. The steps are the exact same colour as the rest of the pool and you basically can't see them so until you're familiar (from falling off the step) everyone goes smashing into the deep end off the last step.

The rooms don't seem to have a proper master light switch by the bed, so whilst you can kill most of the lights you still have to get up and turn others off. I find this annoying.

The doors to the shower and toilet areas open and close in different and annoying/unnatural ways, so every time you go in or out you basically always choose to push or pull incorrectly. Again, its a really small point, but its the details that matter in a 5 star hotel.

The food was ok, but definitely not great. The fruit at breakfast was pretty much all at the end of its shelf live (though in fairness we struggled to find good fruit anywhere in Bali). We went to the Legian next door for dinner one night (also a 5 start hotel) and the food completely blew the pants off The Seminyak Beach Resort.

The staff are all very friendly (actually to friendly - I got tired in the end of every single person from the front gate, the lobby, the reception, the walk to my room) saying hello, welcome back, how are you......it was just a little to much and I ended up just making noises back because it was tiring saying the same thing over and over again.

Again, the quality of the staff at the Legian next door was superior when we visited for Dinner.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2471,Truly paradise!,50,June 2015,"As a word of warning, I am writing this review while sitting by the pool at the Semyniak drinking a pina colada, so I might be just a tiny bit biased.

I must say this place is absolutely amazing and here is why:

Hotel: we booked an ocean view suite via booking.com. We paid for it upfront and received a very good discount. I have to say that it took a while to persuade my partner to pay in advance but eventually the saving and the good reviews here convinced him. If you are worried about this as well, I would say there is no reason for it! The Seminyak is a lovely place and it's unlikely that you will be disappointed. Maybe get travel insurance to protect yourselves in case of unpleasent events that prevent you from taking the trip.
I was a bit annoyed when the hotel asked me for all sorts of card details in addition to what I had given them via booking.com, but I explained my concernes and in the end they understood my position and were fine to confirm the payment.
The hotel arranged airport transfer for us, which was very quick and went very well. Upon arrival we were greated with flower necklasces (they smelled divine) and ice tea. We were also extremely lucky to be upgraded to an ocean view villa, which I cannot even begin to describe. Let's just say it is one of the few places that look exactly like the pictures they posted online. It is absolutely amazing! Everything from the room to the (huge) bathroom, the terrace and private pool is absolutely wonderful. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed in so e very nice places around the world, but this is something truly special. If you can afford it, book a villa without hesitation. I must say I have not seen their regular rooms so cannot comment on that, but judging by the quality of the villa, the grounds, the pool and bars, I doubt the rooms are not very nice.

Two points which I would like to make here are: I understand they have a second building which is somewhere across the street from the main hotel and a bit noisy because of the road, so make sure you read the description before you book. The second point is that drinks and food in the pool area a pricey compared to the average prices in Seminyak. The quality is very good though and the breakfast is very nice as well. I don' eat a lot of foods (dairy, eggs, meat) and still had quite a few options (yes, they do provide soy 'milk'!).
I have read a few complaints about the wifi. It does indeed ask you to log on multiple times but for me this was not a big issue. I'd say holidays are meant to help us disconnect, including from the www, so maybe this is not such a bad thing.

Staff: the staff is absolutely lovely. They always seem to go out of their way to accommodate their clients' needs and are very friendly. I have found this to be true in Bali in general. People here are very nice to tourists. I understand the cynical point of view that they are nice because they want your money but I have been to many other countries where locals wanted to sell me stuff and were very rude and aggressive about it. That has not been my experience here (at least not so far).

Location: A friend who knows Bali well was kind enough to show us around and give us some advice on the best places to stay and go to. From what I have seen so far, Seminyak was definetly the right choice for us as it's busy but not crazy (as opposed to Kuta where teenagers go to party and Nusa Dua which is very quiet) and very civilized. The Seminyak is right next to Ku De Ta, a local hotspot and a 10-minute walk away from the shops and restaurants, so a very good location.

All in all, I would say this is a very nice place and our time here has been amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2472,Beachfront Resort,50,June 2015,"The resort is right on the beach .The service was excellent.The location of this resort so central. It's a 5 min walk into town where you""ll find many restaurants and bars,clothing shops, mini marts,supermarket and 2 markets where you can bargain for a cheaper price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2473,Bali Seminyak resort review,50,June 2015,"My wife and I arrived with another couple to be greeted by 2 very friendly members of staff and given flower garlands and cool towels. We sat at reception to check in and were given a very coollng tea and herb based drink which was much needed after the long journey there.
The check in was very easy and very very welcoming ..the best checkin i have ever had...having stayed in countless hotels.

We were given a room upgrade as this visit was a part of a special birthday celebration...the rooms were by the beach side. We were shown around the room by a very helpful member of the team who couldnt have done much more for us..the rooms very large with a very well appointed bathroom with a walkin shower...
Over all it is an excellent resort with outstanding service from EVERY member of the team ..we were greeted by every member of the team even when passing them in corridors..No faults that i could find .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2474,Excellent Stay !,50,June 2015,"Arrived a little early so had to wait with a welcome drink but had a very warm welcome from Hadi on reception, who showed us to our room. Beautiful room overlooking the sea and gardens, right next to the smaller pool with swim up bar! Also had gazebos next to the pool giving the air of relaxation and peace. Breakfast was great. Do not listen to some of the negative reviews about the food, they catered for asian, english and european with lots of choices. Order your own omelettes, waffles and eggs any which way. The main infinity pool was great as it overlooked the main beach and the sun beds were far enough away from the beach so that you cannot be bothered by the beach sellers. They didn't hassle you anyway if you weren't interested but they were always polite! Taxi from the airport Taxi service was 150,000RPH, but to the airport from the hotel was 100,000RPH (¬£4.80). Either way not a bad price for a 40 min journey. We had a week of sunshine and peace at the hotel where all the staff were polite, smiling and offering to help at every encounter from the gardener, cleaner, restaurant and bar staff. This was a very relaxed place which worked quietly and efficiently for its guests. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2475,Paradise in the heart of Seminyak,50,June 2015,"I stayed here recently with my family (1 year old daughter and 4 year old son) and right from the moment we arrived we were greeted with warm and friendly staff who consistently went out of their way make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.
The location of the hotel is very central, right next door to Ku De Ta and on a great stretch of beach in Seminyak.
The pool is perfectly located on the beach and there was always free deck chairs, and lots of pool service at very reasonable prices. There wasn't a separate kids menu but we were told that they were more than happy to provide half portions for half the price. The kids pool is located at one end of the pool and was great for our little ones to run around and play in without disturbing all the other guests.
The rooms are huge, comfortable and have everything you could ask for in a 5 star hotel. We stayed in a suite and payed for an extra roll away bed for our son - it was big enough to fit the 4 of us in comfortably with a lovely balcony overlooking the ocean.
Breakfast is delicious and the staff are attentive - always bringing extra little bits and pieces for our children.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back - for a little piece of paradise right in the middle of seminyak, this place is a gem!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2476,Mixed feelings,30,June 2015,"Our stay was the 2nd part of our holiday after already staying in a superb hotel outside ubud.
On arrival here we were advised we were in garden wing across road. The room was dark,dingy and hardly a garden view. Not what we expected.

On arrival we asked for room in main building but was told there were none available until 27th and then at a cost for basically the same room.

Finding out we were in cheap rooms knowing how much we paid and the fact that this room was substandard compared to our last place was very disappointing.
An issue I intend to bring up with our travel agent as this is misdescription and there was no mention of us not staying at the resort in the brochure.
The room had lizards in it near the kettle and I had not had the balcony door open. The other shower attachment when switched on in error stank like rotten eggs.

Don't get me wrong this is a luxury setting by the beach and the spa and gym facilities are beautiful but I am very disappointed on the whole. Breakfast is mediocre at best and once again a bit of a let down compared to maya ubud resort.

Whilst staff are friendly our situation was not resolved and then there is the upheaval of moving yet again and repacking and unpacking.

Travel agents are to blame Hayes and harvest who do not reply to my email and Thomson. Believe me when I next plan a holiday will ensure I have read reviews of the hotel first.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2477,Awesome !!,50,June 2015,"I reccomand this hotel to everyone
Good location, very quite, fantastic room condition. Really nice food. They have got everything. Specially the pool is really great and beatiful.

This hotel is really worth it",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2478,Beautiful resort,50,June 2015,"Had a wonderful stay in Seminyak here. The amenities were great, service was prompt and above expectations. The food was a tad pricey but well done. The pool was great and we really enjoyed the smaller sized hotel feel...it was our favourite stay during our 2 week stay in Bali.

My only criticism would have been the wifi was slow/intermittent in areas of the resort...but didn't matter to us since we were on vacation and not planning to use electronic devices all the time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2479,What we hoped it would be...,50,June 2015,"An absolutely brilliant stay at this hotel.

The key highlights:

- attentive, warm and friendly staff no matter where you were in the hotel.

- breakfast was delightful every morning. Love the menu options every morning, this ensures the food is fresh and made according to what you feel like.

- the pool was beautiful and so well maintained.

- we stayed in an ocean view suite and it was luxury at its best. Spacious room, comfortable beds and amazing bathroom, not to mention a perfect view.

- very well located, in the heart of seminyak and near all the great eating places.

Highly recommend this hotel and will certainly be looking to revisit for our next stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2480,Outstanding!,50,June 2015,"We stayed here just recently for for 6 nights. We booked a garden view room but were lucky enough to be upgraded to an ocean view room.

Notwithstanding the amazing upgrade, the resort was impeccible, the staff exemplary, the attention and attention to detail second-to-none. There are many establishments in Bali with similar or higher star ratings but we would struggle to find one we would rank as this exceptional.

Without hesitation we would recommend Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2481,Great stay,50,June 2015,"This stay is exactly what we needed, he pool is great and the surf was 6 to 8 feet the first few days. The resort is not that large which gave it a much more personal feel. I also couldn't fault the staff that were always willing to help and assist. We had a beach side room which I found to be most adequate in size and appointment. I also hadn't been to Bali since 2001 and it has improved greatly (you don't get hassled on the streets and they are clean) so I'll be back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2482,Excellent,50,June 2015,Me & my son enjoyed our stay in this resort because the hotel staff were very warm and accommodating. Room amenities are complete. Room service is fast and reliable even when you call late at night. We will definitely come back.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2483,Beautiful Pitstop,50,May 2015,"Stayed as a solo traveller for a couple of nights passing through Seminyak. This resort was just lovely. From check-in to check-out the service was great. The beach room I had was very comfortable with a choice of pillows and lovely amenities. The infinity pool overlooking the beach was gorgeous. Love the location, a few minutes walk to all my favourite restaurants and only five min. walk up a lane to Seminyak Square. I would stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2484,Magic view,50,June 2015,"Actually the hotel is out of our expectation. We did not spend much time to search the hotel in this area and just booked the room for saving time. We are happy that our families all like this hotel. Grandparents like their friendly and helpful staff and the swimming pool. My girl 10 years old likes their breakfast buffet and the beach, she said it is golden beach bcs of shining in the sun. My hubby and I like their magic view from balcony and yoga class just faced to the sea. The pity is that only Thursday morning has yoga class. The activities in hotel is not enough. And another problem was that the lock of door was spoiled, after repaired, spoiled again. The management of hotel really need upgrade your lock of door!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2485,Magical Oasis,40,June 2015,"Everything was perfect from our Welcome arrival, the friendly and helpful staff, the room, the amenities, the security, and the hotel. Just a magical place for couples, singles and friends. Maybe not for a family with young children. Maybe there should be some entertainment in the bar pool, I found it a bit slow and flat, maybe happy hours could be considered, and keep ithe pool bar open a little longer during the nights. Overall a picturesque magical oasis.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2486,What a place!,50,June 2015,"We were lucky enough to stay in a pool villa at the Seminyak for 5 nights for our honeymoon and it was amazing. The private pool is a really good size and you walk out of the very spacious bedroom with an enormous bed, through the patio doors and step directly into your very own pool! The only criticism I have here (it is very small) is the sunloungers in the room are uncomfortable, they look great but you don't want to lie on them very long. The ones by the pool are a lot nicer as they are adjustable and have cushions. There is a private patio dining area and a pagoda, serious luxury and extremely relaxing....
The rooms are well stocked, plenty of complimentary bottles of water, a great dressing table and a big bathroom with double sinks, rainfall shower and big sunken bath. Plus aromatherapy associates toiletries - nice touch!
The main pool is an infinity pool set against the shore line so you can watch the surfers. Being right on the beach is fantastic, there aren't many better views of the sunset to be had in Bali in my opinion...
The breakfast is vast and all excellent quality. There are Indonesian curries, sushi, a big array of pastries, English breakfast stuff, and a choice of freshly squeezed tropical juices all on buffet. You can also opt for a a la carte option e.g. eggs benedict or waffles with strawberries and chocolate sauce. Excellent service and we even had some live music from two Tiklik players (Balinese xylophones) which is novel.
The hotel is right in the heart of Seminyak so we had no need to take a taxi when going out at night. Seminyak is a more up market resort as Bali goes I think (we certainly thought so after having 4 nights in Ubud) eating out is more expensive and it is harder to find a simple Warung, but there are some amazing restaurants and bars to enjoy and it is great to have them on your hotel doorstep.
We thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are looking for contemporary luxury in bustling Bali location.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2487,fantastic hotel,50,June 2015,"This hotel went beyond our expectations. We have stayed at two other hotels in Bali along Seminyak before and this was definitely our favorite. The staff was absolutely amazing. They were so polite, welcoming, helpful, and had the best service. From the concierge, to the pool, to the room service it was all fantastic. The hotel was beautiful. The pool was perfect and had the best view of the beach. Breakfast was delicious as was the coffee. It was extremely close to Seminyak square and other great shops and restaurants. The hotel concierge made great recommendations for dinner or lunch when we went out.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2488,Totally amazing,50,June 2015,"Paradise on earth, spent the first week of our honeymoon here, our room was beachfront, room huge and had every luxury you could want. Right from arrival welcome and drinks and flowers to all the bars the service was stunning. Nothing too. Ipich bother. Helped us pack a long item to take home giving us boxes, tape and a saw!!! Breakfast excellent",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2489,Love the BATHTUB facing the beach at my SUITE !!,40,June 2015,"I stayed at this resort quite often actually, and this time I stayed at suite room, I must say the suite room is pretty AMAZING !!
The room is much bigger than normal room and the bathroom is set up with 2 washbasins, definitely honeymoon couple kinda room , but what I love the most, it's equipped with such a huge bathtub by the window and facing the beach , and this is sooo BEAUTIFULLY BREATHTAKING !!! You can imagine yourself and your partner having champagne/ wine there together with beach ocean view !! SUPERB !!
The breakfast here is pretty much ok, and the hotel is equipped with fitness centre too, and I really live the CHAPEL BY THE BEACH here, definitely something I recommend for wedding/holy matrimony kinda thing , BEAUTIFUL , PEACE, SERENITY !!
This hotel got 2 swimming pool , 1 swimming pool is around the bar area, and the other one is INFINITY POOL , and this is the one where I always hang out and enjoy Bali , definitely FEELING BLESSED !!!
Overall, I'm pretty much happy with the fact that this hotel is in seminyak area, just walking distance to Kudeta , my fave place to chill , and so close to all the restaurants and club too, it's definitely WORTH TO TRY !! Will upload some pictures here, so you guys can witness what I feel ...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2490,"Nice, clean and wonderful pool area, rooms are lovely also",30,June 2015,"We booked the following hotel for 4 nights in June 2015. The pool area is excellent and what drew us to the hotel in the first instance. This is truly wonderful and right on the beach, great for watching the sun set and also a great location with respect to the best restaurants etc. We had booked an ocean view suit and after checking in, we discovered that we had been given a room below the level that we paid for (and was well below the price point). When we questioned this in the first instance (when being shown to our room) we were told that we had in fact booked that room. Once we found the email detailing that we were in fact right and in the wrong room, they told us that they were overbooked and we should stay in the room for the first 2 night‚Äôs and then they would upgrade us to the ocean villa. This happened, however we were told we could have the room at 1 pm and didn‚Äôt get into the villa until 2.30pm. Slight delay, but we were keen to get settled and the changing around was a little frustrating. I was a little disappointed that we had a leaky air conditioner in the villa which meant I almost slipped over numerous times and had to place numerous towels down to prevent us form slipping. I have to say that the rooms (the first one and the villa) were clean and very very good!
I have marked the hotel slightly down as I feel it is significantly more pricey than some of the other hotels around that area and this coupled with the tentativeness of staff, while good, was not as good as some others in the area.
The buffet breakfast was great if you have a big tummy ‚Äì too much choice!
Would most likely stay here again and is definitely worth a look!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I was traveling alone but never felt lonely thanks to all the people who were working there. They were really very nice and very careful always making sure I enjoyed my time with them.

Our room (suite with ocean view) was extremely spacious and comfortable. The pool is amazing and is right on the beach. Daily breakfasts too were a highlight. The hotel grounds were very pretty and all staff very polite and helpful. Our only criticism would be that although the bathroom was extremely lavish, the water pressure was particularly low in both the shower and spa (the spa too >1hr to fill up).

Otherwise a really enjoyable stay and would certainly return and highly recommend staying at this hotel",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2503,Amazing resort,50,May 2015,"This was our third stay at the Seminyak in the past 8 months. It is sheer bliss from the moment you arrive after a long flight from the U.K and are greeted, to the moment you have to reluctantly leave. There has not been a day since we arrived back that we have not thought off all the wonderful moments this resort has to offer. The infinity pool, the delicious breakfasts, the manicured garden,the most comfortable beds, spacious rooms with the most amazing views and attention to making your stay memorable are just a few highlights of this resort. All the staff at the hotel always greet you by name and ensure that all your needs are taken care off, particular mentions to Retna at guest relations, Mr Merta,Front desk manager, Superman and all the poolside staff. The new General manager has made some notable changes and will definitely take the Seminyak resort to greater heights.

2507,Honeymoon in Paradise!,50,May 2015,"The hotel is perfectly located by the beach, shops and restaurants, 10 minutes walk from Seminyak Square. The staff were friendly, helpful and we were treated like royalty, always at hand to help. If you are looking for culture and class, this is the place to stay. The rooms are cleaned everyday and staff check every evening to find out if you need anything. Gardens and pool area are well kept and your amenities in the room are replenished everyday e.g. Water, tea, towels and toiletries. The breakfast buffet is the best, you have a wide selection from English, Balinese and Asian food with fresh fruit, juices and tea/coffee daily.

Restaurants nearby you must try, Merah Putih, Satay Bali, Biku, Chandi, Ginger moon and Sardines. Lunch at Sisterfields was our favourite. Bars and clubs to check out, Potato head is the perfect chill out spot, Alibi and Mirror are good clubs if you want to dance the night away.

If you are looking for a spa experience, Spa Bali in Drupadi is worth a visit. We had a hour full body massage for ¬£7.50! If you get a taxi please look out for the bluebirds as they are the cheapest and run by a meter, the others will rip you off, be warned. Also do not change your money at the street vendors no matter how attractive the rates seems you will be short changed.

Staying at this hotel, we experienced paradise. We could not have asked for more for our honeymoon, we will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2508,Fantastic hotel in Seminyak!,50,May 2015,"We stayed in the hotel for a few nights during our honeymoon.

KUDETA and many other great restaurants are just next doors.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2509,Excellent Service,50,May 2015,"Our stay in Seminyak was sublime. This was made possible by the excellent service provided by all the staff at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. From the breakfast to the dinner's at this place, everything was handled with care and attention to detail. Service during the day at the pool was fantastic and we had nice interactions with the staff from the lifeguards to the security men to the front desk employees. We have been to other resorts on the island as well and in our mind this is by far the best clean beautiful and amazing experience you can imagine on the island.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2510,Fantastic honeymoon hotel!,50,May 2015,"We stayed here for a week at the start of our honeymoon and it was easily the best hotel of the holiday.

Highlights:

- central location within 10min walk to shops, bars & restaurants
- large pool right beside the beach with plenty of loungers and attentive staff
- amazing selection at breakfast- the cooked to order items such as waffles and pancakes were out of this world!
- extremely friendly and efficient staff throughout; they seemed to genuinely take pleasure in assisting
- large room in the beach wing with a very comfortable king size bed and balcony

We could not find any faults with this hotel during the week we stayed and would love to go back sometime in the future!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2511,Amazing Resort and Staff,50,May 2015,The seminyak resort and spa was above and beyond all our expectations. The resort itself is beautiful and so relaxing! The staff could not have been any better! They were so kind and helpful at all times! We will definitely stay the the resort again on our next trip to Bali!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2512,Absolutely magnificent,50,May 2015,"We had fallen in love with the hotel as soon as we had arrived. Not only is it breathtakingly beautiful, but the staff were attentive and friendly. Upon our arrival my partner and I were greeted with an aromatic lei necklace and mouth-watering refreshments which gave us a much needed energy kick after our long flight. We sat down with a staff member named Dewi and were impressed by her fluency in English - we felt right at home. The purpose of our stay was to celebrate our honeymoon and we had booked the Garden One Bedroom Villa, but Dewi had upgraded us to the Beach One Bedroom Villa as a congratulatory upgrade. We were blown away by their generosity, and we couldn‚Äôt more grateful. I could blab on and on about the resorts beauty but I believe the photos provided on TripAdvisor and on their website speak for themselves. There is one more thing that I must highlight and that is the nobility of the staff. On one of the nights I had left my wallet in the hotel. I started to panic because the cleaners would have tidied our room and there was a chance that my wallet could have been stolen. However when I returned to the room, the room was neatly tidied and my wallet was placed on the corner of my bed. I‚Äôm absolutely overjoyed with my stay at The Seminyak and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2513,Excellent,50,May 2015,"Very first class service. Absolutely beautiful! Location is perfect, breakfast is amazing with so much to choose from and the beds are the comfiest in the whole of Bali. Staff are very warm and friendly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2514,Simply a paradise!,50,May 2015,"Our over all experience at The Seminyak was amazing! It starts at the moment you get out of your car and a very friendly staff will greet you and put a garland on you. As you enter the concierge, a cold towel and refreshing iced lemongrass tea will be served. The very accommodating receptionist Diyan has accompanied us going to our suite and even taught us how to eat the local ""snake fruit"" (which is one of the complimentaries in the room). All the staff are very courteous. They always greet you with a smile. Even in the restaurant, staffs are very accommodating and friendly and making sure that you are having a great time. The only thing that we regret was that we only stayed there for a night! We'll definitely plan a visit again in Bali and we will surely have a longer stay here at The Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2515,Awesome Hotel,50,June 2015,"We just arrived home from this wonderful hotel and all I can say is how fantastic it is. The Beach Wing room is sensational. It's so spacious and elegant.

The breakfast is amazing and the staff all around the hotel are helpful and very friendly.

The pool areas are wonderful and peaceful. The infinity pool is beautiful, the only downside to this pool are the hawkers who are allowed to approach the pool from the beach. But they are friendly and harmless.

I wouldn't recommend this for families - we went without our children with three other couples and it was perfect for the 40th bday we were celebrating.

It is in a perfect location as well right next to Ku De Ta.

I would definitely recommend spending the extra dollars to stay here.

Thank you Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2516,High class resort that keeps the cultural feel,50,May 2015,"We loved our stay at the Seminyak beach resort. We thought it was located well and very beautiful, relaxing resort.

We had thought it would be better to stay at the W, but glad we stayed at the Seminyak given it still had the Bali culture in the service and decor.

Definitely recommend staying in a beachfront room. You can hear the waves from inside the room :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2517,Relax & Recharge,50,June 2015,"Great resort in a beautiful area. Staff were fantastic & very friendly, room (suite) was one of the best I've stayed in. Could just sit by the pool on the edge of the beach all day & watch the sun set or go out for nearby shopping & plentiful quality restaurants. WiFi was a little intermittent which was the only thing I could fault.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2518,Perfect Honeymoon,50,May 2015,"We stayed at Seminyak Beach Resort as part of our honeymoon and loved it! We were upgraded to an Ocean View Suite which was amazing and we could sit on our balcony every afternoon to watch the sunset. The staff were always there to help and we were greeted everywhere we went. The location is great here, only a 5 minute walk to the main ""Eat Street"" in Seminyak, next door to Ku De Ta and short walk on the beach to La Lucciola and Potato Head. We loved our stay here and will definitely return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2519,Group birthday gathering,50,April 2015,"This resort is especially beautiful for many reasons , the staff exceptionally helpful friendly and attentive.always smiling.
It was a group of 12 friends celebrating a 60th birthday. Staff on the date of birthday girls celebration delivered a chocolate cake to breakfast free of charge and sang happy
Birthday . Very sweet.
The resort tropical grounds a emmaculately tended to. The long pool over looking the ocean was very impressive clean various depths to suit families with kids also.
One other small pool in a quieter corner with massage mats under cover was very
Relaxing or suited to couples for a more intimate Set up. The breakfast included a was excellent apart from the bees who hovered over the sweet breads and honey.
The room we booked was a largesuite with a Seaview . More expensive than the garden View or ocean view however we were lucky to get a great deal online at half price. This room had a sunken spa with a TV and view ito the ocean. Awsome. A sneak peak in one of the villas found the private pool and luxury very tempting for next visit. 2resteraunts on sight all day & night room service and free afternoon tea.
It was a quiet period the middle of April 9-16th . Perfect plenty of sun chairs staff brought towels to upon approach . Service plus. Partying at the poolside food snacks
And drinks accommodated with a lot of attention . All great. Weddings were held in the chapel overlooking the beach come restaraunt in the evening . Very romantic with candles lit up . Loved it didn't want to leave. This a 41/2 star equal to 5star+
Definitely recommend it for the luxury end of holiday stays. Seminyak centre only a short walk and plenty of bars quality resteraunts to visit. Oh yes found body works Massage
Cheaply priced for great service.
Fantastic stay thanks to all staff at this resort.üòÉüëèüëç Enjoy!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2520,Endless water on the sandy beach,50,May 2015,"The most amazing Hotel in Seminyak to stay at with all its charm and wonderful gardens surrounding its beauty.
You can't get any closer to the beach than this hotel has to offer with a big endless pool on the beach on one side and the most amazing pool bar and relax area on the other side of the garden still on the beach.The staff are amazing and extremely friendly to every one and always asking how you are and smiling all the time
The food is to die for at breakfast with a very comprehensive buffet set out to please every one from all countries.
A very big special thank you to the Manager Mr Mertha for setting us up in another room from the 12.00 pm check out as we had a very late flight, this gave us some where to shower and relax while waiting for our late transfer to the Airport.
I would highly suggest this hotel for a luxury stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2521,Excellent stay,50,May 2015,"It was a prefect stay and we got engaged when we was there and it was perfect.
The help from all the staff was very good in organising all of this.
I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone .
The location was great aswell for getting everywhere and felt very safe in the area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2522,A wonderful relaxing experience,50,May 2015,"Just spent two fantastic weeks in Bali being looked after by the very friendly staff at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The facilities were outstanding, the food was exceptional and all the staff were polite, friendly and went out of their way to assist in any way they could and make my stay as flourless as possible. I can't wait to go back again, thanks to everyone at The Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

All facilities were exceptional and I would definitely recommend The Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort to anyone!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2524,"Fantastic location, amazing service, beautiful hotel",50,May 2015,"This is an amazing hotel. The location was perfect, everywhere we wanted to go in Seminyak was within walking distance. The service was great - nothing to fault at all. We stayed on the garden side which was the less expensive rooms but felt like we got the best of both worlds, where we were able to go over to the populated pool when we wanted or use the more private pool on the garden side when we wanted something quieter. Could not have been happier with our choice of hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2525,Seminyak holiday,40,May 2015,"Great hotel and great service, only let down was the wifi kept dropping out and wasn't too flash- fix up that and it would be great! The hotel is in a really good location and the staff are very friendly!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2526,Perfect for a relaxing escape,50,May 2015,"Exceptional staff, great facilities and location on a beautiful section of the Seminyak beach with good waves. Rooms are modern clean and upmarket. Breakfast was fantastic. Loved our stay here. Within walking distance of shops and restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2527,post wedding holiday,40,May 2015,"A lovely hotel right on the beach with friendly and helpful staff.
However its obviously at a point where it will need to make some changes to keep up
with the competition.
Breakfast was excellent served in a open air restaurant which would be better situated either in the garden area or nearer the beach.
Afternoon tea was available in a rather unappealing lounge area which unfortunately was just a space off the lobby and unattractive. there was a little seating outside on a small balcony right by the main gate which was continually opening & closing.
We had one evening meal in the restaurant which was fine but we were the only couple there so a bit lonely !! It has a problem competing with the many fine restaurants in the town.
There was a small cocktail bar by the beach which offered a small restaurant also with lovely views in the evening but once again quiet and needs better advertising.
We enjoyed our stay and hope they can improve some areas.
One last tip if you pay the hotel bill with US Dollars the conversion rate is better than the 'cash' rate and very competitive with the rates in the town.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2528,Luxury hotel in good location,50,May 2015,"This is a lovely hotel in a quieter part of the beach resort area just north of Kuta. There is a good choice of cafes, restaurants and shops on your doorstep so no need to eat at the hotel, which typically is expensive compared to what you can pay locally.
We booked a garden room which is in a block across the road from the main hotel, but this is not a problem unless you intend to use the spa facilities or spend lots of time on the beach, neither of which we did. There is a smaller swimming pool on this block which was nice and quiet. Our room was lovely and spacious and well equipped.
Hotel staff were all brilliant - polite, helpful and always smiling.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2529,Even better this year!!,50,May 2015,"This is our 4th stay at the hotel - we come for a month! It has become our home from home in Bali! The wonderful staff welcome us as family and under the guidance of the charming Portugese GM this hotel will go from strength to strength - she has vast experience and knows just how to steer the ship! New F & B manager too with many exciting ideas in that department too!
Never tire from lying by the pool here! Every day brings a different scene as the tides and the residents change! The pool staff are just so nice and can't do enough to help sort your pitch poolside! The service there has also improved and iced water, cold towels and snack delivery is much more efficient!
The sunsets from the Sanje lounge here are fantastic - also great spot for lunch or dinner...
We will see you all next year for sure and thank everyone here at The Seminyak for making our visit such a fantastic experience AGAIN!! Good luck to you all !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2530,Incredible,50,May 2015,"We stayed in the 1 bedroom villa with an ocean view, I can honestly say that this is the nicest room I have ever stayed in, bearing in mind I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore 3 days prior to visiting this. The private pool was amazing with the beach just a few metres away, as well as the mini bar restocked daily.
The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive.
Me and my partner also had a back, neck, shoulder and foot massage which I would definitely recommend.
Overall, a wonderful stay and want to go back already!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2531,Fantastic stay,50,May 2015,Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff. My wife and I had our honeymoon and stayed for 11 nights and loved every second of it! Beautiful location and very clean. Food was good but not wonderful but it is close to some amazing places to eat and I understand that they are in the process of updating the menu. Great Hotel which we highly recommend!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2532,excellent location,50,May 2015,"We visited the hotel on our honeymoon. . The location was very good a lot of shopping is nearby as well as great restaurants and bars and the cleanliness of the hotel
We really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2533,"a bit pricey, but the close proximity to the beach makes it worth it..",40,April 2015,"My husband and I wanted to have a babymoon, some alone time before our baby arrived. We decided to choose this hotel because of the close proximity to the beach, even though it's a bit pricey. We booked the suite ocean view room for this trip.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with flowers, welcome drinks and cold towel. To my disappointment, our room was not ready, even though it was already around 2.30 pm. We had to wait about 30 minutes in the lounge. The receptionist showed us around the hotel, and we get to see the infinity pool, which was also one of the reasons we chose this hotel.

FYI the hotel has an open space concept, so don't expect air conditioner in the reception or dining area. Oddly the restroom near the lobby has aircon, so if you feel like cooling down you can go there. :p

Our room was situated in the 3rd floor. It was as expected, spacious, comfy bed and pillows, with big bathroom and a jacuzzi. We also get complimentary TWG tea, which was a nice surprise.

However after a few minutes inside, we noticed that the room was not really sound proof. We could hear the sounds from the parking lot, which was a bit of a nuisance because the parking guy really liked to blow his whistle. Good thing that the bed is at the far end of the room, and if we turn on the TV or open the door to the balcony, it will mask the noises from street.

The view from the balcony was beautiful, but you can't really clearly see the sunset from the room. You will have to go to the pool area to have the best view.

The best thing for me about this hotel is the infinity pool which has a lovely lovely lovely view, and the almost private beach. Some passerby will occasionally walk along the beach, but it's pretty much reserved for the hotel guests.

The breakfast was OK for me. I was expecting more selections though.

Majority of the staff are fluent in english, and they are very friendly and helpful.

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2534,Can not recommend highly enough!,50,May 2015,"Just spent 6 nights here with my partner and it was amazing!
The staff go above and beyond to assist.
Did not eat in the restaurant as Seminyak has so many great spots to eat.
Stay here if only to watch the sunset from the infinity pool. So beautiful!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2535,Always great,50,May 2015,We have stayed at The Seminyak Resort and Spa twice now and have always had a wonderful experience. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is always fantastic and anything you want they will supply for you. Lia is great as Guests Services and we would like to thank her and her amazing team for such a wonderful stay. The villas is a must if you can get at a good price!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2536,One of the best in Seminyak!,50,May 2015,"This was my first stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and having stayed at several of Bali's top resorts over the years I can say that the hotel did not disappoint in any way. The rooms are beautiful with great views of the beach, amazingly comfortable beds, spacious with great light and very luxurious bathrooms. The pool sits right on the beach and is very large, with a huge deck area. The food is great with a wonderful selection and impeccable service, of course. Worth every dollar spent!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2537,MUST READ!!-ABSOLUTELY AMAZING/STUNNING RESORT!! PARADISE!!!!,50,May 2015,"I cannot express in words how wonderful this hotel and this country is!! From the moment of arrival from the airport-to check in-right to the end of our stay-has been nothing but 5* treatment.

The staff are incredibly friendly and extremely helpful- Always with a smile. Miss SwanDewi went above and beyond to ensure we were welcomed and well looked after the whole trip as well as everyone in the team- so a BIG thankyou to Miss Swandewi :) she made this trip even more special if that was even possible!!! Thankyou to David for his nightlife advise- thankyou to Retno and all the guest services team for her help in organising my surprise engagement- and Lilyan for all her welcoming advise. Chatur was also extremely helpful and went out of his way for us to give us a lift to the restaurants!!

AMAZING. THIS PLACE IS FLAWLESS- I CAN ONLY SING ITS PRAISES. Please to anyone who is reading this- its a MUST VISIT- i can only express its heavenly VIP treatment to all its guests.
Breakfast is luxurious, the beach staff were so hospitable, you honestly get treated like a princess.
I would not hesitate to return.

The rooms are extremely beautiful and cleaned twice a day!!
Hotel is very tidy- as well as the beach- stunning views.

As per the food outside- lets put it this way- its better than any Michelin star restaurant by the top chefs in LONDON- and we've been to alot. The staff recommend amazing places to eat- so you needn't worry they arrange everything for you- you will be in good hands- they all know exactly what they're talking about.
Again BIG thankyou to everyone in the hotel- you will be missed. The culture is beautiful- and the temples are a must see. Everyone embraces the Hindu culture here- its admirable. We love BALI!!!

AN UNFORGETTABLE WEEK.
Love to all.

2538,wonderful stay,50,May 2015,"Wonderful property and I can't say enough about the staff. They were all extremely courteous and helpful. Always had a smile on their face and would go out of their way to help you. The grounds, pool, and beach were amazing as well.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2539,Balinese Gem,50,May 2015,"The rooms at the Oberoi were booked so I opted to stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort. The Seminyak's hotel rates were reasonable ($300) compared with other five star hotels located on the beach at nearly twice the price. The hotel rate included breakfast for three of us. I had read reviews of the hotel but was uncertain about whether it was truly a luxury property. The minute we pulled into the gated hotel, my doubts were erased. We were greeted by the most gracious hosts, given hand towels and a refreshing drink, as well as accompanied to our spectacular room where the hotel staff showed us how to operate everything. The room was large (must have been about 25' long), modern yet contained beautiful Balinese wood and art elements throughout. The bathroom ran the full length of the room with a jacuzzi bath looking out toward the ocean, The location of the hotel was perfect, right next door to the famous Ku De Ta beach club and restaurant where Seminyak's fashionable Eat Street starts. The infinity pool was large and overlooked the beach, the grounds were tropical and beautifully maintained, and the open air dining room was spacious. The breakfast was elegant and contained a spectacular spread of local delicacies as well as Japanese, Western, and Indonesian fare. Each morning a tropical fruit is highlighted and showcased in baked goods, desserts, yogurts, and other treats. The hotel has fun on-site activities such as fruit carving and festival decorations, as well as afternoon treats. The spa and fitness facilities are small but the beautiful grounds (where weddings often take place) more than make up for it.
What complimented this beautiful hotel was the service by each of the hotel staff, who greeted us throughout the day. After awhile you couldn't help but succumb to Balinese charms and smile, bow, clasp your hands together, and nod your head toward all the Seminyak hotel staff.
It was one of the most beautiful and memorable hotels of our 3-week Southeast Asian trip. If I had known how nice this hotel was, we would have definitely stayed longer!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2540,Super luxe in perfect setting,50,May 2015,"I chose this hotel for our last night in Bali, to be close to the airport and dust off after the tour of the island. What a mistake to have left just 1 night in this lovely hotel! But at least I know where to return...

Everything, to the tiniest level of detail, is beautifully decorated and thought out - from the room decoration and equipment to dvd rentals (great for kids). My BEST EVER hotel breakfast as well. The grounds, even if not huge in size, and the swimming pool are exquisite. Seeing the sunset beside the infinity pool is really something special.

Fine service, as everywhere in Bali, but again with that top notch difference that just makes you wish to come back for more. As we stayed just one day didn't even want to go out and explore surroundings, but everything seemed to be close by.

Congrats for this Resort!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2541,As good as the first time,50,April 2015,"I've stayed here before and it was great. This time my husband got us a suite on the 3rd floor with a view of the ocean. The room was twice the size of the basic room downstairs and it had a spa with TV on the wall in the spa.
As per last time, there was an abundance of drinking water and constant fresh towels.
The breakfast was just as good, and if you are like me and love to read the morning paper, you are in luck. We got the Melbourne herald sun.
I would stay here again and again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2542,Week away with husband,50,May 2015,"Totally loved this resort. Fabulous location,great pool .staff were very friendly helpful. Bed was perfect same with bathroom.

2543,Beautiful pool and grounds and amazing staff .,50,May 2015,"I have just returned from a 10 day stay at this resort with 6 women celebrating their 50th birthdays . The resort is beautiful a perfect choice to relax and enjoy your holiday with the amazing infinity pool over looking the beach , luscious grounds and relaxing spa . We stayed in a beach side room which i definetly recomend as the gardern rooms are outside the resort over the road. Our room was large and comfortable lovely king bed and nice amenities with a filtered water veiw over looking the beautiful grounds..
The staff especially are wonderful every corner you turn you are greeted by welcoming and friendly staff whom are always ready to help or give you a warm smile. All the staff should be congradulated for delivering such a high level of service .

2544,Could Bali believe it,50,April 2015,"We were lucky enough to stay here on the first leg of our honeymoon in Bali. We were also lucky enough to get upgraded to a pool villa next to the beach. The room was incredible and we couldn't have been happier with the accommodations.
The hotel is beautiful, not too big, and it has a relaxed atmosphere. I can‚Äôt say enough about the staff, they were so welcoming and helpful. The main pool was quiet and overlooks the beach and there is another pool with a pool bar and some cabanas which was perfect for some cocktails during the day. We had one dinner at the hotel overlooking the beach at sunset. The food was very, very good, and the view was better.
One of the huge +‚Äôs about the hotel is the location. Having never been to Bali we didn‚Äôt know what to expect but Seminyak was perfect for us. Right outside of the hotel there are endless shops, bars and restaurants. We spent a lot of time just exploring the town and sampling the restaurants and bars.
If we ever get the chance to come back to Bali we will definitely return. Great hotel all around.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2545,Amazing Pool & service,50,March 2015,"The was our second time in Seminyak Beach & Resort Spa. I booked the room on the beach side. We stayed from March 19 - March 22, for a total of 3 nights. The entire experience was amazing. The food, service, the cleanliness. We completely loved the hotel. The pool ofcourse was the best thing about the hotel. The location also of the hotel was good, within a walking distance to Kuta Square. The staff and manager was very nice and helpful. Next time i am in Bali. I would definitely stay in the same hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2546,Honeymoon Heaven,50,March 2015,"From the minute we were picked up at the airport, the staff at The Seminyak were kind, friendly and very accommodating. We were on our honeymoon and not only were we offered a room upgrade, we often returned to our room to find flowers, chocolates or cakes. We were looked after extremely well by everyone but in particular by Rupa and Demi. Everyone remembered our names from the first day. The location of this hotel is convenient, with many restaurants, shops and massage places within walking distance. Taxis are in abundance so getting to Kuta is easy and cheap. Breakfast is varied and delicious with both buffet and ala carte options. Try the waffles with melted marshmallows and nutella. Yum! This truly is a beautifully maintained hotel, with immaculate gardens, cabanas and infinity pools that look out onto the beach. Our room was large and tastefully appointed. Unlike many hotels, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The swim up bar is expensive for Bali but the food and drinks are tasty and it is a fun novelty to enjoy. We would certainly recommend this hotel to travellers wanting a luxurious getaway.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2547,Another world,50,May 2015,"I stayed here for five days for a conference in May and this resort is out of this world. The service was exceptional, the accommodation luxurious and the ambience exotic. There are several restaurants and bars, all of which provided really great drinks and cuisine. The beach and pools make this a wonderful getaway break.

Can't wait to return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2548,Amazing last minute visit,50,May 2015,"My 2 girlfriends and I are on yoga teacher training and get 3 days off. We decided after finishing class at noon, to head to Seminyak. Our only criteria was luxury and an infinity pool. We quickly booked and within an hour were at the hotel. From the second we arrived, we were greeted with so much hospitality. We got to take a look at a couple rooms and upgraded to an ocean view. Within seconds of checking in, we had a beautiful second bed brought in, linens and our bags in our room. The day at the pool was incredible and the service truly wonderful. The guest services staff learned our names and consistently did so many ""little things"" to ensure we were happy (ie. charging phones, making reservations, tips on shopping, splitting final payment bills, telling us where to get the best chocolate!)

The morning buffet was out of this world and as one with a gluten free allergy I was so excited to have options :). Although we could not get a late check out, our bags were graciously held allowing us to get another full day at the pool before we got driven to dinner by the shuttle.

Truly, from beginning to end, this was a hotel that clearly has employees who love their jobs and go out of their way to ensure every guest has a great time. i was so impressed that I have changed travel plans at another hotel... to try and get back to this hotel in 2 weeks time to spend another 2 nights.

Terima Kasih to the staff.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2549,Fantastic Villa,50,May 2015,"Can't beat the location. It's right where you want to be. My wife and I went at the very beginning of May and we almost felt like we had that section of the beach to ourselves, but it's a very short walk in either direction if you want some action. The grounds of the resort are impeccable, and the native charm and kindness from the staff was warm and welcoming. I was absolutely in love with my Villa #1106. I will be staying here again within the year. Highly recomended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2553,Best Hotel I've ever stayed at,50,April 2015,"this hotel was recommended to me by family and I wasn't thrilled about staying in Seminyak. I had wanted to stay in a less developed area... With that said, I couldn't have been happier with the location, the hotel, and the service. I (we, my mother and I) only stay in Bali for 4 days and had lots of site seeing to do. Staying in Seminyak really helped to cut down on driving time and it gave us the opportunity to see more things than I even planned on. All the lists, blogs, etc. I read said the beaches in south Kuta were better.... And honestly, I disagree! Seminyak's beaches were excellent and convenient to food, bars, etc. As for the hotel, the service was impeccable. The room perfect. And the size of the resort was great. We visited other larger hotels on out trip and I couldn't wait to get back 'home' to the Seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2554,Beautiful as always!,50,April 2015,"I stayed here end of April 2015 with 2 girlfriends & we loved it! I've stayed here many times & always love it! We stayed in their building across the road which was perfect, the room was amazing, the service excellent, breakfast omg fabulous, the grounds of this resort are gorgeous, there is something for everyone, the fact that it's right on the beach is flawless, the pool is amazing...overall we loved our stay & can't wait to get back here again! The location is perfect, 2 doors up from Ku De Ta, we walked to the main street of restaurants & shops.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2555,Great service and a great location,40,April 2015,"I chose the hotel because of its central Semenyak location close to Ku De Ta, Semenyak square. The shopping and restaurants in the area are fantastic and the hotel is in the middle of it with a nice beachfront. The service is wonderful and welcoming without being overbearing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2556,Our Bali trip,50,April 2015,The Seminyak Beach Resort was fabulous. We stayed in one of the rooms over the road and enjoyed it so much that we didn't often go to the main resort except for breakfast. The breakfast was first class - fresh and with so much to choose from. The staff also wonderful with many even remembering our names. My husband and I will definitely be back next trip to Bali.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2557,Lovely hotel,40,May 2015,"We stayed in a room across the road as it was a lot cheaper, 2-mins walk from the main reception area.

The rooms were lovely, and essentially the area is like a mini hotel in itself with pool and bar in the same location.

The main hotel is very large and looks like it hosts weddings and conferences quite a bit but nice pool area next to the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2558,Nice beach hotel,40,January 2015,"I stayed one romantic week at the Seminyak Beach Resort with my girl-friend and I was very pleased with both the decor and the service. It's a mixture of Balinese decor and modern architecture. The rooms are actually quite big and the bathroom had a nice Jacuzzi (which unfortunately smelled badly once turned on). The breakfast buffet was okay, but if you are used to Indonesian food, you'd wish it would be more spicy. There were classic Balinese dance events several days a week, which I didn't attend simply because they were way too expensive. The pool was big and very nice, especially as there was a lot of waste laying on the beach, which made swimming in the sea quite annoying. The staff, as you would expect, was always friendly and helpful. If you like going out to bars, Seminyak is the right place to go, but if you look for culture and the true Bali feeling, Ubud is the place to go. All in all a very nice stay and I give my honest recommendation to all of you who are looking for an affordable 5-star-resort in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2559,Proper value,50,May 2015,"The staff was excellent, the resort was relaxing and really nothing for me to complain about and I do complain a lot. We haven't tried the restaurant but the room service for food was very good as well. Price/Value definitely is on the upside on the value.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2560,Friendly and beautiful,50,April 2015,"A girlfriend and I decided to stay as we were attending a wedding at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa on the Saturday. We stayed for a full 10 days and completely made ourselves at home and were very pleased with our selection. The rooms are spacious and the beds are super comfortable. The turn down service and room service are excellent, everything is super clean and new.
We are not exactly the buffet type but enjoyed the huge selection and there was definitely variety each day and also the option to order a la carte meant we could have our particular orders as well. We spent a lot of time by the pool which faces directly on to the ocean and the wedding we attended was just spectacular. The service was simple, happy and beautiful and we all had cocktails as they took wedding pics with the sun setting behind them. The loveliest thing about our stay was however the staff. They are super friendly, always smiling and always willing to help. I actually had a big night and lost my handbag with phone, sunglasses and watch inside...two of the staff Ogi and Wyan took me on a 2hr round trip to the police station for foreigners and helped me make a report so I could claim it on insurance. The guys were just lovely and really looked out for me I appreciated this immensely. We highly recommend this beautiful resort and will be back again next year!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2561,Seminyak beach resort and spa,50,April 2015,Fantastic hotel. Very friendly staff. Would definately stay here again. We originally booked a garden view room but we didn't like that these rooms were say from the main hotel so we asked to move to a beach view room. The staff were very accommodating and were more than happy to move us.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2562,Great Decor,50,April 2015,"The villas are very tastefully done. The views are amazing. The restaurant and the bar are sub par and the beach is probably not the best in the area, but the rooms are so comfortable, the beds are heavenly. It's a great hub to explore the gilis.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2563,Excellent stay,50,April 2015,"I stayed for 4 days in April with my boyfriend. We had a wonderful stay. The room was great, we stayed on the beach wing, and the service was excellent! Would definitely stay here again. Worth the $$$ and the breakfast had a good selection.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2564,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,April 2015,"Great accommodation that was a stone throw away from the beach. I had my daughter with us and the staff were amazing with her. We also received a birthday cake for my wife at breakfast. The place was clean and well presented and maintained and the staff were amazing. The food was delicious. The only negative if any, is you pay for what you get, so it is a litlle pricy but you will love it here. Manny and Julie",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2565,"Beautiful, centrally located hotel",40,May 2015,"Gorgeous pool area (one of the nicest I've ever seen), wonderful staff, and nicely appointed rooms. The breakfast buffet was delicious - I think the restaurant is technically also open for lunch and dinner though it was pretty quiet - but there are plenty of alternatives in town, which is a short 5-10 minutes from the hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2566,Fab location,40,May 2015,"Warmest greetings! 4 th time stay ! Extremely professional and curttiius , beautiful pool , directly on the beach .
The breakfast just keep getting better ! Will be back .
Famous bars at your door step , kudeta",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2567,Absolutely very fantastic hotel,50,April 2015,"Good location, garden, swimming pool. The Suite Ocean View is very nice and cosy.The staff are very attentive and friendly, and the service is excellent.
My only limitation is the breakfast or dinner is limited for a longer stay.
Thanks for having us!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2568,5 star accomodation,40,May 2015,"My husband & I stayed here for our last 2 nights of a 12 night Bali trip. Very luxurious, comfortable bed, huge room, beautiful bathroom.
Beautiful gardens & pools. Amazing breakfast & very friendly staff.
You get what you pay for.
Great position in Seminyak
Can't fault the hotel at all but to be honest I probably would not stay here again. Not a true ""Bali feel""",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2569,Great location - you get what you pay for,40,April 2015,We spent three nights in one of the standard rooms which are actually located across the road from the main part of the hotel. This was the only set back for us. Otherwise this hotel was excellent. Exactly what you'd expect for the higher price. The location in Seminyak is fantastic - right next door to Ku De Ta and about a 5 - 10 min walk into the heart of town. The infinity pool is lovely however the cocktails are really pricey.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2570,Awesome place,50,April 2015,"What a great resort, fantastic pool, excellent location, amazingly friendly and helpful staff and an awesome room.
We stayed in an Ocean view suite and high expectations and the room certainly didn't disappoint. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful in every way probably the friendliest resort/hotel staff I've ever experienced.
Next time I'm back in Bali I won't even bother looking at other hotels, I'll be back at the Seminyak Beach Resort for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2571,Resort Feel,40,April 2015,"We stayed in Seminyak Beach resorts for 2 nights to Round out our trip that was mostly private villa experience. The service at the Seminyak was outstanding, from check in to check out. The grounds were beautiful and the pool was extremely relaxing. Views even from a non ocean view room, you could still see part of the ocean. All in all the hotel was a great experience. I found the rooms very clean spacious and new and I love when a hotel room has a walk in closet, to store your luggage. Breakfast was a mix between menu and buffet and most were very good. My only complaint was our room often had a strange smell and our shower water never really got hot. Room 2201. We took an upgrade for a jacuzzi room that was fabulous, but the jacuzzi is filled by a small tap and took nearly 2 + hours to fill. Close to many good places to eat and go out.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2572,Not our thing....,30,February 2015,"Although this hotel was very clean and beautifully presented... We felt it had no atmosphere. Our room, the service and breakfast were once again all great and the location also...but all in all very stark and boring at night which is just as well you are near ku de ta and potato head - which are both well worth going to for their original style cocktails! If you want a hotel with chatacter and a heart do not pick this one :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2573,"Excellent hotel, best I have ever stayed in.",50,January 2015,"We are fortunate to have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, and the Seminyak is well up there with them, and even better than some, but at a much more realistic price so value for money it wins hands down.

We travelled in January - the only downside was all the rubbish on the beach due to certain currents but the staff tried to clear as much as possible every day.. no drama though the pool area was impeccable and you didnt need to go on the beach at all - just look at it from your pool side sun lounger.

The room was HUGE, the hot tub overlooking the beach an amazing treat and the staff and service was impeccable. The food was delicious. The location perfect and genuinely we couldn't fault a thing

If you are travelling to Bali I highly highly recommend staying in this really luxurious amazing hotel",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2574,Ticks all the boxes,50,April 2015,We had a wonderful girls week at this beautiful resort. The staff were so helpful and friendly and the rooms were spacious and luxurious. We loved it so much that we plan to return with our daughters.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2575,An Exquisite Beach Resort,50,April 2015,"I travelled to Bali, Indonesia on April 10, 2015 until April 22, 2015. Having arrived to Bali we stayed at The Seminyak Bach Resort and Spa for 3 nights. I would have to say this hotel is extremely beautiful and well kept. We truly enjoyed this resort.

We stayed in room #3208 which was on the beach wing. We woke up everyday with an ocean view. It was truly amazing.

The room:

Our room was amazing, spacious, clean, contemporary, relaxing, modern, just heavenly. I loved the dark wood floor, the big comfortable white linen bed, the decor in the room was absolutely amazing such as the wood decor over mirror piece hanging above the bed. I love the little touches such as an orchid plant and fresh fruit everyday. There was a hung flat screen tv with a variety of channels to select from when you want to just relax in the room. The bedding was beautiful with clean white sheets and damask print. The patio was spacious with 2 chairs and a table when you want to hang out and take in the scenery. We also had plenty of water bottles supplied to us compliments of the resort.

The Bathroom:

Was clean and spacious, there was a huge stand alone bath tub and standup shower. The bathroom was very modern and contemporary. This would have to be my 2nd favorite bathroom after the W Hotel's Bathroom.

Property:

Situated right on the beach you cannot beat the view. The property is well maintained and care for. There are a lot of lounge cabanas to hang out in. There is also a pond that is in the center of the resort which was very lovely. We usually took a stroll through the property after breakfast.

The Pools:

The main pool was absolutely stunning, it is an infinity pool that overlooks the ocean. There are plenty of lounge chairs to soak in the sun. There is also another pool that features a swim up bar and also has plenty of lounge cabana decks to lay out on.

The Restaurants:

Loved the food that was served to us on the property. We didn't select the breakfast plan with our rooms however we ate twice at the breakfast buffet. It amounted to be $25USD per person which wasn't bad, because the breakfast selection was amazing! So many delightful food from Western to Balinese food were served. You can choose from Omelettes to Waffles and Pancakes. A ton of fresh fruits and fruit drinks. So many delightful pastries and delicious baked goods. The authentic Balinese food was delicious as well. In addition to the breakfast we did have lunch at the restaurant located next to the beach. The food was amazing, I had the seafood fried rice and my fiancee had a burger and margarita pizza all of which was delicious.

The Staff:

Amazingly awesome! They are all so nice and helpful. We truly felt welcome and they were all so eager to help. Everyone was so happy and friendly. Thank you for making our stay at The Seminyak Hotel that much more memorable.

I truly adore this hotel, the location is breath-taking, the rooms are immaculate, the staff are wonderful. If you come to Bali and are staying in Seminyak this resort is a must. We will definitely return to this hotel in the future. I definitely recommend this hotel!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2576,Paradise!,50,April 2015,"We have just had the most amazing stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. We stayed in a Room across the street in the Garden Wing which did not bother us at all as it is only a minute away from the main building, and even has its own little pool and pool bar. The hotel and the rooms are beautiful, and the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The infinity pool is lovely and is right on the beach front. The breakfast is amazing, the buffet has such a huge choice and the menu options are delicious! The stand out aspect of the hotel however, has to be the staff. The staff are the friendliest, most polite and most helpful I have ever come across. Every member of staff smiles and wishes you good morning and could not be more willing to help. The only small negative we have is regarding the showers in the spa, which we used on the last day after we had checked out. The showers are extremely weak and the water comes out in several different directions which meant it was very hard to actually shower. Apart from that we could not fault our stay and never wanted to leave!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2577,Perfect resort,50,April 2015,"This was our second stay at the resort. What we really appreciate is the breakfast, which is absolute perfect. We would come again just to have breafast for 1,5 hours and relaxing. Otherwise, the restaurant is good, the meny is a litle limited for us and there is room for improvement. We stayed in a suit, which is quite spacious and has room enough for an extra bed if needed.
We have seen better pools, but the view towards the ocean is rememberable. The garnen is very well maintained and represents Bali in a good way.
The staff is very friendly, maybe a little to much 'good morning, welcome back' etc for our taste.
We have seen better spaas, more space and better interior design and decorations, buts its there and thats very handy.
We will come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2578,Such Beauty,50,October 2014,"My wife and I stayed around October of last year and was simply fascinated with the Hindu culture of Bali since the rest of Indonesia is Muslim. We felt so safe and the hotel simply has a great beach front. Very imposing in their strong waves so in a more direct way. The beach is great for surfers but if you are not one just walk along the beach and have nice pictures. Stay in the pool for the strong waves might take you to the next island/ country. the food is a gastronomic heaven that every morning is a new experience where a fruit called Snake fruit is very famous but not very tasty. the beachfront rooms are quite expensive but since you can always find time to spend on the beach front, the annex is simply the best cheaper place to stay. It was very pleasant, everyone bowing always. The annex and the main areas have pools. Guests are taken to the annex via golf cart so its really no big deal. The place is very peaceful at night. They usually have a motiff each night in the grand ballroom but those who want to save should go ala carte on the restaurant of the resort. It is also very near the must go restaurant of Kudeta",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2579,overpriced,40,April 2015,"For a once in a lifetime treat we booked the pool villas at $700 aus a night. And while they were very nice, compared to other luxury villas we have stayed in all over Bali, these were very expensive and we were disappointed.
We are trying a few nights here and there in luxury accommodation all over Bali and while these were very nice, we believe they are only worth about $500 aus a night in comparison to where we have stayed before.
The hotel was nice and the staff very friendly. Breakfast seemed disorganised as they never had any tables prepared and we had to ask for menus after about 15 minutes so we could order from the egg menu. Breakfast was nice and seemed all hand cooked although a little limited.
Location was good, right next door to Ku De Ta and a few minutes walk from Seminyak square. When choosing a room i would suggest the beach/garden side as the other rooms look out over the road.
We did eat at the restaurant looking out over the ocean watching the sunset and paid $30 aus for the smallest steak we have ever seen topped by some soggy spinach and lima beans. I wouldnt recommend eating there even tho the view is nice.
All in all it is a nice although a bit small hotel. The grounds were lovely but not as extensive as we thought.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2580,Great location,40,April 2015,"The hotel is in a great location on the beachfront,near many restaurants and shopping. My husband and I spent 2 nights in the beach wing room at the end of our holiday. Unfortunately,on our last night we decided to take our duty free champagne ,near the pool area to watch the sunset. We were told that there is a corkage fee of $20 us plus tax( unsure if this was for the 2 of us or each) . Beware! Very expensive hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2581,Great beachfront location,50,April 2015,"Arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and our room was not ready. Check-in is designated as 2:00pm but I was informed that the room would not be ready until after 2:30pm. I always get a bit annoyed if the rooms aren't ready by the designated check-in because by the time you actually get to the room most of the day has passed. As we were hungry we went to have lunch until we could enter the room.
We got into the room after 3:00pm and our luggage was delivered for us, a welcome fruit basket and water awaiting.
The room is very well appointed and quite spacious. Amenities of a good quality. Bathroom really clean and modern with a separate bath and shower. All room inclusions you would expect from a 5* resort and a DVD player for those rainy Bali days!
Our room in the Garden Wing was at the front of the building and therefore facing the road. Motorbikes frequent the road and I requested a quieter room. The staff were very accommodating and although they were unable to move us on the first night we spent the next four in a room at the rear on the third floor. Still traffic was audible but a lot quieter. The hotel was extremely apologetic and I really appreciated the manner in which they dealt with moving us. Nothing seemed to be a problem when you asked them and they were all so friendly and courteous.
Good breakfast selection and a barista on hand for the coffee!
One complaint which I have of a lot of high end hotels is the cost of their drinks. No ""Happy Hour"" at the main pool here but there is between 6-7pm by the Garden Wing pool! We had one drink there but it was not of a high quality. Ku de Ta is just down the road and if forced to pay AUD15 for a cocktail I'd rather imbibe there!
Overall this is a classy hotel with a great beachfront location. Be prepared to battle the beach vendors near the main pool because of this.
I travel to Bali frequently and as I work in the Travel Industry I tend to stay at different properties each time so can't say if I would stay at the Seminyak again but that would not be a decision made for any negative reason.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2582,Paradise!,50,April 2015,"We were really happy. We got an upgrade to a suite which was lovely. The beach was much cleaner than we expected and we swam in the surf twice a day. The staff were friendly, room was spectacular as were the grounds and service. My only complaint would be that the hot water and water pressure wasn't great. Also prices for food were well above western prices however we ate at many of the the amazing restaurants that were in very close proximity.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2583,Disappointed at the booking agency,20,April 2015,"Just checked into this hotel, one big glitch though:

When we booked our room through agoda it said ""separate building"" turns out this meant across the road. We got offered two rooms in this building, one on the first floor looking straight into a wall, the other in the 2nd floor which faces the road and you can't really open the balcony door as there is much noise from the road. The Internet on this side is also quite bad (cannot comment on the quality on the main side). This was quite disappointing since we just payed the same amount for a beautiful room in Marina Bay Sands in Singapore

On the positive side the check in was great and the staff was super friendly. It is not the staff or Hotels fault that agoda did not specify the details of the room location.
The main building is also very beautiful, which was what we saw in the pictures and decided to book here (there were no pictures of this side of the road st agodas site) . They offered us upgrade to the main side for around 20% of added price, but I feel that we already are paying much to justify the upgrade

Our recommendation is that if you wish to stay here make sure you stay on the main (beach side) of the road, as we got an unpleasant start for our Bali holiday.

Will update this with food and aditional information once we tried it. Again let me emphasise that my frustration is with the booking agent and not the Hotel",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2584,AMAZING,50,March 2015,"Beautiful place, quiet, private, serene, by the beach, the most well maintained gardens, amazing view restaurant by the beach, very good breakfast, beautiful people and service, excellent for a good value( specialy with an unexpected upgrade :)
Made our honeymoon :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2585,Lovely hotel but expensive especially,30,April 2015,"We had a one night's stay at the Seminyak at the end of our Bali holiday. The hotel is in a great location and the staff are lovely. The downside was the fact that I saw several people arrive and pay a nominal day rate to use the pool and outdoor facilities (100,000Rp or 8 USD, I think) I was quite disappointed. The people seemed very nice but our room cost $300per night and although the rooms are great and the breakfast delicious the main thing I think you are paying for is the outdoor facilities, so to hear you can enjoy all of that for a nominal amount made me feel a bit short changed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2586,Excellent Resort!,50,April 2015,Hotel and grounds are absolutely amazing! Infinity pool is one of the best in Bali with comfortable water temperature and staff to make your day enjoyable. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and friendly staff to assist with egg or pancake orders. Great central location in Seminyak for easy access to additional bars and restaurants. Well done!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2587,Wonderful,50,April 2015,Great resort. We were in a room across the road from the rest of the resort and that didn't matter at all. The room was so nice and its a quick walk over the road to the rest of the resort and the staff on the gates pretty much stop traffic for you. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool area was amazing. Great location and close walk to many restaurants near by. Highly recommend.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2588,Amazing stay at the Seminyak beach resort!,50,April 2015,"We could not have been greeted by a kinder and more attentive staff at the Seminyak! Although are stay was short, only two nights, we found the service to be top notch. This was undeniably one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in! The resort offered beautiful views, wonderful staff, and activities (not to mention their delcious brunch). Will definitely be visiting the Seminyak on our next trip to Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2589,AMAZING!,40,March 2015,"Perfect place for a wedding. Friendly and nice staff. Clean. This place was wonderful. It took some time to order food and drinks from the pool bar, but beside that this was awsome. Yes i would recommend it :O)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2590,Ida & Murray's Wedding,50,April 2015,Absolutely amazing resort 5 star accommodation and service for all the wedding party throughout our entire five day stay. Staff were amazing so respectful such a pleasure to be greeted everyday with a warm cheerful smile just a joy to be surrounded in a beautiful tranquil setting full of beautiful love and wonderful people. I have recommended this hotel to everyone I know it made the wedding even more special. Excellent is an understatement this hotel is amazing above anywhere I have stayed before so much so that my partner and I are going back in July.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2591,Wonderful,50,March 2015,"Everything was perfect, the room was big and really clean, all new. We had a beautiful view on the ocean and the garden. The staff is very very nice and warming.
The small gym room is well equipped, the spa is fabulous...
I recommend this place for couple, its very quiet and luxury.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2592,Wonderful Stay,50,March 2015,"My husband and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for 9 nights and we can honestly say that our stay was wonderful. The staff were very welcoming and we were made to feel very special.
Its location is great, as it is walking distance to the main shopping and eating district of Seminyak, But more importantly it is just on the beach. The gardens are what you would expect from a top class resort. The infinity pool is situated perfectly so that you can view the sunset as well as the magnificence of the ocean from your lounge chair.
Our room was beach facing and quite spacious. Definitely worth the extra expense if you can stretch it. Breakfast was very generous and the dinning area perfect for a resort.
The only small comment that i would make is that the restaurant menu could be better for lunch and dinner as it is limited and a little pricey in comparison to the other wonderful restaurants that are close by, but having said that it was not an issue for us. And yes we would definitely stay again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2593,Excellent hotel,50,March 2015,"Excellent hotel with friendly staff, perfect location right on the beach with an amazing pool; would definitely stay here again. Hotel staff were very helpful when it came to arranging day trips out and about, exploring what Bali has to offer.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2594,"Beautiful location,excellent staff",50,March 2015,"I stayed at the Seminyak Resort and Spa for two nights between two flƒ±ghts.I had booked in advance and so had a great deal for a garden room.My room was beautifully appointed with a great balcony and lounging couch,looking at the garden and pool.The pool is fantastic though the water gets a bit hot.Lunch at the pool was great.The beach is on one's doorsteps,great waves and surfing.
The service and staff are wonderful,very courteous and friendly.Each night there was a Balinese show,Legong Dance and the Ramayana which I had seen many times but still enjoy
Seminyak Resort is in the heart of Seminyak village,within walking distance to Seminyak Square,.ƒ∞t is also next to the fantastic beach club.,Ku de Ta.If I go to Bali again,I will never stay anywhere else.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2595,Peaceful luxury,50,March 2015,"We spent the first part of our Bali honeymoon here and it exceeded our expectations. The garden view room in the main part of the resort was spacious and beautifully appointed. We had a suite on the bottom floor so you could access the gardens, pools and beach. We loved both the infinity pool and the daybed/swim-up bar pool. The breakfast was the best I've had anywhere I've travelled! The beach is not the greatest here and sometimes you could see garbage along the shoreline, but they raked it every few days. It didn't matter to us since the pools were so nice.

All the staff were very hospitable, from the groundskeepers, to the guy who sprayed our room for insects, to the front desk people, to the restaurant staff!

Seminyak is a lively place with lots of restaurants, bars and shopping and we were close to the action; however, once you enter the resort, you feel like you are far away from it all!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2596,The Seminyak gets my top vote.,50,April 2015,"My husband & I were in awe with the sheer friendliness of the well trained staff at The Seminyak.

Our room was was full of creature comforts. Amazing bed, curtains that completely shut the light out (I know this sounds minuscule, but the last thing you want on your holiday is to be woken up early by the sunlight). The bathroom is very inviting & the room is modernly finished with a contemporary Balinese fit out.

If that isn't enough, there's s breathtaking infinity pool with ample sun beds & butlers to serve u while you soak up the Rays. Both pools overlook the beach & Indian Ocean & is amazing at sunset. The second pool has a bar in the middle with in-water stools.

The Seminyak gets my top vote.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2597,"very nice resort, great staff just one small but at times big issue",40,March 2015,"friendly helpful staff, lovely resort, spacious and well kept room of a high standard, great location on the beach and close to all Seminyak's facilities. Unfortunately had great difficulty with the internet connection and internet speed. Would have been nice to forget about the outside world completely and not be fussed with internet, but had some work to do whilst on holidays and it made the amount of time spent working far more than it should have been. very unfortunate to have such a small and fixable matter spoil a great resort but would think twice about staying again if I need decent internet.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2598,"Excellent location in Bali, forget Kuta!",50,March 2015,"Location, location! The hotel is right on the beach and steps from the fabulous shops and entertainment venues of Seminyak, where chic meets swank. I was looking for a different place than my previous stay in chaotic and crowded Kuta and I found it in this small (100 rooms) elegant yet unpretentious hotel. I was impressed by the service: EXCELLENT! My garden room was spacious and well organized. The glass window separating the bathroom to the bedroom makes it great for couples (although you can pull the curtain and retreat in privacy). I enjoyed the pool (too bad there were so many guests smoking)!, breakfast was good as it was the restaurant but ‚Äìagain- the service, attentive and constant showed genuine hospitality. A very well managed 4 stars hotel and a bargain for the price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2599,Best place we stayed at!,50,March 2015,"Was a bit shocked to see there were bad reviews for this place given that we couldn't find a single thing wrong with it! Travelled to Bali for the first time and stayed at 5 different 5 star places. Happy to say this was the best one. The rooms are massive with a private secluded outdoor area. The grounds are well maintained and the pool overlooking the beach was the main highlight! Make sure you're there for sunset! Staff are excellent, buffet breakfast was good, and location was prime. Coming back to Bali next year and will stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2600,Fantastic Resort! Wonderful Experience!,50,March 2015,"Beautiful! Perfect oceanfront location with fantastic oceanfront infinity pool. Staff was amazing, gracious and so hospitable. Seminyak location is very convenient to shopping and nightlife. The room was so comfortable--clean and modern. Beautiful bathroom. Delicious breakfast (although breakfast was expensive.). To keep my price down, I booked the room without breakfast included. I paid for the breakfast on days that I wanted to splurge.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2601,"Lovely Resort, great location",40,February 2015,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The staff were friendly and check in was fast and efficient.

Seminyak attracts a different crowd compared to other areas in Bali, eg. Kuta. This was our first stay in Bali and we felt it was a great choice‚Ä¶Guests were respectful and not the classless bogans we sometimes expect to see in Bali.

The Resort is lovely and the gardens and lawns are perfectly manicured. Our beach view room was on the ground floor, making it easily accessible without having to climb stairs. (The villas and beach view rooms are in the main wing on the beach side, whereas the garden view rooms are across the road). This may not sound like a big deal, however if money is not an issue, book the main wing.

The infinity pool is really pretty, as it overlooks the beach - yes the beach was dirty and we did not swim in it, however as I read other reviews, it appears to have cleared up. There is also a swim up bar to the right of the infinity pool. The Resort has gazebos located randomly around the gardens where you can relax;

Security at this Resort is very high, making you feel safe. Staff are very friendly and try their utmost to ensure you have a great stay. House keeping is amazing and didn't only clean your room in the morning‚Ä¶in the evening, when they turned down the sheets, they would clean the room and restock toiletries.

Breakfast is great, with lots of variety, dinner was nice, however it was a little on the pricey side compared to other restaurants, but that's normally the way it goes with hotel prices. The location is perfect for getting around and visiting many of the local restaurants. Ku De Ta is a 2 minute walk and is great for drinks and watching the beach and sunset.

We would highly recommend this Resort to couples and families and would like to thank the staff at The Seminyak Beach Resort for a memorable holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2602,Great Short escape!,50,March 2015,"Me and My husband stayed at this hotel on 28-29 March 2015.
First impression, the staffs were very friendly! The garden was clean and very green that i could really feel the tropical vibes. The welcome drinks also taste really good.
The room was so clean and comfortable. The swimming pool was the best part that we could stayed there from 3 pm to sunsets. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2603,"Avoid the garden wings, across the street",30,March 2015,"Stayed there for 2 nights, from 26th-28th of march. The staff of the hotel very friendly, a bit old or classic design. Got the garden wings building, which i did not like and enjoy. Have to cross the road to go to the main building. Interior of the room a bit old. Mosquitos. Breakfast menu not a lot of choices. However, private beach was nice, room is huge. Overall was okay stay. A little bit overpriced. I can find same price hotels with better facilites.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2604,poor value for money,20,March 2015,"Resort is in a lovely position and the pool area overlooking the beach is just lovely.

The staff are very freindly and on the whole have a good understanding of English and are in the main efficient in their job.

Breakfast buffet is very nice, but that's where the good food ends. There is a verly limited choice of dishes on the al a carte menu and the menu is almost the same in all the outlet offerings.

We ordered chicken satays by the pool and they were very dry and tough. Think they had been pre-cooked and reheated. Several othe dishes we tried whilst edible were not of the standard you would expect for the price.

We were 'upgraded' on arrival from a beach room to a garden view room. Somehow this didn't feel like and upgrade. Think we would have preferred being closer to the beach and pool.

The room was very nice and housekeeping was of a high standard. However in the 5 days that we stayed, we only managed to have 1 luke warm shower, the rest were cold! Could not get the hot water in the shower to work no matter what we tried. The water out of the basin taps was also luke warm at best. This is not something you expect in a supposed 4* hotel.

Overall I think there are better properties for the prices charged.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2605,Really Impressive,50,December 2014,"The place was perfectly relaxing with the beautiful and pleasant view. The room was so clean and comfortable, the bathroom was very awesome. Service was great, the staff were very courteous, approachable and helpful. This place was very well managed by the management, thumbs to you guys.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2606,Great weekend trip!,50,March 2015,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a quick weekend trip from Singapore and we could have not asked for more. The hotel is approximately a 30 min drive away from the airport so it's easy to reach and you don't waste time in the car. The hotel is located right on the beach so you can have a nice walk/swim whenever. The buffet breakfast is good and abundant and you can walk to Seminyak city in about 15 min for more dinner options. The best thing though is the pool just next to the beach which is large, has plenty of sun-chairs and sun all day long. Ultimate relaxation and almost half the price of the Oberoi next door!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2607,Better out there for the price!!,20,March 2015,"Would not recommend this hotel. Staff are pleasant but that's not enough.
No hot showers, after first day room staff failed to replenish tea making facilities and when i tried to call room service no one answered. In house phones appear not to work.
Food was ok but not great:(
Would therefore only rate it a 3 star and feel for the prices charged one could do better elsewhere.
We were told we had been upgraded when we checked in. Went from a beach side room to a garden room. That doesn't feel like an upgrade.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2608,Prefect!,50,March 2015,"We came here mainly for the infinity pool but everything exceeded our expectations!

Breakfast was so amazing here as there are so many delicious options.

And service was fantastic.

Will be returning to this hotel for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2609,Lovely hotel,40,March 2015,"We are h√∏re now, quite good hotel, lovely people .. Allways smiling and helping if there is anything you need. For some People's it's 5 üåü but for us only 4 .... Close to the Beach. If you book the wings room you are on the otter side og the street and have to go here to eat and go to the beach. Good spa. Kindly workers/people.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2611,Perfect soft boiled egg.,30,February 2015,"All i remember about this hotel is, they serve me perfect soft boiled egg on breakfast also attentive staff, since i am on business trip, i have no time to enjoy all facility. over all, i can say that this hotel is nice.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2612,Perfect stay with very accommodating staff!,50,December 2014,"I had a fantastic stay here. Totally relaxing and enjoyable with the very delightful foods they served. I am satisfied with the service of the very friendly and professional staff. The view was amazing, the pool and beach side was relaxing. The ground and room were well polished and clean. Over all stay was excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2613,Very glamorous! !,40,December 2014,"We booked this hotel after our first hotel was awful, we got a flower necklace on arrive, a cool drink and seen to straight away, our room was awesome! Beds ate very very comfortable, amenities were well stocked daily, breakfast.... AMAZING!! Staff were very helpful 24/7 and so friendly! All the pools were very grand, view of the beaches were pretty! !!! Highly recommended",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2614,First class service & resort,50,February 2015,"From the very warm welcome upon arriving, to the farewell upon leaving, the service from all the colleagues at this hotel is unforgettable. Nothing was too much trouble.
Our stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort was planned to be a final relaxing week, after spending five busy weeks & 7 flights, travelling to Hong Kong & down the East coast of Australia.
This turned out to be the perfect venue to relax by the spacious pool & pool area and take in beautiful sea views beyond, before heading home to the UK. The resort grounds are perfectly maintained at all times, the food is excellent, however we usually made the 15 minute walk, in the evenings into town where there are countless affordable restaurants, bars & clubs.
My wife & myself would certainly recommend this hotel & would happily re-book.
Just one recommendation would be to discourage or limit the many hawkers parading along the beach by the pool, this can be annoying.
Also a personal thank you to Redna for providing the freshly cut Aloa Vera to help with our sunburn.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2615,Exceeded expectations,50,March 2015,"I had a hard time deciding where to stay for our first visit to Bali. There are plenty of private villas for rent, but that meant a sense of seclusion we weren't looking for. There are higher priced resorts which are beautiful, and more than twice the price. I'm glad we chose the Seminyak Resort and Spa. The grounds are beautiful, with many options for lounging. The service was professional and courteous. The daily breakfast had many eastern and western options. Lastly, the location is great. Close to Potato Head and within walking distance to Ku De Ta and other resorts/restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2616,Fantastic,50,March 2015,"This is the nicest hotel I have stayed at, the room was absolutely amazing (ocean suite) and I almost didn't want to leave it each day. the ocean views were outstanding and being able to look out to the ocean from your bed and or Jacuzzi/ shower was a great touch.

The aesthetics of the hotel are outstanding, the walk down to the pool is great and the pool is enormous. I also liked that you were front row on the beach and looked out to the ocean.

I want to make a special mention of the guest relations staff, they were outstanding and so friendly and made us feel welcome form the second we arrived.

The breakfast buffet is amazing and I looked forward to breakfast each morning.

we were lucky as we got a cheap deal on the room, otherwise this would normally be out of my price range. I would definitely stay again at the same price.

Overall, I want a message from Luke and Jasmine passed on to the staff to thank them for making it such a great experience and making us feel welcome. Can't wait to hopefully stay here again on my next trip :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2617,"Great property, a little noisy",40,February 2015,"The property is as described and in photos. The beach frontage is great and the pool was super relaxing. Wish I had stayed in the hotel more but there are so many things to do in Bali.

Breakfast would be a draw for many people. The selection is great, and although some of the dishes were just ok, for a hotel breakfast buffet, I would say, they did a great job. Can't speak to the dinners/lunches there as I did not stay in the hotel to eat past breakfast.

The staff are extremely hospitable and kind. Although they were unable to accommodate for late check out, they let me lounge at the pool and then shower and change in a room which they provided afterwards. I thought this was a GREAT service for people who had late flights out of DPS.

Pros: Beach view, great infiniti pool, excellent service with accommodating staff, fantastic selection at breakfast with both local and western choices, unbeatable location

Cons: A little noisy if you are in the beach wing (motorcycle parking and street is right beneath you, if you are a light sleeper(I am not) it could be tough)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2618,"Great location and wonderful staff, amenities can be further improved",40,February 2015,"For the price charged by this resort, I feel more can be offered. Value for money not quite there although was a relaxing stay. Their nearby competitors offer better value for $$s. The pluses are the location and the lovely staff. My suggestions would be to make use of the ocean views for all guests and hold the breakfast in the restaurant area. There are way better dinner options in the area and the restaurant is seldom visited by guests otherwise. Maybe include the option of hammocks in the garden areas and would have loved a day bed on the bakcony of the suite we stayed in rather than those stiff uncomfortable chairs.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2619,Beautiful Balinese Villa but with a few Problems,40,December 2014,"The hotel was nearly empty, they did say more guests were arriving but we didn't see any, so we expected to be treated better. The villa was divine with the lap pools, day bed & comfort, towels changed about 3 times a day, the mini bar was free but not refilled properly eg teabags & peanuts. The breakfast very good but so slow (with not many guests thought the service (eg coffee at the table) could have been quicker, not 15 minutes plus & having to ask. Also each morning there were children running around, so much noise & one little girl had her ipad so loud we couldn't think or talk. I like kids but these parents?? We tried a few meals at the restaurant & found the food very disappointing, no wonder they were empty. The pools & the gardens were beautiful & well kept, right on the beach front. The staff at reception were very helpful & the staff at the foyer etc. Apart from the boring & not very inspired meals in the restaurant the restaurant staff had the poorest English I have encountered in Bali, it's such a shame for a lovely resort. The last few nights at the Villa we had problems with the lights outside, one didn't have a bulb and the electricans couldn't fix them. then they wanted to go through the roof & we said don't as we were leaving the next day.Two days without lights at night, they didn't offer anything & we didn't ask to be moved because it would be too much trouble. I would not recommend & would not stay again, very expensive but wish we had stayed at the Oberoi where we stayed a few years ago (now they do know how to make a cocktail!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2620,A resort with great location and great service,50,February 2015,"From the very first I entered the resort, I already feel welcome. The staff smile is genuine. As they have access to the beach, we can just enjoy the sunset by the pool. The variety of the breakfast menus is also great and most of all, all the staff is very friendly and very helpful",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2621,Again and again we will visit,50,February 2015,"Flights were changed so had an extra night in Bali. We decided to stay here as we have walked past many times and we were very impressed!!!!!!
We originally booked the Garden pool villa online, once booked we were automatically upgraded to the amazing Ocean View Pool Villa !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woohoo from the moment they picked us up from the airport the service was truly a credit to the resort. All staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and efficient. The villa was fantastic and private even thou the beach was just behind the garden. We have definitely found a new place to stay on our yearly visit.
The breakfast is GREAT and the swim up bar is a perfect way to spend the morning.
Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2622,Beautiful resort,50,February 2015,"Stayed here for 5 nights and just got back, the resort grounds are just stunning our Room was in the Beach Wing and was ground level so we only had to walk out our glass sliding doors to the garden then walk past the little bridge to the Infinity pool .. The room had a musty smell but I think sometimes that's just Bali in the rainy season when things get damp. The staff were just so happy all the time ..and as for Breakfast you couldn't ask for more it was lovely plentiful and fresh .. would not hesitate to stay there again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2623,Wonderful Visit,50,February 2015,"Stayed at the hotel for my birthday. Wonderful staff who even helped me packed my breakfast because I was sick. Never experienced better service in my years of travel. Even prepared a great chocolate cake during my breakfast buffet and sang me a birthday song. Every staff at the hotel is helpful and friendly and more importantly, very sincere. Private beach is a blessing, quiet and beautiful. Breakfast is good. The restaurant by the beach provides an excellent view of the ocean. Definately worth every cent of the price paid. Highly recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2624,Amazinggggg service!!,50,February 2015,Ok so I am writing this review from my hotel room. I just came back after eating breakfast and it was delicious (enak in Balinese :p)so we are vegetarians we had a bit of an issue yesterday with the food we told them about it and they more than made up for it today. To people passing by our table I am sure we looked like gluttons! They have been so nice and have been trying to teach me Balinese cause I am bugging them with all my questions and they are doing it with an amazing smile on their face. They really are giving us an amazing amazing service and I am loving it here. They all have beautiful smiles on their faces each and everyone of them. It feels really nice to get out of the room and see a zillion smiles greeting you. Thank you seminyak beach resort and spa,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2625,Ok hotel,30,February 2015,"Stayed at the garden wing.

Room wasn't very nice. The pictures on the website looks much nicer. Had a musty smell.

Location is good. On the beach and close to main semiyak street. Pool is very nice.

Breakfast is very good.

Probably won't stay here again as the room is just too substandard for the price of 250usd.

But if I must I will pick a room in the beach wing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2626,Great service,50,February 2015,Stayed there for 2 night. The front desk when i checked in was very helpful and the staffs were full of smile and very friendly. The location were only few steps from KuDeTa. I stayed in garden wing over the road from the main hotel but you can still use all the facilities. Rooms are big enough and has a balcony where my daughter can see a squirrell climbing the coconut tree. What a great show for her.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2627,Impeccable service - and excellent buffet breakfast!,40,February 2015,"We stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa in early February 2015. Upon check in (at 10:00pm after a long flight), we were taken on a comprehensive tour of the property and even shown how to use the lights in our bedroom. The staff were incredibly attentive - when I asked a whether yoga took place at the hotel, somehow this was communicated to the rest of the staff and after the lesson had taken place, I was asked if I had enjoyed the lesson by staff members I had not met previously! The buffet breakfast was out of this world - packed with delicious gourmet goodies (smoked marlin and triple brie) along with a la carte eggs, waffles and pancakes (with different toppings such as hollandaise sauce for the eggs and salted caramel sauce for the pancakes and waffles) - this kitchen knows how to please a gourmet traveller. Two small things - first, we were not permitted to drink a special celebratory champagne we had purchased by the pool even though we had spent $$$ there for other drinks throughout the duration of our stay and second, watch out for the inconspicuous steps in the infinity pool which could be a hazard for shallow dives. Otherwise, we had a beautiful stay and would certainly return again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2628,Spectacular!!,50,July 2014,"We've gotten picked up by a charming driver with fresh towels and water in traditional clothing. All in all very friendly staff that will happily serve you anything you wish for, constantly smiling and very polite! Breakfast buffet was perfect (I am very picky) and had a lot to offer! The pool area as well as the way leading there are arranged beautifully! There isn't too much space at the pool front (the earlier you're there, the more places you get to choose from). A stunning view from the pool area right out on the ocean, which can not be topped.
Our room was in the main building, second floor, facing the ocean front. A very big bathroom which was separated from the sleeping area concluded two big sinks a shower and a jacuzzi facing the ocean! The room deserves a 5/5!
Even though we didn't leave the hotel too much, it was very close for all activities like shopping in Seminyak, the Ku De Ta which was almost next door (very recommended for dinner/drinks).

All in all the hotel was perfect from A to Z of which I cannot remember any bad aspect. We will return.

Summer 2014",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2629,Wonderful,50,February 2015,"isnt it interesting how different people see the same place?
I stayed here after reading the reviews and I wasn't disappointed
I normally try to upgrade but was advised on TA not to. Glad I didn't pay the extra. I had a garden view on the beach side and it was delightful. I could still hear the waves crashing from my room.
Room was clean and tasteful. Shower was hot. There was always an abundance of drinking water and the towels were changed twice a day. At turn down, there was a different treat each day.
Breakfast was brilliant. (That's a big call from me) buffet and a la carte egg menu. Also the daily newspaper was provided.
I had a couple of glitches but all were quickly fixed. (TV remote ran out of battery and CD player had no sound)
Staff were very friendly and accomodating
To top it off they allowed me a complimentary late check out.
I will return",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2630,Excellent value for beachfront luxury,40,January 2015,"Stayed here over the New Year's Eve holiday. Did not utilize the hotel for their NYE party but instead went to the W. I found this to be great as the hotel is somewhat quiet i.e. relaxing which is what you want over nonstop excitement. They had some cute cultural festivities. The free breakfast (free at least if you are AMEX not sure otherwise so ask) is a highlight. Room was upgraded to a suite. Make sure you stay on the beach side. I wouldn't want to stay on garden side as seems like a hassle walking across the street for the amenities. But of course I am a spoiled American. Staff very warm and friendly albeit a bit over the top at times. Why not 5 stars? Need to focus on the little details. Also the drinks are very weak yet pricey. No bueno. Spa doesn't do waxing which is also not great if you forgot to get your bottom waxed before the trip. Ku de Ta club is next door which is nice. Easy walking to Seminyak square via a cobblestone street just past The Legion. Overall, I was very happy to be here and it's a 4.5 for me. Room: clean. Reception: helpful for a demanding person like me. Breakfast: superb. Room service: not utilized. Swimming pool: 2 options not crowded. Perfect for me. Gym: small, but I guess does what it needs to. Spa: not the best, not the worst.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2631,Dissapointed and totally do not recommend!!!,20,January 2015,"There were 2 positives out of a list of really negatives which were nice breakfast and friendly staffs but here comes the bad ones....
- I stayed in a Suite Room that is old, rundown, dated and unappealing.
- Jaccuzzi is absolutely unenjoyable - old, not working properly and takes forever to fill up
- Shower water is not hot at all.
- Room teabags were not filled and when I asked from reception at 3pm they did not get back promptly and i needed to follow up second and third time and finally after 4hours they got me my tea. It was already dinner time so way past afternoon tea.
- Gym is very small has limited equipment.
- Swimming pool and surrounding is unattractive and dated
- Overall its is way too pricey - i would rate this at maximum an old 4star hotel.
- I often go to Bali and have stayed at conrad, laguna, mulia, rimba, sofitel, pullman and a few other 5 star properties before and they are so much nicer and cheaper than The Seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2632,Beachfront luxury,50,January 2015,We recently stayed at Seminyak Beach and spa Resort in the garden wing over the road from the main hotel but you can still use all the resorts facilities. Sitting on deck chairs overlooking an infinity pool then onto the beach is heaven. Rooms are nicely fitted and more than adequate. We will be back!!!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2633,Fantastic!,50,January 2015,"Thank you to the Seminyak Resort for an amazing stay. The hotel was beyond our expectations, the room was beautiful and the staff were so friendly........we loved every minute of it and hope to return one day!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2634,Didn't want to leave this wonderful hotel,50,January 2015,"This place totally exceeded any expectations that we had on our first trip to Bali. From the room that was beautifully appointed to the staff who couldn't do enough for you, to the beautiful infinity pool setting, there is no need to even leave this hotel it is paradise and everything you need to just totally relax and be waited on. I have to mention the breakfast, My husband and I have stayed in other 5 star hotels and we have never come across such a beautiful range of breakfast options from the delicious local fruits to the freshly made eggs any style, home made waffles, the list goes on!. We looked forward to going to breakfast every morning and the staff who have such beautiful natures make it even better. This place is worth every cent and we will definately be returning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2635,Wonderful,50,January 2015,The staff at the hotel were amazingly friendly. Being close to the restaurants was great. The staff on too helpful to make reservations. The rooms were well appointed and luxurious.We will definitely be back next year.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2636,"One of the best places we've stayed in, and best holidays ever.....",50,January 2015,"I'm cabin crew and stay in lots of hotels constantly. It's only the second time my partner in our lives where him and I went wow!!! The staff were better then good ,they were the nicest staff I've come across. They couldn't do any more for you constantly. Our room was 3121 and we got an upgrade for $50 a night on arrival (we originally had the rooms across the road as it was cheaper). And they gave us the ultimate beach front room where I heard the waves crash every night (admittedly I was scared to death of a Tsunami coming in!!! we were that close!) but in the mornings, we had breakfast delivered to our veranda which over looked the beach and ocean and on the side the swim up pool with cabanas with cocktail bar. I have never been so relaxed as I was there. We ventured out a bit ,but when you're there , you feel safe,and SO relaxed. we had been looking at other hotels in town for a few weeks (work commitments delayed us) but then we just thought, we loved the look of the place and wanted the beach. It's easy to everything and other restaurants (1 min walk to Ku De Tah) and Potato Head (go...better than Ku De Tah) . It was just fantastic and a real holiday . If I was to go again, I'd definitely go back and ask for the same room.....Seminyak is really busy and trendy and a bit noisy,but if you want a definitely holiday and chillout, I'd book this in a heartbeat again,I wouldn't even question it.It's not cheap $15 cocktails etc...but you pay for what you get and if you want a proper holiday and be realaxed, then this is the place. The beach was dirty with rubbish constantly which annoyed me (don't swim in it) and I tried once and couldn't bare it. It needs cleaning without question and that would be my biggest complaint. But as far as the resort is concerned it's perfect. I actually think the staff should clean the front of the beach if it's dirty on their patch ? but that's only a suggestion? Maybe the council should sort it out?? but that would be my biggest criticism ,but as the resort was stunning, I wouldn't even bother going into the beach, it's much nicer with a cocktail and a pool overlooking the ocean (which is nice,). It was a perfect holiday......",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2637,Everything you need,50,January 2015,"This resort has everything you need.

The rooms are well appointed and are generous. I accidentally washed my toothbrush in bali tap water... but no issues! There were spare ones as well as any bathroom items you may need.

The staff were exceptionally helpful. We unfortunately started to get bali belly on our last day, they sent us hot ginger tea and the doctor straight away. They made sure we were ok, which was really lovely!

The pool, restaurant and bar were first class. This place has the best breakfasts we have ever eaten, and we love breakfast! Best staff at this place.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2638,Fantastic,50,January 2015,"Absolutely fantastic. The rooms and the pool area are superb. Food and service is excellent. Great location and on straight access to the seminyak beach. Friendly staff. Will go again.

Pool area suits well for kids as well. The breakfast is good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

I can't wait to come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2640,"Fabulous Hotel, Amazing Team!",50,January 2015,"We had an amazing time at Seminyak Beach Resort. It was one of the highlights of our trip to Bali. It has a wonderful beach front location, a fabulous pool and they provide an excellent breakfast. From our check-in to our check-out, the experience was wonderful.

We were so thankful to have met Lia (Director of Customer Relations). She knew just how to help us select tours off the normal ""tourist path"" and really followed up to ensure we were happy. I also have to say that Irwan at the front desk worked hard to ensure that our stay was of the highest quality...from a thorough efficient check-in, to helping us correct a minor issue with some missing towels to personally lending us his phone cable so we could transfer our pictures from camera to computer.

It is clear that the message has been sent from the top down that customer satisfaction is extremely important to the success of this property. Every member of the staff was courteous, efficient and worked hard to ensure that customer experience was of the highest quality. Thank you to all members of the Seminyak Beach Resort Team for making this one of the most memorable and amazing beach holidays we have ever experienced.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2641,Paradise,50,January 2015,"First of all i would like to start this review by thanking Lia and her staff for everything they did for us during our stay.
During our 24hr flight to Indonesia i came down with the flu. Probably the worst experience of my life so far but thats another story. We were planning on doing a lot of exploring when we got to Indonesia but we had made no travel arrangements because they won't let you from the states. Lia took down all the information i was able to give her(in my time of agony) and made all of our adventures possible(Labuan Bajo 4 nights / Lombok 5 nights) arranged all of our travel and we didn't even have to leave the resort to get tickets/make payments etc. She also took it upon herself to see that i was getting better from all my symptoms. She had a special tea made for me several times and delivered it to my room. She routinely checked in on me to see if i was recovering and i couldn't appreciate her more.
The Hotel was lovely and offers great amenities. there is plenty of room for guests to hang out poolside with the crowd or grab a personal spot on the other side of the resort if you are looking for a more quiet experience. There are also several personal/couples bungalows for hanging out and relaxing in the beautiful garden.All of which you can order food/drinks from. All of the staff is very helpful and genuinely concerned with how you are doing and willing to do just about anything you ask them.
The room is modern with Indo flare. Very clean and comfortable. The mattress was very nice and not a cheap one. I know because i have a chronic back problem and this was not an issue with the bed as it is at most hotels we stay, so i really appreciate that.
Also it is important to note that i come to Indo to surf(beginner-intermediate) and you can get some waves on a nice beach break out in front of the resort. not the best surf spot obviously but great for beginners at the right tide. so this is definitely a +(plus).
The free breakfast is absolutely amazing, i can't believe some of the reviews that were criticizing the breakfast. There is just about everything you could possibly want for breakfast and the quality is 5 stars. Also my wife and i are sort of coffee snobs and the coffee was the best I've had outside of Seattle. We travel with our own coffee just incase and we did not drink any of it.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to this area and look forward to coming back someday...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2642,Living in luxury.,50,January 2015,"This was our first trip to Indonesia. We planned our start to be as relaxing as possible so we chose the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa based on other's reviews.

We arrived in mid-afternoon - had arranged for the hotel to pick us up. The driver was invitingly friendly and the drive went by so quickly as we discussed what we had planned for this holiday. Our check in experience included beautiful leis - tasty tea and meeting Lei (Mamik Lauliyah - Director of Guest Services).

Top experiences that we absolutely think this is a great place to stay:

1. The customer service from Lei (Mamik Lauliyah) and her staff was above and beyond what we could have ever expected. We had planned to fly out to Labaun bajo for diving and to see the Komodo dragons - then off to Lombok for surfing - then leaving time open for what might interest us. We had done some homework to know what Indonesia airlines would allow surfboards. Long story - shortened up a bit - the holiday we had planned was quickly coming apart with fees - not being able to take the surfing gear with us, etc. With Lei's guidance, respectful, and tenacious service we were able to book the flights to and from Labuan Bajo and Lombok and transportation we needed and get our gear to the placed we needed it when we needed it. For this - we are truly grateful. And did and will come back here to stay because of Lei.

2. Renja (msp?) who worked with Lei was wonderful in assisting us during our visit. And so many of the staff from the lifeguards, security, restaurant staff, people working in the grounds, spa staff - nearly made this a wonderful time as we felt well taken care of throughout our time here.

3. We selected the beach wing hotel room, it was spacious, beautifully designed with Indonesian and modern touches. We had everything and more that was needed provided in the room.

4. Breakfast. The choices were fantastic and much more than I expected. Ranging from ordering eggs - omelettes - french toast - and more. Too a buffet that featured Indonesian - Asian - and American tastes. The fresh fruit and choices (including gluten free) were fantastic.

5. Yoga and mediation. I took advantage of this service while my finance attempted to catch a few waves in front of the hotel.

6. Pools - unbelievably beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach. I appreciated that we could buy things from the beach vendors as they walked by on the beach but could really enjoy relaxing without having to say no all the time.

7. Room was stocked with everything you would expect from a upscale hotel.

8. Turn down services. We loved having the room ready to be ready for a wonderful nights sleep and the red rose was a nice touch.

9. Balcony & decks. Great places to hang out. Comfortable. All the places to hang out on the facilities. In the garden - on the beach - by the infinity pool - by the pool bar - and so much more.

10. Hot water not working. The hot water stopped working - we called and they were able to fix it right away.

Opportunities for improvement:
- Room service. Food arrived quickly - however some of the food choices were not on par with our overall experience.

Overall -
Truly a wonderful experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2643,Great Hotel,50,January 2015,"Myself and partner spent six nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort in an ocean view suite.

We both loved our stay!

The room was quite large and nicely finished with a great view of the ocean and sunset. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent with large, sunken, walk in spa bath looking out to sea.

The breakfast buffet in the mornings where lovely with a good mix of traditional and western food. I especially loved the fresh watermelon juice.

The pool was where we spent much of our time, sampling the large selection of cocktails. Makes me want to go back just thinking about it!

I arranged a romantic dinner mid week for my girlfriend's birthday which was out where weddings take place overlooking the ocean. The staff went to great effort to set up candles and make it as a romantic evening as possible, even though it got a little windy! Still a wonderful evening was had. There was even a complementary birthday cake and card when we returned to the room.

While we loved the hotel the stand out thing for both of us where the staff. They where all so warm, friendly and helpful I've never seen anything like it in my travels. Not intrusive friendly which can get annoying, just passively welcoming and ready to help in an instant should you need it.

We'd both definitely return here if in Seminyak. It was just what we where after when searching for a relaxing, romantic holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2644,More intimate,50,January 2015,"Intimate and sophisticated.Relaxing with green surroundings, two pool areas to choose from and the sound of the ocean. A little piece of paradise out of the hustle and bustle of downtown shopping areas.
Standard rooms on the beach side are great and no need to upgrade.
Service is efficient but not intrusive. Staff are helpful, polite and warm.
Visit the pool side bar and ask for Ayuni. Our visit was more special with her bright cheerful nature and attentiveness.
We experienced great Indonesian food at the restaurant at reasonable prices.
Only improvement would be hotter showers with more water pressure.
Will visit again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2645,Wonderful pool villa,50,November 2014,"Location: If you book the beach part (which I most strongly recommed) you will have direct acces to the beach, which enables long walks and some relaxing moments and spectacular sunsets. There are literally dozens of restaurants close by I recommend ginger moon (1 km south) and little india (300m north).

Important point: Ths beach is only for experienced swimmers! The waves actually prohibit swimming most of the time.

Rooms: We did have a pool villa and it was one of the very few moments when the entered the area we said that the pictures do not do it justice You have a small garden, a large sitting area (with minibar which will be restocked according to your wishes if you ask) a gazebo looking out to the beach and a very nice pool with some water all around the villa. The bedroom is very big, as well as the dressing area and the bath. All were very clean, all amenities you could as from a 5 star hotel were in. Bed is very spacious. All in all a very very good villa (see other hotels I reviewed for comparison.

Staff: Very friendly and doing the best they could to help and make sure our stay was a nice one. Some minor quibbles were resolved very fast.

Food: The breakfast with a lot of varying hot and cold items is more than enough to keep you satisfied for the day, especially if you order some items from the menu. Not the most extensive buffet I have had so far bt crtainly in the upper league. The restaurant where they serve breakfast is open so you can have a very nice view of the garden and the sea again.
btw, the garden is also very nice and has some cozy corners.

For dinner we tried the seafood buffet once, very nice if a bit pricey and had some tapas in one evening, very good choice. They do offer some creative cocktails and the wines are reasonably priced.

The pool is a very nice and comforting one with the only disadvantage being the people who try to sell stuff to the swimmers. But large enough and with showers to get you clean after a walk on the beach.

Some birds came by on a regular basis to drink in our pool and we had a very nice time in this hotel. The pool is private so nobody can look into, perfect for honeymooners.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2646,Truly memorable experience @ The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,December 2014,"My husband and I stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort for 4 nights in December 2014. We had a wonderful time and loved every bit of our stay here. We booked a garden view room and for some reason our booking went through for a twin room. Of course we wanted a double room with a king bed. The hotel staff was extremely helpful in understanding the situation and finding a solution to the problem. They had a double room available for 2 nights so they gave us that with a promise to do their best to take care of the situation for the other 2 nights too. Just the following day we were informed that they managed to move some other guests to a twin room and that we could have the double room for all 4 nights. How wonderful ! :)
We were truly impressed by the hospitality of all staff members who always wore a smile. My favorite hangout place was by the pool and the gazebos as the ocean was clearly visible.
I would recommend and encourage others to pick The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa as their choice of stay in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2647,Nice hotel but better out there for the money,30,January 2015,"From booking to checkout:
Pictures online represent the hotel as far better than it actually is. It's starting to look tired and I fear the daily property 'walk around' is not being done. For a resort that poses itself as 5 star this is a minimum.
Check in was easy and the staff were very sweet. This took the focus off the less than impressive lobby. Again, the staff at reception were VERY nice and greeted us in a sincere and special manner.
The room was in a fairly good position in the furthest corner of the property. The room was small but adequate. At around USD500 per night one would expect more bag for their buck.
Garden/pool areas were nice and typical of what Bali has to offer. Staff were good but not overly friendly.
The free breakfast was worth what they charged (nothing). Staff in the breakfast area were not happy and it showed. There was a broken toaster (the only one) which was pointed out by many people and this was not fixed or replaced in the half hour we sat there. Staff were very slow and although there were many it was hard to get any help. This was not due to any communication problem as I speak fluent Bahasa.
I asked for an extra hour in the room but was told 12 noon was it and I had to be out f the room. Check out was easy and we were on our way to the airport for a three hour wait, would have appreciated the extra hour.
I booked this resort as a surprise for my wife on our last night in Bali. Although it was a nice evening as we made it that way we were both disappointed with resort and should have stayed where we always have in The Conrad or The Four Seasons.
We have been to Bali numerous times and are very positive people. I thank the staff that were friendly as they deserve the recognition but we will not be back as there is way better on offer for the same or less dollars.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2648,Not the beach found in the brochures,10,January 2015,"The beach is far from what we expected when we booked a idilic honeymoon. There is literally tonnes of debris on the beach which makes it a total no go area. Maybe this is due to recent storms but still, they don't tell you this when you pay the $500usd per night!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2649,Great resort!,50,November 2014,"For our first ever trip to Bali my husband and I stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort in November and enjoyed it very much. We were upgraded to a suite with an ocean view which was very nice. The staff were great - especially the staff in the lobby. The room service meals were restaurant quality which was a nice surprise and the buffet breakfast was above average.

We ended up spending a lot of time at the hotel as we were quite disappointed almost every time we ventured out. We went to Kuta (and other areas) to have a look around and couldn't wait to get back to the hotel! I am Australian but the other Australian tourists in Bali are an embarrassment. We did take a day trip to Ubud which is lovely and very different to other areas.

The other disappointment was the (lack of) shopping. Unless you want to buy Bintang singlets there is really nothing else.

I won't ever be going back to Bali but I will recommend this hotel if you are thinking of going!

If it wasn't for the lovely hotel we probably would have caught the next flight home.....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2650,"Amazing hotel, amazing stay, truly a top notch experience",50,December 2014,"First, a special thanks to Irwan and the entire lobby staff for their help in making our stay a truly memorable one. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable.

This hotel is simply great. We will be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2651,"Lovely Hotel, great ambience and layout",40,December 2014,"We stayed here for a short break between Christmas and New Year. It's a lovely hotel, with very attentive, courteous and friendly staff. We were in a deluxe room so beach side, with a great view of the gardens and sea. The infinity pool is beautiful and I loved the simple layout of the hotel. Breakfasts were hit and miss with 2 good days and one bad, but all bad if you like English breakfasts, however I enjoy Indonesian food so it was fine for me. They even had gluten free muffins in their cake selection each morning.
We had a massage in the beautiful spa. It is very beautiful and the massage was fantastic, but even with guest discount it was very expensive. We live in Jakarta and you can get a good massage in a high end spa there for around 300k, whereas there it was 800k after 125 discount for a 60 min massage.
The outdoor dining area is a perfect spot for sundowners but these aren't really encouraged as the drinks are very expensive with no happy hour options that you get in most hotels and the chairs are not very comfortable. We had a bottle of champagne one evening and it was about a third more expensive than in one of the top restaurants.
I would definitely stay there again as on the whole it was a lovely, friendly hotel in a great location and although drinks and massage were expensive it wasn't overly expensive to stay there. I strongly recommend the burgers in the WahWah Diner opposite - best ever! Fab choc martinis too!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2652,Beautiful Hotel,40,September 2014,"We stayed here for part two of our honeymoon. The resort was beautiful and you could walk straight out onto the beach. Our villa was enormous, with a particularly amazing bathroom including both inside and outside shower. The staff were very attentive throughout the trip, treating us very well - perhaps too attentive at times with the constant room cleaning which seemed intrusive at points for honeymooners. The onsite restaurant was very good, but the room service didn't have as many options as we would have perhaps liked. The butler service was novel, but oversold and not as I would consider a true ""butler"".

We visited the spa several times - again it was lovely. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back.

As an area, Seminyak wasn't really for us. It was a bit too much like a typical beach holiday town and too far removed from the culture. We much preferred Ubud.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2653,Best kept secret,50,December 2014,"First time to Bali and we were recommended to stay at The Semminyak Hotel from friends that were seasoned travelers to Bali.
Staff were absolutely delightful in making sure that your stay was good.
A staff member by the name of Ariyundi was always there to greet us and give helpful advise for hotel events and even outside hotel activities.
Highly recommend this place.

Ari and Jessica",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2654,David C. Excellent,50,December 2014,"We recently stayed at the seminyak beach resort and spa and were treated to an absolute first class experience. Everybody from the restaurant staff, the reception staff to the grounds maintenance people always made us feel welcome and very special. The rooms were immaculate as was the resort and all the facilities. The staff were always on hand to help and make sure that we had everthing we wanted at any time with a smile.We would recommend this resort to anybody thinking of staying in Seminyak and looking for somewhere special to spend some quality time. Would definitely stay there again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2655,Lovely small luxury hotel,40,December 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak as it is known just before Xmas 2014. It is a charming smallish hotel, just over 100 rooms. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast is lovely, the Passionfruit was a special treat every morning. The are two swimming pools, one basically an ornamental one to laze in, and one the ""proper"" infinity pool. Only one restaurant, but good.

The hotel has won awards in 2013 as a luxury hotel, and the staff are fantastically accommodating, polite, and do try to please. We had a small problem during our stay, really something the hotel could not have foreseen, but it was well handled by Ms Lia (the ?guest relations manager) and Ms Marie-Helene the GM.

It is a true beach resort, actually on the beach, but beware that the beach is only safe for swimming as marked by flags. Unfortunately some rubbish does get washed up on the beach, which is not nice. Perhaps the hotel should arrange a dawn ""beach patrol"" to clean this up before the guests get to the beach.

Overall a nice family holiday at The Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2656,Great stay.,50,May 2014,"I stayed at the seminyak beach resort with family and friends. What a wonderful stay. The staff were amazing and so accommodating. Breakfast was lovely. We had 3 ocean-garden view rooms in the beach wing. Some of the rooms had a bit of a damp smell but that was from the air conditioning. The pool was lovely and and the free drinks and meet the staff night was a great addition to our stay. I loved staying at this resort and would definately stay again. Great location, wonderful balinese feel. Cant wait to go again. May look at the 2br Villa next time but loved every minute of my stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2657,Quiet relaxation in the middle of activities,50,December 2014,"The service was impressively customer-centric and attentive, in an environment that is quiet and relaxing. The staff made us felt very welcome every time we interacted with them. The location, a short walk from interesting shopping streets, and areas with bars and party venues like Ku-De-TA makes it an ideal holiday resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2658,perfect stay,50,December 2014,"I stayed in Seminayk resort with my gf for 7 nights. Service was excellent, everybody pro and polite.
Before arrival I was email by reservation, asking about room preferences, room that we got was much better than I expected.
I do not have almost any compains except bit poor breakfest menu and no taste of alcohol in really expensive drinks they serve (you order Mohito and get soda water with ice, sugar and mint ;-)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2659,"Staff are fantastic, rooms great & excellent location",50,December 2014,"All the staff were fantastic from the security guards on the gate, reception staff, cleaning staff and restaurant staff. Breakfast was brilliant where you could select from the al-la-carte and also help yourself to the buffet breakfast - the bircher muesli was the best! Two pools to choose from but it is a shame the swim up bar is not in the other main pool as nobody was utilising it in the time we were there. The location is excellent - out the front gate and everything is really close by and the beach is beautiful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2660,Simply Amazing,50,July 2014,"Simply amazing place, it's the best of the best and i would absolutely recommend. In a great location out of the hustle bustle and with everything you need within walking distance. Room was beautiful, bed comfortable and friendly staff. When in Bali this is the place to stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2661,Magnificent,50,December 2014,"A beautiful Hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very caring, positive House Guest Services Manager, Lia.

The gardens are dreamy and equisite in a Balinese modern style as are the rooms and atmosphere.

Will be a cherished memory.

Staff went the extra mile when a family member was unwell.

2662,Great resort in a great location,40,December 2014,"This resort is so close to all the action in Seminyak and right on the beach. The rooms are excellent, the staff very friendly, and the pool is a highlight. The only thing missing is a bar ( aside from the swim up version ).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2663,Lunch with a view,40,December 2014,What a delight to stumble across this resort and be escorted from the entrance to a beautiful sea side table - had to check we weren't riffraff! This time of year no one was around and Supraman our server was lovely. Food & drinks were great - best mohito so far!!!!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2664,Beautiful place,50,September 2014,"Good service and lovely hotel. We asked for a twin room but they didn't have so they gave us a suite (upgraded) and moved another queen bed in for my sister. The room was huge, we had a massive bathroom, bedroom, dressing room, sitting room and balcony with beach and garden views.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2665,Romantic setting close to many restaurants,40,December 2014,"This hotel sitting right on the ocean in the Seminyak area is very close to all excellent restaurants and nightclubs in the Seminyak area, in fact it is right next door to KuDeTa. Although we stayed in the guest house across the street from the main hotel, we had all access to the hotel and facilities with a golf cart and driver to take us back and forth. The room was big and comfortable, but very damp and it was hard to regulate the A/C. Some of the pillows and linens were musty smelling as a result of the dampness and should be exchanged often. The King Size bed was a little lumpy in texture and not the most comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly, competent and helpful. The breakfast (included in rate) was of high quality and freshness with eggs and waffles cooked to order. The spa and pool facilities were very hygienic. I would like to try other hotels also next time, but I would come back here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2666,A Holiday in Bali you will always remember from the sunsets to the amazing hotel,50,December 2014,"I have realised that a sunset across the horizon can make your day end on a high. Imagine if you will leaning on the side of the pool watching the sun sink slowly into the ocean leaving behind such an array of colours from pinks and apricots with cotton wool clouds to the most subtle shades of silver blue. That is an experience like no other in Bali. Even the most basic of rooms in this resort is divine. As with all resorts the closer you wish to view the ocean the more the price goes up. But from the swim up bar pool to the ocean front pool and the long stretches of beach, Seminyak resort has on offer a truly brilliant experience. Not to mention that you are amongst such famous places as Potato Head nightclub and many of the finest restaurants Bali has to offer only minutes from your door. They also provide a shuttle bus that will take you to some of the more popular shopping districts",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2667,Impeccable place,50,December 2014,"Everything was perfect. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is simply beautiful and in a perfect location. Our room was big, clean and with a great view of the ocean. The food was divine. We have no complains other than the Internet was a bit slow and spotty...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2668,A lovely experience,40,November 2014,"The seminyak was a good choice for our stay! Nice room on the ground floor, which was cleaned daily and turned down at night. The infinity pool overlooking the beach was a good pool with plenty of sun beds! The grounds of the resort were lovely and I would stay again if I have the chance!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2669,Wonderful location,40,November 2014,"The Seminyak has a perfect location at the beach and is close to shops, beachbars and restaurants. Our suite with oceanview was very spacious and the bathroom with yacuzi was excellent. Perhaps the wooden windows to the terrace need a little upgrade in the nearby future and the wifi in the room was sometimes slow.
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Roomservice was top.
Overall a very positive experience",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2670,You wont be disappointed,50,June 2014,"I sure all the good things said about this hotel have already been said quite righty so the hotel is great as is a couple of others in that stretch of the beach.We stayed 9 nights in June had to pay full freight they would not budge on there rates good work if you can get it! Anyway all the good things said about this hotel they do specialize in weddings and be aware if you want a nanny knap in the afternoon forget it.you will be part of the party if you get a room overlooking the beachside restaurant(which has a lovely champaine tapas deal)well worth $100.They also had a mini rock festival in the main grounds don,t know who thought of that i think there was about six of us there and the punk band yes 5star hotel punk band(understand they have a new entertainments manager)anyway it made interesting conversation at breakfast next day.Saying all that my wife and I tried to book in 2 weeks ago still couldnt get a deal although renovations are in full swing so we gave a 4 star in Seminyak a go with a happy outcome review to follow.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2671,Perfect position,50,November 2014,"The Seminyak was just wonderful - friendly staff, good range of activities and a perfect location. We could walk everywhere - shopping, nightlife, local markets. Our suite was sensational and as a bonus we bought an amazing and authentic artwork by Mohammed, the wonderful Balinese artist, who had an exhibition in the hotel during our stay. We also came away wiht some exquisite hand painted eggs and shells, again from an artisan showing us his works in the hotel. Definitely returning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2672,Sue Fantastic resort,50,November 2014,"What a great holiday. The staff were amazing, nothing was to much trouble and they made you feel like you were more important than any other guest.

2673,Very nice - great staff!,50,November 2014,"Super service from very friendly staff who could not do enough to be at your service 24/7! Hotel facilites are perfect, not to big and location right on the beach! Only downside is the big waves in the ocean - you have to be brave and very careful to go in!
Also make sure to make use of the SPA. Ku De Ta restaurant is next door - do not miss it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2674,perfect,50,November 2014,"perfect place for anyone who want to enjoy bali, easy accessed and great service! especially the view from room.. you can see the beach when you swimming, rent a motorcycle from the hotel and enjoy the vacation ; )",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2675,Best Mistake Ever!,50,September 2014,"We booked a trip to Bali, all 4 hotels and destinations were ready to go and then I found out I made a mistake on booking the hotel in Kuta for only 2 days instead of 3. It was fully booked so we decided to book last minute in Seminyak which is a little farther from Kuta (which in my opinion is not my scene).

The hotel we ended up booking for this one night was The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. It was the best hotel we stayed in for the trip (and we stayed at some nice hotels!) The poolside beach area was AMAZING! Absolutely stunning to lie down next to the infinity pool and watch the sun go down over the beach.

The service was fantastic, we were given floral neck strings and the staff were just so helpful, polite and very efficient. The grounds were spectacular, the room was beautiful and the food was great too - the breakfast area and buffet was THE BEST!

I wish I completely skipped Kuta and booked the whole time here it was that good. If you can, try and get the beach end of the hotel as the hotel is on two sites which I didn't know when I booked, one being across a road. (the ""Road"" is just a narrow laneway anyway and there are security guards to help you cross)

Book this one. You won't regret it! Will be posting pictures here of the stunning sunset.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2676,Outstanding :-),50,November 2014,"Staff are amazing and cannot do enough to help. Grounds are stunning, well equipped gym, food and drink at the hotel is great and represents good value for money. Already planning next year's trip back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2677,Ultimate relaxation!,50,November 2014,"We have just returned from a four night stay at this wonderful resort. On arrival we were greeted by the friendliest staff who couldn't do enough for us and were given a chain of flowers and a cold drink. Even though we were earlier then the allowed check-in time, it was no problem for us to use the facilities while we waited for our room. Best part was we were given an upgrade to an ocean villa! When we arrived at the room, we were left speechless. We opened the door and entered through a magical garden walkway which opened to a private outdoor dining area, pool with jacuzzi and sun lounges and daybed. We then entered the living area to find a huge king size bed, nicely decorated with flowers. The bathroom was also impressive with rain showerhead, bathtub to fit two and double basins, all surrounded by a beautiful garden setting. The most awe inspiring part was the view. From our bedroom, we looked over our private pool and out to the beautiful beach and sunset. It was my birthday while we were there and management sent a birthday cake and card to the villa. Such a thoughtful thing to do. The food and drinks were delicious (although pricey, but what you would expect from 5 star resorts in Bali). My husband surprised me with a candlelight dinner on the resorts gazebo right on the beach and it was fabulous. We also tried the spa out, and although more pricey then what you can find outside the resort, it was more then worth it in my opinion. What made our stay the most enjoyable was the staff. Wherever we went, we were greeted with a smile and they made it a point to say hello every time. I only wish we could have stayed longer but I would definitely recommend the resort to couples seeking a relaxing holiday and we will definitely be returning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2678,Perfection,50,November 2014,"I had no expectations before our trip to Bali. I'm an American living in Australia and have worked in the travel industry. This is the best experience I have ever had in a vacation. The property alone would deserve this statement. However, the service, food, and amenities would make this stay simply perfection. I would recommend this to anyone looking to be absolutely amazed!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2679,Awesome Resort,50,January 2014,"The rooms are big, clean and comfortable. There is an infinity pool on the beach which was spectacular! Also walking distance to the shopping stretch outside.

Food in the hotel is affordable, however if you wish for other food options there are plenty of restaurant choices within walking distance outside.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2680,Great hotel great location great service,50,November 2014,"It's the staff who make your stay here memorable. I've never met friendlier staff anywhere, nothing was too much trouble and whenever we walked through reception they made eye contact and stood to greet you. I can't imagine how many times a day they must do that but somehow they make you feel special. Rooms were large, clean and had all amenities you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre. Beautiful gardens and superb beachfront location all 5 minutes walk from Seminyak Square. nothing at all to complain about.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2681,Why stay anywhere else?,50,November 2014,"This place has it all and to answer the above question, there it no reason to stay anywhere else. This place has everything you could ask for. The infinity pool is probably the best in all of Bali and I saw no real reason to leave my lounger for much of the trip.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2682,Fab holiday,50,November 2014,"Hotel was excellent and lived up to our expectations. On arriving we were greeted with drinks and a floral necklace. Staff in all departments were all so friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The room we had was a garden view, but it was so quiet and peaceful. The room was large with a fantastic bedroom and bathroom. There was everything you required in the bathroom. Bedroom had tea and coffee facilities and fresh bottles of water every day and ice if you needed it. Breakfast was outside and in a wonderful setting, food was excellent good high quality food to suit every one. The hotel wasn't crowded and lots of space for sun lounges. Swimming pool over looking the sea and plenty of shaded areas for you to sit in. We would certainly recommend this hotel to any age group. Great access for shops, taxis and tourist guides.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2683,Simply superb,50,November 2014,"We recently spent 5 nights here on our honeymoon. I had originally booked a beach wing ocean view room, but when we checked in the staff member told us we had been upgraded to their one bedroom villa with private pool etc! That sort of upgrade isn't something you can expect and the kind of gesture that made our honeymoon even more perfect. The hotel itself is wonderful and the staff and service simply faultless. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Great location of course and will definately be staying again in the future. Sincere thankyou to management and staff for making our honeymoon completely perfect.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2684,Paradise,50,October 2014,"We stayed here for our honeymoon, after spending 4 nights in Singapore. As soon as we arrived we were given lays and treated to a fresh drinks while the staff checked us in which we thought was a nice touch. We had booked the Ocean View Villa and couldn't have been happier. The pictures online don't really do it justice. The room was beautiful, with patio door leading right out to the private pool. We had a great view of the sunset in the evening and waking up and hearing the ocean first thing was wonderful too. The location of the hotel is really good, not too close to the busy strip of restaurants to hear the noise but a nice 5 minute walk away from some really great places to eat. The staff were very friendly, going out of their way to make sure we were ok at all times. I would definitely recommend The Seminyak for couples.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2685,Fantastic holiday,40,November 2014,"Very nice hotel, pool is fantastic as with the rooms could joy fault, breakfast was excellent and the staff were friendly and welcoming. Being a short walk of taxi to most amenities of Saminyak, I would highly recommend to stay as we will be back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2686,Loved the Stay,50,November 2014,A great location to shops and restaurants. Staff were outstanding and very helpful in everyway. The breakfast was extremely good and many choices....and was served outside. We would certainly stay here again.....and longer as we only stayed 5 nights.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2687,Amazing,50,November 2014,"This resort was brilliant. We had the most enjoyable stay here in one of the beach view rooms. Amazing views, room cleaned twice daily and toiletries replenished. The pool was to die for. Breakfast was quite impressive. Every single member of staff was extremely helpful and friendly and assisted with everything from restaurant reservations to making sure we were not overcharged by the cab drivers. A truly memorable stay and we would not hesitate to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2688,Great place to stay in Seminyak,40,November 2014,"A very good hotel to stay in central location in Seminyak. Wonderful and very welcoming staff all over the place. Direct beach access and very spacious rooms. We stayed in one of the garden rooms, across the street, as it was a bit less expensive. Apart from some week wifi all was perfect. Breakfast indeed was excellent, the restaurants at night were not frequented so much, although the food was delicious. A bit pricey in particular the wine. Anyway, we would stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2689,Perfect!,50,November 2014,"Fantastic hotel with an incredible view of the ocean, friendly staff, perfect location, Breackfast is top and so are the rooms... an amazing place to stay! It was the second time we ve stayed here and we will surely go back! !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2690,Perfect place to stay!,50,November 2014,"Absolutely fabulous! This is the second time I have stayed here and I look forward to going back again! The staff are so friendly and kind and were always very helpful. Perfect location for the beach and shopping also some great restaurants close by, or a 10 minute taxi ride into Kuta. The breakfast was delicious as well as the hotel menu. The pool area is very relaxing and the service by the pool was great! Overall there is nothing negative I could say about this resort as its just fantastic! I'm already planning my trip back next year :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2691,Loved it!,50,November 2014,"Staff so very friendly, wonderful location right on the beach and walk to Seminyak Square, next door to Ku De Ta. Rooms all really spacious and lovely garden setting. The villas I saw also and they are very luxurious and private with own pool. Breakfast great. Bar on the beach for sunset drinks is great with yummy canapes. Pool large and lovely outlook onto the beach. Highly recommend this hotel. Thank you for a great stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2692,Fabulous,50,November 2014,"Absolutely fabulous! This was our second visit and this time stayed in the garden wing just across the road. It is as good as the main resort only a little quieter which we enjoyed as did our 23 yr old daughter and her boyfriend. Enjoyed use of ALL facilities so missed out on nothing, staff are so helpful, and breakfast is amazing. Highly recommend a stay. Restaurants, shopping, beach a very short stroll. Just Do It!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2693,I love The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,50,November 2014,"I highly recommend to stay at the The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. My husband and I recently stayed for a week and we were blown away by the amazing service from all the staff, the gorgeous location and resort facilities and beauty. I rate our entire experience a 10 out of 10. The food was great, all the staff are extremely friendly, professional and attentive to your every need. It's truly paradise, a relaxing and peaceful ambience surrounded by warm and accommodating staff. I can't wait to get back and do it all again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2694,Great Location,40,October 2014,"We only stayed at Seminyak Beach Resort for one night before flying home, but we really enjoyed our stay. The resort location is great with shopping and restaurants close by, Ku De Ta next door and the resort is situated right on the beach. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming and they offered us free late checkout (2pm) as we had a late flight, which we greatly appreciated. The breakfast was great with a huge selection of food in the buffet as well as food made to order. If I had to find any fault with the resort, it would be that the drinks and food are a little overpriced.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2695,Fabulous,50,October 2014,"Wonderful facilities, welcoming staff. Good low-tide surf just out front!
The staff made us very welcome and comfortable and made a special effort for our birthday and anniversary celebrations. Thank you",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2696,Very Impressive,50,November 2014,"Great location and friendly service, would definitely go back. The staff made us feel very welcome and nothing was ever a problem. For our first time in Bali I would certain recommend this hotel especially newly weds.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2697,Amazing Honeymoon,40,October 2014,"Great Hotel with kind staff. We went for our honeymoon, and to our surprise the hotel kindly upgraded us to the ocean view room. Staff all knew us by our surnames, and a lovely cake was left in the room for our honeymoon. Room service was spot on and could not be any better.
Breakfast was lovely and they had a wide range selection of food and eggs were made to order. The beach is literally a walk away from the breakfast area, so perfect if you cant make it back to you room after eating all the lovely food.

From the moment we walked into our room we wanted to jump into the Jacuzzi, but the Jacuzzi was not so clean! my wife had to clean up the Jacuzzi and after we put the jet on, we had a terrible smell in the Jacuzzi which is probably due to not being in regular usage, hence the damp mouldy smelly. This is the only reason I am rating this a 4 star. Otherwise everything else was perfect.

Hotel is great for relaxation, even though it is in the busy part of Seminyak, being right at the front of the beach makes u feel away from the hustle and bustle on the opposite side, surprisingly u don't hear any of the outside noise, besides the lovely sound of the ocean.

Food was 5* staff 5* Location 5*

I would like to thank the staff for a very pleasant stay at the Seminyak , you put a great start to our honeymoon!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2698,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location",50,November 2014,"We have come to Bali in the quieter season (November) so the hotel isn't as busy as it usually might be but this I think has worked to our advantage, making the hotel peaceful and allowing us to benefit from quieter pools!
From the moment we arrived this hotel has exceeded our expectations and more. You are greeted by the loveliest staff who make you feel so welcome, and throughout our stay have continued to be so cheery always wishing you good morning, good day, good night, along with being so helpful when we've needed to book taxis or restaurant recommendations, the staff have made our stay so easy! On top of this the hotel looks almost brand new with amazingly kept grounds. Our huge bedroom had the most amazing view from our balcony across the hotel grounds and the beach, I would highly recommend booking a beach room, rather than a garden room so you can take advantage of the views and the short walk on to the beach. The main infinity pool looks right across the beach as well and is stunning at sunset, this is the same for the second pool with a swim up bar.
The restaurant here serves the most gorgeous food, with all the options you could imagine for breakfast.
The location itself is a short walk to Ku De Ta and a number of other well known restaurants and bars but equally is a very quick cab away from places further afield.
I can not recommend this hotel enough, the photos online really do not do this place justice, it's just stunning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2699,Location was just right!,50,October 2014,"My husband and I recently visited for a relaxing break.
Location was perfect- close to some great restaurants, on the beach, clean rooms and wonderful, friendly staff!
Would love to get back there some time soon",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2700,First class hotel,50,November 2014,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.
The staff are very friendly and the service and the facilities are first class.
It is a few mins walk to the bars and nightlife of Seminyak, yet it is also a peacful and relaxing place to stay if you don't want to party.
Will definitely return soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2701,"Fantastic service, right on the beach and next to KuDeTa",50,November 2014,"Stayed in November 2014. Service was outstanding and really friendly staff. Location is great, right on the beach and next to KuDeTa which does great food and drinks. The beach isn't as packed as further down towards Kuta, a definite positive. Infinity pool is really cool too. Short walk up to the boutiques and restaurants. Would absolutely stay again and am already plotting a return trip.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2702,Amazing Place,50,October 2014,"This hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed in. I stayed for four nights with my boyfriend. Not only was the location fantastic - right on the beach! But the rooms were great and the staff were so lovely. The staff were welcoming every time you walked past or returned to the hotel, they went out of their way to help with anything you needed. I would definitely return!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2703,Fantastic Stay!,40,October 2014,"Me and my girlfriend have just returned from 7 days at the SBR&S and it was fantastic! The staff were so friendly and fun to chat too, the breakfasts were amazing, so much variety and so fresh! We just loved it! and the rooms/hotel/gardens were great too.
Our room was in the beach wing and was very quiet, great view and close to everything so perfect for our needs. I'd say this is strictly a couples resort and lends itself to a romantic holiday where you can relax and unwind. (no screaming kids or groups of louts)
The pool is fantastic, its overlooking the ocean so just amazing for relaxing. Location wise, its close to a number of lovely restaurants and only a short walk (7mins) to the shops and has good security.
The only gripes i would have if any are;
The hotel dinner menu is a bit limited & seems expensive
There could be more staff around the pool & at the bar as we waited a while sometimes
The hotel transfer was really hard to find upon arrival at the airport (after a 6.5hr flight)
The spa I'd give 5/10

All in all though, we loved it and would certainly return next year.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2704,Cannot wait to come back again..,40,October 2014,"I already stayed in this hotel around three times and never failed to amaze me! Well, as you can see, the scenery is just magnificent! The beach is just so close and so natural. I also ever tried in Santan and Sanje Restaurant. Their foods are so delicious. The portion is quite generous and worth it to try! Eventhough they prepared Indonesian food, they prepared differently than I usually eat. Well, I cannot wait to come back again soon.. :D",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2705,Wonderful Pool,50,October 2014,"Three lovely days, a hotel very Good situated; 10 minutes walking to Seminyak Square, 3 minutes Walking to KuDeTa, oposite the Beach, beautiful Sunset, people who works in hotel very kindly and always smiling, a very good message. We don,t have words for describing the Pool, it was a Dream to be in Sunset in that Pool, incredible Pool.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2706,Do it.,50,October 2014,"Fabulous. A wonderful experience, fantastic staff from security at the gate through to the domestics. Friendly, helpful and good humour. Superb comfortable rooms, spacious ensuite.
Breakfast with a beautiful garden surrounding was top class. Great restaurants and shopping only minutes from the front gate. Thanks for a wonderful time, highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2707,honeymood mood,40,October 2014,"we love the jacuzzi with ocean view, its awesome!
pool beach front is excellent.
we love to spend during sunset time here.
the room is clean and the view is great.
close to ku de ta, mexicola and potato head.
i would love to stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2708,Amazing!,50,October 2014,"Stayed in a Garden view room which is located in a hotel block, directly across the road from the main hotel block, this is no problem at all as security staff are so attentive to helping you cross the road if the traffic builds up and also has it's own pool.

The breakfast is amazing!! Fresh juices and they make different ones up each day. Also loved being able to have a cappuccino made each morning rather than peculated coffee.

Staff are super friendly and go over and above in helping you with your queries, especially a man called Irwan who couldn't do enough for us.

Definitely recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2709,Really enjoyable stay at the Seminyak,50,October 2014,"Myself and my fiancee have just returned from 14 nights at the above resort. As said previously in other reviews the grounds are well maintained and breakfast is excellent, it is also well publicised how helpful and cheerful the staff are but you have to experience it to fully appreciate this.

We stayed in a Garden View Villa which is on the beach side of the resort just behind the beach view villas, our accommodation was excellent, the room was very clean and the bed is huge and soooo comfortable.

We were a little concerned from the photographs that the plunge pool would not be long enough or deep enough to swim in we needn't have worried, it is 1.4m deep (about 5tf) and long enough to do about 5-6 strokes, part of the steps down to the pool is a seat which forms the jacuzzi. We were originally going to book a villa in the nearby Samaya, the Seminyak however, was ¬£2,500 cheaper

Having paid the extra for the Villa accommodation with its own pool we obviously wanted to spend a substantial amount of time beside our pool and what really made it for us was that the mini bar was totally free, this included all drinks including 2 cans of Bintang (local larger) and 2 cans of Carlsberg, all snacks including chocolate bars were also free and the mini bar was re stocked daily this was absolutely fantastic and unexpected, i have previously been on two all inclusive holidays before this and on both the mini bar were either only party included or not at all.

We went white water rafting and on an Elephant safari which were both excellent especially the rafting, however, be aware that on completion you will have about 400 steps to climb ( i couldn't walk for 4 days afterwards).

A few little gripes that were absolutely nothing to do with the hotel:
1) The queues at the airport for visas, the longest i have experienced, so once you are off the plane get to customs asap.
2) You have to pay 25 US Dollars per person to get into the country and then 200,000RU to get out when you leave, so make sure you put that to one side.
3) Be wary of the porters at the airport, they are really keen to collect your bags for you, but demand a tip, which is fine, we gave 2 porters 100,000RU each (about ¬£5 each) however, they said this was not enough and wanted more and when we said they were not getting anymore they then asked for either US Dollars or English sterling, you can imagine what our answer was, they may have been a couple of rogues but on our return to the airport we decided we were quite capable of pulling our own cases.
3) There is a new hotel opening shortly, so they have got locals on mopeds and on the streets with scratch cards (and of course you win a prize) this is very annoying.

Seminyak has a wide range of places to eat, the first few days we ate at our hotel paying 1.2m RU KU DE TA 1.5m and the Breeze @ the Samaya 1.8m for two courses and two drinks you will pay much less on the strip off Seminyak Square, for value we thought you could not beat the Ultimo (italian) we went on three nights altogether and the bull ranged from 400RU to 600RU, the free bread sticks and garlic butter are to die for.

Bali is a fantastic country full of culture and the people are really friendly and i would certainly return",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2710,POSITION,40,October 2014,"Great position on Seminyak beach next door to Kudeta, in walking distance to many great restaurants. Hotel staff are always smiling and offer great service. Wifi is slow and patchy, in urgent need of an upgrade. Breakfast options become a bit boring after a 10 day stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2711,Sheer luxury,50,October 2014,"A fantastic hotel and grounds. Excellent location, fantastic rooms, grounds and gardens immaculate, infinity pool lovely and clean and cheerful, helpful, happy staff who can't do enough for you. 10/10.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2712,A wonderful place to stay,50,October 2014,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in October 2014. The welcoming on arrival was absolutely wonderful, the staff were extremely helpful and courteous at all times. The room was fantastic with a great view of the gardens and the sea, the cleaniness of the room was the best we have ever experienced, the hospitality staff were so professional and friendly. The facilities are first class and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. You are greeted with a smile and a welcome back everytime you return, you are treated like royality. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, we will definately be staying there again next year. A massive thanks to all the wonderful staff.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2713,Lovely Hotel with kind and welcoming staff,40,October 2014,"My friend and I stayed at the The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for a week in October and this hotel is wonderful. We requested 2 beds and I was pleasantly surprised that the 2 beds were queen size and not single beds. The breakfast is amazing with everything included, both of us went for the local offerings like the congee, the nasi goreng but there was also eggs and continental style food.
The only thing is the noise, we were in the garden wing and the street is a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper I would recommend asking for a room on the other side of the corridor which I assume are not as noisy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2714,Worth the price,50,October 2014,"Great resort in nice calm and peaceful surroundings with the outdoor restaurant and infinity pool leading straight on to the white sand beach. Clean and modern rooms with good 24 hour room service. Friendly staff and good cuisine. The resort is about 5 minutes walk to a street lined with fairly trendy bars and restaurants, with boutique shops too. This place is great if you want to avoid the touristy crowds of Kuta and Legian and are looking for something a little more classy.

Overall well worth the price.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2715,Super friendly staff!,40,October 2014,"The staff members were among the best we ever had! They do everything with a natural smile and strong desire to provide the best service. The only bad apple was the restaurant manager but the restaurant waitresses made it an unforgettable experience. The only downside is the breakfast buffet. This isn't what you expect from a tropical hotel where we expected mouth watering fruits not such a limited options with some fruits being so tasteless. The rooms are always clean, spacious and comfy. Highly recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2716,Garden Rooms,40,October 2014,"We stayed in the rooms across the road and although I feel like we missed a bit of the feel of the place it was also balanced by the fact that we had the pool by our rooms almost to ourselves. Felt like we were in a villa with our own private swimup bar and barman! The staff were excellent, breakfast was great, couldn't fault the place although next time I will try for the other rooms (they were completely booked out and the rooms were booked were the only ones left!)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2717,A pity on the service by the pool,30,October 2014,"I am a frequent visitor to Bali and know the Seminyak neighbourhood very well. I've stayed in the other hotels next door and know what a truly 5-star hotel can offer in terms of service. I chose to stay here because it's the least expensive hotel on this stretch of the beach. And I guess it is certainly within my moderated expectation.

There's no argument about its location. To me, it's the best. Breakfast is above average with good selection (although the breakfast next door is legendary, not a comparable benchmark :-))

What I feel is the most lacking is service. Most of the service staff are not very fluent in English. What's most disappointing is the pool-side service, which is almost nil. Water and extra towels need to be self-serviced. Drinks and food menu are very limited in choices.

And because we were not impressed and confident with the breakfast and pool side food quality, we didn't eat here for lunch or dinner.

Overall, it's a pleasant stay but nothing to shout about beside its location, which is within expectation.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2718,Great relaxing getaway,50,October 2014,"Went there for 11nights and ut was perfect.
Not cheap, but if you're looking for a good 4 or 5* hotels, that's the price you oay nowadays in bali....
Location great, right on the beach with a nice large infinitypool.
Breakfast is karge and really international.
Rooms are still in very good shape, large, good working aircon, superb bed (matress) .
Overall great place and nothing to complain",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2719,Paradise,50,September 2014,"Excellent hotel all round - staff, sevice, facilities, location. We enjoyed two first-rate themed nights. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Pool was a good size for swimming, especially as the sea is too rough for safe swimming. Spacious well-manicured gardens, all kept impeccably clean.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2720,All the positive things are null and void due to the lack of service and competence of the staff,30,October 2014,"It was the first step of my honeymoon, hotel was well situated on a nice beach, nice private villa on beach border and friendly staff...
BUT
The toilet was not flushing properly: flushing 5 times in a row each times you want everything to be gone is not romantic at all ( called 4 times for them to fix it ), they kept coming....but nothing changes
The AC was leaking on the floor in bedroom
There is a nice bathtub...but not enough of hot water to fill it, so cold bath or no bath.
We ordered the romantic dinner ( preset menu ).....we have been waiting almost 1h for the first course to arrive ( in the same time that appetizer, amuse bouche, water and bread ), then the champagne arrived competent warm...
We also decided to book a couple massage, we were so bored, no vibe...we had a way better one for $5 on the beach ( against $200 for their )
And to finish, when I checked out, we had a $25 voucher for the massage, they refused to apply it cause we should have gave it before the massage. I just spent $5000 at their place, having a very bad experience and they refused a $25 voucher!!!
So I left without signing the bill, emailed the management and they said they will come back to me.....instead they charged my card without my autorisation....so wrong
The place could be so nice, but they need to completely change the management and educate the staff ( it s a 5*, so open the door to the guest, pull their chair when they sit down, and make sure they always have water in their glass should be the minimum )
Just go finish on a positive note, they have always been friendly ( which makes it difficult to get angry ) and the breakfast was very nice.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2721,"Average resort, great location",40,October 2014,"The Seminyak Beach Resort is nice hotel - old Balinese style, clean, average food, nice spa, very helpful staff, but nothing that makes it really stand out. We upgraded to an Ocean View Suite which was worth it as you get a small balcony and a lovely view of the ocean (ask for a 3rd floor room). The location is the best part of the resort, as you're right on the beach, and can easily walk to bars, restaurants and shopping.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2722,Seminyak beach resort and spar,40,October 2014,"Beautiful hotel with lovely employees . Rooms gorgeous and hotel so accessible to great restaurants, shopping and the beach is the backdrop to the pool.Spar also wonderful.
Would definitely stay here again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2724,Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,40,September 2014,"This is a great location in Seminyak - close to shops if you needed to pursue such activity. The hotel was very well maintained both inside and around the pool & grounds. From our room we had views of the lovely gardens and beach. The pool was brilliant and had lots of deck chairs for sunbathing - and great service for drinks / nibbles and also pool towels. The staff were also extremely polite and very helpful - indeed impressive service!

Overall, a great stay at a venue which was next to the Ku De Ta restaurant and a short distance to Potato Head club (the latter makes for a great day for families).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2725,Great experience with the Seminyak,50,October 2014,The location of the hotel is great - the beach side with KuDeTa on the left and the Potato Head on the right. Hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I definitely will come back - and request a room on the sea front.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2726,Nice Hotel,50,February 2014,"Went with my girlfriend for a trip. It costs about 300 over sgd. I love the infinity pool and the proximity to Ku De Ta. We went there at night, just walk across the beach.
It is definitely a very nice experience for couples.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2727,Great stay,50,October 2014,"Fantastic, very helpful staff. Beautiful grounds and pools. Location close to shopping and great restaurants - walking distance. Stunning outlook from pool onto beach. We stayed in the building across the road, there was no hassle in accessing the main building for breakfast and using the pool. Highly recommend!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2728,A real Bali flavour,50,September 2014,"Lovely stay,quick and attentive service but what I loved the most was the infinity pool area followed by the seminyak beach...could have spent the entire day there.
Spa options and fitness rooms were an added and a great plus",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2729,excellent retreat,50,October 2014,"excelent hotel, incredible poor area, also good for swimming early morning, very nice garden, breakfast also very good. the staff is very friendly, the area has some very good restaurants to over, all in all: would love to go back soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2730,Lovely.,50,September 2014,"Lovely old charming hotel, with the most beautiful and accommodating staff. Well priced considering it sits between The Legian and Oberoi hotels. Close to Seminyak Square and shopping precinct

2731,Great Hotel,40,September 2014,"This hotel has their own beach, lounge, good breakfast, great hospitality.
Overall i really love this hotel either for my husband and my 4yo daughter.
The minus was only i got the room that separated from the main building, so i have to across the road. But still, loves everything about this hotel. Luxurious!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2732,Very welcoming and comfortable,50,September 2014,"Had to make a last minute booking here after out other accommodation fell through. When we showed up at the resort it turned out the room we had booked was also fully booked. The pleasant surprise came when we were informed we would be upgraded to the beach front villa. After a full day of travelling and not being able to settle into our first accommodation this was a welcome relief and we are very grateful! Overall the staff are delightful and happy to assist with any need. The breakfast was great, spa was very good (although more expensive than outside the resort) and the facilities were well kept. There is a nice peace and quiet here with the sound of the ocean and even though it was at capacity it doesn't feel like there are too many people. Convenient location to walk to shops and restaurants let alone the beach on your doorstep. Would stay again. Thank you to all the staff who made it a great stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2733,Lovely hotel and great place,50,April 2014,"I went on my honeymoon and stayed at the Seminyak and we both loved it! The room was perfect and we even got a honeymoon cake!

The staff at reception were very friendly and knowledgeable.

Breakfast was really yummy and the pool area was never busy so we always managed to get a chair.

I would suggest staying in the main hotel too, the garden rooms aren't that far but it's just the inconvenience really. It's better to be in the main hotel.

The area around the hotel is great too so make sure you go and explore. Lots of lovely restaurants close by too, my favourites were the burger place in the square, Sarong (make sure you book as it's v popular) and Khaima (the best beef randang I've ever had)!

Also ku de ta is just next door so that's handy and potatoe head isn't that far either!

Would definitely recommend! Make sure you go visit the rice fields and the waterfall in the north of Bali.

It's so cheap you can get a massage everyday!!

2737,Theft,10,August 2014,"Do not stay in this hotel, the staff steal. A dress went missing. I confronted the staff several times. The dress was never returned. The food is average too and the service is slow. There are many other better hotels to stay at.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2738,All Excellent,50,September 2014,"Everything about our stay was excellent. Amazing value, location and facilities. We stayed in the garden room which is located just across the road. A short 75 metre walk to breakfast. Breakfast buffet was incredible and the coffee excellent. We will return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2739,Lovely luxury,50,November 2013,"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights in a beach view suite with our 7yo daughter. Unfortunately our daughter was omitted from the booking somewhere between Agoda and the resort however staff made up the daybed for her at no extra cost. The staff were very professional and accomodation, always remembering our names and made our daughter, who was the only child in the resort, feel very welcome.

The kids club and fitness classes weren't running so we were slightly disappointed but the pool was great and we ended up doing a lot more sightseeing than we had planned. The suite was beautiful! Very luxuriously finished and the bed was very comfortable. The wifi wasn't great but not bad either. The only negative thing I could say was that the spa bath was really quite dirty but otherwise everything was perfect and exactly what you'd expect of this calibre resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2740,A touch of paradise...,50,September 2014,Excellent resort. For four days it felt like we were in paradise. Beautiful and romantic location. Very friendly staff. We loved breakfast and restaurant. The pool area and beach acces are great. Room service was impeccable.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2741,No hot water in beach wing,40,September 2014,We have just spent 5 nights at this hotel and it was lovely except for the fact that there was no hot water. The manager offered to change our room but we were happy with our position... a beach wing room looking over the ocean. Very convenient and great to be able to walk out to the pool. But in a hotel with top rates it is unfortunate that the hot water problem cannot be fixed. The manager conceded as we checked out that it was a serious concern for the hotel and that she hoped it would be fixed by the time we visited again! So lovely hotel in nearly every way but be warned that Beach wing rooms have Luke warm to cold water.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2742,Seminyak Beach Resort,50,September 2014,"Fantastic hotel, staff were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. Very welcoming and top notch service. We had a beach view room and everything was 1st class. Food was great, the seafood buffet was brilliant, lobster, giant prawns and anything you wanted and as much as you wanted. Take your life in your hands if you venture out with the traffic - but the restaurants in Seminyak are worth the risk. We went to Chandri and Bambu - both highly recommended.
We will be back and will stay at the Beach Resort again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2743,Relaxxxxxx,50,September 2014,"We spent a week here every day was perfect-staff is friendly, helpfull and always eager to help. Having the room with view to the ocean added to our wonderful experience!

2745,Perfection,50,September 2014,"Recently stayed here for five nights, cannot rate this hotel and all the staff highly enough. It is immaculately clean and the food in the restaurant is superb.

2746,FAMILY HOLIDAY IN BALI,50,September 2014,Great Location and waterfront. Walking distance to shops and Restaurants.The interconnecting rooms were spacious and close to the amenities. The Buffet Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection. Stay at the property with the Beach.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2747,Great First Anniversary,50,July 2014,"Stayed here with my husband for 9 nights 10 days in the garden wing. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome. We were greeted as we arrived in the car and given a flower necklace and a refreshing ginger tea. The check in went smoothly and we were driven in the buggy over the road to the garden wing. Now this is literally about a minute walk away and the security guards were very helpful in helping you cross the road.

The room was gorgeous and coming from Dubai we do have high expectations. The room was modern yet charming with a fantastic bathroom with bath and shower. The only thing I will say is the bath does take around 30 minutes to fill enough for a bath!

The room was cleaned well every day and offered a turn down service which was lovely and made the room so homely. I will also add that I was pretty sick whilst in the room and housekeeping were fantastic cleaning up so we could bed down for the night. Also the night I was very sick the hotel arranged for a doctor to come out and also kept offering me toast or porridge to help settle my stomach. They definitely went over and above.

The breakfast was a good offering - wide range of cereals, fresh fruit, pastries, waffles, pancakes, cooked items - different styles, cheese, cold meat etc. The egg station we had a few issues with with poached eggs - either under done, over done or broken. I pointed this out to the restaurant manager at the time and he offered to make me another egg and look at the way the egg station ran. Also the plates are not cleared quickly when guests have finished each part of their breakfast. The other point to note here is topping up of water once you have finished a glass another glass should be offered. I most note that they were very good with offering tea and coffee and an additional tea and coffee.

The location is fantastic - conveniently located for good restaurants and right on the beach. Also the hotel was great with helping us get reservations in a range of restaurants in Seminyak. One night we were running late as our safe malfunctioned however the hotel were great sending someone up to fix the safe and picking us up outside the door and driving us the the restaurant constantly calling them to ask them to hold the table - this was definitely over and above.

Overall we had a great time here and I must mention that when I contracted Bali Belly the hotel were absolutely fantastic looking after me and helping me with doctors etc...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

Great evening meal location overlooking the beach. All round very impressed and would certainly go back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2750,Paradise Seminyak Beach View,40,August 2014,"Great location at Seminyak. Infinity pool with beach view. You can swim at the beach back and forth to the pool. it is very convinient.
The room is very spacious and nice.

Do not stay at the Garden Wing. It is at the opposite side of the street. You have to walk acrross the street to go to the pool or the beach. I don't understand why they put the Garden Wing separately. It is not comfortable for the guests. And They don't mentioned it on booking.com or any other site. They should mention it everywhere that the GARDEN WINGS are accross the street, outside the main building.

They have a romantic wedding room.
The Receptionist people are very friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2751,Beautiful location but not worth the money,40,September 2014,"This place is lovely and has a great location, but I've stayed in much nicer places with friendlier staff for half the price I paid here.

2753,Amazing location....great resort!,50,September 2014,A big thankyou for making our getaway so special. The only one issue I have is I belive prices for food and drink are expensive if they were more competitive with other good quality restaurants in the area we would have spent more time at the resort.

Complimented by excellent facilities (the infinity pool on the beach was a dream), and the friendliest staff we have encountered in Bali made for a wonderful stay. Highly recommended !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2755,Beautiful Hotel,40,September 2014,"Great experience upon arrival, you are greeted with very friendly staff, a welcome drink, cold flannel and hula flowers.

The rooms are lovely - ours was decorated with petals as we were celebrating our anniversary. Rooms are very big and spacious - we had a great view from our balcony looking over the beach.

I did upgrade the room a week or so before travelling, as the reviews of the garden side put me off - although it is literally across the road I am very glad that I upgraded as I don't think you would feel part of the hotel if staying on the garden side.

The grounds are very beautiful - I would say one of the best I had seen in Seminyak from that point of view.

For me the downside, which let the hotel down was the service at breakfast - the staff although very friendly as always just couldn't get it right. Service was very slow... Whether it be you waiting for a glass so you can get a drink, a knife, butter - just leave this out for guests to get themselves considering the slow service! First day was the only day it was right - you went up to get your eggs cooked etc - the next day this was taken away.....instead it was by menu - which we found out after eating the buffet!! The breakfast unfortunately was not 5*, I really regret this but feel I should be honest.

There were a few others factors that meant this hotel wasn‚Äôt quite at the 5* mark:

*stains on beach towels - I mean big hair-dye like stains
*thin grey looking bath towels that had seen better days - at the other hotel's I stayed at on this trip we had white fluffy towels
*thin/cheap dressing gowns
*think more staff are needed around the pool....for drinks etc

I get annoyed when people write petty reviews, but when you are paying the price I paid and comparing to the other hotels I stayed at while in Singapore and Hong Kong, you do really notice the flaws.

It made me think with having paid the extra for the room upgrade should I have just stayed at the Legian...

Highly recommend the Breeze restaurant at the Samaya.

Overall - a beautiful hotel, very friendly staff - spa looked gorgeous! There are just a few teething problems.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2756,Pretty average and not value for money.,30,September 2014,"The Good:
Great location on a quiet stretch of the beach.

Great infinity pool that looks onto the beach - the promotional pictures reflect reality.

Rooms were spacious; the bed was super comfortable.

Near some fantastic restaurants.

The bad:
No hot water in the evenings meant that baths were not possible.

The breakfasts were average for 5* hotels in the Far East (read that breakfast was good but not great). They accidentally served raw chicken one morning that I was there - unacceptable.

Some things about breakfast bugged me - e.g. They didn't serve eggs benedict with ham - only bacon (somehow it ruined the eggs benedict) and the hollandaise sauce was unbelievably heavy.

I don't know why they couldn't serve the pancakes or waffles with plain syrup. It wasn't even an option - the alternatives, whilst possibly appealing to others just didn't do it for me. Why fiddle with classics?!

We asked for a recommendation for a seafood restaurant: we were advised to go to Jimbaran by the hotel concierge and the hotel driver took us to a restaurant that fleeced us - we were told that we ate 3kg of seafood between the two of us which was impossible. I take part of the blame for not researching this more - a simple internet search reveals this scam at Jimbaran is common, however, I would have thought that the hotel would have been looking out for me given that it was their recommendation.

Overall: Average experience (albeit on the good side of average) for the price. Some things mentioned above let the hotel down. I can't recommend this hotel to my friends I'm afraid as I've had much better experiences elsewhere. Nor will I return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2757,Absolutely Stunning - Highly Recommend,50,September 2014,"From the moment we walked in, we were 'wowed'.
The staff were friendly
The breakfast was amazing
The pool was deep, warm and fantastic, heaps of sunbeds
Most importantly, the room was amazing. It was the most well appointed room I've ever stayed in. The ceilings were high, and it was just massive. Very very happy indeed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2758,Seminyak Resort and Spa.,40,September 2014,"I was travelling with a friend and our experience here was lovely.

2760,The perfect Romantic getaway weekend ..,50,September 2014,"As someone who usually works on the weekend, whenever I have one off I'm always keen to spoil myself and head somewhere truly fabulous. Words cannot express how perfect this past weekend was for me.

Me and my boyfriend booked ourselves into the Seminyak Beach Resort on Saturday morning, and were greeted by some wonderful hotel staff who made us feel totally relaxed as soon as we stepped into the hotel. Since we were too early to check in, we had a wander around the hotel grounds which truly took our breath away; the attention to detail is second-to-none.
We enjoyed a lazy afternoon by the pool which is located on the beach - superb. After having some delicious lunch at the hotel (at a very reasonable price), we wandered through the town and had a look at some very cute boutique shops.

Our hotel room was devine - we were staying in the Deluxe Beach Suite overlooking the sea on level 3. It was equipped with everything and more - even a jacuzzi! We had a great evening in the jacuzzi, watching the rugby on the TV and looking out onto the sunset - pure bliss.

Breakfast is amazing, and I especially recommend the eggs Benedict. So good I had it both days we were there! We also used the gym which has got everything you need, and it is all very new equipment which we liked.
Sadly we had to leave on Monday but our flight wasn't until the evening, and so the hotel very kindly let us spend the whole day there whilst storing our luggage for us, and even set up a room for us to shower in before we leave around 8pm.

This weekend was expensive, but my how it was worth it. If you're looking for something a little special, stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2761,Absolutely beautiful!,40,June 2014,"This resort is really something!
I am always a huge fan of white beaches but this resort is located right in front of the breathtaking Bali beach. You will never want to leave the place once you get there.

The infinity pool that has the view of the big waves is just so relaxing.
We have booked The Room Beach Wing and we had a corner room.
Everything was great except for the last night. The room was not well cleaned, probably they knew that we will be checking out the next day. But I believe that is not an excuse for not grooming the room properly.
Everything else is great.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2762,One of the best hotels EVER,50,September 2014,"The Balinese staff are the jewels in the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa crown. Apologies for waxing poetic but it is absolutely true. Our stay at this hotel was greatly improved by the wonderful staff. We leave tomorrow (yes, we're still here) and barring an unlikely occurrence, believe this to be one of the finest hotels we've ever been to. Our room is in the beach wing with a great view of the Indian Ocean. The room is sizeable, has a beautiful bathroom and a nice, private terrace. The gardens here are superb. The staff are out at the crack of dawn to rake and tidy the grounds, really quite spectacular. There are several pools, each close to the beach and viewing the ocean. You can get tasty treats by the pool, which certainly heightened my holiday spirit as it allowed me to stay in bathing suit rather than go out for lunch.

Food at Seminyak: breakfast has been divine, varied and exhaustive. If you go away hungry it will be your own fault! Cannot give a glowing report for dinner, however. Many shared my view it seemed since we dined alone in the big dining room on the single night we ate at the Seminyak. Cheaper and better dinners can be found in Seminyak. Bonus? We are right next door to Ku De Ta. Excellent, if pricy food, at that location for sure.

If you are looking for a hotel that is perfectly situated in Seminyak, look no further. It's all right here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2763,Lovely location,40,August 2014,"We spent 3 nights in the hotel and must say it is beautiful, although worth the money, not sure. Arrival was seamless, breakfast good, room beautiful although I felt a little tired. The pool is divine and it is just wonderful to laze around and watch the sunset.
Must say disappointed in the service around the pool area, didn't seem to see anyone going round asking if you wished to order a drink, lunch etc.
What spoilt our stay was that we had no working shower for the time we were at the hotel. Management were very pleasant and did compensate us but would rather have had a hassle free stay.
Great location on the beach",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2764,Extremely friendly and helpful staff,50,September 2014,"We had 10 days in this hotel with our 1 year old and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I found the staff to be very aware of guests and worked hard to build a relationship with us and particularly our baby. Although not an overly child-friendly hotel we were very well looked after and the hotel has a lovely babysitter we used a number of times. Originally in an Ocean Room, we paid for an upgrade to a suite after the first night as the room was too small for 2 adults and a cot but the suite was much more comfortable. Breakfast was included in the price we paid and was definitely worth it. We used the spa and it was amazing, each of us had a massage and I had a facial, a very relaxing experience. We used the pool everyday, usually eating there also during the day.

Although not the newest hotel and I do think they should price themselves more competitively, the overall experience was superb and I would book to stay at the Seminyak again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2765,Bali revisited,50,August 2014,"Recently stayed at this resort, beach side. It was a fabulous experience.. Room were lovely and cleaned every day.

2767,A very relaxing hotel with beautiful sunsets...,50,August 2014,"We (my husband, my 8year old daughter and myself) very much enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak. Everything was perfect and the staff very friendly and accommodating . Would go back any time.

Highlights of the hotel:
- The infinity pool.. I usually do not like pools but the pool was really lovely and the ocean view from the pool was great.
-Watching The sunset every evening ..Awesome.. I miss that!!!
- The beach side Villas with a private pool are beautifully planned and furnished.
- The green gardens in the hotel call for relaxation and mediation.
- The hotel has the right size - not too big and not too small . Perfect.

Thank you ""Seminyak hotel"" for making our stay special.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2768,The Amazing Spa!,50,August 2014,"I stayed at this resort for 2 weeks more for my long holiday. Everything in this resort was good, but the best of all was the spa. Their spa was very beautiful, the treatment was great, the ladies were gorgeous, the massage lesson was wonderful. I kept wondering why the spa was so outstanding until I met the Spa Director. A humble lady, I talked with her. She didn't talk to much, but she really could make the guests comfortable and feel like home by the way she treated us. She was taking good care to everything. And the amazing one was, she didn't stay in the spa for a whole day. Within my two weeks, I saw her at the main lobby in the morning, at the infinity pool in the afternoon, at the restaurant in the evening, and even one night when I came back from the outside hotel, I met her at the rooms corridor on 1 AM in the morning! When I have checked out, and was waiting for my friend in the lobby, nobody farewell me, but she came and farewell me with her unique way. Thank you so much, Madam Juni! Definitely I'll come back to this resort in my next holiday!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2769,Lovely hotel,40,August 2014,"Stayed here with my wife second week of August this year. The drive from airport is a bit of a drag due to traffic but not the hotels fault. It took us just over an hour in the afternoon. The hotel welcome was lovely with the customary flowers and cold flannel. Check in was very easy even though we made a special request for the top floor of the garden block. We had to wait a bit as they had to make the room up but gave us a complementary drink whilst we waited. Note there is no lift in the garden block but it's only 3 floors.
As said in many reviews the road between the two blocks is busy but the security guards are fanatic at making sure they stop all traffic for you and are very friendly. Initially we were not sure about staying in the garden but it was absolutely fine.
The room are large and very nicely laid out with big comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms.
All staff in the hotel were very accommodating and friendly.
Beds by the pool do go early so be prepared.
On a side note it's much easier to visit the bars by walking up or down the beach. Ignore Ku De Ta as there are much better less pretentious bars further down.
The bars around Seminyak square were busy and on the street. All a bit tacky compared to the beach bars. The food in the restaurants in the food market were excellent and excellent value.
All in all a lovely hotel in a brilliant beach location.very safe and you feel very well looked after.
Seminyak is slovenly but a bit touristy for me and Kuta was just chaos. But it depends on what your after.
Tip: ask the hotel to arrange a car and driver for the day and get out of the tourist area and see the real Bali, it's beutiful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2770,Amazing location. Lay back and relax,40,August 2014,"If you want a real holiday away from everything this is the place. Soooooo quiet hard to believe it is booked out when there doesn't seem to be too many people around.....except when you are trying to get a sun bed by the infinity pool . We upgraded to beachside after reading Trip Advisor. thanks !best $200 US we spent. All staff very friendly and accommodating. bring your own mugs if you like a mug of coffee and not a thimble. A couple of concerns that were addressed immediately like DVD not working. Very short walk into eating precinct. Directly next door to Ku De Ta and a lovely stroll along the beach to Potato Head.
Will definitely be coming again soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2771,Highs and lows,30,August 2014,"First the positives - beautiful pool, right on the beach. You can laze about in the water and watch the surfers or enjoy the view at sunset. Buffet breakfast was very nice, staff were super lovely (particularly to our baby) and the room was pretty big and comfortable.

Negatives - we booked into the ""Garden Wing"", which isn't a wing and doesn't have a garden. It is a separate building across and slightly down the street, which feels like it used to be a separate hotel. Actually, it feels like it's still a separate hotel.... one with no lifts. We were climbing up to the 3rd floor with a baby, stroller etc. We ended up going down for breakfast and packing for the whole day out so that we wouldn't have to go back to the room (although in fairness walking from the pool it's only about 5 mins, and their staff help you cross the street). I chatted to someone who'd stayed in the Garden Wing and then paid to move to the Beach Wing, and I think that must be quite common because you do feel a bit like a second class citizen.

Also, check-in was very painful, somethings had gone wrong which meant that they didn't have our room available, they somehow hadn't realised there was a problem until we tried to check in, but they then had to spend 3.5hrs resolving it. Very disappointing as we'd arrived after a long car journey with our 10 month old, desperate to chuck our stuff in the room, get some lunch and hit the pool. After an hour they told us we'd be in a twin room for the first 2 nights and then upgraded to the Beach Wing for the last 3 nights. I didn't see that the upgrade for 3 nights balanced out the downgrade for 2 nights, and Twin beds are completely impractical for us as our baby often sleeps between us. It wasn't until 2.5hrs after arriving that the Manager came and told us we could go to the pool while they sorted it, we eventually got to the pool about 5.30pm! The Manager did handle things well and gave us complimentary dinner that night, which was a very nice gesture, but unfortunately it doesn't make up for the wasted afternoon when you've only got a few days somewhere, and you're paying $300+ a night for it.

Also, don't get excited about the bowl of ""tropical fruit"" on arrival - ours was a pile of apples.

Only other thing is it's a shame there's really no shaded area over the pool, especially tricky with kids.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2772,Beachfront and Central but Older and Not Cheap,40,June 2014,"I came to Bali not quite expecting just how huge the island is! We stayed in Nusa Dua for the first four nights of our 12 night stay and it took one hour by cab to get to the shops and restaurants in Seminyak. I would say Seminyak is definitely the pulse of Bali as far as boutique shopping and nice eats so if you are looking for central accommodations, definitely book here.

We decided to spend our last two nights in Seminyak at The Seminyak and while the property was nice, it wasn‚Äôt a wow. It seems just slightly below luxurious, despite commanding a luxury hotel rate. Overall, though, the stay was good, the pool area was very nice, complimentary breakfast offered plenty of choices, service was gracious and above all, location was excellent. It was walking distance to the main drag and neighbours some top-end hotels and famous beach clubs.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2773,not happy,30,July 2014,"Stayed for four nights July 2014.Asoundingly beautiful place. Breakfast to die for. Staff like all of Bali were great. Room was beautiful, beach wing. Now for the bad news. No hot water on day one. Complained told it was fixed. Day two no hot water. Complained, sent the ""engineer"". Day three, you guessed it, no hot water. I had a cold shower once again then went to reception and escalated politely. The manager was apologetic. I suggested that perhaps my wife could use a spare room to have a shower. He hadn't thought of that and said one was close by and he would ring. One hour later, no call. I rang. Still finding room. Fifteen minutes later a young girl came and escorted us to a room a long way from our room but it had hot water. Day four, HOT WATER! Prices at this place are astounding. So overpriced for what you get. Must say though that the WIFI is by far the best I have experienced in Bali. To their credit they offered us a free massage or a free evening meal to make it up but this was only after we filled in their review critically but we declined as we wanted out of there. But oooh the breakfast!! Amazing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2774,Sunset at the Legion Spa Hotel,50,August 2014,Perfect tranquil sunset while on the Terrace enjoying English tea! We travelled to Seminyak to watch the sunset but it was an hours queue wait at The Potato Head Club on the beach front. So we walked 10 minitues to the Spa Hotel. What a delightful experience. Tranquil 5star beachfront hotel with an infinity pool sinking into the beach,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2775,Bali trip June 2014,40,June 2014,"Very nice hotel with excellent price/quality. We stayed for 10 days with wife and daughter in 2 rooms. At arrival staff was very helpful and friendly. Although arriving a bit early we could already have 1 room available so we could change and go to the pool. Pool is very nice with a great view of the nice beah and ocean. Breakfast was excellent with its of choose. As location this hotel is perfect only walking distance from all nice restaurants and bars in the area. Ku De Ta and Potato Head are a must to go and have a drink and diner. Also nice for lunch !! We never had diner at the hotel as there are so many fine local places around but lunch at the pool was perfect !! Most people at the pool are couples so always very quiet.
Some minor remarks :
- Airco in room was leaking and sometimes smelling a bit. I think this is a general issue as we say staff working and cleaning leaks at several places in the hotel.
- Pool bar is a bit hidden behind the Wedding Chapel so not really a swim-up pool bar.
- If staf is preparing for a wedding it takes while before you can find someone the the pool to order a drink.
- The hotel tries to organise nice evenings (BBQ, Diners, etc) but should communicate this better. They do a huge effort but not much people join these events as we only found out in the evening. A shame for all their effort made. Communication to every guest personally would be helpful.

All in all a very nice and relaxed stay and a nice hotel with great and helpful staff !!!

Would definitively recommend and stay again !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2776,On the Beach in a great location,40,July 2014,"We wanted a week away with warm weather and beach for my wife and myself. After searching around online we got a deal here in the off peak season and stayed in a beautiful room in the garden apartments across the road from the main hotel. This area had its own pool and pool bar which was rarely used as most people preferred to be in the infinity pool on the beach. The walk to the main area was not hard or inconvenient but the hotel did have a golf cart for those to lazy to take the 20 second walk.
The buffet breakfast was included as part of the deal and was excellent providing plenty of variety.
The sunset over the beach was romantic and they even held a wedding their one night. The hotel also had a cocktail function one night so that you could meet other guests staying at the resort.
We generally stayed around Seminyak eating at many of the great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel including Merah Putih, Sarong, Ko De Ta, Potato Head, La Lucciola and Salt. We also had the sea food buffet at the resort one night. All in all the food is reasonably priced but they get you with the alcohol.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2777,Good choice if you can get a deal.,40,July 2014,"This enormous hotel is right on the beach in a great convenient spot in Seminyak. The lovely infinity edge pool is perched right on the interface between the beach and the hotel so you can swim and still feel as though you are at the beach without dealing with the pollution of the ocean there, or the rips. Similarly, you can go onto the beach and have a swim very easily if you feel like it. There are great massages available just up from the hotel on the beach in front of the Legian next door. (Bella is the BEST beach massage expert - world class at around $10 for an hour including the beach lounge rental). The hotel is walking distance to lots of great restaurants and shops so really you can just stay put here and never have to fight the traffic and leave Seminyak.

The rooms here are well equipped and have very comfortable beds and good shower and bath. We were very lucky to have probably the best room in the hotel because it was right on the beach. When the sliding doors were open to the verandah it felt like the waves were crashing in to the room. There are only four rooms in the whole hotel like this though - all the rest have a side view of the ocean.

We found the staff very helpful and kind at all times. My daughter had a broken foot and they lent us a wheelchair to get around because the distance from the reception is a long way so it was exhausting on crutches. Our room had some kind of plumbing issue with a bad drain smell in there when we arrived. The room boy was right onto it and had some tricks for making the smell diminish. It never went completely but we kind of got used to it and the room was otherwise very good.

I recommend this hotel for an easy convenient and comfortable place to stay, with good service and lovely pool.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2778,Over- priced - in need of refurbishment,30,July 2014,Wonderful location but our villa was very dated with stained and battered furnishings and full of Mosquitos because all the seals on the bathroom doors were not working. Really not worth the tariff !! Couldn't get a cold beer either!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2779,Nice large rooms,40,October 2013,I stayed with my husband and 8 month old for one night on our way to Gili T. The room was large and facilities were nice. We loved the huge spa bath with a view. The room we stayed in was quite removed from the beach front although we still had a view. We would stay again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2780,Top spot in top location,50,July 2014,"First time to Bali, stayed at The Seminyak for the first 4 nights of our trip. Room, facilties and staff were all very good. The pool area and loungers are a sweet place to chill and relax. Location wise this place its tops - Either side of The Seminyak is great eating, drinking options (Ku De Ta, Potato Head, La Lucciola, Mexicola Etc). We went on to stay in Ubud and Nusa Dua, but would definitely come back to The Seminyak if we had to pick.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2781,Great hotel in Seminyak,50,July 2014,"I've stayed at a lot of Hotels around the World and have a fairly high expectation of service and found The Seminyak Beach Resort to be outstanding.

I stayed there last year for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed the trip and whilst I thought about staying elsewhere this year, I'm glad I didn't - The Seminyak has a great location, the pool is amazing and the service of a high, courteous standard. If only such service existed in Australia....

The Seminyak was busy but was never noisy. The hotel is very spacious and not overly large, so I hardly noticed the other guests.

I found the food generally to be excellent and the bar service great.

The only thing I'd like to see expanded was the size of the fitness centre. Its pretty small but does have everything you need to keep fit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2782,Average stay at average hotel.,30,July 2014,"Myself and my partner have just returned from Bali having spent two weeks there on honeymoon. The first week was spent at the Amana Villa complex in Seminyak which was fantastic, but we wanted to have the second week in a hotel on the sea and the Seminyak Beach Resort looked perfect. First impressions were good, from the location of the hotel, to the look of the room but after the week had ended we left quite disappointed.

The major gripe was that there was no double glazing in the hotel room so all you could hear (apart from doors slamming and the cleaners chatting within the hotel) are car horns and the security guards whistles all day and most of the night. On top of this there was minor building work, which we were not previously told about, going on next door so the noise started at 7am.

Other things that may sound petty to some but should really be better in a 5 star hotel are a poor breakfast, unpredictable wifi, room service plates/ trays left outside rooms all day, wafer thin hard towels, no main lighting in the hotel room (apart from the bathroom) and a cheap hairdryer which kept overheating after 5 minutes use and turning itself off.

The hotel pool in the main part of the hotel is lovely but unless you're prepared to get up at 8am, you'll have no chance of getting a decent sunbed. This may be the case at most hotels but I still think more should be provided, even if some are on the beach. The pool on the garden side of the hotel is also okay, however there are only 6 beds to accommodate approx. 30 rooms.

On a positive note, we stayed in the garden side of the hotel and having read some of the reviews were concerned about the road separating the two sides of the hotel, however there was no issue. The road is quite busy, but there are security guards stood either side of the road all day/ night who will stop the traffic for you to let you cross. The staff at the hotel were also very polite and friendly.

We didn't want to complain during our stay as we were on our honeymoon, I was just going to go through a few things when we checked out but we weren't even asked how our stay was. Sums it all up really.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2783,A relaxing Stay,40,July 2014,My wife and I spent 5 beautiful nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. We are not overly fussy people and found the room very comfortable and the staff very friendly. The lounges around the pool are in high demand so best to get around the pool early.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2784,Great location n staff,50,July 2014,"We are often in Bali (over 50 times) for short breaks we love seminyak for the nightlife and restaurants if we are travelling with friends or family, we stay in Villa accommodation its better for socializing our choice in villas is (Villa Aramanis Seminyak). New and modern with 5 star finishes close to everything lovely staff and in November they will have 4 bed villas available, when traveling by ourselves we like hotels. The hotel is next to Ku De Ta great for breakfast or evening drinks, many great restaurants in seminyak Bambu, Pettingget, Sarong, Mama San, Mosaic, Jemme just to name a few. The Seminyak Resort is clean friendly, G8 location, on the beach lovely staff we cant fault it. We stayed here in July and have already booked for October for 10 nights. We have stayed in all the best hotels in Bali and this is just as good we have no hesitation to recommend this hotel to anyone.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2785,Fabulous staff and location,50,July 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak during July 2014 to celebrate my 40th birthday - just a quick getaway for hubby and I. From our arrival to our departure, we could not have asked for better service or care from the wonderful staff at this resort. We arrived early morning and whilst our room was not yet available (requested a ground floor which they accommodated) another ""hospitality room"" was available for us to use (a king superior room, top floor with Ocean view). We were welcomed with leis, chilled ginger tea, cold towels and chilled water before being taken to our hospitality room. After we freshened up, we headed to Kuta and Legian to knock over our shopping then headed back to the hotel. Our ground floor room was ready and more than we expected with great access to the breakfast restaurant, quiet infinity pool, swim up bar and poolside bales. We enjoyed the sunset poolside/beachside with some cocktails and light tapas dinner from the pool menu. My husband mentioned to Aldi, the wonderful Pool F&B Manager that it was my birthday. Champagne soon arrived and when we returned to our room, my husband answered the door to a beautiful birthday cake arranged by the staff. Rebecca and Marissa at the guest relations desk for arranging day spa reservations and dinner reservations at Starfish Bloo (W Resort). Even though it was a public holiday (end of Ramadan celebrations), they worked tirelessly to find the perfect spa, treatments and reservation times for us at several different spas until the right one was arranged. Executive Sous Chef, Made and staff made sure we had loads of fun at the cooking class and we were thrilled to come home with the recipes to try out ourselves. Agung, our porter, was warm, friendly, efficient and kind. I had the chance to walk and talk a little with Glen, the Training Manager, and passed on my heartfelt appreciation to the staff for making such a special even more special. We are used to the generous, kind and efficient hospitality of the Balinese people but The Seminyak took it to a whole new level for us. We cannot wait to return...but, alas, must save our pennies first. Suksema, Staff @TheSeminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2786,Worked well for our family holiday with kids,40,June 2014,"We stayed in the ""Garden Apartments"" side of the Seminyak, across the road from the main hotel area. I can see why some may complain about getting placed here. However, in our situation we pretty much had a private pool to ourselves there for the kids. We also used the main hotel side as much as the Garden Apartment side and found both to be great.
The staff were all lovely and the location within Seminyak is excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2787,Great!,40,August 2014,"Definitely will miss the place, great service and awesome atmosphere by the beach... A bit overpriced but i guess its well worth it! will definitely come back! It's going to be really hard to accept the real world after having experience like this!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2788,Excellent location and facilities,40,July 2014,"Stayed 6 nights and the location was ideal for exploration of Seminyak and surrounds. However, it was also a fantastic place to relax as it fronts onto the beach, has beautiful large (very well cared for) gardens and a couple of pools, so it is a beautiful oasis isolated from the chaos of Seminyak's retail centre. We were able to choose between hectic retail sessions, trips and excursions or chilling out in/by the pool with a book and a cocktail.
My only criticism was the food - breakfast is very good but dont bother with dinner - there are far better and cheaper alternatives well within walking distance.
Our room over-looked the gardens & restaurant (very quiet at night) and the room itself was huge and quiet...very comfortable. We were on the second floor (beach wing) looking directly west over the gardens and beach so we had beautiful beach sunsets every evening (lots of sunset photos).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2789,Sanje Lounge for Dinner,20,July 2014,"We went there for dinner just this week having read a review in the Magazine Exquisite Taste, unfortunately it was anything but. The Magazine did a review of the Australian Rack of Lamb which we were both looking forward too, unfortunately we had to send them both back as they were both almost raw. This was after having the vegetable spring roll and the crab crocque for starters, oh they were both what you would expect from a frozen pack bought at your local supermarket, we were shocked and did not bother to eat frozen food. The only good thing on the evening was the bottle of Chablis which was most enjoyable.
From the moment we arrived there was something not right, they had a barbi going and tried to get us to eat from the set barbi price menu. There was no one eating in this area. When we said we had a reservation for the Sanje Lounge they moved us to the seaview restaurant which only had about 8 people eating. When we asked why the hotel was so empty they advised there was a big wedding the next day and that the hotel would be closed.

We expected a lot lot more, how disappointing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2790,you won't regret it!,50,July 2014,"Loved my stay at The Seminyak. Right next door to Ku De Ta and just up the beach from La Luciola and Potato Head and W Hotel. Beautiful pool, staff, rooms - I stayed in Garden Wing room and was no problem, just across the street and you are in reception of main hotel, and the breakfast and pool are not far at all. Good breakfast. Illy coffee & well made. Would definitely return and recommend to everyone :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2791,Lovely hotel in the heart of Seminyak that's right on the beach,40,July 2014,"We stayed at the Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort for a total of 3 nights in the high season. It's a large hotel with over 100+ rooms that's conveniently located right on the beach next to Ku Te Da. Our original room was located on the high street which was extremely noisy so the friendly staff were great and helped us move into a beach front room - no traffic noise, only the sound of waves crashing on the sand! It has a great infinty pool looking over the beach.

The rooms were comfortable but rather small. Considering they said the hotel was only renovated 3 years ago, some of the areas already look at bit worn out and dated. It's in an ideal location within a 5 min walking distance to all the bars/restaurants and Ku Te Da is right next door. Although there was no private event at the time, I can only imagine this to be a negative due to the noise, however the management do pre-warn you if there are any major (late) night events taking place.

The pool is located right on the beach which was great if you like to alternate between swimming in the ocean and the pool. It also has a pretty basic gym and a chapel. To my surprise I didn't see very many children at the hotel - mainly couples.

We were a bit disappointed with the breakfast for such a large number of guests - the food seemed a bit old, often cold and not particularly fresh. So we only really had the eggs from the egg station, and toast. However the poolside dining was excellent. We tried the salmon bagel, burger, spring rolls, satays, fresh salads during the course of our stay, and it was all delicious.

Also the hotel doesn't really have a hotel bar. We wanted a drink before dinner and all they had was the pool bar (which you can't sit at unless you're in the pool) and the lobby area. There were some table/chairs on the decking that looks onto the beach where you could order drink service, but not a bar area as such.

A lovely stay if you want hotel style service that's close to all the restaurants and shops in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2792,Beach resort ?,30,July 2014,"We had a great Holiday in Java and Bali.
We choose this hotel to relax a few days before flying back home.

Arriving in the hotel our room was opposit of the main building from the hotel crossed the street.
The rooms are nicely but the location is less !

Coming to the pool all seats where taken. No place to sit or relax !!! We went to the beach and layed down on our towel.
After speaking with the manager we recieved a nice reservated area beside the small pool.

The general impression of the Hotel is that the building is not logically contructed.
If you sit in the restaurant you do not have any view to the garden or even the sea, and for example the pool bar is also on the wrong side of the pool.
In the middle of the two pools they have a kind of building which is very bad situated and was never used for any thing during our stay !

People from the hotel where very helpfull and friendly. If I would go back to Seminyak I would choose another hotel in this price category.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2793,Outstanding resort,50,July 2014,"We went on a second honeymoon for our 15th wedding anniversary, and it was our first time in Bali. The staff at The Seminyak were very pleasant and helpful from first arrival check in to checkout. We had a level 3 suite with stunning views of the beach from our balcony. The breakfast was excellent, with choice of Balinese, western, Japanese and continental cuisines. The staff were very helpful, booking restaurants for us, sharing knowledge about local shopping, and arranging a motorbike hire to scooter around. The location is perfect - right up on the beach front, with a glass windowed chapel for weddings and special occasions, and an infinity pool (approx. 40 metres), to do laps. It helped make it a very special experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2794,Great stay,50,July 2014,"Loved it here. Read previous reviews and thought we'd give this place a crack. Right in the centre seminyak so easy to get around. We had an ocean view room, would consider a room across the road as we didn't stay in our room much and it wasn't that much further away (but a lot cheaper!). Very we'll appointed hotel and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2795,Location location,50,July 2014,"Just spent four days at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. This was my tenth trip to Bali and we decided to stay on the Beach rather than at a villa. Rooms are nicely appointed although small with a lovely view of the gardens. We booked and paid for an ocean view room however you needed to walk out into the gardens to enjoy the view. Would certainly stay there again but would request a room with a view. Location is excellent as restaurants, shops and markets are all within close proximity.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2796,Fantastic holiday. Feeling pampered.,50,July 2014,"Very friendly & accommodating. Set in the heart of Seminyak and close to all that Bali has to offer.
You can enjoy the hustle & bustle of Bali's markets and shops and then return to the sanctuary of this beautiful hotel offering tranquil gardens with day beds, beach access and high quality rooms. Ideal for honeymooners.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2797,Beautiful,40,July 2014,"All was pretty good, but would have been better if the pool bar was in the main pool.
Also this is the only resort I've stayed in that don't do a happy hour with cocktails. They done a free cocktail hour one night, with only 1 type of cocktail.
Also they charged us full price for late check out, even though we had 4 beach wing rooms for 9 nights.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2798,Great relaxing stay,50,July 2014,The resort is beautiful with such friendly staff. I really enjoyed the spa too which had a beautiful view to the ocean from the room. We stayed in the garden wing across the road which was still really nice but be warned there is no lift! All in all a great resort for couples.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2799,Great Place!,50,July 2014,"I just came home from Seminyak, Bali from my honeymoon. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were super friendly, the restaurant's food was absolutely delicious and tasteful, and the rooms were clean. Being located right on the beach, the waves were too strong to go in the water. Although, the pool and day beds offer a great atmosphere to catch some sun. It was not very busy, which was a good thing. The town is beautiful, and the people are the one of the friendliest I have met when traveling. Great luxurious stay, especially for couples!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2800,5 Star Location but not 5 Star Service,30,July 2014,"We stayed here for 4 nights. This was our 3rd visit to Bali and we decided this time to stay on the beach rather than at a private villa. The Seminyak is ideally situated ‚Äì right next door to Ku De Tah, a short stroll to Potato Head Club and La Lucciola and within 10 mins walking distance to Seminyak Square (shops, restaurants).

Our room was simple and quite tastefully decorated ‚Äì we were lucky enough to score a room directly overlooking the beachfront. The bed was super comfortable, slippers, toweling robes, TV, good Wifi etc‚Ä¶all the usual comforts one provided though it would‚Äôve been nice to have an extra set of towels, not just one. Unfortunately, the room and location of hotel were the only highlights about staying here.

When one pays around $400 per night, you expect a certain standard of service. We‚Äôre not talking about being treated like a king but it‚Äôs the little details that count. Like the staff being able to anticipate guests‚Äô needs rather than having to ask for everything:

- The first day, we went to the pool we had to look for staff and ask for a towel. By the time, the staff member came back we were sitting at the pool bar having a drink. He then handed us our towels over the bar and we were expected to carry the towels in the pool over to the other side where we were sitting!

- Every time we went to the pool, there was nobody around to provide us with a complimentary glass of water (one assumes that this is standard for all 5 star resorts. At other resorts, we‚Äôve been almost always given complimentary water, cold towels and refreshing spray). And we had to ask for a menu everytime if we wanted to order something. We shouldn't have to do this.

- Breakfast was nothing exceptional. One day, we were offered tea and coffee, the next day we had to ask for this and water. The following day, we were provided water without asking and offered tea or coffee. The coffee was not good. Someone also needs to train the barista how to make a cappuccino and latte. They both looked the same.

I don‚Äôt blame the staff for this; they were lovely. I blame hotel management for not adequately training their staff properly. During our stay, we took the time to send an email to the hotel GM highlighting some of our concerns but we received no response.

The hotel also does not have enough day beds for their guests and these are reserved early in the morning. Often, we found most beds reserved already. We hate this policy ‚Äì you‚Äôre either there or you‚Äôre not there. We disagree with guests being able to reserve their day bed for what could be 3 or 4 hours until they turned up.

Would we stay here again? Not so sure as there are lots of other choices available which provide better value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2801,Zen Holiday,50,July 2014,"We recently had a week at this resort, what a joy. We had a huge ocean view room, everything was lovely. Staff were amazing, customer service was fantastic from from desk all the way through to the security staff at the front . I was so impressed. Breakfast was lovely with great coffee and hot tea which can sometimes be a little hard to get in some resorts. We will definitely go back to this resort and all the wonderful restraunts in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2802,Helping the environment,50,July 2014,"This was my second visit, this time with my young adult daughters. We were given the most divine room, overlooking the beach, and loved listening to and watching the surf. The pool, grounds and breakfast are divine, but the highlight of the trip was having the opportunity to release baby turtles back into the wild. It's great to see a large hotel doing something for the environment. I found this a truly moving experience. The next thing to work on is all those plastic water bottles - there must be a solution. Thank you again for a wonderful stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2803,"Great unique place, beautiful interior, very helpful staff.",50,April 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak for almost two weeks in an ocean view suite. The Hotel features a beautiful Balinese influenced interior, has a gorgeous landscaped garden, an elegant pool area overlooking the beach and a marvelous spa. It also has an elegant wedding chapel on site facing the ocean. In case you are planning on getting married in an unforgettable, romantic setting...this is THE place to say ""YES"". It also is in walking distance to the village that offers shops, restaurants, bars, night life. The beach is beautiful and clean. Breakfast goes until 11am, which is very nice for us since we love to take it slow in the morning and it also allows you to use the gym or to go to the yoga class with no rush. Breakfast has a huge and delicious selection of 'everything you can think of' and 'everything you can think of' is also very nicely presented. The Santan restaurant is an excellent choice for lunch or dinner. It also offers the setting of ocean front dining, which is not so easy to be found in this area. You HAVE to do this...sunsets in Bali are breathtaking. The rooms are very clean, room service is excellent. A/C is very silent, which we really appreciated since we can't sleep in an noisy environment. The room service also makes sure you will wake up the next day with all your blood, NO mosquito bite will interrupt your good night sleep. WiFi in the room is fast and reliable. The staff is very friendly, very helpful and they all speak excellent english. We were ""First-Timer-Bali"" but with the help and the recommendations of the staff and the concierge we got the best out of it. They organized us everything, tour guide, driver, checked restaurants, tickets... They even got us appropriate cloth to see the ""Melasti ceremony"" (part of the celebration of the Balinese New Year) and not feel out of place! They are self-conscious, young people who are proud of their country and like to explain Balinese life style and traditions. These insights make you feel very welcome and it adds so much to your travel experience. We love this resort and we definitely will come again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2804,Postcard beach setup,40,July 2014,"Not for everyone, as this place has a genuine beach ""flavour"" rather than opulent feel about it. But, it is still very upmarket, and if you like body surfing (or surfing), then walking straight off the beach into a great infinity pool to relax then you will like this place. Smaller than other resorts, TINY gym, but well located to restaurants, although Seminyak is a bit crowded and unpleasant. Free wifi, friendly staff. Over all I would consider staying again, just for the beachy stuff.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2805,Just okay,30,July 2014,My wife and I travel to Bali every 6 months. Normally we stay in Nusa Dua but this time decided to end our trip in Seminyak. Although the Seminyak beach and spa resort was in a good location I really could not see the Value for Money as expressed to Managment. Apart from the checkin staff and the room cleanliness everything else was average,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2807,Beautiful Rooms and Grounds / great location / great service,50,July 2014,"Beautiful Rooms and Grounds. Excellent location right next to kuh de ta beach club, good area for surfing or just drinking by beach. Free and unlimited wifi everywhere, unlike many other hotels that only offered it at the lobby or limited. The service was excellent friendly and attentive. Really stands apart above many other hotels. Ground floor rooms are nice as there is a small lounge area outside every room.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2808,Nice hotel,50,July 2014,Nice place to stay. We have stayed at beach wing and really liked it. Nice pool but it is quite small. Hotel stuff was so calm and friendly. You can enjoy the restaurants around as you can find many tastes.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2809,"Absolutely outstanding, a magical spa resort",50,July 2014,"My husband and I chose this resort 6 months prior to departure for a relaxing getaway from work and the kids. From the moment we were met at the airport we got the five star treatment. A very smiling face from Wayan to welcome us, a comfortable van with our own tv screen and bottled water galore in the van. A short ride to the hotel and we were welcomed with frangipani leis and the most tasty ice tea I've ever had.

We were a few hours early for check in, and although not the hotels fault they were extremely apologetic (unlike our holiday in Hawaii when we had flown a much much longer time to get there) and they promptly organized our welcome massages in the incredible on site spa. A couples massage overlooking the ocean was our next welcome to this resort, the spa itself is truly divine.

We were here for our 6 year wedding anniversary and were informed at check in we were upgraded to a suite room. This was just stunning. I don't want to give too much away, but they really put on the special treatment to make it feel very romantic. We were in room 2302 and had a lovely front on view of the ocean from our bed, balcony or spa. The hotel is only a few years old so I thought all the decor is very new and beautiful.

A few extra points
* Upon losing some money to a dodgy money changer the hotel staff organized security to come with us and we got all our money back. This is one example of how they go above and beyond.
* After eating a very average meal on the streets we decided to get recommendations on where to eat, keen for some good tasting Indonesian food we decided to try our hotel restaurant and the food again was just divine, so delicious and flavoursome and the wait staff so attentive. The resort was apparently full but we didn't feel like it was very busy at all.

In conclusion I'd like to say well done to the architect of the hotel, I really love it, and all the beautiful and kind staff in the hotel and also the spa for the wonderful job they do. I'll definitely be back and recommend to all my family and friends.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2810,Fantastic pool and location,50,July 2014,"We stayed there for four nights, and got upgraded to a villa. Staff were very polite n helpful! Breakfast also quite nice and lots of variety. Location was fantastic, close to the main streets and have Ku de ta right next to it. You can spend your whole afternoon at the Infiniti pool and off to those famous restaurants nearby in the evenings! One thing you need to pay attention is the Mosquitos, guess it is normal in Bali. Apart from that, the hotel is definately a five-star resort!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2811,Tropical oasis right on the beach in gorgeous Seminyak,40,July 2014,"After a long 12 months without a break, constant work, kids, and the routine of getting ahead in life we found the Seminyak to be an oasis of tranquility, good service, good location, and good vibes.

The rooms were excellent. Room service excellent. There's an infinity pool that's the highlight of hotel (if you like a pool and time in the sun) then this is the pool for you. We spent 75% there. A special shout out to ""Suparman"" the pool service guy. Yes that's his actual name. He needs a promotion! More towels than you can shake a stick at too! Special note make sure you put your towel and book, etc before you go to breakfast as the quite large quantity of pool beds does go by around 10am.

The break fast goes from 0630 to 1030 daily and is top rate. It's not the best, of the best buffet breakfast however you can eat till you burst, bottomless coffee, great service staff, USA and Aussie newspapers, the whole nine yards! Sorry I couldn't remember any names from breakfast service but that's only because of my daily hangover!

A huge Special Shout out to the room service guys for their 5-6 trips to our room per day for more ice buckets! Those guys rule! Let me tell you that a $2 tip will practically get you the world in Bali!

I had plans of using the gym which was awesome but found myself glued to the pool. Only put on 5kgs over 10 days; not bad ey?

As far as location goes you are 300m from Ku De Ta (which I think is the most over rated and needlessly expensive club/ restaurant in Bali). But aside from that you're 30-1000m from 50150 great bars, restaurants, clubs, and shops.

We will be coming back to Seminyak Beach resort over and over and over. Thanks you for a wonderful time?

2812,Wonderful hotel to spend 5 days,50,June 2014,"So relaxing and so peaceful and only a short walk to shops and restaurants if you need them. Beautiful gardens and infinity pool with staff only too accommodating when you need them. Very friendly and welcoming on check in, and after an upgrade to a suite our holiday was almost perfect. Breakfast is delicious with such a variety. Our only complaints are the white towels in our room , they were a disgusting grey colour and hot water system very poor. Would love to see a bar in the hotel for an evening drink or two....this is our second visit to this hotel and hope to be back before end of the year",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2813,Beautiful resort,50,July 2014,"This was our first trip to Bali in 20 years ( the first time for our two children) and were keen to stay in Seminyak having heard so much about it from other friends. Our travel agent recommended this hotel. Based on other TA comments we opted for the Beach Wing rooms rather than the Garden Villas. Upon arrival we were advised we would not be able to get interconnecting rooms which had been requested prior to arrival. Not such a huge deal for us as our children are 14 and 11 but if they were younger it would have been a problem. Our beach wing rooms were next door to each other, ground floor, facing the beach with a shared verandah. They were lovely rooms with a king size bed in each (although this meant the boys were sharing a bed which wasn't ideal), bathrooms were spacious and clean with a lovely deep bath to relax in. The rooms are serviced daily with a turn down/bathroom clean in the evenings additionally. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the beachfront location is perfect. The surf out the front can get quite big so recommended for strong swimmers/surfers. I wouldn't take toddlers to the beach as there was often an undertow. I agree with other comments that the pool area, whilst lovely, can get busy and it is often difficult to get a lounge. Having said this, I noticed staff packed up towels when lounges appeared to be not in use for a period of time. The breakfast buffet was fabulous with a huge variety to chose from (a highlight for our boys!!). All staff were very friendly and helpful. When both boys copped a dose of Bali Belly during the week the hotel were very helpful organising medical attention. There are buffet nights most nights plus a casual light menu available throughout the day and evening. Room service was efficient with a good variety. All in all, a gorgeous hotel, highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2814,Decent enough but not 5 star,40,July 2014,"We felt lucky to get a sun lounger sometimes because the grounds have been poorly designed and common space has been sacrificed to cram in awkwardly placed guest villas and a giant Las Vegas style wedding chapel. There is only a thin finger of loungers by the main pool which are practically on top of each other.

No 5 star touches like freshly rolled towels already on the loungers, cold water brought to you when you sit down.

The guest to staff ratio at the pool makes it feel a bit like a packed restaurant back in London.

They have a quieter cabana area the other side of the Chapel but the roofs of the cabanas were falling to bits.

The drinks menu is in broken English, yet cocktails are more expensive than Ku De Ta next door.

Even adverts for the place which we saw in local magazines had embarrassing spelling and grammar errors. This has no bearing on the quality of the hotel, but just makes the whole operation look a bit amateurish.

It's a good hotel, but not a truly 5 star experience in our opinion. We stayed in other resorts on the island during our trip which were cheaper and felt more polished.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2815,It's a no brainer,50,June 2014,"This hotel will not disappoint. The rooms are beautiful. We were lucky to be upgraded to a suite which was just so lovely - but I'm sure the other rooms are just as nice, The pool and pool area are so pretty and one of the best I've visited - I was worried the shape was boring as we're used to large lagoon pools - but it really was just lovely.
The locals selling goods on the beach were a little annoying but we just tried to see the funny side.
Breakfast wasn't perfect - but I ate so much at the amazing near by restaurants all day and night that I was grateful not to pig out at breakfast too. Lunch and cocktails by the pool were brilliant and well priced. We didn't eat in the hotel at night as near by places so good.
Perfect location - lots of great places to eat, drink and shop in walking distance. We particularly liked Potato Head and Ku De Ta.
Staff at hotel so accommodating.
Seminyak a perfect location in general too - we did 6 nights here and 3 in Ubud which was also wonderful for different reasons and a great way to split a holiday. Plenty of excursions and things to do. Loved cooking class, massage lessons, temples, rice fields, boat rides and monkey sanctuary.
I dont see how anyone could have a bad holiday at this hotel. Total luxury and value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2816,"Wonderful rooms, service and location.",50,October 2013,"We are regular travellers to Bali and other destinations, arriving at The Seminyak and being taken to our pool villa was a great thrill. This hotel is beautifully kept and is in a great location, it is a short stroll to a range of restaurants and Seminyak Square.
The room had a private plunge pool and outside sitting area allowing for easy access to the beach or to stay in the privacy of our own ""mini compound"". Breakfast offers a great selection and with top quality ingredients and presentation.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2817,"Luxury, convenience & pampering",40,April 2014,"On my 4th visit to this resort. Wife & 3 year-old daughter loves it, whether we're staying at the villas or the Garden Wing across the road. The buggy ride from the Garden rooms to the main lobby is an experience my daughter enjoyed even though it took less than a minute. Service is great, as expected of Balinese; but the enthusiasm of the staff to please and go the extra mile deserves mention.
Minor Irritation #1: computerised key locks are problematic no matter where you stay. I was locked out once after climbing 3 flights of stairs to the 3rd floor of the Garden rooms. Needs fixing definitely.
Minor irritation #2: Reception staff answers in perfect English as if everything is fine; but never trust that seemingly reassuring smile; for nothing is fine when you get to the bottom of things. They've given me key card which wouldn't work, and room reservation information which differed from one staff to another e.g. whether the 2 rooms you booked have connecting doors.
Other than those minor irritations, everything else is what one would expect of Balinese hospitality + 50% at this place.
Infinity pool overlooking the ocean, Bali sunset, walk down to the beach with security watching over you, 5 minutes to a massage, Wha Wha wagyu mini-burgers across the road (wife and friends loved that), VIN PLUS down the road for supplies of wines, Ku De Ta and La Luciola within 5 minutes walk etc.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2818,We would come back,50,June 2014,"Overall we throughly enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was amazing - so much choice. Rooms were large, clean and we felt like we were well looked after.

The only disappointing aspect were the price of food and drinks. They were much much much higher than normal bali prices.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2819,Fantastic service,50,June 2014,"Due to an unfortunate passport situation, we were unable to arrive on the dates that we'd pre-paid for on wotif.com. However the staff at the hotel were more than accommodating and changed our days at no extra cost. Wotif were also very helpful given our plight.
The room was absolutely stunning and huge. Gorgeous Jacuzzi right next to wooden shutters opening up to a view of the ocean.
The breakfast was lovely and had everything you could want.
Location is central and handy.
I would definitely be back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2820,Bad Faith,10,June 2014,"We were quoted one price over the internet but when we booked we were charged $600. We called to tell them there was a mistake and we needed to cancel and they said sorry ""We have already been paid by your credit card and basically go to hell!"" When we checked with visa they said there was nothing they could do on a foreign transaction.

DON'T GO TO THIS HOTEL - THEY HAVE BAD FAITH!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2821,No hot water for 2 days - very bad problem solving skills from staff,30,June 2014,"I was really impressed by the hotel room. Very spacious, well decorated and sophisticated. The bathroom was amazing and had a jacuzzi by the window, really beautiful. Room was very clean and hotel food was amazing (breakfast was nice but dinner was really good). Facing a nice beach with an infinite pool. Hotel service was nice, but not very efficient.

The big problem:
I didnt have hot water in my room on the first day, water was not cold, but not hot enough for a nice shower. I asked the frost dest to check and they were very nice (as always) and said they would fix it.

Coming back from the beach the water was still cold. I called guest relations and they told me it would be fixed. At night it was still cold, I went downstairs and asked to speak to the manager. He came and I told him that was unacceptable... he told me it would be fixed.
Next morning was STILL cold! I called room service and they sent an ""engineer"" that fixed it in 10 minutes.

When you pay 450 dollars for a hotel room like this you expect great location, great service and hot water. Even in the best hotels things can go wrong, but you expect them to fix it as soon as possible, or get you a new room. I was really disappointed with this hotel's capacity to fix problems. They were inefficient and I had to talk to 4 people and didn't have hot water for two days.

I was about to give an ""Terrible"" review, because was tired of asking for my problem to be fixed and have to solution or feedback. Yesterday I had 4 beers, some sweets and a letter from the manager apolligizing. Better than nothing, but still very late.

I would recommend for friends to stay here, but better hope not to have any problems because the hotel staff is clearly not prepared to deal with it. Maybe its just bad management?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2822,Will Be Returning,40,June 2014,"I recently stayed at this hotel and was very happy with the location and service. As a single traveller I felt very safe and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly. Lovely setting with ocean views and relaxing gardens. I stayed in the garden room which was located across the road from the main lobby and ocean view rooms, however did not find this a problem. I only ate twice at the hotel, as I preferred to eat out at the many good cafes, restaurants and shops all within walking distance. This was my fourth time to Bali and found this to be a lovely hotel to stay in. I will definitely be returning to The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2823,Our wedding at The Seminyak...,50,June 2014,"Three years ago, we stayed at The Seminyak - we loved it so much that we decided to have our wedding ceremony and reception there.

Last Friday, 20th June, our wedding took place at The Seminyak - the ceremony itself was planned and organised to perfection. Many thanks to Denny, Pritha & Roma for their help.

The Reception was wonderfully executed - though there were some mild teething issues. But hey, which wedding doesn't. But this was completely forgiven by the amazing food buffet provided by the head chef Olivier Portret. We cannot rate the food highly enough - all 50 guests loved the food!

To those who really want a good chef and food for their wedding - Olivier is your man!

Overall, our family and friends were very impressed with both the resort presentation and the service from all staff. A big thumbs up to all.

Now on to our accomodation - we stayed at the Garden Villa for 3 nights. We requested to check in a little earlier, and they were able to clean the villa up straight away for us. Granted that when we stepped in, we could still smell the wet floor cleaner - which wasn't the most pleasant smell. But had we checked in at normal time (2pm), the villa would have smelt perfect. The bathroom was very large and impressive - and most importantly, the minibar was free!

We had friends and family staying at the Ocean Villa + 2 bedroom villa. To be honest, after visiting their villas, we still preferred our own Garden Villa. Maybe it provided us with a more 'exotic' feel.

Service from both reception and restaurant staff was exceptional. Though after ordering room service, the leftover plates took a very long time for staff to clear away. There was also some issues with mosquitos late at night. But those are the very minor faults we can overlook.

The overall experience was fantastic. We do not have an ounce of regret having our wedding at The Seminyak - just wish we could go back there to stay again right now!

Anyone considering their wedding at this resort, feel free to private message us for any further tips / questions. Happy to help.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2824,"Beautiful Resort, Great for Couples, Avoid the Garden Rooms",40,June 2014,"There's not much I can add to the other reviews on how pleasant this hotel is. The beach pool is fantastic and the brunch is amazing. Make sure you get plenty of both while you're there. On the flip side, I was completely underwhelmed by the garden rooms in the separate building across the street. While the room is nice, I was left with a view of a small garden and a fence. Not exactly inspiring. For the price (or much less) you can get a much better view and experience than what the garden rooms offer.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2825,Honeymoon,50,June 2014,"Very nice hotel, so relaxing and the pools are great facing directly the beach.

Sea view suite is wonderful, with private jacuzzi viewing the ocean.

Food is excellent.

Very near to Seminyak Square where many shops and restaurants are located.

For good prices on shopping go to Discovery Shopping Mall, there they have many brand names. Taxi from Seminyak beach resort approx Rp 60k-70K",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2826,Holiday,50,June 2014,"Very nice hotel, the staff was friendly and very helpful, the rooms are nice and very clean.

All in all great and the best place to have a relaxing vacation in Bali :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2827,nice place to stay,40,June 2014,"Very friendly and helpful staff, nice beach - more for surfers than for swimmers. Excellent meal, close to ""everything"" - dining, shopping, other spa and massage places. Two less positive comments: the room was very dark in the evening with not central light. beddings and towels were clean but not really white - a bit greyish. On the other hand, everybody very nice, ready to make his/her utmost.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2828,Missing the mark for 5 star,30,June 2014,"Only stayed three nights but had stayed previously at the royal beach seminyak so can say that the royal beach is the better choice.
If you're there to enjoy the resort for the pool and services then you'll be disappointed. There aren't enough pool lounges to accommodate the number of guests so if you do manage to get one you will feel like a sardine. If you request one the service given is with lack of enthusiasm with the pool guy actually rolling his eyes! Not just to me but to many others! Rooms are beautiful if you get on the beach wing.
Food is extremely below average for the price.
Don't eat here!
Hot stone massage was nice until I was burnt.
This does have the potential but unfortunately it was hard to relax when you know you have to race to the pool at 9.30am to avoid missing out on a bed and then know you can't stay in to eat as the food will only disappoint you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2829,Superb location and excellent service,50,June 2014,The hotel is located near the Seminyak square and within easy reach of all the food and drinking hole. Room is clean and the view is superb with nice beaches at the back of the site. They serve excellent breakfast and the hotel staffs are really very friendly and helpful. Well recommended.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2830,Totally Amazing,50,June 2014,"We just got back from a 10 night stay in a Beach Wing Room. It was totally amazing and we loved everything about the place. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. Always smiling, stopping to talk and checking on your day. The room was beautiful, appointed well and serviced twice a day (a full morning service and a night time bed turn down and mini service). The beds were extremely comfortable. Breakfast each morning covered our expectations and we were happy with the variety on offer. Pool side service was pricey, but as expected in a resort, but we loved the touch of free fruit kebabs that were brought around each morning for a morning snack and the nice warm towels. There seemed to be quite a few things on offer to do at the resort, not that we took up these things (not even the free cocktails!! Silly us), but did do a morning Aqua session in the pool which was fun and thought the turtle release on the beach was awesome. On the day we checked out our pick up to the airport was not until 8pm, and check out was 12pm. They locked our bags away and allowed us to shower and get ready using the spa facilities. If you want to hire a scooter use the hire place across the road as they seemed to be linked up the hotel - we were able to leave the key with reception to return to the hire business. Restaurants and shops are all within easy walking distance, with Ku De Ta right next door. Missing it already and will absolutely be back to stay again. Brilliant!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2831,Professional service just not as good as it could be.,30,June 2014,"Now unfortunately for this place we stayed 6 nights at the komoneka rasa sayang in Ubud, that is to say when you arrive at that place after every outing they said ""welcome home"" and meant it, type of service. This place really needs to send it's staff through that place as the service and quality is hard to describe. Rotate some staff I say!

Here we are at The Seminyak for 7 more days. It has beautiful pools and grounds. Gorgeous. Yes the beach has hawkers that ruin your infinity pool jive... But you can tell them firmly no and you're also welcome to ignore them.. Ie harden up it's not the end of the world. Who thinks direct onto public beach in a country like this would not have beach sellers? uh.
Room is really nice and of course breakfast has a massive selection. Plus a couple if chef's who do some cooking.

The problems are in the little things; no consistent setting of the room after service or for turn down. Half empty or non existent toiletries and towels. Inattentive staff; if you're anywhere front reception don't make guests feel like they are interrupting the Facebook chat or photo share review. Do that out back.
It's almost like the 5th star hasn't been earned except around appearances, as this is truly a great looking resort.
Oddly enough, the security guards who assist with traffic crossing out front are exactly the level of job responsibilities-outcomes that inside need lol. Great guys.

Few more days to go, so providing we don't have to chase missing things anymore, it may get better?",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2832,Wonderful,50,June 2014,"I have been travelling to Bali since 1979 and have stayed in the full range of accommodation from family compounds to 5 star luxury. Without a doubt, The Seminyak Beach resort is one of the best places I've stayed. In a nutshell, they do everything so well from the welcome check-in (we were upgraded to a spa room-thank you once again Putri) to the non-intrusive yet very helpful and friendly staff who all seem to enjoy working at the hotel (which is not the case with all hotels). The room was very well appointed with a king bed, spacious walk in robe, large double bathroom, great shower, wi-fi, and a lovely balcony with ocean views and quiet air con. The location is excellent; right on the beach, very close to the main shopping centre (easy walk in a few minutes) and surrounded by good restaurants and bars. The grounds and gardens have and understated elegance, perhaps not as green and plush as some other 5 star hotels nearby but there is a sense of tranquility and spaciousness that pervades the hotel that is very comforting. I chose the hotel when I saw a picture of the wet edge pool right on the beach (I'm a regular surfer but wanted a place to relax with my wife for a few days where I could still connect with the ocean. It was fantastic; the pool was brilliant, large enough to swim a few laps if desired yet so great for just swimming around in and watching the surf or floating with my wife. The demographic was certainly a majority of couples relaxing and enjoying the peace (no groups of loud drunks and thankfully no swim up pool bar...There was a very relaxed and unpretentious yet elegant atmosphere. The outdoor breakfast area was spacious and very well appointed; the buffet breakfast one of the best I've experienced in years-western, Indonesian, excellent coffee, wonderful fresh fruit, delicious breads...the perfect holiday breakfast. I was very impressed by the hotel and immediately felt at home, yes it's easy to feel very attached to a place like this, I seriously did not want to leave after just two nights. Forget Ku De Ta and Potato Head , hanging out at the pool here is a far more relaxing and enjoyable experience. It's also great value for money. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you to all the staff for a great stay",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2833,Great beach and infinity pool,50,June 2014,"The infinity pool is great, especially in the evening. Just laze at the pool, watch the beachgoers and the sunset......

This hotel has beach access. After a great time at the beach, just walk up the steps, wash yourself clean using the taps and shower next to the pool and you can jump into the pool.

Besides the great service , the great food and ambience, the pool and beach access are my favourite features of this hotel. Not to mention Ku De Ta is right next door.

Restaurants are nearby. E.g. Sea Circus is a 3 minute walk away. Teatro Gastroteque is 5 minute walk in the other direction.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2834,RELAXING,50,May 2014,"Loved this resort! I am in the Travel industry and was checking out a few hotels, this resort was far superior than the other two. Boutique feel with fantastic service - nothing was too much trouble. I thought I lost my camera so they rang my previous hotel, they rang day spa's and made bookings at no charge and were very helpful with any queries we had on locations for shopping and restaurants. We also loved that we could walk straight onto the beach and walk to Ku de ta, Potato Head, also Woo bar at the W made fantastic cocktails. The room was lovely but my only complaint was a cold shower on both mornings not sure why but it was fine in the afternoons when we had a shower. Laying by the infinity pool ordering lunch and drinks was a highlight and would definitely come back and stay here again!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2835,Fabulous Hotel,50,May 2014,"I stayed at room 3202 with ocean view. We stayed for 3 nite total.
I stayed here with my wife n 2 kids, 3 year old n 5 year old. The room was pretty big.
First we had 1 bed king size, but my wife want to have another extra bed so we can sleep more comfort. I thought we will have another charge to pay for extra bed. But when I came to the reception, they know that I stayed with 2 small kids, so they gave us a free extra bed.
Usually I know a lot of hotel will take this opportunity to get extra money from extra bed, but this one not.
Staff was really friendly n nice with my kids.

My son n daughter love the beach seminyak so much, they have a long sand beach, so u can play around, running and sitting, the beach more like private beach.

The thing that need attention is the shower, the hot water pressure was running down when I took shower around 6PM, the engineer from hotel said its due to people taking shower at the same time so The pressure is down a little bit.
Second sometime we smell some rusty or old pipe smell coming out from the shower.

The room was nice decor with woden floor n love the design of the bathroom with glass partition so we can see our kid playing inside the bathtub while we watch movie.

The swimming pool area was amazing,we took many photos while we swam, the pics were wonderful. If u swim, better bring a waterproof camera so u can take picture a long the pool.

They have some gazebo, so we hang around n chill while we were watching sund down, no need to go to kudeta or potato head. The scene was wonderfull.

Last thing, breakfast is okay, taste is good but need more combination. I can not say much but u can add more variety of local food or american breakfast. Croissant chocolate is my favorite and also different combination juice everyday, just love it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2836,Great Location - close to all the good spots!,40,May 2014,"My first time to Bali. Stayed at this Resort with some girlfriends. 100m from Ku De Ta, and a stones throw from La Lucciola and Potato Head. Walking distance to small market and Seminyak Square. Great location.
Rooms were beautifully appointed. We had booked the Garden Wing (adjacent building over the road), and whilst it was just as lovely and had a small reception are and 24 hour security, we did feel a bit isolated from the main hotel. After 2 nights we were able to upgrade to the main hotel. Pool area was lovely and relaxing, especially the infinity pool overlooking the beach. Just amazing for watching the sunset. Poolside snacks were a bit average. Breakfast was ok, but have had better. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2837,Excellent Resort,40,April 2014,"We spent a lovely week at The Seminyak Beach Resort in late April. We stayed in an Ocean View Villa which was fabulous.

The stay overall was very nice. We were pleased with the wonderful staff, delicious food, the ideal location to Ku De Ta and Potato Head and the wonderfully private villa.

While our overall feel from the resort was quite nice, there were two things that were frustrating. Firstly, the resort plays up The Cellar (which was great); however, it is no use to have an on-premise Cellar if you then have to call room service for both corkscrews and ice buckets. Surely they can put corkscrews in the room for guests to use. And it would be much better to get an ice bucket at the Cellar instead of waiting for room service.

The other frustration for me was that every single time you ordered a drink, or snacks, at the pool you needed to sign a new bill. Wouldn't it be easier to just take a room number and then have the guest ask for the bill when they are ready to leave? All in all these are two minor items, but resolving them would make a better experience for the guests.

Lastly, it would be nice if there were ceiling fans in the dining pavilions for the villas.

It was a great location, a great stay and a wonderful resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2838,Amazing!,50,May 2014,"This a sensational resort in the heart of Seminyak.
Convenient location near all the good beach bars and restaurants.
But a great refuge and you hardly know you are near the main drag.
The service is top notch, the rooms are amazing and the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. They didn't just nod and say yes to everything, they actually delivered.
The best thing about this resort - the mai pool! Beachfront facing and massive, it had heaps of deck chairs and towels and the pool bar service was amazing. You barely had to look up and someone would be at your side to take your order. There was also another pool with a swim up pool bar and a kids pool. Granted we went in May and it is not peak season, but the hotel is well staffed and they know how to treat their guests to a stress free and relaxing holiday. The overall resort has quite a traditional feel but the rooms are clean and well maintained and I believe a few of them are new and although I was not in one of the new rooms, I didn't even know the difference. Compared to a lot of the other upmarket beachfront resorts like the Samaya, The Legian and even The W, this resort is worth the money. They know what's important and where to place their efforts.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2839,They can do better and you can do better.,30,May 2014,"We stayed for 6 nights with a friend. The hotel had arranged transport which was present at the airport. On arrival, only part of our group was offered refresher towels and a welcome drink.

The overall feeling was the staff were not that attentive at check-in, our sense reinforced when the bell boys delivered the wrong luggage to our room.

The room was spacious and well fitted out. Simple and elegant design which hadn't dated too badly. We had ongoing issues with our A/C unit. We had the option of having it on full or reducing the fan at night which made the unit sound like a helicopter on take off. Engineers were sent twice to repair it in the middle of the night.

Breakfast was the only time I saw the staff looking like they enjoyed themselves, but a few disappointments that you wouldn't expect from 5* hotels. Cheap paper napkins - Fail. Staff repositioning dirty cutlery on the table when clearing plates - Fail. Endless cups of ordinary espresso coffee - Almost pass.

Now we had been sold on this place on the view from the infinity edged pool. What doesn't show in the photos is the hawkers that stand at the edge of the pool calling for your attention every 30 seconds. No, I don't want another copy watch, sunglasses, sarong, kite, beaded necklace. Get in the pool and you are fair game for the hawkers. I did see the security guard try and move them on at one point, but he was fighting a losing battle when many other guests were encouraging them by purchasing their rubbish.

I guess this reflected on the attitude of the pool staff (if you could get a lounge by the pool) then you had the joy of dealing with surly staff, who didn't really want to get you a fresh towel or glass of water as this interrupted their conversation.

The gardens and grounds were very pretty.

The turn down service reflected the general apathy toward service in the hotel, with some nights the mosquito repellant plug in, other nights not.

Consistency and attention to detail is something that differentiates an average hotel from a great hotel. Our experience here was the staff and management were very happy to provide just an average product for their guests.

It wasn't an inexpensive hotel at US$400/night. They can do better and you can do better.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2840,AMAZING with a captial A,50,May 2014,"This hotel was perfection right down to every last detail. We stayed in a beach view suite on the 3rd floor so had great views of the ocean sunsets. The room was clean, had everything you wanted, the staff were so friendly and could not do enough for you. The infinity pool is beautiful but definitely just for adults and meant to be relaxing, not meant for drinking by the pool although you can order drinks and food from the one guy walking around. The other pool has the pool bar and also like a mini infinity pool bit.
My husband and I went for the weekend for our anniversary so left our child at home which was probably a good thing as I don't think it is really aimed at families although there were definitely children there it was mostly couples or friends. Although I didn't investigate, I didn't see anything about kids clubs or the like.
The breakfast that was included was probably the best hotel breakfast I have had, everything nice and fresh and a balance choice. You could also order decent coffee. I would definitely go back and possibly take my child but he would have instructions not to run around like crazy.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2841,No reply to my emails,30,March 2014,"Potential to be a 5 stars hotel except for 2 major drawbacks:
The GRO supervisor, Pak Prabowo, does not exist. He is a computer and does not reply to your emails. I requested blankets but the hotel only provided duvets. I could hardly sleep during my stay ...!

2842,Wonderful,40,April 2014,"I stayed here for 5 nights on honeymoon. Check in was quick and easy with a welcome drink and cool face clothes (totally needed!). We stayed in the Garden wing, which is across the road from the main complex. There was good security to help get across what was a busy road.
The room was lovely, large with a nice bathroom.
The pool area was amazing, right on the Indian Ocean, great bar service also.
Breakfast was a very international affair with everything on offer from sushi to a fry up!!
We had one issue while here, a leaky roof, but it was dealt with fast and efficiently (even though it was midnight!).
Overall, would recommend this hotel. Great staff, beautiful surroundings and rooms and in walking distance to a lot of restaurants & bars in Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2843,"Very good, but ...",40,April 2014,"This past April, my wife and I held our latest vacation in the South East Asia area of this beautiful planet. This trip involved several legs of various durations, starting in Bangkok, then Jakarta, a few days in Borneo and then finally Bali.

In Bali, we had a beach view villa (#1107) with private dive pool. Staff at the Seminyak are completely dedicated and courteous. Lay out of the villa is in good taste and reflective of the Balinese experience. My wife even mentioned that the bathroom was to die for ... :-) women ! The grounds are lush and well maintained. The pools are also maintained on a daily basis. The beach is wide and long, which allows for gentle walks throughout hours. The included breakfast buffet is above expectations, and both of us usually shy away and prefer ‚Äò‚Äòa la carte‚Äô‚Äô meals. However, the Serminyak has made a believer out of us when it comes to buffet breakfasts. Meals on site are fresh, well prepared and in good taste.

A few points of concerns apart from the initial hiccups on our first day, starting with the airport pickup and subsequent room service. As indicated ‚Äò‚Äòa la carte meals‚Äô‚Äô are well prepared and reasonably priced. On the other hand, ‚Äò‚Äòliquid charges‚Äô‚Äô are astronomical and bordering on ‚Äò‚Äòabusive‚Äô‚Äô. As an example, for a lunch meal grilled fish of the day we both had, it was about 14$ per plate. However a bottle of water and 1 glass of wine each (nothing out of a special cellar) added to the final invoice which amounted above 75$. What is more perplexing is that the price of bottled water is about 12$ per unit, considering this is free in the villa‚Ä¶ go figure. This is not an isolated incident either. On another occasion, we both ordered a martini which ended up costing 36$ in total, all things included.

Another issue of lesser importance, but yet when you are paying for a room (villa) at more than 1000$ per day you would expect a broader maintenance and upkeep schedule. To explain a bit more, for example, chair cushions and sunbathing mattress cover were very much used. Bathroom towels always appeared to be dirty, although we know that they were washed every day. The beautiful furniture is starting to decay (for example, bottom of the pedestals of the dining table). So basically on this front there is real improvement to be achieved.

This said, we still enjoyed the Seminyak Beach & Spa Resort experience ‚Ä¶ we hope that the operators of this site recognize the level of dedication of every member of the staff‚Ä¶ they are a great group and everyone (gardeners, restaurant personel, to front desk, and so many more) were on top of their game !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2844,Loved it,40,March 2014,"Great location, friendly staff, beds are super comfortable wish I bought it home with me, best sunsets by the pool at happy hour overall great would stay again was disappointed not to have a towel animal on my bed though",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2845,Seminyak hotel in Bali,30,March 2014,I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort in March this year. It has a very nice location and is a compact hotel with a lovely view of the beach and sea. The rooms are nice but the upkeep is not good at all! It's quite an expensive property and for the same price there are better hotels nearby! The paint work near the electrical points are terrible and when I put on the plug for the electric kettle the whole socket came off! I changed my room as it was very dusty but to my dismay found the same paint work problem and dust in the next room too! I had to stand and get the room cleaned! I had an ocean facing suite which is in the higher category! The receptionist who checked me in was very unprofessional. In a 5 star property one expects trained staff at the very least! The Oberoi or The Legian both next door seem like a much better choice!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2846,What a FANTASTIC spot to holiday,50,April 2014,"We went to the Seminyak for my sister's wedding last week and it was incredible. The whole resort is amazing - the rooms, the pools - everything. And the staff made my sister and brother in law's wedding fantastic, no query was too much. The staff were all friendly and accommodating, going out of their way to make the time special for us.

The hotel is very well located and being right on the beach was really special.

Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough ‚Äì a magical spot.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2847,Amazing hotel!,50,April 2014,"Wow! What a place to stay - I cannot fault this hotel. We stayed for 7 nights and had a wonderful time at The Seminyak. Location is great - walking distance to all the restaurants but far enough away to be quiet. The beachfront location meant we received a daily breeze that kept it nice and cool by the pool. The staff were wonderful and extremely willing to help with any request we had - big or small. Wonderful buffet breakfast every morning.

Will be returning soon and highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2848,"Fabulous resort, not too big, but big enough to impress.",50,April 2014,"This is the best hotel we have stayed at in Seminyak. Location on the golden mile is absolutely ideal. Right next door to Ku De Ta, very close walking distance to all the big names....Sea Circus, Bodyworks, Motel Mexicola, Potato Head etc. All the staff so lovely and skilled. Everyone says hello, even the gardeners. Makes you feel special. Nothing too much trouble. Gorgeous pools, lovely rooms and grounds. Will definitely come back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2849,A Perfect Place,50,April 2014,"We just spent 4 nights here and our stay was truly perfect.

Online, with the hotel we got very good rates for a garden room. Contrary to some reviews, we found our lodging to be excellent for the price. It was quite ""design"" , huge bed, incredible bathroom and amenities. Shower power and hot water fine. We had a poolside ground floor room with a charming terrace. No noise from the street at all. To cross, there was always a security officer who stopped whatever little traffic there was.

True, the breakfast buffet was the best ever we had with a choice of everything you could imagine including changing Asian dishes daily. Many dishes were prepared personally for you and there was never a wait. Coffee and tea served directly to your table, with many choices. The surroundings were beautiful as well.

The beach was perfect for us. There were security zones flagged off and we were able to swim daily in the rough ocean which we loved! Strange that lifeguard stations did exist but they were always in prohibited zones of swimming. One could rent surfboards (even take lessons) and bodyboards. The people selling their wares on the beach were not at all aggressive and quite pleasant to talk to. You really felt comfortable and safe. Towels were abundant and huge and true, no beach umbrellas spoiling the view (tide was too high at times to only allow for a narrow strip of sand but almost everyone stayed on the grassy grounds).

Close to many restaurants and shopping (reserve the Sarong and Mamasan), walking or very inexpensive taxis were easy going.

The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful and the rooms were well cleaned twice daily.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2850,Quality Experience,40,April 2014,"We stayed here for a few nights and, overall, were very pleased.

The resort is in a great location, with many cafes, bars and restaurants in walking distance. We managed to dispense with the need for taxis while staying here, which was great.

We had an ocean view room, which was well-furnished and very clean.

The pools were very nice, though you do need to get yourself pool-side reasonably early or risk missing out on lounges. If I was nit-picking (and this really wasn't a big deal), I would suggest that the deck by the main pool needs to be oiled. It was quite dry - understandably so, taking a beating from the Indonesian sun each day. This didn't really affect my experience - just nit-picking.

The service by the pool (for food, drinks, etc) could, on occasion, be a little patchy. The staff don't seem to do the rounds of the pool deck to see if anyone wants anything, so you may have to grab their attention to firstly get a menu, and again to order. That said, we never waited a huge amount of time to order anything. The complimentary fruit skewers by the pool each day were very much appreciated!

We had the buffet breakfast each day at the resort, but never dinner. With so many restaurants in walking distance, it seemed silly to eat there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2851,"Lovely, one minor negative",40,April 2014,"The location is perfect, on the beach, walking distance to both the centre of Seminyak & in the other direction from the hotel towards Kerobokan & even better restaurants.

Rooms were fantastic, although if we hadnt got the free upgrade from garden to ocean room I'm not sure we'd have felt so positive.

Rooms huge, excellent facilities - free ample bottled water, fruit, Wi fi & I pod docking station, not to mention the rainfall shower & roll top bath. Huge, extremely comfortable bed with much needed powerful air con.

The infinity pool was cool, not quite as cold as needed on some humid days, but the twice daily fruit kebabs, attention of the towel/pool attendant & fruit juice shots made up for the lack of a bracing dip (all complimentary, I've never known a hotel be so generous ). Views of the beach & surfers, not to mention the amazing sunsets meant the time passed far too quickly. The complimentary cocktail night on Thursday was another unexpected treat, again with that spectacular view.

Breakfast was high quality, the staff were lovely & for once real bean to cup coffee - a rarity for a hotel. Choice was ample, freshly prepared with everywhere absolutely spotlessly clean.

Hotel grounds were lush & tropical. It was very quiet when we went so sun beds available all day long & lots (and lots) of staff available at all times.

Here comes the one minor negative. Prices charged.

The hotel itself was reasonable, the cost of drinks, food & eg spa treatments or transport was not. It is not an exaggeration to say prices were 4 times that of high end establishments straight outside the hotel front door. (Including other top end venues, eg ku de Ta immediately next door).

This did not affect our enjoyment of the hotel & infact we'd return tomorrow, that's how minor we consider it. It is worth bearing in mind, especially if you plan to dine in the hotel as the options within the locality are extremely wide ranging & embarrassingly good value.

We had the most amazing 1 1/2 hr massage at 'jari menari' & 1 hr facial at bodyworks. These were two of the more expensive spas yet cost us the equivalent of say a pedicure in the uk, for both. Quite unbelievable.

We also hired a driver for the day via assistance from the security guard outside the hotel. Again the cost was embarrassingly low, immaculate vehicle, air con, perfect English & we spent 8 hours touring Ubud, Tanah Lot, rice terraces & all the surrounding places of interest. It was perfectly safe & in our opinion the best way to do a tour - we literally walked out of the hotel and the drivers were called across by the security guys from the parking lot opposite. Sounds risky / dodgy but would whole heartedly recommend.

Seminyak itself was a lovely place - full of spas, restaurants, temples, shops, great coffee and lovely lovely people. Kuta provides a huge contrast next door, just keep driving through and be pleased you opted for seminyak instead.

All in all, cracking hotel, first class accommodation & food, superb location, lovely staff & worth paying that bit extra for.

We went in April which was low season. It rained twice, both times overnight, temperature was perfect, town busy enough - I'd worry just how hectic the hotel & resort become at peak times as there aren't that many sunbeds....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2852,Location location location,30,April 2014,"Overall, our experience at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa was good. Location was fantastic! We were essentially 2 minutes away from Ku De Ta! Room was clean and spacious and staff were very friendly. We stayed for 2 nights.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2853,Magnificent Weekend,50,April 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak for one luxurious Saturday night in April 2014. Through booking online, we were offered a free upgrade to the Suite Ocean Room which was one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I've stayed in. Very clean, smart and spacious layout, beautiful view over the restaurant rooftops to the ocean, two flatscreen televisions(!), a gorgeous jacuzzi and private balcony. We were blown away!

In the afternoon of the first day we walked south along the beach. After walking past all the other resorts, we knew we had chosen the best. It is one of the only resorts that doesn't have a beachfront full of those horrid red beach umbrellas (i.e. eyesores). So basically, you have a fantastic view of the beach and sea from the pools.

There are two lovely pools (one with a pool bar) and after our swim on the last day, a pool staff member came around offering everyone complimentary fruit kebabs!

I highly recommend dinner at the beachfront Santan Restaurant, which is part of the resort, as it serves delicious food (and as a vegetarian, I was surprised to have so much choice) and has such a great atmosphere.

The buffet breakfast was an incredible with foods from all nations. I'd never thought I'd see sushi, chocolate croissants and a pancake & waffle station all in one spread. One of the best breakfast buffets I've ever seen.

The staff also need a special mention. Everyone was friendly, helpful and obliging.

Such a fantastic stay overall. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2854,Paradise at the pool,50,April 2014,"The last 6 nights of our 14-day holiday to Bali we spent in The Seminyak. We had a beach-wing room and enjoyed our stay very much.

Higlights of our stay were the beautiful pool, with fine food and drinks provided by the staff (Love the 'Lost in paradise'-cocktail). A big compliment goes to all the staff who were always very welcoming, kind and happy to make the stay a perfect one. A special compliment I would like to make to the Security staff. Being strict towards the taxi's that brought us back to the hotel (bomb check and booth-check), while in the mean time they were very welcoming to us with genuine big smiles.

Our room was spacious and luxurious. Extra towel change during the day was very much appreciated. One small remark: on arriving we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a villa. The receptionist would make us a proposition the next morning, but never did. Because we liked our room (and prices are pretty high for our standard) we never got back to the subject ourselves. On the good side: We got a late check-out for free.

The last day we spent at the beautiful pool, feeling in paradise and a bit gloomy at the same time for having to leave Bali.....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2855,Not up to standard,30,March 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 9 nights. When we checked in they offered us an upgrade to a suite, however we liked the garden room layout better so decided against paying for the upgrade to ocean view. The room was quiet and clean and comfortable, especially the bed.
The staff are friendly and helpful however the resort standards and systems let the Resort down. House keeping staff never left the same bathroom towels, sometimes we had too much other times not enough, there seemed to be not standard set up for rooms. My pet hate in hotels is when the house keeping staff move personal toiletries as I consider the room my home when I am travelling and that should be respected by cleaning staff.
The pool area is not serviced well and there are no offers of water, cool towels etc as you recieve at the W, Oberoi and Legian Resort. It's the small things that let the Seminyak down but they add up to be big and annoying. We did let the management know and the sent us a bucket of bintang beer (we dont drink beer) but it was nice thought. They also offered a free upgrade to a suite which we declined again until someone checked into the garden room next door to ours. The garden rooms have adjoining doors and you can hear everything from the room next door. So for the last two nights we moved to the ocean suite which was not as nice as the garden room. The veranda is very small in the suite and the bathroom is massive but completely open to the bedroom plus there is this dreadful carving that surrounds the door as you walk in to the room and it is dangerous, serves no purpose and ideal to walk into or bag your head, plus annoying with luggage and for tall people. The road noise is loud and constant from the ocean suits/rooms and there has been no care to sound proof.
There is also dreadful, depressing music that is played throughout the hallways at the resort that sounds like funeral music with the same song on repeat, not ideal for a tropical holiday.
We liked the location of the Seminyak but for the price would go back to the W Retreat, Oberoi or The Legian - we wanted to try it as it's a pretty resort nice gardens. Our tip stay in the garden room as they are quieter if there is an empty room next door.
Friendly, helpful staff but suggest the management go and check out their competition at the W Retreat as they have great service, standards and systems which makes a difference to guest stay. I have worked in hotel management so know where The Seminyak is going wrong.
I don't think we would stay at The Seminyak unless they improved as it lets the Resort down.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2856,Excellent Stay,40,March 2014,"We stayed @ The Seminyak Beach Resort for a couple of nights and was a ho-hum ok stay! Nothing great at all! The staff very helpful and always smiling and the food was excellent and moderately priced - well it's about that! The rooms are quite spacious and well furnished and maintained, but the fun stops there.

Drawbacks -
1. No play area to keep the kids busy. Resort not meant if you want your kid to play on their own, away from the sea and beach.
2. No provision from hotel for beach umbrellas and chairs on the beach - even though it is a ""beach resort"" very much ""on the beach"". I just did not get the logic behind this.
3. The resort has 2 buildings with a public road running in between. There is a USD100 /night/room difference between the main building and the adjacent building - a bit crazy!
4. Secondary building on the road and ground floor rooms not comfortable due to traffic noise.
5. We had AC problem in the room and it took them almost 2 hours to fix it. Honestly they could hardly fix it in the end! :-(",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2857,fabulous,50,March 2014,"It was fantastic, got upgraded to a seaview suite with spa, great view, the pool was fantastic, we were there for the religious day which was very interesting no-one on the beach not even a dog, had a lovely day breakfast late then relaxing pedicure in the spa drinks at sunset, then room service, no noise no lights so peaceful. loved everything about the place, staff are great cannot do enough for you, highly recommend, also not too many children as the pool is nice and deep.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2858,Wonderful Honeymoon!,50,March 2014,"The Seminyak helped us have a marvelous honeymoon! The staff is so gracious and pleasant and willing to help! They booked us ample local sightseeing expeditions, brought us great food room service at all hours of the night, and decorated our honeymoon suite with rose petals which really made the bride's night! The free cocktail hour on Thursday evening was awesome, as was the daily breakfasts with awesome food choices from Germany to Thailand and Korea and everywhere in between. Any time we wanted to go out at weird jet-lagged hours of the night, they were able to find us a place and get us transport there. At one point my wife got sick and they helped us get her some medicine at no time also. This is a great place with the nicest staff I have ever seen!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2859,This resort is not worth for what they are charging.,40,March 2014,"Tourists who will make online booking please be careful about the differences between beach view rooms and garden view rooms. The garden view rooms are situated in an annexe building opposite side of the road far from beach. You have to cross the road everytime you want to come to the main complex and the beach. They have only a small swimming pool inside the annexe building, nothing else. The rooms are road view, not garden view. If you want to change to beach view, you have to pay $100 extra.

Apart from that, during the 2nd night of our stay, the aircondition suddenly stopped working. After making complains twice, that was rectified to some extent. The breakfast was horrible though there were lots of varieties. Drinks and foods were overpriced compare to other hotels of Bali.
In a word, it is not a good hotel as it claims itself.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2860,The Worst Smell we have ever Smelt !,20,March 2014,"Having just recently stayed at The Seminyak Resort & Spa, March 2014, I must say we were so so disappointed! Of course there are positives, the infinity pool right on the beach was amazing and a place you could spend many lazy days :) Our Room, a suite, which we paid close to $600 a night for was very beautiful on first inspection, a large spacious luxurious suite, with another large huge bathroom attached ! But within an hour of arriving, a terrible smell seemed to dissipate thru the air vents into our room. Having travelled thru Bali before we are accustomed to a few odd smells around the place but this was putrid! Having left for dinner we left the doors open in a hope to get rid of the smell. We came home and started to run our spa bath and the smell of the water was enough to turn the strongest of stomachs!!! Vomit worthy I assure you :( We rang and spoke to management and they said they would send someone straight up, we went to turn on the Kettle and wait but the kettle did not work another call !! 45mins later someone came up to check the smell, apologetic but their solution was to hang air freshener sachets in front of the air vents!!! (Something tells me this is not an unusual complaint they get as they were so casual about it) An hour and a half later we received a new kettle! The smell got worse thru the night in fact it was so bad it woke us up numerous times during the night, the next morning it was unbearable and once again we went down and spoke to management, they said sorry but only offered us a free transfer to the airport the following evening for our troubles. (Wow save us a whole $8 !!! Max) We spent close to $1200 on 2 nights accommodation for a room we couldn't spend any time in, with what we consider very bad management skills. If your looking for a place that offers a delicious breakfast, this is not the hotel for you, the juices and water are warm with practically no traditional Balinese style foods offered. All in all they are only getting 2 stars and they are both for the pool area! There is nothing else we found positive about this property, and we have travelled a lot in and out of Australia and we have stayed in many places, many that have cost us a lot less than this with a lot less star rating and they have truly outshone this property and the service offered by far!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

The in-house Spa and massage was exceptional. I went twice for a rejuvenating set of massages. I would recommend the Karheyana massage.

2866,Great with excellent service,40,March 2014,My hubby and I had a nice time at the resort facing the ocean view. Closeby beach n pool to enjoy. V enjoyed our romantic sunset dinner at the chapel with a personal butler with an affordable package! Everything was good except for the jacuzzi not working properly which was a little disappointing as I love to use it daily. Nevertheless it was a clean quiet and safe resort. Breakfast was v pricy and wish the management relook into. Thank you to the management of staff especially Dewi who attended to our services efficiently before she went on her leave. I wud still recommend the resort.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2867,"Fantastic Experience, Could not have asked for more",50,March 2014,"The hotel and staff are fantastic, we were made to feel very special. The staff are so friendly and seem to learn your daily habits and remember your needs and little details about you, making the service very personal. When we arrived we were offered the option to upgrade our room for a very minimal cost, it was well worth the money and very much appreciated.
We booked this holiday to celebrate my partners 50th Birthday, we came back to our room one night to find the staff had made her a birthday cake for us and left it in our room. On one night I ordered ice for drinks, the following night when we returned to our room after a night out we found ice was already in our room.
The day we checked out we were not actually leaving until 8:30 that night, the hotel offered us the use of the Spa showers to freshen up when we returned to the resort to collect our bags, we were welcome to use the resort facilities until we were picked up.
Our experience at the resort was exactly what we wanted, a romantic get away, we felt spoilt and loved every moment. The staff, including the security personal were all very friendly and we felt very safe and secluded, which was fantastic after spending the days exploring Seminyak and Kuta.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2868,Peace and tranquility,50,March 2014,"This hotel is great! It is in a great beachfront spot, close to the centre of the action in Seminyak.

Despite the busy road outside, the hotel is a peaceful haven. The biggest asset of the hotel are the staff. They all speak good English and are charming and helpful. The rooms are large and spacious, and kept in very good order by the housekeeping staff. Clean towels appear as if by magic when you pop out for dinner (even though you've already had a clean set that day).

A word about the beds - they are fantastic. I have stayed in some pretty upmarket places with dreadful beds in the past, so I was delighted to find this enormously comfortable bed. Heaven! I used the spa once - it is excellent, but a tad expensive for me. The Spa charges are about what you'd pay in the UK, so not unreasonable, but you do expect things to generally be cheaper in Bali.

The food in the breakfast buffet and the poolside restaurant is very good. Always nicely presented and very tasty and fairly priced. Drinks are a bit pricey compared to local restaurants. For example, a small Bintang is 45k Rupiah, compared to 25k at most local outlets, but you have to consider your surroundings. The gardens and pools are beautiful and really well kept.

My husband and I were unlucky enough to pick up a nasty gastro bug while we were there (nothing to do with the hotel) and when the staff became aware of this, they couldn't have been more helpful. They organised a visit by an excellent doctor for us, and kept a check on us to make sure we were ok and offered special food. Thanks to everyone involved for your help!

We stayed in the beach wing rooms and had a lovely sea view. Please be aware that the garden wing rooms are not in the main part of the hotel. They are across a fairly busy road and have their own pool. By all accounts, the rooms are just as good, but I imagine that you might feel a bit left out if you were staying there.

There were only two small gripes while we were there. The first was negotiating a late checkout. I was surprised to be asked to pay a charge of US $125 (about ¬£80) to extend our stay by just four hours. The matter was resolved to our satisfaction in the end, but I did think the amount they asked for was excessive. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never been asked to pay that much for a late checkout.

The second gripe is not the hotel's fault, just something you should be aware of. The sea along this stretch of coastline is quite ferocious, with big waves and strong currents. Great for surfers, but not for anyone wanting a relaxing swim in the sea. Certainly not good for children. The red flags indicating no swimming were on display pretty much all the time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2869,"Perfect location, genuine hospitality, should be in the top 10 list!",50,March 2014,"I was a little apprehensive at first looking for hotels that would be suitable for my mom who is wheelchair bound. Wasn't really keen on big chain hotels with numerous rooms since we were just looking for a weekend getaway for some peace and quiet. After an extensive research reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I finally decided on this hotel but was only keen on the ground floor beach wing as it would be easily accessible for my mom in getting around the hotel grounds and for my 11 year old nephew to get to the pool. Since there were only one available for booking, I called the hotel via Skype to check just to make sure and the front office staff Ratna was very reassuring to me patiently answering all my queries over the intermittent not-so-good voice quality of Skype that evening.

So I booked it through Agoda from 14-16 of March only to realise on the check-in day that my booking did not go through although I received a Confirmation Number but not a follow-up email consisting of the hotel voucher. Imagine my panic. Dian and I believe the Front Office Manager whose name has now escaped me, guided me through in checking my booking status and eventually had it all resolved. While sorting all this out in the Business Centre, I have left my mom and my nephew at the lobby. Little did I know that my mom had taken to the fauna and flora of the surroundings and had wandered around by herself. Seeing this, Gunawan who I believe is the conceige helped wheeled her around answering her questions on the species of plants and flowers. And when that was over, he stayed on speaking to her since this being her first time in Bali and filled her in on what little she knows about the people and the place. It wasn't long before my mom was bought over.

We had the beach wing room 3109 with a porch that stretches out to a well kept garden and gazebos and facing the sea. The Garden Wing which was divided by a narrow stretch of road was behind us. Yet it was quiet. The bed was comfy and so was the roll away bed. Sheets that were clean and amenities well stocked. The way the surrounding of this place was kept, you could almost tell that it is not going to be mosquito infested. Another reason why I opted against staying in a villa regardless of its ratings. As soon as I read something about mosquitoes, I would click 'next'. But having said that, it doesn't mean that this place does not have mosquitoes and that you could leave your sliding door open after sunset for the sea breeze. This is Bali after all and there is bound to be mosquitoes. But it does mean that you do not need heaps of mosquito coils to burn or frequent fogging of the place.

The pool is great and I like that it sits right there overlooking the beach. There is also another pool with a pool bar albeit a little smaller. The buffet breakfast spread was sumptuous with eggs prepared the way you like it. The staff at the Santan restaurant were cordial catering to all our needs especially that of my nephew who had only wanted Spaghetti Bolognese which was not in the menu. I could kick myself for fogetting to take the name of the waiter who served us. Location is just perfect! Right beside Kudeta and walking distance to shops and eateries. No problems with the Wifi either.

I must say that it was a very nice touch that they greeted us with a garland of frangipanies on arrival to the hotel. The other thing I must mention is how helpful the staff were in going the extra mile in getting a plastic stool for my mom just so that she could sit while having her shower and a rubber floor mat. Thanks you guys for caring. Thank you Ratna for following up with your colleagues on my phone call and Indra as well for your help in answering my queries.

If you were to look at the plants and trees, you would be surprised at what you were looking at. The plants that were sticking out of the Koi pond beside the Santan Restaurant were actually lemon grass. The little plant that sits on the dinner table is that of rice plant. Many of these were pointed out to me by my mom and of which you don't see anymore in the urbanized island city that we live in.

Overall, I am so very pleased with this hotel and being in the hospitality industry myself and we all know that it is the people that make the brand. Not just anybody but the right people. Clearly, the Seminyak Beach & Spa Resort has the right people working for them. Passionate, committed, warm, dedicated individuals infused with Balinese traditions, culture and genuine hospitality. Kudos you guys, can't wait to be back!

Just a little pointer here: It is approximately a 20 mins drive from the airport. There is a taxi booking stand on the left as you come out of Customs and it is a standard 100,000 Rp (approx $10 USD) to get to the hotel. Pay after you reach your hotel. Alternatively, you may take the hotel shuttle that would set you back $35 USD if it is not included in the package.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2870,Relaxing Anniversary Trip,50,March 2014,"We stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort last weekend for our 10 year Wedding Anniversary. We were very impressed with the resort, on arrival we were greeted as VIPs and our room was decorated with rose petals etc. Big spacious room, extremely comfortable bed and things like chocolates and turndown service at night were very thoughtful and personal. Staff were very friendly and made our stay hassle free. Great location, 2 min walking distance to Seminyak Markets, KuDeTa and Bodyworks!! Amazing stay, thank you :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2871,"Excellent location, great stay",50,February 2014,"We stayed there for 4 nights and had a great time, very quiet and relaxing. We had spa treatments every day and can highly recommend the spa. Loved the hotels location, as it is walking distance from all the shops and you can walk along the beach and go for sundowners to Kudeta. We also loved their swimming pools. All in all we had a great stay.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2872,Gorgeous hotel!,50,February 2014,"This is a beautiful hotel, with a breathtaking location on the beach. We stayed here for 3 days at the end of February. We arrived in Bali around 8pm and the hotel driver was waiting to pick us up. Even with the later arrival, the hotel staff was so gracious and friendly. We were offered an upgraded room (a suite with a private jacuzzi) for an extra $70 US per night and it was SO worth it. Our room was gorgeous. The view of the beach and hotel grounds was great, and the private jacuzzi was awesome. Only caveat - it took FOREVER to fill up the in-room jacuzzi, like 2 hours. Definitely need better water flow or something.
But I digress, the room was gorgeous. The breakfast at the hotel each morning was delicious, and in a great setting. The hotel grounds were beautiful and the pool are is amazing. The value for this hotel is excellent!
We opted to dine at the Balinese Buffet held on the hotel grounds, complete with Balinese food and Balinese dancing. The dancing was excellent, the food -- eh... I'm not a fan of traditional Balinese cuisine, but the suckling pig was awesome.
Overall, the hotel is a gorgeous resort with all of the amenities that one could hope for. The staff is so friendly and attentive. The spa is great and the overall experience was excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2873,"Good, not great",40,March 2014,"Lovely resort with gorgeous views of the sea. The gardens are lovely, as are the pool areas. However, the rooms are in need of a little renovation - for example, the air conditioning leaked water constantly down the walls in both rooms. There were some inconsistencies in the service too - we only had turn-down one night in three, and a noodle soup from room service was not good and hideously expensive. The concierge was pleasant but not hugely consistent either - sent us to a very good restaurant one evening and then a terrible one the evening after.
Overall, a very nice resort but would not return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2874,"Great location, comfortable quite rooms, great selection of food for breakfast.",50,February 2014,"Great location, comfortable quite rooms, great selection of food for breakfast.
Gardens were beautiful.
This is being picky the but gardens should of been manicured more as the lawns were not mowed and there were weeds growing up the outside of the pots etc. The pool area is a perfect spot, however the water never seemed to be really clear and the gardens around that area really need some attention.
However this is being really picky and I think it was of season.
The hotel is a great place to stay in a perfect location and would highly recommend it.. I will be staying there next time again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2875,Appropriately enjoyable experience,40,February 2014,"It is hard to sum up our feelings about this resort to one title line. You cannot deny how beautiful the ocean view is from the room and the pool, the friendly staff and the amazing breakfast. Still throughout our stay we were missing something, to take the experience to a 5-star level. When you pay a lot of money for your stay (~4.000 EUR for 12 nights in the ocean facing suite), your expectations are naturally high.

Maybe this comes from being a woman, but I was missing certain things to make me feel like a valued guest:
- the mini bar in the room is not free of charge (4 bottles of water are provided free of charge), which is kind of ridiculous considering the room price
- there were no complimentary gifts in the room (fruits, flowers, candy). This would not cost much, but would make a nice touch
- the hotel tried to charge us for an airport transfer (as it was not included in the package), which also is relatively ridiculous considering the price

These very small things left me with a feeling that this resort is run very effectively as a business.

As general comments about Seminyak I would say that the area has reached the final stage of touristification. It takes a load of patience to travel anywhere from Seminyak, as you are sitting in a traffic jam for up to 1-2 hours (depending on where you're going). Take this into account if you're planning tours or diving trips. Seminyak does have excellent restaurants, and we ended up eating out every night except one.

The one experience that eventually left a good taste in my mouth was the dinner we had at the hotel on our final night. There were very few participants in the seafood buffet, so it was practically a private dining experience by the sea. The hotel had organised a very nice cover band as entertainment, and the cook was presenting the food. Definitely recommend to take advantage of the hotel buffet offering.

In the end, I would probably not return, as with this kind of money you have so many other options available (e.g. Mauritius, Maldives) but this also very much due to how Seminyak has developed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2876,Stunning sunset,40,March 2014,"We r at the ocean view suite. Very spacious, great ocean view shower and jacuzzi, comfortable bed. I was worried about the breakfast, reading some -ve comments here.

2877,Excellent - Would love to return,50,March 2014,Stayed in the ocean front villa unit for a few days and it was paradise. The facility was great and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Many good restaurants are within walking distance.

2878,Perfect Resort,50,February 2014,"My husband and I had a beautiful stay at this resort last week and were very impressed by the staff, their friendliness and their willingness to help us any way they could. We were celebrating an anniversary and the manager upgraded us to a spa suite on our final two nights. Thank you so much we loved the room and facilities.
The pool area was fantastic so clean and well maintained. There was no problem finding a lounge chair to sit on with staff on hand to provie towels and drinks etc. I attended the yoga classes at the chapel which had a spectecular view of the ocean. The buffet breakfast was varied to include an egg and pancake station and the fesh fruit was delicious. The location was great within walking ditance to some of the best restaurants in the area. We used the shuttle a couple of times and found the driver friendly and accomodating. We did not use the spa because we thought it was expensive for Bali. Another bonus was the business centre for guests to use that helped us keep in touch with family at home. I would definately recommend this resort to others and hopefully if we go to Bali again we will be more than happy to stay at this resort. Thank you to all the lovley staff they are the best part of this resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2880,Lovely Resort But!,40,February 2014,"We stayed for 9 nights and although the resort was a lovely place, with good food, lovely helpful staff and our room (beach wing) was beautiful, I was totally disappointed with the state of the beach (rubbish). I did not set foot on the sand and would not swim in the water. Maybe the staff need to clean the beach early morning before guests went for a walk, but it was the sewerage which totally put me off. Maybe I have been spoilt with the lovely clean blue beaches of FIJI.
Overall I will not be returning to Bali but will still recommend this resort. My husband and I decided that we must be the minority that did not enjoy Bali at all.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2881,Fabulous hotel,50,February 2014,"We stayed here for two weeks, and could not have enjoyed our stay more. Living in the garden wing was not a problem, and the room was large and had gorgeous decor. Breakfast was really good, with a wide selection of hot and cold alternatives. We loved the infinity pool, and the gazebos in the garden. The beach in front of the hotel was kept clean, and the surf there was decent for beginners according to my partner. Service by the pool and at breakfast was good, and we loved the towel animal/flowers/sweets housekeeping left for us.

I have to say that the staff is wonderful. When I became ill and needed a doctor they were really sweet and caring, asking me if I needed anything etc. They were generally really helpful with everything, and always friendly.

The worst bit about this wonderful resort was actually leaving it, so if we ever come back to Bali, there is no doubt we will stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

2883,Very Disappointed in this Hotel,20,February 2014,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. I was not allowed to charge food and drinks to my room, until I asked to speak to the manager. The beach front was littered with garbage which undervalued the hotel's beauty, and some of the staff were rude at times. They also tried to jip me by a day by making my check out date a day earlier than what I had pre-paid for. Thankfully, I had printed and brought my hotel voucher with me. Otherwise, I would have had to pay for an extra night.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

style.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2886,"Excellent resort, service, location, everything!!! Simply faultless.",50,January 2014,"The most enjoyable stay in Seminyak at a guess! (booked via Expedia, late notice, still good value!)
We had a beach wing room, second week of January. Staff were so polite and helpful right from the beginning. A smile goes a long way in a place like this and we felt like royalty. Premises is large and clean. Pool area is excellent. Pool service (towels, drinks, food) was spot on and efficient. Swimming is allowed at the beach but just not in rough conditions.

Pool bar staff (swim-up bar) were a lot of fun and good at their cocktails. Reception staff made plenty of phonecalls on our behalf and never charged us.

Location is SO good. We walked everywhere in Seminyak from this resort. Beach was cleaned if there was rough weather from the night before, gardeners were always at work but always discrete.

Breakfast was very good and the staff very attentive, no problems there. The egg station and fruit station staff were wonderful. Sometimes you need to slow your speech a little bit and watch your pronunciation on some things but they try their absolute best. And don't forget your smile!! Coffee was very good. Main food items were consistent and the local cuisine changed daily. Snake fruit was something new for us!!

Room was to the northern end, 2nd story. So quiet but still central. It had everything we needed, I don't care for a few scratches on a cupboard, seriously, who whinges about these things?? Room service provided any extras we wanted (ice, wine glasses, a fruit knife) and were always polite. Daily servicing was done while we were at breakfast, they seemed to really try to stay out of your way.
Shower is large and excellent. Bed was huge and comfy and there was 2 choices of pillows. Black-out curtains kept us wondering if the sun was even up!! The evening turn down service often left us a sweet or dessert and also information sheets about what was happening!!

We required a late checkout (4pm) and they did this at no extra cost and at short notice. They let us use their Spa's bathroom to freshen up before we left the resort after we checked out (shower etc). Checkout was painless.

Staff always showed interest in what we were doing every time we left the resort on foot, asking if we needed advice on taxi's, eating, directions. But they were always so discrete at the same time. Security guards were polite and helpful with crossing the road
I tried some Indonesian words/phrases with the staff and they loved it. Friendly friendly people.

Be aware that they require a credit card hold upon check in, this sometimes catches people out and makes them unhappy if they don't know in advance.

I tipped they guy who took our bags to the room on check-in, he struggled a little bit with the bags but wouldn't be defeated! That tip made him smile SO much and he was a good little mate for the rest of our stay, never did he ever look like he was pushing for more money. It was impressive.

Weather didn't bother us too much, its the wet season so expect rain and don't whinge if it does rain!

As a couple, this place was perfect but some families had babies, children, teenagers and they never impacted on our holiday at all.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2887,Weekend Getaway,50,January 2014,"I recently booked to stay here for a weekend getaway for a friends birthday. I had found out prior it is best to stay on the beach side (there are rooms across the street) as you had easy access to breakfast and the pool. We stayed in the beach wing room...it was incredible! We had two single beds which were the size of doubles and were so comfortable! Nothing worse than a really hard bed and pillows that make it seem like you are sleeping on nothing. The comfort of the bed/pillows was fantastic! The room was really quite big and was adjoining to the room next door in case you travel in a group. The room was very spacious with plenty of space for suitcases and clothes. The bathroom was very large and had a monsoon shower head a big bath.

The cleaners would come in sometime mid morning and do the rooms, they also come around and change the flowers each day - attention to detail which I thought was nice. They seemed to come by in the afternoon to close up the curtains and make sure the beds were tidy. We were never really there so only noticed these things on passing.

When we arrived we were given a frangipani lei, welcome drink and cool towel. The staff there are so friendly! Greeting us on arrival and whenever we returned back to the hotel. They also assisted us in calling to a booking we had due to the language barrier. We had arranged a car to pick us up also and there was no drama in this.

Breakfast was included in our stay and was fantastic. Lots of variety and great coffee which is a first i've experienced at a hotel. Instead of the usual black brewed coffee we were able to order lattes and cappuccinos!

The pool is amazing - we were going to go to potato head but felt no need when we had a big infinity pool at our doorstep.

Great location next to ku de ta and walking distance to seminyak square and all the stores.

We used the spa on the last day there it was a great service - expensive in comparison to places in ubud and around seminyak but we used it for convenience and had the debussy facial which is one of the better facials i have had in my time.

Overall a fabulous experience. Good food. Staff were so very friendly. Comfort of the rooms was fantastic! Location wise and the resort itself was beautiful. Walking up and looking at the ocean. I wouldn't hesitate in staying there when I return - in fact I wouldn't' want to stay anywhere else.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2888,Great for Active Couples,40,December 2013,"Positive:
The Hotel is smack in the middle of a bustling shopping district which is also full of good places to eat.
Friendly and helpful staff
Good food
The Cabins are spacious with large bathrooms and the private pool is very nice.

Negative:
In Room dining menu was limited
Although the Hotel is on the beach, swimming was not allowed.
There was a new years event planned at the hotel but it was spoiled by the rain, Frankly I expected them to have a better backup plan since it was the middle of the rainy season and it had been raining all day

General Bali:
I don't suggest traveling to Bali in December, its in the middle of their rainy season and it rained every day we were there.

Overall It was a great Experience I just regret not Timing the Honeymoon better. Seriously December is in the middle of the rainy season. if you go to Bali in December ALWAYS have an umbrella ready.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2889,Very Good Overall - Room Garden Wing,40,January 2014,"We stayed in the Garden Wing at the Seminyak Beach Resort for one week in January 2014. The Garden Wing is located across the road in a separate building, however, it is directly across, not 200m away as some posts might suggest and they have nice security men who stop the traffic for you. We did not realise this when we booked, but decided to give it a go anyway (we booked through expedia or hotel club and it wasn‚Äôt as specific ‚Äì our fault really). It was certainly more private as I went on to read on the Seminyak website with its own pool and swim up bar. We didn‚Äôt see anyone use the pool the entire time we stayed and had it to ourselves the one day we opted to use it. Just make sure you‚Äôre aware of it. I think the Garden Wing is really good value, you get all the amenity of a five star resort for a reduced price and you spend most of your time in the main resort and it‚Äôs really not that far.

We spent most of our time by the infinity pool, which is truly the highlight of the resort. We never had a problem getting a sunbed and the staff were attentive. The beachfront resorts in Seminyak are all excellent places to watch the sunset and the Seminyak Beach Resort was no exception. The concierge was also excellent, booking restaurants, tours and pretty much anything we asked for. The location is excellent. Only a few min walk to Oberoi Street and loads of other restaurants, bars and spas to visit. The buffet breakfast wasn‚Äôt too bad, certainly not the best or worst I‚Äôve had in South East Asia.

I would certainly consider coming back, good value five star resort experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2890,excellent service,40,January 2014,"the cons:
-some parts of the room have scratches, need touching up especially when it is rated 5 stars and an award winner.
- the pools are smaller than expected and there is a shortage of beach chairs + umbrellas (required to avoid sunburn).

the pros (too many)
-outstanding services. the waiters at the breakfast buffet remembered my request for vegetarian dishes without garlic/onion/shallots. i only had to mention once on the first day and they took note of it each time i enterred the breakfast area. that is what i called service!
- many pavillions facing the ocean for an afternoon nap
- a high end accomodation without all the over the top deco. feels like a second home, contemporary yet Balinese.
- feels like a secluded oasis once you stepped inside the gate, even though the entire SeminyaK is rather crowded.

would go back again for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2891,Enjoyable and relaxing,40,January 2014,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights in a beach view room, which was more costly than the Garden Room but worth the difference in price. Stepping out on the balcony and straight to the pool and beach, it was very handy. Room was large and facilities all provided. The resort is close to the shops and restaurants which was also very handy. The best part is in the night, with the sound of the waves and the night birds adding to the relaxing atmosphere.
Had breakfast once at the resort and found it not very exciting in terms of the range but the proximity of the many restaurants nearby at the nearby Seminyak Square and shopping strip meant there's always something on offer.
Will like to come back when time permits.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2892,Excellent modern hotel,40,January 2014,"All their facilities have a modern luxurious touch. Their staff is very friendly and understand English really well. They were really helpful in arranging tours. The breakfast was an excellent assortment.

My only complaints were that it felt at times they were less focused on customer service/satisfaction than other places we stayed in Bali like the Four Season. Specifically, they'd immediately give you the bill after your order something rather than just get the room number prior. Also, my girlfriend seriously injured her foot and was on crutches -- they wouldn't give us a much later check out to accommodate the greater time requirements for packing even though we were also on the 2nd floor with no elevator to use to get down. That said, they did provide some assistance with it and were friendly overall throughout the ordeal.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2893,Overrated,30,January 2014,"We must have been at a different resort from the other reviewers. Booked a ""garden"" room which is 200 metres away on the other side of a busy, noisy road. Swimming pool but no garden, lifts or other facilities (not shown on their web site).
Friendly staff but a bit inept. We took nearly an hour to check in, after objecting to our ""garden"" room. Once relocated to other side of road the room, garden and facilities were great.
Great breakfast, lovely restaurant and food, but mostly deserted outside breakfast time except for one or two other couples, which was a pity.
Can't see how the resort could rate better than 3 star.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2894,Very Nice and Relaxing,40,January 2014,"I stayed here at the long of a hectic trip away. Service was very good, rooms great , great pool and breakfast. I stayed at the garden view which was across the road and while I thought initially it would be an issue it wasn't as long as I was organised. The only downside I found and this happens at most resorts in Bali is the amount of pool chairs "" saved"" for the entire day by people putting things on the chairs but might only spend an hour of 2 by the pool. On one day in particular I got to the pool at 10.30, all chairs were taken but would have only been 20 people at the pool. The rest had been saved. The staff were unable to help with this. Pool service was friendly but slow as was the breakfast service. Quality of food was good and prices comparable. Overall a very nice stay but a few critical things that could be improved.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2895,Nice and clean,40,January 2014,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The room was great! Very clean and the service was great. Garden view rooms are on the other side of the road from the main building but this really wasn't a problem. The breakfast spread was pretty good and the pool by the beach was great. My only criticism is that the room service wasn't great. We felt like staying in one night and were slightly disappointed with the food. But that's probably because the food in seminyak is so good everywhere!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2896,Amazing Everything,50,January 2014,"Just flawless. Great location, very clean services was fantastic could not recommend to stay anywhere else. We stayed in the beach wing and the sound of the waves crushing all night was soothing. Great breakfast, helpful staff without a request being denied or disappointment.

2897,service and location very good,40,December 2013,"we had two weeks over Xmas and would summarise our experiences as
1. positives
layout and scale of hotel very good. Room was spacious with everything you would need; free wifi service throughout resort; gardens very well kept
infinity pool and area surrounding the pool excellent
staff all incredibly friendly and could not do enough to help
very clean and well maintained
easy to get out and a wide choice of restaurants within 5-10 mins walk: our preferences:
Lello Lello - fab pop up curry and to die for ice cream
La Lucciola
Breezes - great cocktails
Chandi
Ku De Ta

Not so good
food and drinks in the hotel very poor. We only ate there once (although breakfast was very good)
these comments are nothing to do with the hotel: the beach is volcanic influenced and is therefore grey and nothing compared to the white sand of Maldives or Mexico
The Indian Ocean is great for surfing but do not expect the blue lapping waters similar to the Maldives. There were some big storms around and we had a lot of debris (wood, plastic etc) continually washed up onto the beach. There was a big effort made to clean it up but we often had to walk through it on the shoreline",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2898,Good to V Good....but not quite there!,40,December 2013,"We went as parents with daughter and son in law for the Christmas/New Year break. The hotel was comfortably appointed, sizeable rooms, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating, with an adequate breakfast provided, but the service around the main pool was somewhat wanting. Pool was great but beach was very ordinary. The kitchen is at least 100 meters from the pool, so any food ordered comes cold (food covers might help!), and don't hold your breath waiting for someone coming around to see if you would like to order something. Other than for breakfast, we didn't eat in, but that's normal for Bali anyway, and went nextdoor to Ku De Ta one night and 200 meters down the beach on the other side to Breeze which both served great food, but far too loud at KDT to enjoy the meal, but there are some really great restaurants 500 meters away with fantastic food at very good prices....check out reviews of Chandi, Ginger Moon, and Cafe Bali restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2899,Amazing experience,50,January 2014,"Travelled with a friend over New Year and the Seminyak Beach resort was our last stop in Bali. It was absolutely amazing. The room was beautful with a massive bed and all mod cons. The staff were attentive and there were lots of little touches to make the stay memorable. There were two pools, one was an infinity pool on the beach with big comfortable beds.
We had a pool view room but could still see the ocean from the balcony which was lovely.
The location was perfect, right on a lovely stretch of beach and within 5 minutes walk of all the restaurants and shops in Seminyak.
I would definitely stay again and highly recommend for affordable luxury in a beautiful part of Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2900,Great for couple and small groups of friends,40,December 2013,"Travelled with two other couples for New Year's & The Seminyak was perfect for us. Great location within walking distance of Seminyak Square etc & only a short cab ride if you wanted to head further out. Rooms were fantastic & well-appointed, cleaned thoroughly. Outdoor areas are great & is in a great position on the beach. Nice & quiet at night, despite being next to Ku De Ta. Great internet service, breakfast & restaurant were very good, but there are also many other fantastic restaurants/cafes within walking distance so it is worth making the effort to get out. All of the staff were friendly, attentive & very professional. We would definitely head back",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2901,Nice hotel but overpriced,40,December 2013,"Great location on the beach at Seminyak and a short walk to the main retail strip. Rooms are very comfortable. Nice outdoor pool area, although they probably need a few extra umbrellas next to the pool lounges. Breakfast buffet was good, but nothing special. We were charged an extra US$135 per night to have one extra bed in the room which is outrageous.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2902,Holiday trip to Bali ....,50,December 2013,"We spent 11 days/nights at the Seminyak in a beach front villa and wasn't dissappointed. Great location and excellent standards of service. Staff very friendly and helpful. It was always a pleasure to return the hotel after a busy day sight seeing or enjoying the water sports.Could have stayed another 11 days if time permitted. Short walking distance to shops and restaurants and has probably best stretch of sand on the bay. With Ku DeTa on your doorstep, hard to beat if you want to listen to some good music and tasty food around sunset. Would certainly use this hotel again if going to Bali. If nit picking then I would mention that service around the pool could be a bit quicker and room service food not top notch but overall very nice indeed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2903,A little overrated,30,December 2013,"I was so excited to stay here based on photos from the website and other reviews but I was a little let down with my experience. The room was nice enough if a little dated and showing some wear. The room was clean enough but there were some stains on the bathroom blinds, mold along the shower door and you could tell where they cleaned the bathroom floor and where they didn't (in the corners and along the sides). I was on the ground floor right next to the beach/pool with swim up bar so the location was great for pool/beach access however I needed to keep my curtains drawn most of the time since you could look right into my room from the main path.

The pools were nice and probably the best part of the hotel. The service at the main pool was slow (but friendly!) and the drinks were watered down.

I didn't eat at the restaurant (too many great options close by) but I did go to a cocktail hour where there was some food being served. The food at the cocktail hour was not good AT ALL and a very odd choice (in my opinion) for a Bali hotel- for example, turkey roll ups were one of the passed apps.

It was a nice stay by the beach but I do not think it is worth the price they are charging per room- unless you're set on this location I would look elsewhere.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2904,Good location Excellent Service,50,December 2013,"Very strategic location makes the hotel one of the reasons why we chose this hotel for a family holiday accommodation. All the staff we encountered were very friendly, the breakfast menu options many variations and comfortable rooms. Our rooms are equipped with a balcony overlooking the garden and sea. The pool is great and dealing with the beach and the sea makes us happy to linger swim there.

The hotel is highly recommended for a vacation spot with family",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2905,garden view room very bad ( street view ),10,December 2013,"the location of rooms garden view ( next building ) all most very bad ( street view ) very bad

Rooms beach view and garden view rooms in another building separated by street

Compare prices very expensive garden rooms similar to university housing",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2906,Christmas Eve diner,40,December 2013,"My wife and me, we are used to luxurious hotels, and, to good restaurants. Unfortunately, the good restaurants are not very often in the luxurious hotels.
For Christmas eve, two of our friends who were staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, insisted to have our Christmas Eve diner together at that hotel. To be frank it was not my favorite choice.... But friends are important.....we ended up in the hotel restaurant.

The evening begun with beautiful Christmas sons sang by talented young girls and an interesting flow of cocktails.

Then, the buffet...

We were amazed by the diversity and the quality of the food proposed at that buffet.
As appetizer we tried : French oysters, lobster, gambas, Parma ham, foie gras Pates and terrines... Excellent.
There were so many more dishes, but we could not try everything.

As main courses, we had some salmon, exquisite - just panfried tuna, delicious - Seafood casserole, a treat - grilled Beef Angus, tasty, tender, juicy, unbelievable - then some lamb..... I have no word to describe how good it was.

As desert we decided to make it light. A Creme br√ªl√©e, a small crepe Suzette with some Cointreau, and to freshen everything we ended up with a delicious ice crem (from Gusto) .

This buffet was billed 85 US$, which makes 55‚Ç¨, and it was Christmas. For me, the value for money was there with no doubt.
We had also, but that was not included in the price, even if it was, for Bali, quite reasonable, some gorgeous French wines : Margaux, St Estephe.... What an enchantment
Last year, I had the Chrismas Eve diner in a very famous restaurant in town. The price was 3 times more, and really, the quality of the food was not at all as good. Some like the packaging, I prefer the content.

In a few words : Everything was tasty, well cooked, well presented, and the quality of the ingredients could not be doubt of. The cherry on the cake was the service, mastered with class by Anon, an excellent waiter, attentive, careful, friendly.
We will come back next year for sure.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2907,Another Amazing Visit!,50,November 2013,"This was our second time staying at The Seminyak over Thanksgiving weekend and once again we had a fantastic time!

The service and facilities were fantastic and we had an absolutely gorgeous ocean view room! My fianc√© got sick during our trip and they sent for a doctor and we got great care.

We always have wonderful trips in Bali and we absolutely love this resort and will continue to return! It is in a fantastic area, the service is consistently great, and I love walking to Seminyak Square for shopping :). See you on our next holiday!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2908,"JUST BEAUTIFUL, COMING BACK!!",40,November 2013,"HI I stayed at the Seminyak beach resort between the 1st November & the 6th November, with my sister. We had a beautiful beach view room, Rm3122, and it was spectacular!
We had sunset views from our verandah, and a very short walk to the pools and gardens. The resort is well maintained with beautiful gardens, and beautiful pools,one pool is a large infinity pool & he other has a pool bar attached to it. I loved the pool Cabanas!!

The staff were extremely helpful & polite, they were always willing to assist.
The Room was large with a recently renovated bathroom and the furniture was made of handcrafted timber. The only dissapointment I noticed was the Blowdryer in the bathroon, extremely slow & heated up quickly therefore would stop working to cool down quite often, it took forever to blowdry my hair. I Recommend you bring your own blowdryer if you require to use one.

The resort is placed in a beautiful location, approximately 2 doors down from 'KU DE TA' -(beautiful eatery with a few bars attached to it on the beach).
The resort is a also a walk away from the Seminyak square markets.

A wonderful resort, I cant wait to return to the resort with my husband this time, hopefull in the next year!!

BEAUTIFUL RESORT & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2909,"Really good value, quality resort",40,December 2013,"Next to Ku De Ta, this beach resort is a great location for relaxing in 'Yak. Most rooms don't have a view of the sea, but the rooms are fairly plush and have a fun glass wall to the bathroom. Watch out you don't get put in the annex at the back - you'd have to cross a busy road to get to the beachside infinity pool, and that just ain't classy in your bikini.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2910,Everything was magnificent - Staff extra helpful - room amazing - free upgrade - best of seminyak,50,December 2013,"Stayed in room 2208 - got an epic upgrade when we got there! Guess we were lucky, travelled with my best friend. Stayed 3 nights - our room was right off the elevator - 2nd floor. Complimentary waters ( like 6 per day), safe in room, gorgeous small ante room - natural view of the walk towards the ocean. Room was huge - air was perfect, hair dryer was strong and the shower was perfect with a shower head directly above and a manual one. THere was also a huge jacuzzi in the bathroom. The closets were huge and our overall room was spectacular - truly 5+ star room. The reception was very kind, very helpful and very humble, you felt they genuinely wanted to help you, they helped us hire a private driver ( for a very cheap price of 11 dollars an hour) to drive 4 of us to Ubud and back. They also helped us book massages and peel the dragon fruit we had never tried. I would definitely come back here! The morning buffet is to die for and the expresso is strong and great! Coconuts by the infinity pool is also a must. You walk straight onto the beach here. It is priceless.The lifeguard here also helped us book our surfing lessons. Overall it was an amazing experience that the room, the service and the place afforded us!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2911,Perfect Bliss without the hassle.,50,November 2013,"Stayed 3 nights with my sister. The hotel is well placed - great location - great pool - great beach. Within walking distance of many shops and restaurants in Seminyak so don't really need hassle of transport if shopping and eating within the area.
Staff were helpful and kind. Touched by concern over my well-being when I was recovering from a bout of ""Bali Belly"" from another place I had stayed earlier.
Perfect place to view Sunset in private without the crowd.
Only downside is food was average. But enough variety of restaurants within walking distance or short taxi ride - so not really an issue. And shower gets a little slippery when wet (might be good to provide a bath mat)...but other than that, excellent place to relax whether on your own or with family or friends. Definitely going to be become my choice of stay when I go to Bali again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2912,Beautiful Resort,50,November 2013,We recently stayed at the resort for a week. Our room was lovely with a beautiful view. Modern bathroom. The grounds have a very traditional Balinese feel. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The infinity pool is beautiful and quite large. Loved the cabanas! Overall a great resort and a wonderful experience.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2913,"Amazing infinity pool, friendly staff & great location! :)",50,December 2013,"My friend and I stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort for 3 nights and were very impressed with the friendly staff (the security staff even help you cross the road), great location (walking distance to great restaurants such as sea circus and motel mexicola) and the amazing sunsets which can be viewed at the infinity pool right next to the beach. Why pay to use the infinity pools at ku de ta and potato head beach club when you can stay here & have access to your own!?

The resort also provides guests with complimentary activities such as yoga on saturday mornings, aqua aerobics daily and a cooking class (albeit the cooking class was average, they just taught us how to make balinese pandan crepes). All acitivities had towels, yoga mats and water supplied to us. I highly recommend the yoga class, its at the chapel overlooking the beach ... AMAZING place to do yoga!

The rooms were spacious and clean with marbled bathrooms, good room service food and pay TV. The free wifi was also good.

The only downside was that airport transfer with the hotel was $US35 which i thought was a bit steep, so we caught a taxi instead for 100 000 rupiah.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2914,excellent place to stay in Bali,50,December 2013,"We stayed in a beach front room with a private pool, which was absolutely delightful. The management, staff and service were really first class. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We could not have asked for anything better. The situation of the hotel is right on the beach and although near to the famous (infamous) ku de ta, was very quiet. I don't know what the other rooms are like, but I really recommend the beach front villa",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2915,Right on the Beach,40,December 2013,"There are only a hand full of hotels located right on Seminyak Beach and this is one of them. A good location hotel with good service. Our family stayed in a suite facing the beach. The rooms are a good size with nice balinese decor. However it is certainly more befitting for couples to stay in this room as the doors to the bathroom are basically sliding gates that can see right into the bathroom and sinks etc...thus zero privacy for groups or families. Showers are glass so again...not very private. The grounds are well kept and there is indeed an infinity pool as advertised. Lobby and entrance needs a little facelift as it doesn't have a very luxurious look to it especially for the rates they are charging to stay right on the beach. Overall good hotel...however there are better, more luxurious and more expensive ones on Seminyak like the hotel right next store...the Legian Bali. But I suppose you get what you pay for so there is no comparison.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2916,"Nice setting, great staff, good rooms",40,November 2013,"The Seminyak beach resort and spa is a very good hotel in a great location in Seminyak with many excellent restaurants and bars close by.

The pool is excellent overlooking the beach. The only negative was the lack of poolside drink & food service.

We had a room in the garden wing. The 50 metre walk was no trouble and the room was very good, clean and very quiet, perfect for us to relax.

The staff were excellent. Breakfast was good with freshly cooked omelettes, pancakes and waffles on offer plus a wide selection of other food.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2917,Love the resort - would definitely return,50,November 2013,"We have just returned from 14 days at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa - we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.

We booked in the Beach Wing on the ground floor, which was the main building. This was a 1min walk to the pool/beach but close to the restaurant and handy for getting out onto the street (although very little traffic noise). We had seen reviews of the Garden Wing being across the road - we did see where this was located and, in our opinion, although across the road and slightly less convenient, it still seemed to be very pleasant and not as negative as some reviews had portrayed. It is a small road and only adds about 1min to your walk to the beach - so for one return trip per day is not a burden!

Our room was excellently appointed and spotlessly cleaned each day. The breakfast buffet had huge choice and was very pleasant - towards the end of the session the choice was slightly less, but that was to be expected. One hallmark of our stay was how universally pleasant the staff were - restaurant, bar, poolside. Everyone was exceptionally friendly, courteous, always saying hello. We remarked even on-site contractors like electricians were extremely friendly - a reflection of the Balinese people as a whole.

We only ate dinner in the restaurant on the day we arrived. The food was delicious and service was excellent, but was expensive compared with restaurants in the street. At first Bali can seem quite daunting when you step outside the hotel environs - but once you do, you realise there is a raft of extremely good restaurants within 15mins walk of the hotel. We ate somewhere different each night and did not have a single bad meal or experience in 2 weeks. The hotel is excellently located for local restaurants.

We were there at a quiet time, so had no issues with sun loungers. The pool staff are very good about finding you a space where people had left towels but not shown up! Pool side drinks and snacks were expensive compared with restaurants but still reasonable and cheap compared with UK prices.

The infinity pool was lovely - allowed you to stare out to see and watch people on the beach. We walked down to Kuta on one day, which took an hour (around 40mins and IDR50k by taxi otherwise).

For tech addicts, excellent free wifi throughout the hotel, including everywhere in the pool area!

Overall - beautiful hotel, wonderfully friendly staff, excellent location with great restaurants and shops nearby. We would definitely visit again and would highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2918,Loved this resort,50,November 2013,"We have just returned from a holiday in Bali . We were travelling with our son , his wife and our two grandchildren .
We booked into the Seminyak Spa and Beach Resort for 4 nights and loved it from the minute we arrived !
We had been staying in a villa out of Seminyak centra for 7 nights which was a lovely experience for us as a family but we wanted to stay near the beach and near all the action for the last 4 nights of our holiday.
We wanted to walk to restaurants or at least have a short taxi ride instead of 20 minutes or more each time we went somewhere .
We chose the Seminyak Spa and Beach Resort and were not disappointed .
I said when I got into the beautiful infinity pool on the beach that I had ARRIVED in Bali even though I had been there already for 7 days .
This resort ticks all the boxes !
It's central , it's light, it's clean , it's gardens are beautifully manicured , it's rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated , it's food is good , it's staff are warm and welcoming and their service is fantastic !
We spent everyday lounging by the pool which is well designed.
The children's pool is adjoining the adults pool which meant we could be swimming and watching the children all at the same time !
No kids club but our two grandchildren are only 3 years old and 22months old , so not a problem . Maybe older ones might be looking for that .
We stayed in the Beach wing on ground level of the resort and would so again ! Lovely lawns and gardens leading up to our rooms .
We would not hesitate to recommend this resort and we hope to return ourselves !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2919,"Loved every second, would definitely return even just for the brekkie!",50,November 2013,"Everything about our stay here was gorgeous, check in was great, the service helpful and friendly. The rooms were beautiful, clean and stylish. The pool was amazing and the buffet breakfast out if this world. Bizarrely the best doughnuts I've ever had!! Gym was sufficient and all amenities were great. Loved every minute of it!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2920,Heaven! - detailed review of the seminyak br&s,50,November 2013,"I went here for a week with my sister on 18/11/13 and we loved it! We stayed in the beach side room which was lovely. Probably more suited to honeymooners because the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is glass. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly. It is not like other resorts where you feel you need to get up early and put a towel on a sun bed to reserve it, there is ALWAYS atleast a few beds by the pool which is great. You can order everything to where you are by the pool which is nice.

The only negative is that when you are in the infinite pool, numerous locals come up to the edge and bother you to buy their creations which gets REALLY annoying, one minute you're looking at the ocean and the next, someone has popped up and won't leave you alone.

The breakfast buffet is good, but there's not much as others I have been to. They let us take food to our rooms for later. The location is perfect! We made the mistake of booking a taxi to take us to our restaurant on the first night (Sarong- AMAZING) and we got there 1 minute later and had to pay the 30,000 booking fee when we could have just walked. It is so close to the W, Potato Head, right next door to Ku De Ta and in walking distance to so many other good restaurants to just walk. Instead of paying for the spa in the hotel, i walked down the road to Body Works and got some great things done there for super cheap.

If you are wondering if you should stay in the Garden or Beach wing -which is what i was wondering about- the garden wing is right across the small road- so if you want to save a few hundred bucks, definitely stay in the garden wing because it is sooo close to the beach wing. It would take you just a few minutes to walk from your room to the infinite pool.

Random tips: don't book a taxi to get you from the airport with the hotel, you will pay quadruple. When you land, there is a taxi stand and you will pay 100,000 rupiah which is $10 for a 35 min trip. Don't book taxis, they are everywhere and beep at you to show you they are there. I bought heaps of dvds from the street about 5mins walk from the hotel and nearly all of them dont work properly- although they were less than a dollar.

If you are wondering if it is OK for kids, it is perfect, there wern't many there but I spoke to a few of the parents and they said that because the pools are heated, their babies absolutely love the water and don't want to get out. There is a warmer 'kiddy' like pool attached to the infinite pool which is really shallow so it is perfect for babies.

We had such a great time here and if we ever came back we would definitely stay at the Seminyak again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2921,Bliss,50,November 2013,"We have just spent five days at this fabulous hotel and we can't fault it. This was our second stay. Breakfast is fabulous and there is much variety as the choices are changed daily. Our room was amazing - overlooking the beach with a king sized bed and a huge room with large bathroom and very close to the pool and day lounges. Staff are fantastic and very attentive. I emailed the hotel before we arrived to let them know it was a special occasion. On arrival, we were greeted with a home made cake and canap√©s. It was the perfect start to a lovely stay. They have introduced a daily aqua gym class which is a most welcome addition as it is one thing I thought the hotel needed - some form of water activity - this is perfect but perhaps it could be a little better advertised as I think some people may not know it exists.

The worst thing about this hotel is having to check out - we just wanted a few more days!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2922,Relaxation Complete,50,November 2013,"We just spent 3 wonderful days at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa,wonderful service, great rooms spotless clean, wonderful massages, the staff couldn't help enough. Gym was great, aqua aerobics was well run and fun... the swim up beach was great... pool side service was exceptional",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2923,"Good spot, great service.",50,November 2013,"Although a bit pricey this place was worth it. The grounds are breathtaking, rooms nice and service above average.
Great location on the beach and best breakfast buffet so far, everything was fresh, tasty and beautifully displayed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2924,A nice spot for a relaxing break,40,November 2013,"We recently stayed at The Seminyak for a 5 night short break. I have to say that all of the staff we encountered were courteous and friendly right from our pick up at the airport.

Positives:
Our Ocean View room was worthwhile ‚Äì a far better option than staying across the road. It provided a pleasing place to while away an afternoon. Although, our room did face directly west, so we had to abandon the balcony once the afternoon sun arrived until the early evening otherwise we would have been roasted. Perhaps some sort of roll down shade or an umbrella on these west-facing balconies would be an idea. The ocean view rooms facing across would be more pleasing for those like us wishing to use the balcony.

We were impressed with the array of towel animals that appeared on a daily basis from housekeeping. We began to wonder if it was a skill requirement for employment!

We also liked the in-house restaurant, and were amazed that more guests didn‚Äôt dine here beyond breakfast. We had lunch and dinner there on a couple of occasions and the food choice was good and presentation very modern.

The pool adjacent to the pool bar was great, as was the pool bar. This area is also a great spot to watch the sun go down with a beverage in hand.

The garden cabanas were a nice way to relax in the middle of the day.

The poolside cabanas were also pleasant ‚Äì IF YOU COULD GET ONE!

Now comes my negative comments:
The management of the pool area needs improvement. In particular, the use of the cabanas. There are three in place. Our best example of how this area is NOT managed was the afternoon we spent in and around the pool watching this cabana with personal effects sitting in it, but no people. Two girls returned mid-afternoon after parking their items in a cabana mid-morning. They had obviously been shopping at the markets and were gone for a few hours. During this time, we could have utilised the cabana. This was repeated the following day, when we saw a couple appearing to pack up but when we headed over they said, ‚Äòoh we‚Äôre just going to lunch.‚Äô They were gone at least two hours and then the husband made a point of telling us when he was leaving.

In the room, you might want to get some instructions on how to get the shower tap to work efficiently. The control tap was awkward at best and the hottest shower I managed was lukewarm.

You also might want to take some ear plugs. Whilst it was nice to return to a cool air conditioned room in the afternoon, the air conditioning itself is quite noisy. We had to have our vent fixed to remove an annoying rattle. Also, the traffic noise is fairly constant until late, so if you‚Äôre a light sleeper, be warned.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak. It was just unfortunate that the selfish actions of a few other guests left a bad taste in our mouth.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2925,Fantastic,50,November 2013,"This was my 2nd stay here, I stayed last year with girlfriends and returned this year with my husband. They upgraded us to a suite, overlooking the garden, and we had a magnificent view of the ocean waves. The service was unbelievably friendly and efficient, nothing was a problem. We accidentally left our safe open one day when we went out; when they discovered this, the cleaning staff called reception, who came up and closed it for us, not a cent was taken, this is how honest their staff are!!
The rooms are really beautiful, clean and large!! The bed is really comfortable. The infinity pool and the pool next to the bar with the private cabana's that surround the pool are to die for.
Since the hotel resort is not incredibly large in size, (compared to the W), the staff gets to know you and your needs, very quickly.
The hotel, organised a complimentary cocktail evening, (which has never happened in the 20 years of our travels), it turned out to be a really lovely evening, meeting like minded people staying at the resort and watching the sunset!! Our flight home, was late in the evening, so the hotel allowed us to use the facilities all day and treated us as if we were still booked into the hotel. They also organised for us to shower and get ready for our trip home in their beautiful wellness spa's guest bathroom (huge) and organised a hair-dryer and a curling wand to use. It was a great end to our trip, with no extra charge!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2926,"Ok hotel, missing money",30,November 2013,"This was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in bali and our least favorite by far- here is why.

The good:
Rooms- very nice with lots of amenities

Pool- huge and gorgeous with enough chairs to suit everyone and a great view of the beach

Location- great and close enough to walk to most great restaurants within 10 min

The not so good:
Hotel grounds-
Landscaping was basic for such a nice hotel. No lush plants or fauna, just trimmed grass. No wow factor at all- which in this price bracket and for beautiful bali was really unimpressive.

Layout:
This hotel sits on a beautiful beachfront property but is laid out poorly so you can barely see the ocean unless you are at the pool. Not from breakfast or most of the outdoor cabanas or almost anywhere on the property - just odd. The hotels best feature is barely featured and the general layout was not well thought out. This added to the sterile feel and lack of tropical ambiance.

Breakfast:
Just ok, we had some terrific breakfasts in bali but this one (included in our stay) was just mediocre. An unacceptable amount of ants crawling on the pastries and just middle of the road food, although they did have a large selection.

Prices:
We were happy to splurge on a great hotel, but were largely unimpressed and very much preferred alam shanti in ubud and qunci villas on lombok (both priced much lower) compared to this hotel. Also, the massage prices here were fairly ridiculous for bali. When a shop massage runs 10$/hr and we were happy to pay 20-30$/ hr at our other hotels - for a cleaner more trained staff- 80$/hr that the seminyak charges in bali just means you are being ripped off. We didn't use the spa since we were put off by the prices.

Totally unacceptable:
Theft:
One afternoon while on a day trip for 8 hours we returned to find our safe open and 100$ missing.
I can't say whether we left it open or someone opened it. We are usually careful, but either way it is completely unacceptable for a hotel this expensive to have staff that steals. I reported it to the front desk who seemed completely not upset or apologetic and said they would inform the manager, who never contacted me. Upon checkout that same day, the manger was called over and apologized a little, but I was honestly expecting much more shame or something ( I never expected the money back- duh).... But either this happens all the time or they just had no idea how to handle it. Was offered a free ride to the airport, but I would have much rather had a profuse apology- so unacceptable.

Overview:
The only thing that makes this hotel great is the pool. It is highly over priced for the ambiance it provides and we wish we would have chosen somewhere else. Just felt sterile and unimpressive and for over 300$ a night we wanted to be wowed- which happened for 200$/night at our other choices. And on top of that, they have staff that steals. Can't recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2927,Nice resort,40,September 2013,"This was our first trip to Bali and to be honest we were a little shocked at how bad the streets etc were but this resort is quite an oasis from the craziness of seminyak! We travelled with two teenagers and booked two beach rooms which were interconnecting. They were in a lovely spot amongst the manicured gardens very close to the beach and pool area. These rooms were very well appointed and very spacious. The only downfall, which did surprise us for a ""five star"" resort was the cleanliness was not up to scratch, the first thing I noticed was the bathroom floor had stains on it and especially around the toilet, yuk!
The staff were quite friendly and helpful.
The pool is the main feature and runs along the beach (which is horrible, dirty, open drains and rubbish running into the ocean) we did not even paddle in the dirty ocean and could only walk about 500m each way along the beach before having to cross a filthy stream of sewerage running across the sand into the sea.
If you are looking for a nice beach, go elsewhere.
The buffet breakfast served was included in our room rate and was quite nice, you can order a variety of cooked items, eggs, waffles, pancakes etc. lots of fruit, pastries etc.
All in all a nice resort, possibly more four star not five and quite expensive.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2928,Very nice 5-Star Hotel,40,November 2013,"The Seminyak Resort and Spa is a very nice mid-range 5-star deluxe hotel with perfect, friendly and professional service. The rooms and facilities are tidy and in great condition. The hotel facilities are not as spacious however as the layout is line shaped along the seaside. The hotel offers magnificent views on the sea, especially during sunset and I could only recommend it to anyone who is looking for an affordable 5-star deluxe option in Seminyak. Its great value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2929,Great Experience,50,November 2013,"Greeted by friendly smiles from our first arrival till our departure! We were upgraded to an ocean view suite which was beautiful, ocean views, balcony and huge spa. I did a fair bit of research before booking this hotel and it did not disappoint!

The hotel is well located and the pool and grounds are beautiful. Breakfast was good ‚Äì not a massive selection like other 5 star hotels I have stayed in but always freshly prepared. The young service staff in the restaurant in the morning were very sweet and attentive.

This hotel is perfect for those who look for a nice swimming pool to chill out, the infinity pool is right on the Seminyak beach and is quite large ‚Äì great to sip cocktails and watch the sunset!!!

Only one negative comment but I have to admit I did not bring it to hotel staff attention - unfortunately the room had a quite a bad sewer smell.

All in all we have a wonderful stay, the staff were so friendly and willing to assist with anything we needed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2930,Perfect,50,November 2013,"I had read many mixed reviews on this place.. I booked simply because of the location: right next door to La Luciola & Ku De Ta, a short walk to Potatohead and W.. I figured if we didn't enjoy anything else, we could swim in the horizon pool and sip cocktails until nothing mattered!

Well.. weren't we completely shocked! We arrived late in the afternoon and were greeted by the bellboys, who passed us each a welcome drink and a fresh frangipani lei.. We checked in and were guided by the very polite and polished gentleman from reception. I booked a One Bedroom Villa - it was our real honeymoon, so I wanted to splurge for our final 2 nights in Bali...

AMAZING. We walked through our front gate and immediately spotted the ocean. There's a beautiful infinity pool that wraps around the villa, with a day bed on the ocean side. There's an outdoor eating area and a kitchenette, complete with mini-bar which was complimentary.

Walking into the room, there was a huge comfy bed, a large walk through robe and a huge bathroom with separate shower on one end, a toilet on the other, a double vanity, and a large deep double bath and indoor tropical garden - heaven!

What an incredible place!! We then found an invitation for free cocktails at the pool put on by management that evening and headed off.. we watched the sunset from Sanje Lounge, and met some incredible other guests.. We then ventured off to Sardine for dinner (highly recommended) and came back to our pool for an evening swim!

The next day we attended breakfast which was phenomenal - almost anything you could think of was there and the staff were amazing... On our last day we had cocktails and tapas at the swim up bar which was to die for... The whole experience just amazing!

My only negative comment is trivial but it must be mentioned: the villa has a beautiful water feature, which by day is nice to listen to.. But at night, it sounds like a toilet running... It is SO loud.. The sound competes with the ocean and my hubby and I just couldn't sleep.. The next day we tried to find a switch or some way of turning it off, but we couldn't, so we muffled it with towels.. Such a better sleep without that water feature!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2931,Absolutely perfect,50,October 2013,"My husband and I just returned from Bali, having stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks. Everything was absolutely perfect!

We had a beach wing room on the ground floor, very close to the pool and to the beach that is just next to the pool. The room was perfect, everything you can ask for. Minibar, great bathroom, air conditioning, huge bed, nice size terrace with a comfy sofa etc. We loved the room.

The beautiful infinity pool is 100 m away and there are always free sunbeds at any time of the day, no trouble in finding free ones. The only negative thing about the pool is that the water gets very hot - understandably given the all day long sunshine - but still, a bit cooler would be better. Anyway, the pool is amazing and time just flies by when you chill out by the edge of it staring at the ocean, waves, surfers, bargaining with the tireless sellers loitering by the beach side hotels.

The food is great too. Breakfast times are 6.30 - 11 so plenty of time for everyone. Great variety of food, we didn't get bored of it during our 2 weeks stay. The poolside meal options and other food / dinner options are nice as well. A bit pricey, but at least guaranteed good quality.

Spa is very nice, clean, absolutely relaxing with professional staff.

Gym well equipped.

What makes the whole place even better is the amazing staff! Everyone is very friendly, helpful and polite. Makes you feel like every single person who works in the hotel is there to make your stay the most wonderful time of your life. They will help with anything, whatever you would need help with.

Great location too. Besides being right by the beach Seminyak centre is steps away. Great restaurants nearby, shops, convenience stores and a very cheap flea market also walking distance.

We both really hope that we can return one day and until then we sure will spread the word about how excellent The Seminyak is!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2932,Great service,50,October 2013,"The hotel grounds are excellent and were as advertised in the photos posted.
We stayed in the garden wing and it is literally a 20m walk across a narrow road to the main resort. The garden wing has its own beautiful pool which is hardly used.
My wife fell ill for a couple of days and with a late. flight out the staff were excellent in finding us a room free of charge for the extra hours so she could rest before the flight.
Well done!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2933,Amazing Resort and Staff,50,November 2013,"We initially had a few issues at the beginning of our stay and mad management aware of these. We then go the most amazing response for the staff and management.

We are so overwhelmed with the level of service and detail that this resort and staff offered that we would recommend it to anyone.

We are already planning another visit here.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2934,A Quiet Oasis In Seminyak,50,October 2013,"This was my sixth time traveling to Bali this year as it has become my absolute favorite travel destination to escape Singapore. I typically traveled with my fianc√© or friends and stayed outside of Seminyak as I prefer a quieter vacation.

However, this time I was treating my Mom to her first trip to Bali and wanted to show her the main area. I chose this resort over several others in the area because of the great reviews, location, and the fact that it wouldn't be a party hotel. I don't mind being near the party, I just want a quiet place to return to at the end of a long day. I also wanted my Mom to have a really relaxing time as she had traveled from New York to visit me in Singapore and Bali.

After staying many times at another five star resort in Jimbaran, this was just as good, if not better in many ways. Our room was absolutely stunning and had direct ocean views, the staff was absolutely amazing and assisted me with every booking request, and the pool area was unbelievable with the swim up bar and perfect ocean views! This stay has made me want to return to Bali and stay directly in Seminyak on my next trip!

The only area for improvement would be the breakfast. I am not a big fan of buffets and would prefer an a la carte option as I am a bit of a picky eater. Other than that, it was a flawless and super enjoyable stay. My Mom and I walked along the beach to Ku De Ta for sunset drinks and I loved how we were directly on the main beach and Main Street but you could hear no noise inside your rooms or around the resort area at night.

We are already in the process of booking our next monthly trip to Bali and I will be taking my fianc√© back here! I am very happy to have two amazing resorts to go to when in Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2935,Luxury on Seminyak Beach,50,November 2013,"Wonderful experience. I only booked the morning of my arrival, after not being happy at other villa accommodation. On my arrival I was upgraded from beach wing to beach jacuzzi suite due to late booking and no availability in beach wing room. The room was beautiful, with a balcony, 2 large screen tv's, comfy bed and lots more. Did not eat in the Restaurant, but did order several meals - room service, which were great. The infinity pool is lovely overlooking the beach. Easy walking to main Eat street, Ku De Ta next door, La Luciola, 3 doors up and Bodyworks Spa a short walk.
Staff were wonderful. Would not hesitate in recommending the Seminyak Beach & Spa Resort. My Stay there was the highlight of my holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2936,The Seminyak was Outstanding!!!,50,November 2013,The Seminyak is one of the best resorts we have had the pleasure of staying at. The resort facilities were amazing especially the infinity pool overlooking the beach. We stayed in one of the Ocean Suites which again was also exceptional and very well maintained. All the staff looked after us so well and were always so positive and a pleasure to deal with. Will definitely be going back to The Seminyak on our next visit :),The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2937,WE WILL BE BACK!!!,50,November 2013,"Absolutely beautiful resort - not an overly huge hotel, so wasn't packed with hundreds of guests & kids etc. Was very quiet & peaceful at breakfast, which was nice, and was also very easy to get a sun lounger or cabana by either of the 2 pools. Swim up bar was handy & had a good selection of snacks & cocktails etc.

All staff just lovely & very attentive to every need. The day spa was incredible & we had 3 x sensational massages over our 6 night stay.

We stayed in an ocean view suite and enjoyed the incredible views from balcony (and shower & jacuzzi area). Room was very spacious, huge comfy king size bed and had lovely bathroom products for guest use. Free WIFI access from room was handy too!

Location was perfect with 5 minute walk to everywhere (Potato Head, W Hotel, Kudeta, La Plancha, Seminyak Square etc.)

The gardens around the resort were lush, established & gave good privacy. The beach outside the resort was also very nice - clean, not crowded & we went swimming every day!

We come to Bali every year - was the first time staying at this resort, but will definitely be returning here! A great find for sure!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2938,Great service for such a big hotel,40,October 2013,"The service at The Seminyak was absolutely fantastic. Staff were always willing to help - making calls for me, setting up a driver, etc. I'm a sensitive sleeper and my first night my room was near the road and the traffic noise was significant. The next day they immediately moved me into another, quieter room. The wifi worked pretty well throughout the entire property and the breakfast was good. I did find the hotel to be a bit too big and slightly outdated but generally comfortable. Staying across the street in the ""garden building"" was completely fine.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2939,Class apart. Highly recommended..!,40,October 2013,"Stayed here for two nights and i must say I had a great time. We had booked the beach wing room for us so the view from the balcony was nice.. i could see the beach..! The room size is comfortable with a luxurious bathroom.
The USP of this hotel i must say is the swimming pool right next to the beach. I could spend hours just relaxing in the water. There is a '5 step' staircase right next to the pool from where you can go to the beach. You should see a photo to believe this. The F&B services near the pool side are also wonderful.
Talking about the location.. Kudeta and Potato Head - the two excellent beach clubs are just next door. You can even walk down to these place from the beach as we did. The sunset view from the pool side is a sight not to be missed.
Food - For non-vegetarians i dont think its a big problem. But for us we had only limited options. Would have appreciated if there were some more vegetarian option (even without egg) in the breakfast apart from only fruits and juices.
Even the spa here is nice and well managed. So one time spa session can be taken.
Overall a wonderful experience. Cheers..!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2940,Amazing Beach & Pool,40,October 2013,"It is a true 5 star hotel. The beach & the pool were the biggest highlight of our stay. We stayed for 3 nights, from October 19-22, 2013. Swimming in the pool and looking into the beach was the most amazing aspect of our stay at the hotel. The service is great, and the room we stayed in was very clean.

There was only one thing which surprised us when we got there, which they did not mention when we made the booking. We choose a Garden view room when we made the booking, thinking that it was just a room with a view of the garden and not the beach. So when i got there i was surprised to find out that the our room was located across the street in another building. So i had to walk for like 15 meters across the side pavement and then cross the very narrow two way street so i can just get into the hotel main entrance. And then i had to walk all the way to go to the pool and beach area. I felt like they should have been more honest with me about that part.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2941,Serene with exceptional location on the main beachfront,50,October 2013,"Stayed here for 3 nights from 21st October 13 to 24th October 13.This is a superb hotel with well trained staff who greet you every time they see you,nothing is a problem for the staff.The food is delicious and the location is the best on the beach,the semiyak sunset from the hotel pool will remain in your mind for ever,will defiantly return

.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2942,Excellent Bali Experience,50,September 2013,This was our first visit to Bali and I was a little apprehensive about the quality of the experience given the reputation Bali has. Overall we loved it and the Seminyak Resort was a significant factor in our enjoyment of the trip. We had one of the rooms with its own outdoor sitting area and pool. It was a tremendous environment and we had a steady stream of guests dropping by. We found the service overall to be very good. Our only dining exposure was for breakfast which we always enjoyed with its considerable variety of cuisine styles. The location is great with easy walking access into the main Seminyak strip. Its a pity New York is so far away.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2943,Blissful Bali,50,October 2013,"We stayed at the Seminyak beach resort and couldn't fault this resort. Our first visit to Bali and we felt cared for and welcomed the whole time, from our meeting at the airport and transfer to the hotel. A large room overlooking the tropical garden and glimpses of the ocean. A plus the large walk in shower. The pool a highlight, beautiful infinity overlooking the beach and ocean. Food from the Sanje cafe welcome for a poolside lunch, however wish there were some menu additions for the evening. We enjoyed the theme dinners especially fisherman market with whole fish, crab and other seafood available. All the staff helpful and ever smiling. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the resort very highly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2944,A wonderful start to our Bali Trip - The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa,50,October 2013,"The moment we arrived at the hotel the friendly staff, well dressed in traditional purple attire welcomed us with flower garlands and a refreshing herbal Iced tea, in a Balinese style. Since we arrived directly from the airport, it was around 11 ish in the morning and we were told that it would take some 10 mins to get our room ready. Normal check in time is at 2 PM. Once we entered our room all our tiredness of a long flight from India, seemed to vanish in one go. The room was designed for optimal comfort, reflected the warmth of the island and its people. A stylish d√©cor, hardwood floors, an earthy color palette and decorative pieces inspired by Bali's artistic heritage.
The Balcony with chic sitting had the Ocean view and was a cheery on the cake. Instantly, I started imagining myself sitting there with my husband for a romantic sunset. Little did i know what else was in store for me. The Infinity Pool with ultimately clear water and awesome view of the Indian Ocean was what we could least expect. The Pool ended just at the beach. The Beach was exceptionally clean. We sat in one of the shacks on the beach and enjoyed the sunset sipping Coconut water from a full sized fruit. Unbeatable...

Upon inquiring with one of the hotel staffs,(he called himself Shah Rukh Khan), he told us about great places in and around Bali. The Close proximity to one of the very famous Beach side restaurant and club - Ku de Ta was an added privilege. Potato Head, Ku de ta, etc. were all walking distance from the hotel. And the best part was that you need not have to step out of the hotel to visit these places. Its connected by the beach itself.

We got a 30 min complimentary facial each,in the beautifully constructed spa. We stayed here for two nights. And I have to admit that the experience was priceless.

The only setback of the hotel was food. They didnt quite have many options for vegetarians who even don't take eggs. Even the breads in the breakfast had eggs in it. So we would only have fruits and freshly squeezed juices. The second day however we made a request at the reception about our dietary habit. They prepared a vegetarian rice specially for us for breakfast. So it is advisable to mention your food preference at the time of check in.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2945,Lacking in service,30,September 2013,"We stayed in an Ocean view Suite and whilst the hotel was stunning the music from Kudeta starts at 7am and goes late into the evening. Very unfortunate. Breakfast choice was disappointing with scrambled eggs being rolled into a ball and served as omlettes. The pool area is stunning but everyday I had to go and find someone to order lunch or a drink and on their way to us they would stop and serve other people. A hotel of this class should be a lot more attentive.
Stunning setting but make sure you don't stay on the Ku De Ta side and be patient until they up the service.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2946,Great place to stay,50,October 2013,Relaxed environment with warm and helpful staff. We were in the beach wing and enjoyed drinks on the balcony whilst watching the wonderful sunsets. The breakfast buffet had an excellent selection and we also enjoyed the menu at the restaurant in the evening. The infinity pool was amazing & the complimentary aqua cycle and aqua aerobics each day gave us a good work out and was really appreciated.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2947,Lots of hiccups,30,October 2013,"Pros:
-Staff exceptionally warm and welcoming
-Pool and beach area were very nice. Really liked the infinity pool overlooking the beach.
-Grounds were beautiful
-Breakfast was good

Cons:
-The hotel car service picked us up at the airport. Within a minute of being in the car, our driver got in a road rage argument with the car in front of us, complete with him getting out of the car and challenging the guy to a fight. The other guy wouldn't fight, and our driver came back and said if we weren't with him, he would have ""killed him!"". Not professional or a great way to start our vacation.
-My reservation didn't say ""room only"" or ""breakfast included"" so I emailed the hotel to ask and was told breakfast was included. At check-in I was told I had a room only. I showed them the email saying otherwise, and they said they would not honor it. It took escalating to the general manager for them to honor it. This should not have to happen. Hotel staff or at least management should be empowered to honor something proven in writing.
-Every morning at breakfast was an ordeal because the staff were not aware that our breakfast was comped. There should have been more communication between staff so this wasn't an issue for us.
-The battery on our room door died. We were told they would fix it while we were out. We were gone for 4 hours, came back, and the battery still wasn't fixed. We had to stand there and wait while they fixed it.

I feel bad for saying all this because the staff was so nice, but it just wasn't a great start to our Bali vacation. I got a low rate, but if I had paid full price, I would NOT be happy. We're in Ubud now in a STUNNING, truly 5-star hotel with stellar service, so we're finally really enjoying our vacation.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2948,Good hotel with some things to improve,40,September 2013,"8 good days spent in The Seminyak. We stayed in the beach wing. The room was good, esp. well prepared before we arrived (nice bath, blossoms...). This however could have been anywhere in the world. In this sort of hotel, one does not spend a lot of time in the room, so it was fine. The chapel, the infinity pool and the park around these all is just awesome.
Everything was clean, the personnel very polite and helpful - especially at the reception area. (They arranged us a fantastic romantic seaside dinner in a small restaurant in Jimbaran:))
The breakfast was good - both Asian and Western dishes. Sometimes the breakfast area was too crowded, so we did not always find a table. Also, organization around breakfast was not good. Somtimes we were waiting for 25 minutes to get a coffee - after having asked twice for it. (as a consultant would say: no one was responsible for anything, no task, no area - except for the two ladies at the egg station...however one of them could just make pancakes and waffles all the time - this would reduce the queue.)
The poolside area is great (with good finger food too:)) - it was not always easy to find a sun lounger....esp. when too many Germans / their towels around (and yes, living in Germany, i may write that, as it is true!!!).
We enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak - it is a good hotel, that also offers good things to spend time with (it was funny to release the little turtles in the sea, but also the GM's cocktail party is a great idea). The spa is very good - it looks a bit expensive, but they use quality products - my wife loved it!
The personnel is not always prepared for ""the unexpected"", sometimes the do hard to walk the ""last mile"", but they are all nice.
Overall: good value for money on the fantastic Seminyak beach, if you would like to relax and enjoy the sun or some cocktails at the beach.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2949,Romantic and they will even arrange a sitter for your kid.,50,October 2013,"Wonderful view, romantic ambience. Serene resort. Takes you out of the hustle and bustle of city life, and even Bali life. A resort that takes u away to near paradise. The only thing is that Seminyak on it's own is a busy town....which has quite a bit of modern shops. Otherwise, the resort is awesome.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2950,You can do better in Bali for the price,30,October 2013,"First I will say that I am an tough reviewer. I cross compare lodging options painstakingly before making a decision so am always trying to find the best of the best. So it says one thing that SBRS was selected after much comparison. It is nicely located near Ku De Ta and walking distance to some nice local a resaurants and shopping. However, the hotel just does not represent good value for the price being charged. Breakfast service was very questionable (had to repeatedly ask every day for a second cup of coffee) and food options while OK, again not commensurate to the pricing. The pool is nice with an infinity edge right on the beach but on the small side and felt a bit overcrowded at times. Staff were helpful and friendly at times and then seemingly would go on mental vacation and not respond to simple requests. If I had paid about $300ish , I would have felt like the hotel represented good value but I paid much more. You can do better in Bali. Service is just too hit and miss and extra services such as spa are tremendously overpriced.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2951,Perfect location & friendly staff,50,September 2013,"Stayed here for 3 nights for the start of our honeymoon. The staff were friendly and professional. They even organised a 'honeymoon cake' for us. It was a perfect location for shopping in Seminyak and all the superior dining experiences. We loved sitting around the pool, overlooking the beach, the pool bar is a great plus. We also enjoyed a couple's massage at their beautiful in-house spa. We both loved staying at The Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2952,Dream Stay ...,50,October 2013,"This was certainly one of our best stays ever - everything was perfect: location, design of the rooms, service, friendliness of the staff and food .
The rooms are clean, spacious,
We especially liked the breakfast - a huge selection of dishes and drinks, and a beautiful ambience in the restaurant. The Food was fabulous. We got experience the BBQ .Every thing was delicious and probably ate too much with many choice.
I remember waiters who offered me a special drink every morning during breakfast, which made me, feel that he really cares about the hotel guests.
The points are given for the excellent hardware and facilities of the resort, as well as the credit of the services of most of the hotel staff‚Ä¶ we would still rate this resort with 5 points.
I will recommend it to all my friend and social networks.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2953,Relaxing and beautiful resort,50,September 2013,"My hubby and myself stayed here 5 nights and it was fantastic, the staff are so friendly, food is lush and beach wing room was comfy and perfect size.

We were invited to help release new born turtles in the ocean which was a fantastic experience, also had a great seafood buffet, all fresh and all you can eat for $ 35 AUD each! it was amazing.

Highly recommend staying at this resort and will happily stay here again on our next visit to Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2954,Most Relaxing Holiday Ever,40,October 2013,"Went with hubby for 9 days and had the most relaxing holiday ever. Great buffet breakfast, impeccable service, very clean rooms and very friendly staff. The pools were wonderful with plenty of lounges (although we learnt to get there early to guarantee one). Outside the resort was a leisurely stroll to restaurants and shops - special mention to WahWah restaurant almost opposite, yum!!
Only disappointment was unavailability of 2 wine requests from the wine list when we had the midweek seafood buffet. We found it strange that a resort that has a large wine cellar did not have the wines available for dinner, but apart from that small blip every thing was perfect!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2955,"Great place, awesome customer service!",50,March 2013,"Went here on a ""honeymoon"" trip with my wife after our wedding along with two other couples. We had ordered the 2br villa for 3 nights but found out that the hot water tank was way less (60L) than the tub (160L for each room!) so one of my friends was so disappointed that they couldn't take a warm bath.. However, the manager came (it was late night around 9-10pm) and talked to us and offered to upgrade us to 1br villa each facing the ocean. Even though we still couldn't use the hottub, I did appreciate the gesture.

Overall it was a great stay for us. The breakfast was delicious and the infinity pool was awesome. It's only steps away from the beach too! The only downside of the stay was the weather wasn't that great, but I can't blame the hotel for that.. :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2956,Loved it!!!,50,September 2013,"Went here with some friends to celebrate a big birthday!! It was perfect for a grown up, relaxing trip! Beautiful hotel, excellent buffet breakfast, brilliant service and lovely friendly staff. The location was great, near lots of great restaurants and shops. Spa was lovely but a bit pricey. Loved the free daily aqua aerobics with Gerald! Lots of fun and a great bonus!! Looking forward to coming back to try the new aqua-bike classes when the bikes arrive!
Thanks again, we'll be back!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2957,Great few days,50,July 2013,"We had a lovely stay in July. We had two large luxurious rooms, with a beautiful outlook and spent four days often by the stunning pool, overlooking the ocean. We also did a yoga class in the beautiful pavilion, enjoyed a varied and tasty breakfast each morning and walked around town and the beach from The Seminyak's great position. The rooms are really good - we had entry level rooms, which were spotless and very comfortable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2958,Great hotel and good location,50,August 2013,"A very short stay at this place which is amazing. The villas are very well furbished, comfortable and perfect to relax with the pool, jacuzzi and a top service. The beach front restaurant is perfect at sunset and the food is very good although not so much local. The atmosphere may be a bit absent but the clients seem to seek to remain on their own. For a night or 2 it is a great experience but rather pricey.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2959,"Great hotel (luxury, service & location) but lacks atmosphere in the evening",40,August 2013,"We chose this hotel for a couple of nights of luxury before leaving after 2 weeks in Bali. We‚Äôd booked a suite with Jacuzzi and view of the ocean. Expensive but still a good deal by comparison to the international 5 star hotel chains. To our delight we were upgraded on arrival to an immense garden villa with private pool and waterways around the villa. WOW.

225m¬≤ of luxury. Gigantic, comfortable bed from which you can step through the bay windows and plunge into your pool. Loungers in the shallow part of the pool. Beautiful bathroom; the shower has doors opening onto the vegetation at the back. All typical 5 star amenities. The only draw back is that you are behind your villa walls, no view on anything, however I guess it‚Äôs the price of total privacy.

The hotel‚Äôs ocean front pool is huge, plenty of loungers and good service. You can access the beach directly. Beach is clean and goes on for kilometers in both directions. Sunset is a great time to be here as the Indonesian families arrive to swim, fly kites, play football and hang out.
Service at the hotel is great. I arrived with a backpack soaked through after the incredibly awful Indra Jaya Fast Boat service dropped it in the sea. All of my clothes were cleaned and dropped back to me in under 24 hours.

Breakfast is one of the most varied I‚Äôve ever seen; cornflakes, eggs any way, local dishes, cheeses, meats, yoghurts, sushi, various coffees. I even found baked beans.

There‚Äôs no atmosphere in the hotel in the evening and the pool/ocean front bar closes early. People do not hang around in the evening. We didn‚Äôt eat there in the evening but walked 10 mins into central Seminyak where there are loads of great restaurants and bars. The Chandi has the best cocktails I‚Äôve ever tasted as well as fabulous food. You can also walk along the beach 15 mins (turn right on the beach when you leave the hotel) to reach Potato head or the W hotel which has a hopping beach front bar deck. Dress up a minimum so you don‚Äôt feel out of place, this is the only time in Indonesia I‚Äôve seen where the majority of girls are wearing towering high heels;-)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2960,Perfect honeymoon at private villa,50,September 2013,"We got merried at the purnama chapel of the seminyak beach resort in sept 28th. The glass chapel with beautifull beach view,, awesome..!!
We chose to take a private villa for our honeymoon. A really big room, with private cabana dan pool. We can swim naked and go around the room totally naked..hahahaha
Breakfast in santan restaurant, they have various and complate menu from appatizer, the main course and dessert,, from indonesian and western menu, served in buffet from 6.30-10.30
They also have a really big swimming pool with the view of seminyak beach and the sound of wave is accompany us while we stay @the seminyak...
The staff was so kind and fast respon from check in, while we ordered room service, asked for taxi until check out.
It was a really great experience and absolutely we would never forget this place and will get back here someday",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2961,"""The Seminyak"" - good facilities and location",50,September 2013,"First of all , I would like to say that we were very lucky to be upgraded by the hotel so we stayed in the beach wing suite for 3 nights. so the room was so spacious. we have our balcony and a Jacuzzi facing the ocean.

This hotel is perfect for those who look for a nice swimming pool to chillax. the infinity pool is right on the Seminyak beach. and there's plenty of room there, even the hotel is busy, you can still find lounges. just like many of the hotels in Seminyak, you can expect to see amazing sunset view by the pool side.

The location of this hotel is very nice too, just walking distance from the boutique street. Kudeta and the Legian are right next-door.

The only thing which really frustrated me was the Wi-Fi access by the pool side. perhaps it's a big open area so the network is not stable at all.

Please note the name of this hotel is Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. I think the hotel is branded as ""the Seminyak "" bur frankly this name is very confusing for taxi drivers",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2962,Excellent if aware,50,September 2013,Just enjoyed an excellent stay at this resort - main resort was hard to fault and service was excellent. Stayed in the Garden Wing and from other TA reviews we realised beforehand that crossing the road was an inconvenience and detracted slightly. the full price for staying at the Garden Wing is excessive given its over the road status and sterile nature.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2963,Good Resort - Hotel Average,30,September 2013,"Just returned from a 7-night stay at this Resort Hotel. We booked an ocean view room which was spacious and comfortable. The hotel itself is well maintained and the pool location adjacent to the beach front is a very pleasant place to while away a few hours on a sun bed. The staff are all pleasant and attentive.
We had a few issues which we felt were not in keeping with a resort hotel in this price range:
1. When we booked our room through the hotel's web site we were quoted a price in USD. However, when I was asked to pay on arrival and produced my credit card, I was advised that card payments would be charged in Indonesian Rupiah as this is ""company policy"". The hotel are using an exchange rate some 5% above the tourist rate, so your actual room rate is 5% more than they quote. Also, you then get charged an exchange rate by your card provider to switch back to your local currency. I complained about this immediately, and was advised it would be resolved and I would receive a refund to my card - it never happened.
2. Occasionally we would experience a strong smell of sewage in our room. We initially thought this was due to the excavation / upgrade work taking place on the pavements / sewers outside the hotel front, however, we subsequently found that the smell was coming from the hotels own sewage system and was being drawn into the room through the air conditioning system. Despite several complaints and an assurance that their ""engineering department"" would look into it, the problem was never resolved.
3. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Legian every 3 hours from 10:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs with returns on the half-hour. We took the 16:00 hrs service one day and on drop-off asked the driver if this was where we could collect the return journey at 19:30hrs. He said it was. We arrived back just after 19:00hrs and by 20:00hrs gave up and took a taxi back. When I questioned reception regarding this, they said we should have told the driver we wanted the return trip. We told the receptionist we had, and never received a satisfactory explanation as to why we were left stranded. Either they are going to provide a shuttle service, or they are not - it should not be a random service...
4. We attempted to organise a tour of the island. We were advised that we could hire a car and driver at an hourly rate. When I said that we were looking more for an organised tour I was presented with some folders containing tour information in German; not very helpful. Eventually, the hotel were able to provide a leaflet from a tour company from which we selected a tour which they booked on our behalf. I was surprised that this request proved so troublesome; I would have thought that requests for organised island tours were not that rare in a large resort hotel.
Seminyak is an up-and-coming resort. It is much smaller / quieter than Legian, and already has some high-end shops and good quality restaurants available. They are currently upgrading the pavements in a lot of the resort which is badly needed as walking around requires care, particularly in the evening.
Would we return? To Seminyak; possibly, but not to this hotel resort. It does not represent good value for money in this price bracket. I would expect issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently at this end of the market - the staff were able to say all the right things, but ultimately could not sort issues out effectively.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2964,"Extraordinary and Amazing, in the Heart of Seminyak",50,October 2012,"We stayed in the Suite on 9-10 Aug 2013, after 2 nights stay in quiet and peaceful Ubud. upothe atmosphere of Seminyak is definitely 180 Degree from Ubud. on the way to Seminyak, we passed thru Kuta and Legian, and was amazed how bustling these places were.

however entering Seminyak area, the atmopshere was not as busy as those 2 places. upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staffs. check in was swift and fast, we were then ushered to our suite. opening the door, we were greeted by the ocean view and how big the room was. the bathroom itself was large enought with jacuzzi overlooking the ocean. keep in mind though, it took forever to fill in the Jacuzzi.

the hotel has direct access to the Seminyak Beach, and it was extremely lovely. it was like having a private beach. you can opt to swim in the Infinity pool, or just lazying around in the sun lounges. but of course we prefer real beach with real white sandy beach, so the beach was the choice. the hotel itself is very secure with security guard and a beach lifeguard on duty on the entrance, so you dont have to worry for any unlawful trespassing by non-hotel guests to the hotel premises.

Staying in this hotel means you can skip those expensive sunset view from nearby beachclubs. the Sunset view from the hotel areas (we chose Sanje Lounge) is so memorable, that we spent 2 afternoons in the Sanje lounge just to wait and watch the sun went down.

the hotel was situated next to the famous KUDETA beachclub, and when we were staying there, there was an annual party held in the KUDETA. surely it was noisy the whole afternoon and night, but the hotel was thoughtful and provide every rooms with earplugs. fortunately we didnt hear a thing during the whole night.

we dont know about dinner menu, since we ventured outside to eat, and with so many very good restaurants nearby the hotels areas, such as the CHANDI or MYKONOS we decided to give them a try.

Breakfast was Excellent!. in fact we are very thankful to the hotel. we are only supposed to be entitled for 2 adults complimentary breakfast, however our 10 yr old kid is allowed to have free BReakfast for 2 days we stayed there, thank you!!

overall, we really love this hotel and will definitely stay there again if we ever decided to stay in Seminyak area again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2965,No better pool to kick back and relax,40,September 2013,"The last stop of our honeymoon and we couldn't have picked a better place. Our room exceeded expectations with a modern fit out and HUGE jacuzzi overlooking the beach. We loved the extra effort to make us feel welcomed, including the towel animals surrounded by rose petals. The Seminyak is walking distance to a myriad of shops and great restaurants. We were worried about city noise, however, once inside the resort you are adequately shielded from outside noise. The resort has a great buffet breakfast but we made sure to venture out for other meals because there is so much on offer, one of the main reasons we traveled to Bali was food! The crown jewel of this place would definitely be the pool with a view to rival any around the world. We spent many hours lying by the pool which is where I raise my only concern. It would have been nicer if staff were more proactive in taking pool side food/drink orders, something which was consistently lacking over the 3 days of our stay. This is only a small concern from a lazy guest, however, it is a service expected from a 5 star resort. All in all, an awesome place to stay and we would definitely go back. Highly recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2966,"""We'll be back with the family ! """,50,August 2013,"Following the disappointment of our cruise being cancelled out of Singapore on day of departure, we decided on Bali as an alternative holiday.The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa was certainly the tonic we needed -a lovely resort in a perfect location! The manicured gardens , picture perfect pool areas,a fantastic,clean well appointed room with great views of the beach. However it was the staff who put the icing on our 10 day stay ! From Mr Gunawan and the Front Office staff to the waiters, maintenance and housekeeping staff - always a smile and nothing was too much trouble !! Lots of restaurants in the near vicinity with a variety of cuisines.
A super holiday that we hope to replicate with our family- thanks SBR&S !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2967,Amazing place for our 25th wedding Anniversary,50,September 2013,"My husband and I stayed at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for 9 days to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary and everything exceeded our expectations. The staff were super friendly, room was fantastic, clean and well appointed. Fun little personal touches like the towel animals made me smile and the welcome letter and invitation to cocktail party, rose petals and cake made it all special. The breakfast was delicious, my favourite was the waffles- yum! The pool was amazing and great free activities like Aqua gym which is a surprisingly good work out. The Seminyak is close to the main square and markets, and within walking distance to brilliant restaurants. Security is tight which is reassuring. Overall fantastic.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2968,Will definitely go back,40,September 2013,"Great resort, perfect location. Plenty on offer for breakfast and the perfect spot for sunset cocktails. Staff were happy to book restaurants on our behalf and were friendly at all times. From the groundskeeper, to room cleaner and bar staff- they always had a smile and friendly hello.
On booking I was concerned that the resort may be noisy as its next door to KuDeTa but we didn't hear any of the music from there.
There was even construction across the road but we didn't hear any of that noise in our room. Another bonus was the total block out curtains so we were not woken by the early sunrises.
Overall a great resort without a pretentious feel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2969,Great spot on the beach!,50,September 2013,"Stayed for 8 nights at the SBR&S and very much enjoyed the experience. Chose it for being on the beach which we felt was more comfortable due to the fresh breeze in the afternoon heat (rather than a villa). Ininity pool with choice of shade was beautiful and a perfect spot to spend the day. Easy walking distance to Ku De Ta, Potato head, La Lucciola and Petitenget, as well as to Jl Oberoi (Eat Street) with plenty of boutiques and shops.

Special mention to Gerard and his twice daily Aquagym - a great inspiration and fantastic exercise adding greatly to a wonderfully relaxing holiday. In fact, I would say his offer distinguished the hotel from (very) nice to great!

Spacious room, very quiet , friendly staff, great choice at breakfast ( fresh tropical fruit, European breads, cold cuts, jams, pastries, omelettes, sushi, ... you name it, it was there. Even the coffe wasn't half bad). Had dinner at the pool bar which was nice for the first night but there are so many nicer dinners to be had near by. Also treated ourselves to a last day spa body rub in lieu of a late check-out to prepare for our 11 pm flight back home.

Quick recommedation for trip activities: Uluwatu  to soak up some amazing surf vibes, then the fire temple dance but don't bother with Jimbaran bay seafood dinner on the beach. For the same money, treat yourself to a three course meal at Sardine! Walked to Kuta on the beach but couldn't wait to get back out of there again fast enough. Luckily, the SBR&S was our safe haven & oasis. Definitely recommend staying there and would consider going back there for a lazy week in Bali!

2970,Excellent ... Couldn't ask for more,40,September 2013,"Me and wife stayed at the resort for 4 nights and it was amazing. Property is well maintained , staff is well behaved and speaks English really well. Very close to Semniyak squar. It's THE place for the ultimate relaxation. I would definitely recommend thIs resort. They even allowed late check out for free of charge.
We will surely return.

2971,just fabulous!,50,September 2013,"Room was divine! Hotel staff were delightful, and nothing was too much trouble.
Any request we had was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Breakfasts were beautiful...so much variety, excellent quality and superb service. Location was excellent...close enough to walk to markets etc etc, but very quiet at night (except for the pounding surf!!!!) Our room overlooked the gardens and the beach, so our balcony was the perfect spot for the morning coffee, or the pre dinner G&T! So sad to leave....will be back, and would highly recommend the Seminyak Beach Resort to those wanting great service, location, and true Balinese hospitality.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2972,Brilliant,50,August 2013,"My daughter and I recently holidayed at the Seminyak and would definitely return. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and throughout our stay all staff that we encountered were friendly and polite. We had a beach view room which afforded us lovely views of the grounds, the pools and the beach; lovely to wake up and sit on the balcony and enjoy the serenity! The breakfasts were part of our accommodation and we were afforded a lot of choice, we found that often we did not need lunch. Again the staff were very accommodating. On one occasion the couple next to us asked for another coffee and they took this to sit by the pool to enjoy. The gym was small but adequate, with complimentary water and towels. The pools were clean, beach towels provided and with the design being 'infinity' was superb to swim to the end and look towards the ocean. A bonus for us was that they were not a lot of families with young children, even though I have 3 children (all adult now) was lovely to relax without the conundrum that sometimes appears with lots of young children. We spent of lot of time relaxing by the pool, not interrupted at all - perfection. The room was very nice, large and clean and was serviced each day and then again towards the evening, again with lots of complimentary water. We felt very secure at the Seminyak, and we were very well looked after - I am sure we will return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2973,Suprisingly Improved,50,August 2013,"This is my 3rd visit within this 2 year. I stayed for 3 days with my boyfriend and again we've decided to stay at the Seminyak.
My last visit which is last year was great although several things wasnt went well. Room service was quite took times to delivered and the GM seems always not available. But now, they seems improving the quality either the food and service which I didnt expect at the first place. The management seem pay more attention to the guest, it's easier to get to meet the GM compare to my last visit. Basically they all around so easier to meet.
They also have arranged a very nice Balinese Authentic dinner buffee with Balinese attraction which is become a memorable moment for us - and it's save more time to dine in rather than going out a long the crowed seminyak street. I think at some point its better to dine in, they have great selection of wine, great food and reasonable price.
Staff here are -wow- they are incredible bunch of people, thank you guys to make my every stay is count. Overall, the management has been done big changed, big improvement I will definetely come back maybe in 3 month (very soon). Big kiss from Dubai!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2974,Loved it!,50,September 2013,"We stayed for 7 nights at the Seminyak to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and loved everything about the hotel. The service was incredible by all the staff at the hotel - often going beyond the call of duty. We stayed in the beach wing and got a nice quiet room away from the street - only heard the ocean from our room. We looked at staying in a suite but they were next to the street so we decided against it.

Breakfast buffet was amazing with so many options available. Also loved the organised yoga classes and aqua gym with Gerald - great start to the day...he had us coming back every day. Lots of deck chairs available throughout the day and the infinity pool was a great place to relax away from the busy streets of Seminyak.
Only recommendations would be to increase the size of the gym or number of pieces of equipment. One treadmill and one bike is a little lean for a hotel of this size.

Overall a fantastic experience at the Seminyak - would love to come back next time with the kids.

Thanks again

2975,Wonderfull holiday experience at the SEMINYAK HOTEL,50,September 2013,"Just returned to Adelaide, Australia after having a wonderfull, relaxing break at The Seminyak Hotel in Seminyak, Bali.
Having stayed in Seminyak previously, it suits our lifestyle, plenty to do, or in fact plenty ""not"" do do if so inclined. Chose this Hotel, having previously stayed next door , took a look on our last trip, the pools are sensational, nice swim up bar, plenty of lazy boys and umbrellas and a pretty cool swim up bar.
The vila was outstanding, staff were very friendly and attentive, nothing too much trouble.
My wife and I met Sebastian the General Manager, and his assistant Made, who are inspirational in building a high class Brand, and the Spa Facility and its staff are truly unbelievable.
Reasonably priced, great position on a lovely beach, close to Kudeta and my favourite La Lucilola's its a first choice in future,
Congratulations to the entire team, regards Wayne, Terry, Sam &Renee",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2976,Don't be fooled by their website....,20,September 2013,"This hotel is another example of how a good website can embellish reality. The website describes itself as ‚ÄúThe Seminyak is a stylish beachfront resort that‚Ä¶‚Äù. As for the room types, it refers to ‚Äúbeach, ocean and garden views‚Äù. Pictures on the website are top class.

Here we go. We check in and are told that our room is in a building behind the hotel. To get to our room, we have to exit the property, cross a busy public street and walk 100 meters on a sidewalk on which one has to watch his feet in order not to break his neck.
There was our building--a huge square apartment building. We were on the 3rd floor. No lift, luckily we were assisted up with our luggage. The room was clean and modern, nothing to show off about or send photos home.
The view--no ocean, no beach and no garden. The view was a wall and since we were on the 3rd floor, we could see a bit of the pool (the neighbour‚Äôs pool though). Every time we wanted to go to the beach, we had to make our way on the treacherous sidewalk, cross the busy street and enter the main property. Walking to the beach barefoot in a bikini was a no go.

When you book that hotel, don‚Äôt be blinded by the website and ask specifically where they will put you. For the same price, you can get better hotels in that area (we have been living in Indonesia for 21 years).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2977,Everything you could want in a hotel,50,August 2013,"What a great place, ticks all the boxes-great pools with different areas to hang out during the day, very good breakfast buffet, the ocean view room (3rd floor) was amazing, with views (and a spa) looking out over the water, very comfortable and large room, and great service. Still beaten by The Legian but for the price this place is great, would definitely return. Also location does not get better than this. The only negative and no fault of the hotel was KuDeTa was having some crazy and extremely noisy party when we were there which meant little sleep, but the hotel informed guests in advance and provided ear plugs which was a considerate touch!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2978,great stay - 3rd time,50,June 2013,we have stayed here as a family ( 1 child = last visit she was 2years) its just so lovely. the location is excellent and the infinity pool just gorgeous. very short taxi ride or walk to so many amazing places for dinner. supermarket near by for supplies. right on the beach. kids pool is great.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2979,Location Views & More,50,September 2013,"My daughter and I had six wonderful nights at this resort we had an ocean view suite which was fantastic very spacious and a great view of the ocean, breakfast was included with wonderful tropical fruits to English cook breakfast etc etc, choice of coffee up to Melbourne standard. The staff were so helpfull and very friendly. Would definately recommend this hotel and we will certainly be back again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2980,Room with a view,50,July 2013,"Have just returned from 12 wonderful days and nights at The Seminyak, we choose the sea view room and the view was amazing great sunsets.

The staff were superb always happy, smiling, wiling to chat and do anything for us.

Breakfast was top notch with plenty to choose from.

Lazy days by the beautiful pool where the pool staff looked after us really well.

The room was lovely, much bigger than I had expected, cleaned really well each day and a great walkin shower, we tried the jacuzzi but it took a while to fill up.

Only thing that would have made it even better would be for them to promote their evening food more as the food was really good just not many people in the restaurant.

Would happily return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2981,Excellent service quality,50,August 2013,"Me and my wife stayed here for 4 nights recently and both of us are extremely happy with the experience. The location is awesome, right between Oberoi and Legian resort and it matches up to the same standards at a little lower price. We took the beach view room and were upgraded to the junior suite. There were a lot of activities like acquagym, yoga offered. We were also invited to a complimentary cocktail session on day 1. Buffet breakfast is good too. The wifi in the room was little intermittent and could be improved.

One thing that stands out for this hotel is staff service quality. I have to specifically mention a gentleman on concierge named Gunawan Prabowo. The was excellent and helped us plan our day on many occasions. He always went out of this way to assist us and make sure we had a comfortable stay. I hope he gets recognized for keeping that smile and service attitude on throughout our stay. I would recommend this hotel any day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2982,Over priced!,30,August 2013,"Great beach with the pool in front. Really liked the staff who were very polite. Unfortunately I paid 5000.00 to stay one week. An ocean view suite. My view was of roof tops with a triangular view of the ocean, the room small and as others have stated the room smells if sewage by noon which they try to mask with air fresheners. The bathtub literally takes 2.5 hours to fill so we only tried this once. There are very few seats by the swim up bar so no one goes there, it's empty and not enough lounge chairs by the pool. This is not a 5 star resort by any means and unfortunately for me I listened to my travel agent and should have believed the comments on this forum as they are true. Enjoyed the release of the turtles, nice touch. Very over priced for what you get.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2983,Great beachfront resort,50,August 2013,"We stayed here for 3 nights in August as part of our honeymoon.

We booked a suite with an ocean view but got upgraded to one of the villas when checking in. It wasn't one of the ocean facing ones but it was still an awesome room with a pool surrounding the bedroom and an outdoor seating area and pagoda. It was really quiet and private, not overlooked by the hotel behind. John legend was staying in one of the villas opposite us!

The location of the hotel is great, direct beachfront access, although we didn't really go on the beach, instead sticking to the pool area!

The pool wasn't too busy, we always got sunbeds easily and staff run around the pool taking food and drink orders and looking after you.

Breakfast buffet was excellent here, freshly cooked omelettes and pancakes were the highlight. Good coffees as well.

We ate at the hotel one evening which was a special balinese buffet style menu in the garden with dancing. It was good to try some local dishes, although the food wasn't that great to be honest. We had lunches from the regular al a carte menu which was decent enough for a snack by the pool.

Definitely recommended for a beach hotel in seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2984,"Amazing resort, service impeccable",50,August 2013,"Our experience of this resort was exceptional. The four standout reasons to visit this resort in our opinion are service, spa, location and pool. Firstly, the service was the most friendly and helpful we have ever experienced. Every member of staff from the receptionist and waiters to the gardeners would go out of their way to greet us with a friendly smile and help with our requests. We did not fully appreciate how great this service was until visiting other resorts in Bali on our trip. The spa is quite expensive, but worth every penny. Again, very friendly staff, thoughtful consultation prior to the massage and a relaxing environment. The location on Seminyak beach is ideal. There are a number of great restaurants within a short stroll along the beach or into town - La Lucciola is a five minute walk down the beach to the right and is perfect for lunch, Ku De Ta is to the left of the resort and is great for dinner and drinks. Relaxing by the pool during the day and watching the sun set in the evening is a must.

The only drawback for this hotel is the restaurant for dinner. We did not eat at the hotel as it was empty and there are plenty of great restaurants which are often cheaper in town. Another must visit is Chandi.

Would definitely choose this resort again if we ever go back to Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2985,Great option if you‚Äôre looking for a resort experience.,40,September 2012,"We stayed at this property about a year and a half ago (actually Jan 2012, but the drop down doesn't go back that far) and had a good experience. I promptly logged on to TA after to post a review, but I'm surprised/embarrassed/confused to find that the review was published for/under the incorrect property. I recall that there were very few reviews and not much information about The Seminyak around that time, as it had recently had its full opening, but I also recall being careful to post the review to the specific property. I'm not sure what happened, but I certainly want to make the correction. Pasted below are my original comments.

We stayed around New Year‚Äôs, one night in a 1 bedroom villa and other nights in a standard (1 King) room. The property is lovely; the staff professional and courteous. The oceanfront villa was stunning. The standard room was very nice. The food was fine. The fitness center, sadly, was a bit lacking; it was far too small for such a large property. All that said, if you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable resort experience, this is a great choice. It felt, to me, however, a bit too much like I could have been on a resort anywhere in the world. I‚Äôd stay again if I just wanted posh pool time and the like; I‚Äôd probably choose something else (and probably in a different town than Seminyak) if I wanted to experience more Balinese culture.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2986,Fantastic Service and Excellent Resort,50,October 2012,"We stayed at the Seminyak beach resort and Spa in October 2012, I have been at little lax in writing this review but felt I had too after reading a number of poor reviews for this facility. This could not be further from my wife and my own experience.

Firstly, the resort is well positioned on the beach at Seminyak and the view from the infinity pool is absolutely unsurpassed. The pool bar pool is separate from the main pool with both pools enjoying sufficient lounges and umbrellas. The pool bar pool also has a number of private cabanas for the perfect relaxing day. Service at the pool bar was excellent with friendly, prompt and professional staff. The drinks were slightly more expensive here tan outside the resort but you expect this in high end properties such as this one.

We were booked in the Garden wing on arrival, we had read all the reviews and were aware that this wing is over the road from the main complex and much quieter. The rooms in this wing however are appointed to the same high level as in the main hotel side, so if your budget is restricted you can make a considerable saving by staying in this wing. One point, the pool in this section is great, but the pool bar was only in operation for short periods of time while we were on this side of the resort

During our stay my wife became ill and the service and support provided by the staff again was unsurpassed. Reception organised a professional doctor who arrived with a nurse and assistant who was able to dispense immediately the required medication at a very reasonable cost.

After this I requested an upgrade to the beach side of the hotel, and a suite was available at a reasonable additional cost, this provided easier access to the main resort facilities. The suite room was very high end with great air conditioning, balcony and bathroom - there was some condensation from the air conditioning vents but this was the only very slight fault in the room. Rooms were clean and extremely well serviced.

After my wife's illness we ate in at the in house restaurant more frequently, breakfast was superb and freshly cooked options eggs, omelettes and pancakes were always available with a magnificent range of fresh fruit and buffet options. Coffee was excellent. The Spa facilities were among the best we have seen and used in a range of resorts. All staff provided excellent and professional service. We will stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2987,Great hotel but dreadful Internet,40,August 2013,"We stayed for 7 days in early August. We were impressed with the hotel generally, the pool and the staff. Breakfast was fine and we were surprised that there were some negative reviews on that. The hotel needs to make more use of its location and promote the dining as one night we were the only ones there. The seafood BBQ was great and would recommend.

The big downer was the wifi. It was not just intermittent but went down or hours especially during the day. Even reception said they had problems. Fix that up and we will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2988,Beautiful beachside hotel,50,August 2013,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 9 nights recently and I have to say that the hotel and the grounds are stunning. We stayed in an ocean view suite in one of the rooms closest to the sea (and closest to Ku De Ta but that did not bother us). The suite was huge and very clean and well kept. It is a modern hotel with all the amenities required. The grounds are immaculate and the staff and manager are happy, helpful and eager to please. Surprisingly though there is no concierge or staff with a good knowledge of day trips and only a limited selection of leaflets. We researched and found our own though the staff were happy to call and book for us. Breakfast is good (except for the cereal on offer), just a shame there is no view but that is because the villas are in the way. We only ate lunches at the restaurant but they were very nice and the chef will cater for your needs. I do not think they make the most of the seafront location though. One day there were no dining tables at all for lunch. Strangely there are only a handful of beds around the swim up bar so it was always empty. Plus the water in the swim up bar was too cold so we did not sit here more than once! If they warmed up the water and added a few beds they may get a few more customers spending their money! A great tip from another TA review is that this hotel will allow you to bring your own wine to the pool area and they will charge 50,000 rupee corkage. For that you will get a bucket of ice! Wah Wah restaurant opposite the hotel has a wine shop cheaper than the hotel shop and bar. Local wine is fine. There is not much atmosphere at the hotel so we went out for sunset. Out of all the sunset bars (Ku De Ta, Potato Head & Woo Bar). Woo Bar was our favourite. It‚Äôs a good 10/15 minute walk to Seminyak square but a taxi us only 10/15k rupees. Lots of places on ‚Äòeat street‚Äô though no locals had heard of eat street so ask for Jln Oberoi! It‚Äôs the main strip with lots and lots of great restaurants and a few bars. We loved every minute and would definitely stay here again...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2989,"Amazing stay,perfect location",50,August 2013,"We splurged a small fortune and spent an amazing week at this beautiful property in the first week of August.Accommodation is on the pricy side but I am glad we paid the odd $300+ a night because everything was spot on!Breakfast is delicious and plentiful,the pool boys are great and we had no issue finding a chair each day.the grounds are lovely and the staff are always smiling.its located between Ku de ta and the legian,in a wonderful location in seminyak.the shops and restaurants are a short stroll away and legian is around 15-20 minutes by foot along the beach.its a lovely quiet hotel not many kids running around.perfect for couples(we left our kids back home) the staff were extra nice in that we had a complimentary afternoon tea, and on two occasions found our bath tub filled with petals and a lovely anniversary cake in our room.We couldn't get a late check out but happily lazed around the pool and used their spa to shower.i would definately be going back to this hotel.Sitting by the infinity pool overlooking the ocean daily was bliss.My only small negative is that it is a bit pricy.of course drinks/alcohol is, but even room rates.we are lucky we got a bit if a discount through expedia",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2990,So tranquil,50,August 2013,"We have just returned from 6 nights at the beautiful Seminyak (August 4th - 11th)We choose the Seminyak over The Legian next door, and what a great choice. From the first gong and lay greeting till the last luggage loaded our stay was a delight. The staff with out fault were happy an helpful all the time. Every time we passed one around the resort we received a smile. We had a beach win room which was much more than adequate, lovely toiletries, nightly turn down, great servicing. Th infinity pool is lovely however the pool staff whilst absolute delightful could at times offer refreshments more often, however this maybe management instruction to not bother guests too much. Next time we would consider the beach view villa which we inspected and were very impressed. The breakfast is marvellous, the location perfect. Many thanks seminyak a truly wonderfully tranquil place to relax. Gabrielle and John rm 3115",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2991,Perfect paradise!!,50,July 2013,"I stayed in a beach room for five days at the end of July. It was such a lovely hotel and I will be back again and again, in fact it was the best hotel in Bali I have stayed at. The hotel had a lovely Balinese feel and the staff were just so friendly and inviting. I couldn't speak more highly of the staff. The only problem I had was trying to figure out what I wanted for breakfast, there was so much choice and the food was very good. Great location, very close to Ku De Ta, The W, Sarong and the main shopping streets in Seminyak. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2992,Almost perfect,40,April 2013,"I stayed at the hotel in April 2013 with my 14 year old daughter. We had a beach wing room. I thought the layout of the room and the bathroom were fantastic. Nice amenities and bedding. The room was clean and very comfortable. Great shower! The pool is so beautiful - one of the nicest in the area. It doesn't have alot of lounge chairs due to the shape and the fact that the front part overlooks the beach (infinity pool). It was pretty busy during the day.

Breakfast was ok. I thought the service was slow and abit inefficient. The food was good but compared to other hotels in this price category, I think they have lots of room for improvement.

My biggest complaint was the cost of the drinks. I realize that other hotels and restaurants in this area are charging similiar prices but how many guest go elesewhere to have a cocktail or a glass of wine? I really think Bali in general is out pricing itself when it comes to fancy cocktails and nice wine. I've travelled all over the work and expect to pay these prices in New York and Hong Kong but not in Bali. I've been travelling to Bali since 1983 and have noticed these crazy prices for about 3 years now. Even if a better Happy Hour was offered, it might encouraeg more guests to stay at the hotel for cocktails instead of going to one of the cheaper beach bars that are just a minute or 2 walk away. I think the hotel is losing alot of business because of the high alcohol prices - at night the place was very quiet.

I would highly recommend staying at The Seminyak but I do hope the Management gets creative when it comes to their cocktail and wine prices. Why not keep your guests at the property by making it more affordable for them to enjoy drink?

Forgot to mention the front desk staff were very efficient and friendly. Same for the spa staff - although prices here were crazy high as well.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2993,August 2013,50,August 2013,"My Husband and I had not been to Bali for 20 years and decided to treat ourselves to a 5star hotel.The Hotel and its facilities were wonderful. We chose a ocean view room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful always smiling and courteous. The only problem we had was trying to decide what to have for breakfast each day. Fabulous choices and real coffee!! Only a short taxi ride/walk to good restaurants and shopping. Enjoyed the sunset, free cocktails and nibbles at the pool bar cocktail party. Loved the baby Turtle release race on the beach. Gorgeous infinity pool over looking the quiet Seminyak beach. Over all a lovely place to stay away from the madness of the streets. Would definitely recommend staying here for that romantic getaway.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2994,Fabulous Week,50,July 2013,"I am writing this review whilst still here at The Seminyak Hotel. We arrived on the 27th July and are staying for 7 nights. The Hotel is fabulous.

We are a family of 4 (our boys are 18 and 20) and stayed in 2 beach view rooms. Our rooms are interconnecting and beautiful. The staff here are very obliging and really happy to please. The service is great.

The breakfast really has everything on offer from made to order Pancakes, Omelettes, Eggs, patisserie bar, cold meats, cheese, full fresh fruit bar, cooked breakfast, Sushi................like I say anything you want.

We have only dined in the restaurant once. The food was excellent as was the service. The only negative if anything was how quiet and few people actually eat at the Hotel. Being on the doorstep of so many great restaurants that are considerably cheaper I guess is the reason why nobody really dines in the hotel in the evening.

The pool area is lovely, the infinity pool beautiful and the staff excellent. Oke is a really good member of staff that is always happy to look after us, he aswell as many of the other members of staff are helping to make our holiday special.

A little tip for anyone visiting Bali is learn a little bit of Balinese. Hello, Goodbye and Thank you the locals are so surprised to be thanked in Balinese and they respect you for trying.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2995,Perfect Paradise,50,July 2013,"We stayed at this Resort for three days and it was the most relaxing, enjoyable quick trip to Bali. We're so glad we chose this hotel on our first trip to Bali as the real-life Bali can be a bit overwhelming. This is a quiet, tranquil paridise where you can get away and enjoy the scenery. The infinity pool is to die for and the Staff were polite and prompt, if a bit impersonal.

Lovely stay would highly recommend!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2996,Very good alternative to THE LEGIAN and perfect location,40,July 2013,"Positive points : 1. very well located next to KUDETA you can walk from the beach to have an aperitif or late night cocktail
2. you can walk to the LEGIAN and SAMAYA Villas from the beach to have dinner or lunch 3. Amazing infinity pool overlooking the sea, hang out there to relax and enjoy the view 4. very good Price / value for its location, rooms and service 5. Staff is very friendly tough they need extra training to reach excellence in service 5. Very private , you can easily find a good spot to relax if you do not feel to be so social 6. Breakfast great variety of food, homemade jams, live egg and waffle crepes station to order whatever you like 7. We stayed in the Ocean suite, beautiful view and huge bathroom and room, Garden rooms are also well located so if you want to save some money it is ok 8. We tried the food around the pool and it was good quality, expect hotel restaurant price tough. 9. We will be back, THE LEGIAN is more expensive but this one is a good alternative
Negative points or areas of improvements: 1. Wifi is good everywhere rooms and poolside however sometimes it stops responding and it is very slow 2. the Jacuzzi in the oceansuite is more like a big bathtub, pressure is not strong and to fill it up it takes 1 hour 3. The lift chimes are very loud, so when you are in the room sleeping you will hear it from outside, we were 2 rooms away from the lifts, I guess you can turn the sound off, it is useless 4. Staff need more training but on the other side they are very very friendly and smiling all the times, so you can forgive mistakes and mishandling 5. The pool is really amazing however as owner or General manager I would remove the big white statues in front of the pool beds they cover the view, and they do not look so nice, infact nobody wanted to seat there because they are really blocking the view.
CONCLUSION: We will be back because we loved the hotel and the staff, I am sure by improving small details The Seminyak will become one of the most wanted hotel in the Seminyak area.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2997,"Relaxing, up-market beach hotel spoilt by sewage!",30,July 2013,"The hotel is located on Seminyak beach and makes full use of its location. Most of the rooms and the pool area face the sea. Sunset is just after 6pm and can be enjoyed with wine/beer on sofas or sunbathing beds.

The hotel is next door to the very popular Kudeta restaurant and bar which is an all day dining venue and then a restaurant / chill out club in the evening.

The bathrooms are as expected of a 5 star hotel: proper power, nice new fittings and toiletries. The blind between the bathroom and bedroom needs to be kept down for privacy. The bedroom fittings are not quite as good: there was a serious gap in the windows where the balcony doors were supposed to meet.

Hotel food is OK. Breakfast has a good choice and the hotel has proper coffee machines. The hot food was not kept warm but there are cook to order options. All meals are served outdoors under cover. Lunch and dinner are nearly deserted. Lunch snacks at the pool are popular. In the evening everyone goes to the Seminyak restaurants like Rumours, Chandi or next door to Kudeta.

Drinks are a little bit expensive - think US$20 for a glass of wine whereas Gado Gado would be about US$13-$14 glass. Better value - apart from bringing your own duty-free or detoxing - is to buy a bottle from the wine shop in the hotel and pay the US$6 corkage charge.

Guests are mainly couples from Australia and Europe. A few families with adult children but no 'kids' spotted. The main age profile is probably 30-40.

The hotel has a 38m infinity pool next to the beach and a 30m ornamental pool which is less deep and has a bar area attached. In this pool the hotel arranges aquagym daily (not popular!)

This biggest turn-off is the untreated sewage that is discharged by each of the hotels daily into the sea. Each hotel discharges once a week in turn. The sewage hangs around all day in front of the hotel. We were nearly sick at the sight.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2998,A wonderful stay,50,July 2013,"Great location, good food and a great, friendly yet professional staff!
The rooms are spacious, well equipped. The gardens are well kept and the pool is by the seaside.
I have been there twice while in Bali for a business trip and both times were just wonderful. I look forward on coming back for some vacation in the future.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
2999,So relaxing!,40,June 2013,"I really enjoyed staying at The Seminyak Beach Resort. Upon arrival I was upgraded to a first floor room with a nice balcony and an awesome view of the ocean. Thanks so much!

The best thing about the hotel is its location right on Seminyak Beach and what an amazing view from the public pool area! I was on my own on the first day and it was so relaxing just to sit on a sun lounger sunbathing and people watching. The second day was with a friend and we enjoyed swimming in the beautiful and warm pool, chatting and watching the sunset. It was also really lovely to bump into a pool bar staff we knew from his previous work. And the next day, all pool attendants knew who we were!

I was also very impressed with the lobby and the housekeeping staff. Every time I called and asked for something, they were really quick to act on and were so friendly. The Seminyak Beach Resort is not a small hotel and it can't be that easy to meet so many guests' needs efficiently. But they managed it all the time and I was in safe hands.

The only slight disappointment was the breakfast. I was happy with the choice of food but felt that the restaurant was beyond its capacity on both mornings and it took me a while to find a table. Also some staff were perhaps a little edgy or forgetful because they were very busy.

But over all I really think The Seminyak Beach Resort is a fantastic hotel and probably one of the best properties in service and value on Seminyak Beach. I would definitely stay again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3000,Beautiful hotel,50,June 2013,"we stayed here for our honeymoon for 8 nights in June 13. we both thought that this hotel was amazing. it is very clean with beautiful gardens and pristine pool area and outdoor dining area right on the beach. the infinity pool is lovely overlooking the ocean and a few steps takes you down onto the beach. the room we had was excellent, modern and fully equipped with a view of the sea. a tip would be to ask for a beach wing room when booking as the garden wing across the way wouldn't have been as convenient. the breakfast in the morning was exceptional with the highlights being tasty fresh eggs done to your liking and fresh made waffles and pancakes. staff here were very helpful, pleasant and friendly. drinks and food are very expensive but with an array of excellent restaurants a 10 minute walk away I wouldn't like to be eating in the hotel every night. seminyak itself is a short walk away with many boutiques, spas and restaurants. the only issue I had with the hotel is that it didn't cash travellers cheques. wifi also needs improving as I had to sign in everytime I lifted my phone instead of automatically connecting but im being picky here!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3001,Just perfect,50,July 2013,Wonderful service from all staff. I stayed in a beach suite which was absolutely beautiful. The linens were high quality.The view of the beach terrific. The resort is walking distance to many top restaurants. Daily activities are offered too. I would stay here again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3002,Fantastic!,50,July 2013,"Recently stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed it. The room was well maintained, clean and private. The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, with a smile. I will definitely be staying again and recommending this resort to my family and friends. Thank you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3003,"first class hotel, excellent location in the middle of Seminyak Beach",50,July 2013,"If your idea of a holiday includes beach, surfing, spaing and doing touristic shopping, clubbing and dining , this is one of the most upscale and family friendly beaches in Bali. The hotel is new, very well run with very friendly service and everything works well. My room did not have an ocean view, but they are available and the view is great. Breakfast is well done and to be honest when I request a cappuccino and don't get charged extra I am happy. I hate being nickled and dimed for extras, but when it is a perfect Illy cappuccino, you make my day. It is how I start every day and always brings a smile to my face. Also in the room there is a tropical island scent that is very thoughtfully designed to add to the experience. All the amenities are 5 star, the wifi free and works! The General Manager had very good lobby presence and looked quite happy in his paradise. ( altho I can imagine he must have more than his fair share of stress and pressures) The hotel is also right next to Cu De Ta, one the most classy beach clubs in Asia! Seminak Resort, thank you for the kind service, well done and easy for me to say highly recommendable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3004,Amazing place,50,June 2013,"We treated ourselves to a week at this oasis in Seminyak and weren't disappointed. Being beachfront and with a stunning infinity edge pool, we hardly wanted to leave the resort. Poolside was a beautiful place to sit each day, watching the surfers, the beach traders and the clouds in the sky. Breakfasts were amazing, with so many options. We attended the free cocktail party with an amazing sunset view and wandered around the beautiful and lovingly looked after gardens. We splashed out on a waterfront villa and it was stunning, so much space, beautiful views, fabulous cool pool with relaxing cabana to watch the sunset from and even free minibar with beers, soft drinks and toblerones!! Would happily stay here again and highly recommend it as a beachfront option for those who love to be near the surf.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3005,A MONTH AT THE SEMINYAK!,50,May 2013,We spent the month of May at the wonderful Seminyak Beach Resort! Our second stay and wont be our last as we are already looking at returning next year! Lots of improvements in the pipeline to restaurant and bar area both of which are necessary - especially when there is rain and we had lots of it! As always the staff were brilliant and their friendly greetings and smiles made each day there a special one! Thanks again to all who made our stay so memorable - see you next year!!!! xx,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3006,Stunning Seminyak resort,50,June 2013,"I was travelling solo for the first time in my life and this resort far exceeded my expectations. I was ambivalent about some aspects of Bali, but this resort is actually situated on a nicer stretch of the beach, yet in walking distance to Potato Head and other famous spots. The staff are truly lovely and made me feel so welcome. The buffet breakfast is delicious, and the pool and garden area is magnificent, and despite being at near capacity, never felt crowded. My only regret was checking out on the day they were releasing 50 baby turtles back into the wild - great to see a hotel with a conscience, trying to restore some of Bali's natural wonders.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3007,Pure bliss!,50,July 2013,"My friend and I arrived at The Seminyak after 10 days of travelling around Sumatra and Bali as an end of trip treat. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Even though we 'roughed it' during our trip, we have previously stayed in luxury hotels in the UK and other countries whilst travelling and this was by far the best to date.

Upon arrival we were given a complimentary upgrade to a garden villa which we were immediately blown away by. Once through the front door of the villa, we were greeted by our own sun loungers, dining facilities and pool which extended to surround the room.

The room itself had all the amenities one could ever need including an extremely comfy bed with amazing pillows! The bathroom again was out of this world!

The main pool had plenty of sun loungers which were maintained by the staff and poolside service was top notch. The beach was directly adjacent to the pool so it was lovely to hear the waves (which are amazing) whilst relaxing under the scorching heat!

The food in the hotel was also exquisite. Priced a lot more expensive than outside the hotel as you would expect but even so the prices were reasonable and comparable to the UK. A two course dinner with drinks cost about ¬£20 (300,000 IR). The breakfast buffet was incredible with so many different manned stations. This was definitely one of my highlights!

All in all, the hotel is absolutely amazing and deserves its ratings. A credit to the friendly staff who definitely make it that extra special. Perfect for honeymooners!

We came away feeling extremely relaxed and had the holiday blues before we had even boarded our flight! So thank you !!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3008,Dream vacation - wonderful resort & spa,50,June 2013,It was our first trip to Bali and this resort did not disappoint us. It has a private beach and the infinity pool was simply fantastic. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The rooms are well designed and comfortable. The location of the resort is excellent as guests could easily walk a short distance to all the nearby shops and restaurants. This resort would be a great getaway for all occasions. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3009,Great Getaway,40,June 2013,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Seminyak to celebrate our 25th Wedding Aniversary. Once the staff at reception heard of this we were upgraded from a Beach Wing room to an Ocean View Suite. Very nice indeed. We also received a free dinner for two.The staff at the resort were all very helpfull and friendly. The highlight of the resort is definiatelly the infinity pool and also the very obliging staff. The suite was excellent from the very comfy bed to the great uninterupted ocean views both from the bed and the ensuite. Make sure you order an omlette for brecky, very nice. Another great feature was even though we had a very late departure back to Melbourne, we were able to utilise the hotels facilities all day, after checkout and they even let us use their spa facility for a shower before our midnight flight home. Very accomodating.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3010,Amazing Welcome,50,July 2013,"We arrived quite late to the resort but were met with big smiles and personal service. After being escorted to our room which although was on the other side of the road was completely gorgeous, quite and overlooking the pool.

We were in Bali for our wedding and our room had been prepared with rose petals in the bath, swans and flowers on the bed and they brought us a cake to help us celebrate.

The breakfast was delicious, the grounds superb and the service wonderful. Over overall experience was great the only problem was that it was too short. We will return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3011,"Serene, peaceful and all the rest I needed",50,October 2012,"Absolutely would return to this establishment.

I was with friends and we all loved our rooms, check-in was easy and came with beverage. I arrived before my friends and even though the beverage they supply for your refreshment is juice, I asked for 'special' beverages for my friends who were soooo surprised and pleased. They thought the hotel somehow knew their drink preference. Silly people. LOL It was nice to do this for my friends, especially after that crazy taxi ride from the airport.

My taxi driver's name was Ketut (which added to my given nickname by friends 'Eat, Pray, Love' because of my travels). Thought that was great as he was so very kind and informative. The hotel offered up assistance for outings and we had a superb time.

The ladies at the spa were as kind as your favorite little sister. They really took care of me as I was fighting a cold from sheer exhaustion from work (this holiday was earned). The bath after your massage that overlooks the ocean is so much more than expected.

Thanks Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa for the relaxation that I so needed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3012,The real Bali experience,40,April 2013,"We stayed at the ocean facing villa. The villa itself is nice and very spacious. Great service staff. Good breakfast.

It is a bit more expensive than average villas at Bali but the room we got is much nicer than other villas we have seen at Bali.

Highly recommend to my friends and other traveler.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3013,stunning views and location,50,June 2013,"me and my boyfriend stayed here for the last 3 nights of our bali trip and we fell in love with the hotel!, our room was amazing, loved the bath however the water temperature and pressure isnt the best. the pools are just as expected....beautiful! doesnt get much better than watching the sunset over the sea from the infinity pool....perfection!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3014,Will definately be back,50,June 2013,"This hotel is Fab, we stayed here for a week while attending a friends wedding. We stayed with friends so we were on the same level just a few doors down. We booked the beach wing which was beautiful, not sure if we got an upgrade but the Spa bath was amazing. You get two TVs, couch, big King Size bed.
It was fab, we had a great view and will definately be back. Would recommend to anyone.
Pool was lovely to relax by, it had great service for towels and food, its so handy having the beach there as the guys were able to surf and we were relaxing by the pool. We could still see them while they were surfing.
Breakfast in the morning was gorgeous, loafs of options to choose from.

Will be back soon we hope.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3015,A totally Forgettable experience.,20,June 2013,"This was our 15th trip to Bali and the worst hotel I have ever stayed in...............promoted as a luxury hotel.........it most certainly was not. The pool lounges were torn and grubby. When we asked if we could use the pool beside the swim up bar we were told no...must use the main pool. The access into the main pool was extremely difficult as the steps were not gradual and the drop off the bottom step was quite a shock. The water is the same depth the length and width of the pool. Looks great but poor function and is too deep.
The room was not serviced until 3pm for the first 3 days despite the ""make up room"" sign beiing on. The air/con was a problem initially but was fixed.
There is no light in the wardrobe or into the wardrobe so very difficult to see the contents and the same for the cupboard containing the safe.....needed a torch each time we opened the safe as it was so dark it was impossible to find what we wanted.
Had to ask more than once for the soap and toilet paper to be replaced............there were always many apologies and smiles but it became so annoying.
The 3 special food nights were very disappointing as the food was very average. We know how good Balinese and Indonesian food CAN be! The setting however was very lovely, beside the beach.
The day we took the shuttle into Seminyak and Leggian it failed to collect us at the appointed time and place (4.30pm) and by 5pm we had to ask one of the shops to call the hotel. When the shuttle arrived about 5.15 we were told that the ""other driver had not told me about you"".
However the tables booked for us by Yuni at reception at the restaurants we visited on other nights during our stay were very good tables indeed....she was very efficient.
I did voice my concerns in the survey left in our room and received an email from the Manager but it was all very general and I do not think my comments really mattered.
I would not ever reccomend this hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3016,Great - but has its issues,40,June 2013,"The good:

- wonderful attentive staff
- fantastic location
- great atmosphere
- very comfortable beds
- the view over the surf from our room
- the decor

The bad:

- Internet access atrocious, do not try and do any work from here if you value your sanity.
- water pressure a joke, allow 2 hours to fill the spa, so much for a romantic spontaneous dip !
- little things like hair dryer no stronger than a breeze, aircon vents leak water all day, the toilet is not enclosed & bathroom door is just a open screen so you really have to go to the public toilets in the foyer for a number 2 if you don't want your partner to hear & smell everything! You can hear the road noise,

Small gripes I know but they all add up to take the edge off what could have been a great place.

Overall we enjoyed our stay here and most 1st or 2nd time visitors to Bali would be more than happy at this venue, it's just that we have had better in Bali before.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3017,Exemplary!,50,March 2013,"My partner & I stayed @ The Seminyak Beach Resort in March. We had never stayed @ Seminyak before & we were totally amazed by everything @ this beautiful hotel. We were accommodated in a suite which had outstanding views to the ocean & infinity pool. The buffet breakfast is superb, not just the food but the smiling staff just make the start of your day wonderful! In fact all the staff make you feel so special - nothing is too much trouble, whether by the pool, @ reception or the room attendants. We had the most relaxing holiday we have ever had, you can just ""chill out"" in luxury. You can walk to anywhere in Seminyak as the resort is so well located & the security is top class! We will definitely return to this haven.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3018,Great romantic beachfront property,50,June 2013,Just got back from a 5 night stay at Seminyak Beach Resort. Had a wonderful experience. The staff was great. We got a ocean view suite and it was huge. The villas are in between the hotel and the beach but you are still less than 100 meters from the beach and elevated so you have a great view. The pool is the best feature. Can lounge by the pool and still be right on the beach. The services poolside is a tad slow but you can always walk up and place your order. There is a great swim up bar where we met other travelers. Right next to KuDeTa which is a great for dinner and drinks. WahWah's burgers is the best kept secret in Bali and right across the street. A $8 cab ride from Kuta is you are thinking about going out for some crazy Bali night life. The water in front of this resort has a good morning break for surfing and body boarding. There weren't a lot of kids but were some. I not sure I would bring my 5 and 8 year olds there. There is one restaurant and the food was excellent. We ate lunch there 3 times and dinner once and never had a bad meal. Beers are $5 in your room or at the bar. Mixed drinks were $8 and well made. It was quiet in the evenings so you could sleep in. They helped up book dinner reservations 3 times and were quite helpful in booking tours to Ubud. 4 shuttles daily to Legion (large shopping district). We prepaid for breakfast and they were worth it.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3019,"Great hotel, great location!!",50,June 2013,"This was my 5th trip to Bali and my first stay at the Seminyak Bearch Resort and Spa. This was without a doubt the best hotel we have stayed at in Bali and will no doubt stay there again.
We had a Beach Wing room which was excellent. We had 7 nights at the hotel and the room was sufficiently spacious that long stays remain comfortable. The room was well equipped, has a generous-sized bathroom and was kept very clean.
The gardens and pool areas were absolutely first rate. The horizon pool is fabulous - well large enough for some early morning fitness laps and for lazing the day away whilst watching (and listening to) the surf rolling in.
The staff were always friendly and willing to help - although occasionally responses was a bit slow (somewhat typical of Balinese properties).
The location is fantastic. Right on the beach, 10 mins tops to Seminyak Square and an easy walk to the main restaurant strip.
The onsite spa was also very good - clean, well appointed, excellent staff.
I will return to this hotel for any future Bali holidays.

3020,it's a big WOW!!,50,June 2013,"Speechless... the hotel is excellent! Great & spacious room, great bath tub & bathroom, great terrace, great view, very great infinity pool, great service! All EXCELLENT!!

3021,That typical apartheid assumption,10,June 2013,"My oldest sister has been planning her vacation here for weeks and we already have plans to spend time together. When she said she booked a room here I assume nothing. I mean, okay, that one is a nice hotel, I'll go and meet you there. Like any unassuming normal guest, I came to the main gate and said that I came to meet my sister and her family who stays there. I came on a motorbike like everyone else who actually lives in Bali. The security guy eyed me skeptically. It's obvious that he didn't believe me and told me to go to the farthest gate and park my bike there. I'm stunned. This is the kind of attitude employed by the high and mighty BTDC hotels! Seminyak don't operate this way! So I went to the other gate where there's another satpam and asked where that parking lot is and also stating my purpose of coming to the hotel and then he also told me to go to another gate. It was a parking lot meant not for guests but for staffs and suppliers and anyone but guests. To add salt yo injury it started to rain and i had to walk through rain to reach the lobby and ask for direction to where my family stayed. While I walk to the lobby I noticed that there are bikes parked in the parking lot in front of the lobby. So...I can actually come through the main gate and park there? The security guy just choose not to believe and assume something else. Thank you very much.
I bet if I came on a car I'd be treated differently. But hey, now I know which chain not to recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3022,My Holiday Centre,40,May 2013,"Just returned from a great holiday to Bali which we booked with My Holiday Centre. They organised superbly The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa at Seminyak which was just perfect. Located right on the beach and just a 5 minute walk into Seminyak Square and also a 10 minute walk to Potato Head, and many many fabulous restaurants.We were met on arrival and whisked though immigration and then assisted with our bags through customs, straight to an air-conditioned vehicle to be dropped of at the Seminyak...so easy!
They gave us a car and driver for the day to go wherever we wanted plus breakfasts and a couple of dinners, which we didn't use because of all the fabulous restaurants we wanted to experience in Seminyak.
The departure was just as seamless as the arrival. Assisted with check in, whisked through immigration and then settled in to a special lounge to await our departure.

Thanks My Holiday Centre and we cant wait for our next holiday",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3023,TRULY OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND SETTING,50,June 2013,"We have stayed there 5 times. Do not stay in the Garden Suites across the road. Cheaper, but inconvenient and lacking atmosphere. The Beach rooms are all lovely.The attitude of the staff and overall service is wonderful. They try so hard. The infinity pool is lovely, but the loungers around the pool are too close together and there are insufficient if the hotel is busy. Breakfast is good.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3024,Perfect resort for romance,50,May 2013,"We booked a room at the beach wing and our room was located on the ground floor, steps away from the swimming pool and the beach. Despite being on the ground floor, we had all the privacy needed as the resort has nice gardens outside each room. Although the rates are quite high, it worthwhile to save up and spend a little more to book the ground floor rooms at the beach wing and you will have a fabulous time in Bali. The rooms are nice and big. The staff there were really lovely and polite. Check-in was a breeze and we were well taken care of. Breakfast was absolutely amazing. Best breakfast ever in a resort! Try their pancakes and crepe. Delicious! And their fresh juice counter was a nice touch. Although breakfast was buffet style, the staff will bring your dish to the table after cooking. There are gazebos around the swimming pool which was great to sunbathe and read. Kudeta is right next door and is definitely a restaurant that you should dine in when you stay at this resort. I had an amazing and romantic time at Bali and will definitely book this resort again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3025,Our chillax experience....,50,September 2012,"When choosing a place to stay I very carefully read many Trip Advisor comments by other travellers and it was suggested to not stay in the Garden Suites, as they are across the road from the resort. We were booked in there and changed before we flew over. We had a beautiful breakfast every morning and enjoyed relaxing and swimming in the pool area. There were various banquets which we loved sitting looking over the ocean and a happy hour for new guests which was very enjoyable in the chapel. We didn't have to walk far to find restaurants to eat at and places to shop. The staff were very helpful, the food service at the pool was excellent and our bedroom was very comfy with 2 wonderful twin beds. We lost some luggage at the airport on our arrival, but everything at the resort soon made up for this, plus our luggage turned up the same day!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3026,"Perfect pool, perfect location",50,May 2013,"This is the second time I have stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort and I will definitely be staying there in future. The resort itself is staff by the most welcoming, accommodating people that nothing is too much bother for them. We stayed in one of the suites on the 3rd level with the most amazing view of the beach. The room itself was huge, the bed very comfortable, so were the pillow.

The thing with the Seminyak that no other place can rival is the most AMAZING infinit swimming pool! What you see in the pictures is what you get and more... Another big bonus is the Seminyaks location, on one side it's close to Seminyak corner and all the restaurants and shops in ""eat"" street. On the otherside close to Petitenget and all that it has to offer. Right next to Kudeta as well!

The only thing I would say is if you want to stay on the beach side of the street you need to make sure you DONT book the garden view rooms, otherwise you will be staying at the other side of the street.

Overall a wonderful experience and I most highly recommend this beautiful resort!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3027,Big disappointment,20,April 2013,"Unfortunately, it started badly when we checked in just after 2 pm, when we were told our room was not ready. We had no communication that we may need to delay and dragged our check in luggage to the pool side tables and ordered a light lunch.
The room is actually not bad, comfortable bed, good facilities, but the interior designer should be fired. The cabinets and drawers are difficult too open, there is inadequate storage space if you stay for a number of days.
The wifi is free but so bad that you wouldn't want to pay for it. It is very, very slow. Less than 1 Mb/s so don't expect anything better than dial-up speed.
We had dinner in the restaurant and also decided to attend the Balinese experience - total rip off at 350,000 - only attended by small group and we were badly positioned. The food was pretty average - I ordered a la carte - scallops had no flavour, tasted not fresh. The fish was overlooked. My wife decided on the buffet - reasonable but hard with only about 20 people in the restaurant.
The place just seems badly managed. I could not see any managers. Still trying to speak to them.
They are clearly understaffed. Difficult at times to get good service, compared to other hotels.
The pool is nice and we certainly are making the most of it. Breakfast is included and is good. But pity about the rest.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3028,As good as any in Bali.,50,September 2012,"This was our first stay at the Resort although we have often stayed at other very good hotels in Bali.

It compared very favorably and in fact had the advantage of being somewhat closer to some excellent outside restaurants.

The staff were extremely helpful,friendly and very professional. Enjoyed the pool area and the available service there.

The front staff were just so very friendly and most helpful in response to any request.

All in all as good if not better than any of the 5 star hotels in Bali and we will most probably return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3029,Absolute Luxury,50,November 2012,"We had a wonderful experience on our 10 day stay at the Seminyak Beack Resort and Spa. The staff were extremely friendly and obliging. We chose where to eat our buffet breakfast and the staff would collect our orders and set up a beautiful breakfast for us. There was always space to have privacy around their grounds! Great swim up bar and WiFi everywhere so that we could check back on our children at home occasionally. Business services were excellent as we we still running our companies from Bali with daily faxing, communication and printing required. The staff were some of the nicest people we have ever met and we have been a lot of places. Our room was exquisite with its large jacuzzi and really spacious rooms. My husband s celebrating his 41st birthday while we were there so they had many unexpected surprises in store even though neither of us had told them they were clever enough to check his ID and arrange for a birthday cake. All very unexpected, they definitely go the extra mile.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3030,A relaxing stay,50,April 2013,"We stayed at the Seminyak for 9 days in April 2013. I had opted for a cheaper room which I was utterly dismayed to find on the OTHER side of a busy road, away from the beach. This was not what I wanted and I should have read the room notes closer. But the staff were very accommodating and gave me a good rate to upgrade to the main resort. I was thrilled with our new room - we were just meters from the beach.

My husband gave the breakfast buffet a big thumbs up and he also enjoyed being right on the beach, easy walking distance to Potato Head and Kudeta (which is next door), as well as the middle of Seminyak. I loved the infinite pool, and the privacy and tranquility of the resort overall.

As always, there was some construction work going on, but that is everywhere in Bali. It stopped after a day and a half.

Although the Seminyak was a bit dearer than some of the other nearby resorts, I thought it good value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3031,Great pool and location,40,October 2012,The gardens and pool area were amazing. Breakfast was always wonderful. The hotel was a very short walk to 'eat street'. Highly recommended! There was a high standard of cleanliness. There needed to be more sun beds around the pool which were always occupied.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3032,Loved everything about our stay in seminyak beach resort,50,November 2012,"From the time we arrived until the time we left, the staff were so helpful. The resort is so clean inside our room and around the pool. We loved how close we were to shops and restaurants. Would recommend this resort and hope to return this year.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3033,Perfect holiday,50,November 2012,"I stayed here with 16 mother and daughters and we couldn't fault the resort. This was my 5th visit to bali, so i had high expectations and alot to compare to. this is by far the nicest resort i have satyed at. The room was lovely and modern. The pool was beautiful and always clean. The staff were helpful with anything that we needed. Most of us stayed on the beach side if the resort, but the girls who stayed on the garden side were not disappointed. Would defiantly come back to this resort again",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3034,Wonderful Resort,50,October 2012,"This was our first visit to the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. It exceeded all our expectations.
We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. On checking in we had a problem with our travel card, the receptionist assisted us in a very professional and efficient manner and after a few phone calls the issue was sorted with a minimum of fuss. The grounds are beautiful. The infinity pool is magnificent. The food in all of the restaurants was of a good standard. We were very impressed with the cleanliness in all areas of the resort. It truly is an idyllic tranquil setting and we will certainly stay at ""The Seminyak"" on our next visit to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3035,A Dream Team in a beautifull Hotel,50,March 2013,"Ariving at the Seminyak was like entering paradise Island... flowers around our neck, fresh Juices...very friendly and capable staff.
Beautifull room with ocean viewn, the infinite pool is amazing.
Clean and spotless, modern but touched with Tradition, the staff was everyday so friendly with our Little Girl, she calls the Seminyak now ""her Home"".
Breakfeast Buffet was delicious, we are for sure coming back to the Seminyak.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3036,It was fantastic... Best place to stay could not recommend anything better!!!!!,50,October 2012,We stayed in the garden side of the hotel and was amazing!!!! Service was always impeccable and rooms were amazing!!!!! It's expensive but you defiantly get your moneys worth!!!!! the pools were great and the drinks were not too pricey!!!! Within walking distance from Seminyak square and eat street... could not recommend more highly.... SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3037,Fantastic,50,April 2013,"We could not fault this place and I am surprised when I read reviews that are critical.We upgraded to a suite overlooking the beach which was beautifully decorated and spotless.The breakfasts were delicious with triple the staff numbers to guests,the staff could not do anymore to help and always with a big smile.As already mentioned,the pool is the highlight where you watch the world go by resting on the lounge beds or the infinity pool edge.Many thanks also to the staff that helped us after we had checked out. We had booked into a villa for the next 10 days with our children arriving and meeting us at the villa.Problem was no one could find the villa,the kids weren't picked up at the airport as was arranged,our taxi driver was lost so we ended returning back to the resort so I could access the internet,with the staff on the phones assisting us as well.Finally found the kids who met us at the resort and were given a cool towel,drink and lei which was very thoughtful.They then arranged their private car and driver to take us to the villa.

Will definitely be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3038,"Secluded villa, great location, lovely staff",40,May 2013,"On arrival at The Seminyak beach resort & spa we were upgraded from the suite to a pool villa which was a lovely surprise. The villa is very private, with high walls all the way around, the main bedroom/bathroom is surrounded by a water moat comprising a pool, spa & water feature fountain. It really is beautiful. The bathroom is massive with an indoor/outdoor feel with a large glass wall that opens onto a roofed garden. The lounge/dining area is outside, surrounded by water & under cover, only downside is the heat & with the high walls, little breeze, a ceiling or pedestal fan would be appreciated in that space. The one thing the suite has over the villa...a view.

Breakfast can be delivered to your room or you can visit the breakfast buffet. the food is plentiful, lots of choices & onsite preparation of juice or cooked eggs/waffles is a nice touch. Sadly, the one let down in the restaurant is the shear lack of fans, some pedestal fans are required as this is open air & quite hot.

The service of staff is as you would expect, very polite, very accommodating & all smiles.
Overall, I would certainly recommend the hotel to those wanting a private get away & the location is just perfect for dining out, shopping & local beaches.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3039,Even Better than Last Year,50,May 2013,"This is our second visit to the Seminyak Beach Resort, having stayed there with the same business group last year. It was great last year but this year it's even better. The service is so professional and nothing is too much trouble.

The main highlight of the resort is the accommodation. The rooms are some of the best I've seen, especially as they have all the little extras one might need so thoughtfully included, even a little tote bag to take shopping or down to the beach.

I particularly love the breakfast area, which has a very cosy feel, even though the resort is quite large. We ordered some room service food and that arrived hot, well presented and in a timely manner. We also had a private function at the beach front and the location and presentation were amazing. If you're thinking of a wedding, the setting and facilities at the Seminyak would be spectacular.

I also spent time relaxing by the infinity pool watching the world go by. The beach in front of the hotel is not really suitable for swimming, it's more of a surfing beach and definitely not suitable for children. I didn't use the spa, but was told it was beautiful. There are plenty of cheap and cheerful spas nearby however, as well as markets, restaurants and boutiques.

Overall, I was looking forward to re-visiting the Seminyak and delighted to find it even better than I remembered.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3040,Can't wait to go back,50,April 2013,"This is my second time staying here so I had to write a review.... From the moment you arrive you receive first class service , the hotel itself is beautiful and manages to keep that Balinese style and feel that is lost in some of the larger resorts . The hotel has the most amazing infinity pool that overlooks the beach ,you could stay here and people watch all day whilst floating on the edge with people walking dogs ,riding horses, surfing is very popular at the front of hotel also
With board hire just at front. On the other side of the main pool area they have a plunge pool area with Balinese cabana's suspended over the water that also overlook the ocean also the swim up bar is in this area (another place to spend all day ) The rooms are big and have everything you need ...but make sure you book beach wing as they have another section of the hotel that is across the road . Breakfast is good but not the best I've had there are great places
Outside the hotel for breakfast if your wanting more variety . The location of this hotel is awesome with Ku De Ta next door potato head , la lucciola and much more in walking distance
I am staying here again the staff here are amazing and nothing is too much trouble .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3041,A fantastic place to stay,50,April 2013,"My wife and I recently stayed in a Beach Wing suite at the Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa for our 5th wedding anniversary..From our first email communication to the hotel prior to our arrival, the level of service was outstanding, and this continued throughout our 7 night stay. The staff throughout the resort were extremely friendly and helpful and their smiling faces certainly made our stay special!

The hotel itself is beautifully laid out and is one of only a few resorts with amazing views of the ocean.. especially from the Infinity Pool, which is fantastic. The rooms (in the beach wing) are spacious, clean and well appointed, especially the amenities in the bathroom, whilst the day bed and deck area is a nice place to relax.. The Breakfast buffet is very well stocked, with a wide variety of Asian and Western dishes, which change regularly, as well an egg/waffle/pancake station and fresh juice/fruit stand.

The day spa is beautiful to look at (we didn't use the facilty however) and the gym is well stocked with a good combination of machines and free weights.

In terms of location, this hotel is in a great spot; it's secure and a very easy walk or cab ride to the shopping and dining areas. There is a small tailor shop across the street for any alterations, made to measure clothes or copies you need done!

Seminyak itself is a great place for shopping and dining! Here are some of the restaurant we ate at and can definitely recommend checking out (these are our own recommendations, so if you want more info, then google these places) :

-INDONESIAN-
Warung Bale Bali
Warung Kolega
Warung Biku
Naughty Nuri's

-WESTERN-
Potato Head /Tapping Shoes (Sunday Brunch)
Ku De Ta
Metis
La Lucciolla
The Bistrot

Also, we used a spa called Amo Spa(opposite the W hotel) which was fantastic; my wife had a couple of nail treatments and I enjoyed a face shave and a massage! Definitely worth checking out!

Feel free to message me if you want any more details but overall, we can definitely recommend the Seminyak Beach Resort as a fantastic place to stay and enjoy all that Seminyak has to offer!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3042,Stay at the best.,50,April 2013,"My wife and I spent 6 incredible nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort Hotel in a beach view suite and had one of the best holidays we have ever enjoyed. The hotel facilities are first class and the infinity pool beautiful. Breakfast was a true feast with all tastes and nationalities catered for and many foods cooked fresh to your liking. The rooms are superb, exceptionally clean, water restocked twice daily and bed turned down at night. Without exception, all of the staff are incredibly friendly, attentive, very professional and go out of their way to satisfy your every request, nothing is a problem for them. We highly recommend this hotel, it is a true five star resort with staff to match. Stay here and spoil yourself.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3043,Fantastic resort,50,March 2013,Our visit to the seminyak beach resort and spa was wonderful we were upgraded to third floor room with a great veiw of the beach. The room was extremely spacious and very clean with the towels being refreshed sometimes twice in the one day. We stayed for eight days and had an idyllic experience...just what we were looking for! The staff could not have been more welcoming or accomodating. The infinity pool has to be the best that I have seen yet!! A wonderful experience all round.. and thank you to the staff who made it such a great stay,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3044,"Relaxing stay, friendly staff",50,March 2013,"Stayed for 5 days at the end of March. Booked a suite direct through the hotel only about 4 weeks before. Good communication, pick up from the airport and check-in a breeze. We had a suite on the 2nd floor with great ocean views. Very luxurious, with it's own spa also overlooking the ocean. Shame we didn't use it.
Breakfasts were good with more than enough variety.
As other reviews have said the stand out of the hotel is the large infinity pool .Spent most of our time here relaxing, reading and watching the world go by on Seminyak beach.
Service was good around the pool. There is a pool bar at the smaller pool. Also on the beach.
Prices for drinks were not over the top as in some other upmarket hotels. Bintangs 40Rp cocktails from 100Rp. We only had a few snacks at lunch sometimes. Pizzas, satay & club sandwich 90Rp. They did have a happy hour from 5pm at 3 for 2 drinks also.
What really struck me about this hotel was how friendly and helpful every staff member is. It really makes a difference to your stay. Nothing was too much trouble, and on ringing room service a few times, they were at the room very quickly.
I would have to say this is more a couples hotel than a family one. We didn't see any children here our entire stay, and having come away without our kids this time wouldn't want to bring them here in the future.
Made the most of being without the kids by trying some great restaurants including Mamasan, Sarong, La Sal and a must go to Chez Gado Gado. All excellent.
We were sorry we didn't book for longer, and will certainly be returning.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3045,pretty good,40,April 2013,"We visit Bali regularly. We have just returned from 4 nights at The Seminyak in a standard beach ring room. The room was very comfortable, with a balcony and glimpse of the ocean. Comfy bed and pillows, good housekeeping and we certainly had no complaints.
We also inspected the suites and the villa to consider for our next stay.The king bed suites on the top floor are very spacious with commanding views of the ocean and a jacuzzi in the huge bathroom overlooking the ocean...if you can afford one, go for it...The villa's are also equally as nice (with an outdoor dining area) but not as roomy as the suites. Actually we preferred the suite unless a private pool is on your list The main infinity pool of this resort is beautiful!!!
We have stayed twice at The W. It's hard to compare. The W is definitely awesome but you could be anywhere in the world. The Seminyak provides the typical Indonesian/Bali feel.
The main pool/s are smack bang on the beach. The pool area was never overly crowded,plenty of lounges.
The breakfast was ok...typical of most Bali resorts...egg station, pancakes, fruit sculptures....it certainly does not compare to The W breakfast but the setting is nice and the staff all lovely! The food around the pool again typical of any Bali resort..nasi goreng, satay, salads etc...
We are pleased with our choice of staying at The Seminyak and will probably stay again in a suite and next time with our two young kids. The location is great, you can easily walk to Seminyak Square via a laneway not far from the main entrance. It is next door to KuDeTa and a quick beach walk to Potato Heads and The W. The beach is clean from The Oberoi hotel onwards...before that it is quite crowded and a bit dirty so we avoid it.
We often swam in the ocean right in front of The Seminyak and then jumped in the pool to refresh.
This is a nice resort!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3046,Awesome Stay,50,March 2013,"We stayed there for our honeymoon and not being to Bali for years and originally considering the W we were glad we chose this resort! Excellent location, very friendly and professional staff, and our room was ideally located right on the beach! The infinity pools were amazing and we were really impressed by how friendly and helpful the staff was. It was very relaxing. Can't talk more highly of this place. It made travelling with my wife for the first time even that much more special.
PS. We got a complimentary happy honeymoon cake and on a different night got some complimentary beers delivered our room. This just exemplifies the experience there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3047,The image of your perfect life,50,April 2013,"After many years of going everywhere but Bali, i must say those hours of research for the perfect place to stay paid off. The perfect introduction for us.
I decided i wanted my birthday overseas, a few friends happened to be going to Bali at a similar time, so it seemed a good plan already.

This resort is flawless. Perfectly positioned on the Island (unless you want adventures inland) right on the beach in a beautiful setting. You have many pools to choose from, the infinity pool is gorgeous and you can stare at the ocean all day from its comfort. This was our base during our stay.

Breakfast, typically as you would imagine a buffet style, times by 100. Great quality and anything you want is just there.

I must point out, the resort is made what it is because of its staff. Hard working kind people ready to please you. I am uncomfortable with service and attention at the best of time but i just wanted to hug them all. They are the face of this place. My deepest thanks to each and every one of them.

Now, a lot has been said about the garden rooms on the "" other side"" however let me say, at not one point this has been an issue. To cross that narrow street (in my eyes a size of a laneway) whilst eager security guards stop the traffic for you is not at all painful. And yes, it does provide you with extra privacy from the main section.

The rooms were perfect. Clean and large. The housekeeping staff is amazing, again, its the quality of their work that makes this place. Thank you to you all.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3048,I wish I didn't have to leave,50,April 2013,"I spent 4 days/3nites in bali staying at the this resort, and I wish I didn't have to leave. This hotel has the key elements of a brilliant hotel. The hotel was full and as we had booked for a room earlier, they offered to upgrade me to a suite on the third floor with the balcony facing the ocean. If you are looking for a hotel or resort in seminyak which sits as close as possible to the ocean, this is the perfect accommodation for you. The splashing waves outside is a constant reminder of how close you are to the ocean. Brilliant!!

Best things about this place include the view, the infinity pool and the fantastic service. Make sure you choose the ocean wing. The staffs were very accommodating, friendly and professional, especially the conscierge and front desk.

The only downside to this place is the food. The buffet spread wasn't exciting, and the room service menu was ok. The only thing I really liked was the mee goreng which was Very delicious and generous in terms of serving.

But then again with food, there are plenty of options in seminyak and you will be spoilt for choice.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3049,Fantastic,50,April 2013,"Wonderful hotel right in the beach. Infinity pools overlooking the ocean.Our room on 2nd floor huge and well appointed bathroom included a spa.Staff were all very friendly and the position was, great. The Spa facials were excellent. The only negative was we had to come home.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3050,Another perfect holiday at The Seminyak.,50,March 2013,"My husband and I have just returned from our 4th stay at The Seminyak, and we love it just as much every time. We had a beautiful view of the surf from our suite on the top floor. The staff are amazing as always, so friendly, always greeting us like old friends, no request too much trouble. Fabulous position, and beautiful grounds. Thank you Mr Dwi and all the staff for another memorable Bali holiday.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3051,"I missed the old, but came to love the new.",40,March 2013,"I used to stay here at the old Resor Seminyak, but haven't returned to Seminyak for 10 years - my how things have changed! Let me say first we wanted to spend a little extra cash and have a nice couples holiday - first time in years. I travel a lot and I'm a bit fussy, and I had a few ""musts"" on the list of things I wanted from the hotel - absolute beachfront, swim up bar, breakfast included, king size bed, and separate bath... all ticked. Also because I knew the location I felt comfortable booking in. The hotel is close to everything - a short meander up the beach to La Lucciola... my fave restaurant here still, Ku De ta next door... if that's your thing. But of course when I first arrived I missed the retro charm of the old hotel - the beautiful gardens, and the great value. Perhaps had made a mistake? Ultimately though, I would have to say the answer was No. It was lovely.

The room was a very good size, with a view of the ocean, the bed large and comfortable. Blockout blinds for that lazy sleep in. The coffee was good - several cuppucinos each morning, and the breakfast - well - it is what it is. Changing array of choices all reasonably tasty, good egg station, and if you wanted something extra you only had to ask. Still I find breakfasts much of a muchness in Bali hotels.

The staff are all wonderful - but I have never really had a bad experience in Bali. The cocktails at the swim up bar were delish - and the satays are well worth trying - they come in their own little smoking grill. Didn't eat in house apart from that, as the prices aren't worth it when you can walk out the door to so many restaurants (for a quick and good meal - try Ultimo). We both suffer from mozzie's... but there I was only bitten once and didn't even have to wear repellant for most of the trip so they obviously had things under control. And it was nice to see that my friends who traded on the beach were all still there and we had a jolly reunion. Yes, there's the hassle of being approached when you go to the beach, but a couple of strong ""No thank yous"" will send people away. If you want a good beach massage ask for Linda. I tried to spend a bit with the locals on the beach to share the money around.

The joy of this hotel is to watch the incredible sunsets... and I went mad photographing them. We were there for Nyepi day (and the Ogoh Ogoh the night before that) and I would love to come back again for the day of silence...like experiencing Bali the way it once was. You're not allowed to leave the hotel on Nyepi day but the staff put on some wonderful activities including making a Balinese offering and Language classes.

The infinity pool is beautiful. The cabanas dotted throughout the grounds very restful. Whilst at first I was a bit overwhelmed by the size of the place, and felt that it lacked a bit of soul, I came to really love our stay. A couple of little things that weren't quite right though... our welcome flowers inside the room were there long past their first bloom and well into dying mode. They should have been removed or replaced. Plus a little more attention to cleaning under the toilet seat wouldnt have been a bad thing... but overall the standard of cleanliness was very good. For a hotel that is competing with the romance of those 5 star hotels around it, little touches were missing - some candles/lanterns in the evening around the pool and bar areas for example.

I don't love the position of the restaurant - you're looking at the back of the villas... but if you time yourself right you can get a table with an ocean view. Elements like the lighting etc didn't really give it the romance and soul I would have expected from a 5 star balinese hotel, but given we got a good price I really can't complain.

We were given a free massage each in the spa - the spa is lovely, really beautiuful and the massages very nice. Pricey though... and they did put the complimentary massage on our bill. When questioned though the items were removed.

A lovely woven bag in the room to take out shopping or to the beach was a nice touch - and you can take them home with you.

We asked for late checkout, and at first were told since our room was booked, they couldn't accomodate us... but I returned a second time and the hotel moved us to another room (a twin) until 6pm free of charge. Sometimes a little persistance helps.

If you're looking for nicely presented rooms, good beds, a nice bath and rain shower, a fabulous pool, a great location, and a cruisey getaway, then it's a lovely hotel and you can't go wrong in the beach wing. Stay away from the Ku De Ta side in peak season, it's bound to be noisy... (even when you're not in peak I would think). Also make sure you find a good deal. I shopped around, got the lowest price I could and then went straight to flight centre who guarantee to beat it. I wouldn't pay rack rate or anywhere near it to be honest, not worth that amount of money, but if you can get a good deal I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Oh - and the little tailor immediately across the road came well recommended.I had a linen dress copied, and they did a very nice job. There were probably cheaper places I could have gone, but it was so handy... and I was on holiday!

So all in all, we had a ball, and the little things were not large enough to detract from a lovely stay. Will we stay again? For a good price, absolutely.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3052,There are probably better,20,September 2012,"spent our Honeymoon here in September 2012 and it was probably a mistake. The hotel was pretty new when we stayed so may have had time to get better but it desperately needed to. We were promised a free upgrade when booking as it was our Honeymoon which was not forthcoming. After discussions with the front desk staff i asked to speak to the manager whom i subsequently found out was not the manager but the front desk manager, i repeated this process three times, never actually getting to speak to the hotel manager. The upshot was that, though the hotel was not full and they could have upgraded us, we did not get a free upgrade and i had to pay extra to move up to the promised room for our honeymoon. The hotel generally (and it has to be said Bali) was ludicrously overpriced, our room bill averaged out at ¬£250 per night. The food and drink in the hotel was stupidly priced with the upshot being that nobody ate or drank there which was a real shame as there was a nice (but empty) pool bar. The sea outside is too rough to swim in, the noise of the wind on the balconies and walkways is something to behold.
The grounds and pool area are very well cared for, the room was great but far too expensive and the sense of resentment was dificult to shift. I would say that the owners and management just havent got their heads around customer service and a reasonable business model to create a nice hotel.
Have to say that Bali as a whole was a huge disappointment, even though Seminyak is meant to be a nice, upmarket resort area it was overflowing with Australians doing their best impressions of English people in Spain.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3053,Amazing hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,March 2013,"I am a Travel Agent and have recently returned from a familiarization trip to Bali. The Seminyak Resort & Spa was definitely a stand out resort on the trip. The property is very elegant with a grand marble open plan foyer and intricate artwork and detail through out the resort. It has a prime beachfront location, with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean and a beautifully decorated day spa. The Seminyak is in a perfect location, close to the popular Ku De Ta and Potato Head Beach Clubs and close to great boutique shops, markets, restaurants and bars. Seminyak has some of the best restaurants in Bali and it is a massive highlight to this resort, being so close to it all. The marble bathrooms are amazing! The rooms are spacious, clean and have a beautiful Balinese feel to them using traditional Balinese colours and decorative art pieces. I unfortunately did not get to enjoy the Day Spa, however it looked very luxurious.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3054,best ever bali stay,50,April 2013,"This is our last day here, don't want to leave. We had a beach villa, which was excellent. Staff are lovely, and very helpful. The gardens and pool, are wonderful. Our only complaint is that we had to wait for a table at breakfast time, even though there were plenty of tables empty. Overall, we loved our stay, and will certainly stay here on our next trip to Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3055,The pool made all the difference...,50,March 2013,"We have booked the garden wing room, which was a mistake and we will definitely book the beach wing room next time we go, but it did not bother us as much as I expected after reading all the bad comments on it here on Trip Advisor. Yes you have to walk across the street, but for some reason we did not mind that, as we basically left the room before breakfast and came back in the evening. There is a security guy stopping the traffic for you, so it is not dangerous and it is really only a 10 m walk across the road. The room was OK, nice furnished, modern, clean, only problem we had there was, it is just so loud to be facing the road, so we changed the room to the other side, which was better but still, slamming door, hallway music, ringing phone at the reception, you can hear it all! And if you are light sleeper, you will not have a pleasant morning.

Stuff is just amazing. People working in a hotel are always smiling, polite, helpful, and make your day nicer.
Breakfast is nice, sitting outside watching a garden, selection could be more variable, but no complains there.

Most importantly the POOL, I could spend all day in the infinitive pool. Drinking cocktails, having dinner there (The Indonesian specialties-amazing) or just hanging out with friends, the sunset from the pool is the most beautiful sunset you can see. Just because of that, and great stuff, we will go back to this hotel.

Location is good, with Ku De Ta restaurant right next door, and walking to the more lively street does not take more than 15 min.

Sum, we would go again and enjoy the stay. I would recommend this hotel, but would say, pick a beach wing for those who like to spend holidays in a room. For those who are to busy to take a afternoon nap, garden wing is OK too.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3056,Be careful what room you book,40,March 2013,"I made a mistakes when booking. As I was in a rush and the choice on Expedia (at the time) was small I grabbed a Garden room - another error (when staying in a hotel for the first time, I make it a rule not to book suites etc before I see what the place is like). With a garden room, you are not in the The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, no beach to be spotted and furthermore, you are not even in the main Hotel complex - not only are you down the road but you are also across the road.

However, I am pleased to state that the Hotel moved me from the ‚Äòoutpost‚Äô (where the Garden rooms are) to the Hotel proper and were very gracious in doing so. Mr Dwi was very accommodating and professional as was his colleague whose name escapes me sorry, but the gentleman who arranged my transfer to Nusa Dua when I checked out.

Whilst the Hotel is nice it does lack a few of the ‚Äògivens‚Äô that one would expect from a Hotel that purports to be (and charges like) a 4 star or better. Firstly there is only one bar and that is the Pool bar. If you do not want to literally sit in the pool then you have no other option except go elsewhere. One bar in a hotel this size does not make sense. My suggestion would be to convert the little used (from what I saw) beachside ‚Äúchapel‚Äù and make it functional. Convert it into a proper bar where guests can relax, have ‚Äòsundowners‚Äô perhaps and gaze over the beach in comfort rather that having to sit on poolside sun chairs or in the pool to have a drink (which if course one can if one wants). Plus the space can be used 7 days a week instead of only occasionally = revenue.

The staff are of course are very friendly and welcoming - always with a nice smile ‚Äì as is the norm in Bali. The room are nicely appointed and functional (the garden room was nice to). One thing that should never happen in a Hotel of any class is run out of Tea, in this case English Breakfast (I now it is petty but still important). This happened one morning at breakfast and then I could not believe it when the same was said the following morning. There are supermarkets in Bali ‚Äì go and buy some Tea!
To sum up, a pleasant stay once the management moved me from the ‚Äòoutpost‚Äô. The Hotel should seriously consider getting rid of the Garden Rooms ‚Äì in my opinion it damages the ‚Äòbrand‚Äô.

Would I return? Possibly but NOT in a Garden room and I will bring my own tea this time, just in case :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3057,Beautiful resort - amazing holiday,40,June 2012,"We arrived at this resort to find a beautiful entrance and large airy reception.
The staff were all helpful and polite. After a problem with the room we had booked being set a little further from the beach than we were told (me being pregnant) we inspected two other types of room and then settled with a front villa suite at an upgrade price.
The room was beautiful - and throughout our stay well cleaned with thoughtful touches left (towel art, sweets)
The bathroom - amazing! Huge shower, huge bath tub set in glass encased gardens ! Phone by the toilet ? Unnecessary but awesome !

The outdoor dining area was great - along with minibar and outdoor sink - came in handy when having family and friends over for evening drinks. This area led onto the amazing pool in our villa and the raised gazebo from which our view was over the main hotel infinity pool and the sea- amazing !

Housekeeping made sure to come by in the evenings and spray the rooms for bugs, light coils and turn down beds.

If we hadn't ordered our breakfast by 9ish the kitchen would call to ask us what we would like brought to us. Pancakes were the best ! Chefs were very accommodating.

I probably ordered ice to the room twice a day! Tipping is not mandatory but it hardly breaks the bank (20,000 is fair)

Main pool - infinity is the only way. Gorgeous views of the sunset. Sometimes the sea came so far in it deposited sand into the pool - crazy seeing the waves crashing in.Service by the main pool was great both for food and drink.

Small pool - quieter with a pool bar. More shaded with cabanas available at no extra charge.

Grounds kept immaculate - grass cut and gardening occurring everyday.

Just 2 negatives:

On returning to our room one night our main door was open but our beds had not been turned down- odd but security dealt with the matter quickly and nothing was amiss.

The bed is huge and comfy with fresh soft sheets, but for some reason it felt like it may have bugs as my legs were always itchy when trying to sleep.
The rooms near water may suffer this problem.

Water feature outside room a little noisy but on asking staff they were able to switch it off every night when they turned down the room.

Apart from this i have to say the attention to service is great. We had mentioned to the hotel on arrival that two family members would be coming to meet us and the staff instantly welcomed them and showed them to our room even sending a complimentry anniversary cake and an ice bucket full of drinks to our room!

The car service was happy to drop us locally anywhere - spa, restaurants, shopping. Staff were always happy and smiling. We always tipped the driver 20,000 each way.

I would only stay here again. Some of the reviews moan about the garden view rooms on the other side of the road - I never saw these and my review is based on staying in the main hotel. I would say if you are booking - stay in the main hotel - you won't be disappointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3058,Room upgrade made it worthwhile,40,March 2013,"We booked an ocean view room and got upgraded to the Ocean view villa which was amazing! We had our own private pool and alfresco, overlooking the ocean. The location of this hotel is perfect if you want to be on the beach. It's on a nice part of Seminyak beach, directly across from a small surf spot. You can hire surfboards next door. The infinity pool is gorgeous and directly overlooks the beach. Its a lovely walk along the beach to good restaurants/bars such as LaLucciola, KuDeTa.
The breakfast however isn't as good as the Padma Hotel or the Legian - in both quality and range of choice. The spa treatments are also not as good as other 5 star resorts in Bali - though the prices are as steep. I would say that this hotel is perfect in location, and the ocean view villa is superb, but other aspects of the hotel weren't as good as other places I've stayed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3059,Superb service! Beautiful resort! Highly recommended!,50,March 2013,"My husband and I book the deluxe beach view room for this trip. Upon arrival, we are already treated to their uncompromising service. One of them is the checkin, they didn't keep us waiting but instead settled us down comfortably. As the room we booked was not ready, they move us into a suite room for the next few hours and to compensate for the inconvenience, they threw in a complimentary airport transfer for us. Not only that thy upgraded us to the suite room because by the time we came back for our original room which was still not ready by then.
Overall, I must say the service standards made my stay greater than great. Not forgetting the resort is wonderful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3060,What should we have for lunch? Nasi? Satay... Cocktails?,50,March 2013,"We are here right now and having a wonderful time. The staff are friendly and lovely.. Check in was efficient and well done after our 6 hour flight. welcome drinks, frangipanis and refreshing towels. The food has been great so far and our room Is spacious, clean and has all the mod cons. Quite air con, iPod dock, huge bath, rain water shower, comfy bed... Flat screen and an awesome view of the ocean from our front deck. Thanks to the staff already... for making our stay kick off in style :).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3061,Annoyed,40,March 2013,"Nice hotel nice pool.. But when booking the garden wing room I didn't know it was across the road. So so dangerous each time we try and cross the road. If i knew It was across a road I wouldn't booked this room.
It's not very busy this time of year, plenty of free rooms available on the actuall grounds of the resort. I asked to change rooms but nothing. If we had stayed on the actuall resort this review would have been great!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3062,Almost perfect!,40,August 2012,"Checked in to this hotel for 2 nights after staying in Ubud for a while.The location is amazing,really close to the shopping area/bars/restaurants and Ku De Ta.The check-in was an absolute nightmare.I had specifically booked for a room with a double bed and had a confirmed reservation for the same.However,they messed that up and moved us into a room which I had not reserved.I had to make several calls to the reception to move us to a better room,but all in vain.Nobody bothered to get back to us.My husband and I finally decided to move to another hotel as we were really disappointed by their service standards.I had already paid the entire amount for my stay and requested for a refund.Things totally turned around after that.The manager graciously apologized for all the confusion and upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a sea view.The jacuzzi had a good sea view.However,the water pressure was really low and it took ages to fill up which made it pretty unusable.The breakfast was just OK with very limited vegetarian choices.We used the hotel shuttle a few times and our driver was absolutely amazing.Recommended some great places and gave us a tour of the place.Overall,we had a great stay.Just wish that it had started off on a better note.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3063,Enjoyable stay,50,January 2013,"We stayed here over New Year's Eve for a week and had a fantastic time. The hotel is very ideally located on the beach and in walking distance to all the hotspots.

Check in was easy and the staff (mainly locals) are very friendly and accommodating.

The rooms were of very good standard, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was great, walk in shower and big tub etc.

Pool area was really nice, plenty of sun loungers and right on the beach too.

Dinner options might be a bit limited but I'd highly recommend you go to the many awesome restaurants in the area. Ku de ta is right next door and great for drinks, bite to eat and chill out. Wah wah burger across the road best wagyu burgers ever, pricey but good. Luccianos, 5 min walk from hotel is a nice venue on the beach. Sarong, 5 min drive, highly recommend for a special dinner and ultimo restaurant about a 5 min walk, great for laid back Italian food.

Stay in seminyak if you looking for plenty of options all within walking distance.

I would recommend this hotel, it's not perfect but its thoroughly enjoyable and I'd happily go back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3064,Enjoyable But,40,November 2012,We stayed at The Seminyak Resort in November for 7 days we upgraded to a seaview room with only a glimpse of the sea not really worth the money. The rooms are nice enough the grounds ok we had a palm tree with dead branches all over it that no one did anything about. A real eyesore. Staff we're lovely. Breakfast could have been better. Nice pool on the beach. I don't think it's a 5 star property more a 4 star. Quite a big resort lots of funny ways to get to your room it took a few days to work it out. Overall a pleasant stay but will try somewhere else next time.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3065,PEACEFUL HAVEN,40,February 2013,"We have just spent an idyllic week in Beach Front Villa 1107 ‚Äì the staff at this resort could NOT have been happier, more friendly and helpful - BRILLIANT. We arrived late 11.30pm ‚Äì checked in quickly ‚Äì the villa is large & beautifully furnished ‚Äì good A/C very comfortable king bed. Breakfast buffet extensive ‚Äì you can also order from the a la carte menu. As the resort is only a very short walk (or cheap taxi ride) to sensational restaurants we ate out ‚Äì Chandra (brilliant), Sardine (Amazing), Ku de Tah (WOW!), Potato Head (French) (delicious ‚Äì only one we should have booked) we also tried Naughty Nuri‚Äôs (delicious & fun ribs/bbq).

3067,A great week at the Seminyak Beach Resort,50,February 2013,"My wife and I stayed for a week at the Seminyak Beach Resort. Fortunately we were able to upgrade our room to a Beach Wing. We had a fantastic room very close to the Swimming Pools and Beach. The staff are very friendly and polite. They were very happy to book restaurants or assist with any questions. The location is ideal for shopping on the main street of Seminyak and very close to some great restaurants such as Sardine and Sarong or cheaper alternatives such as Taco Casa, Sasa and Ultimo. The beach directly across from the hotel was clean and provides access to other hotels or you can walk to Legian or Kuta if required. We would definitely stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3068,We loved our stay at The Seminyak,50,February 2013,"We loved our recent stay at The Seminyak. We took a room in the Beach Wing for one week and were very impressed by all aspects of the experience. The entire property is simply but tastefully decorated and along with the grounds and gardens is exceptionally clean and well maintained. The staff are polite, welcoming and accommodating and clearly work hard to keep standards consistently high. The infinity pool and the sun deck surrounding it is picturesque and the proximity of the beach gives the option of splitting time between the two. Breakfast was included in our rate and although not something that we'd usually bother with much, we enjoyed it - there was a good selection of different hot and cold items each day. Our room was cleaned daily with a turn down service in the evening. The hotel is well positioned within Seminyak; it's an easy walk to some great restaurants (we recommend Sarong and Chez Gado Gado.) Before we travelled we researched places to eat and drink in the evening, which was handy since there is no information or guidance / recommendations on local amenities given in the in-room directory. We found drinks in the hotel's bar rather over priced, but there are plenty of good drinking spots in the local area. Overall a wonderful break at a gorgeous property.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3069,The pool,50,February 2013,"The pool, the pool the pool... and the location.
Of course for this hotel category you will find bigger and more amazing pool but this one is very nice, if you want to relax enjoy the scene, the sea, the sun, the food and the service.
the place is nice, and chic... Now it's depend what you are looking for.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3070,Location Location Location,50,October 2012,"This is the best location on Seminyak Beach. The resort is an easy walk to the markets and Seminyak square. It is right next to Ku De Ta, which is the hot spot for dinner/drinks at sunset, and an easy walk to La Lucciola, which is one of the top rated Italian restaurants in the area.

The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet changes slightly each day and offers a wider variety of options. We found the offerings to be fresh, and most days took advantage of the cook to order egg station. You can even order your coffee via room service free of charge to enjoy prior to going down to breakfast. The poolside bar and food service was good, with daily drink specials.

The rooms are very large, but as others have mentioned, you must opt for the beach wing. The Garden wing is across a busy street, in what looks to be another hotel at first glance, and has it's own small pool.

It is a bit hard to get a poolside lounge, but on days we planned on being poolside we headed down before breakfast to save our seats. The people selling things on the beach are down and out of view, since the pool is elevated from the beach. If you are interested in shopping you can swim up to the infinity edge and flag down a salesman, or walk the beach, otherwise you can relax undisturbed.

We booked a couples massage at the spa, and though it was wonderful, I thought the prices were a bit high, compared to advertised rates in town.

This resort is located between The Legion, and The Oberoi. It's pool/ocean view are superior to that of the Oberoi and about the same as The Legion but for less money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3071,infinity pool is this beachfront resort's most charming part,40,February 2013,"a quite new resort with ideal location @ Seminyak beach. Location is closed to many clubs & restaurants. In my opinion, the infinity pool is the main thing that characterizes the beachfront resort. Seminyak beach is better for swimming and surfing compared to those of Nusa Dua, Benoa, Sanur, and Kuta. Staffs were very helpful and friendly. Most of breakfast menu are so-so / average taste. For those who choose to stay @ Garden wing room, the rooms are separated from the resort main wing.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3072,"Great hotel, great resort",40,November 2012,"I had a fantastic time at The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa. The hotel is split into 2, the beach wing and the garden wing.

I stayed in the garden wing and yes they do take you in a cart over the road to this wing, but it's less than a 2 minute walk between the 2 wings of the hotel and there are security outside 24 - 7 to stop any traffic and help you cross the road. The rooms in both wings are identical, I had friends staying in the beach wing, and the rooms are spacious, with great bathrooms, rainforest showers, TV, minibar and a balcony with chairs. The garden wing also has its own pool, with bar and sun loungers if you'd like to stay there and chill during the day.

The hotel has a further 2 pools in the beach wing. An awesome infinity pool which overlooks the beach and sea and the other one is still stunning with a swim up bar. The food was of a very high standard and in typical Balinese fashion nothing you ask for is too much trouble for the attentive staff. I do like a spa and even though there are many street shops offering massages a lot cheaper I'm really glad I used the hotel spa.

Seminyak is my favourite Bali beach resort. Classy resort but only a 15 minute taxi away from the mayhem of Kuta. The resort has lots of good restaurants and shops although most of them will involve a 15 - 20 minute walk or a 5 minute taxi. I did ask the hotel order me a taxi once and they simply got a car and drove me there, a nice bonus. If you are looking for somewhere to go out and eat/drink/chill you must visit Potato Head - stupid name but huge really classy beach bar / restaurant. Very well designed beachfront property with great food, day beds, cocktails, swimming pool and also visit the similar but slightly more intimate Ku De Ta.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3073,The worse hotel ever,10,January 2013,"We book our hotel through the travel agent. Were really looking forward our holiday. We've been to Bali before but we always stayed in Kuta. So we decided to go to another part of Bali this time. The trip from airport to the hotel took us almost an hour, but we didnt care, we were very excited. The hotel was built in 2011, so we thought it will be nice and new. It was.. But then... After we checked in they put us on a cart and we drove.. I was excited thinking that the hotel is sooo big they have to drive us to our room... My excitement has change the moment we hit the main rode. They took us to the building down and across the street. And we so wanted to be on the beach!!! I asked them to take us back to the reception cause i was sure there was a mistake. At the reception they said that all is right we booked the garden wing... Yes we did, but we didnt know it would be across the rode.. When i asked if there is some chance for us to change the room they said no..only if we decided to stay in their suite and pay extra $100 per night... Of course we didnt. Oh well.. Ok.. We stay there and will walk for breakfast and pool and beech. But when we entered the room... The smell of stale air and mold shocked us... We call our travel agent in Australia and told him about our problem... He promised to sort all out. More then two hours we were on the phone talking to different people...the decision was to stay for a night... Upset and and angry we went for dinner.. The nearest decent restaurant was more then 20 minutes walk... After the dinner we decided to go to the beach for a swim... Haha... The beach was covered in litter!!! Disgusting!!! In the morning we went for a breakfast in the hotel: spoilt eggs and hot breakfast served cold- this is what we got... It was enough!!! At around 10 am our travel agent called asking what we have decided to do. We asked to book us into a different hotel. When we checked out they inform us that they WONT GIVE US A REFUND!!! So our $4000 were just wasted!!! So we went to different hotel and payed for it in full... So all our holiday was influenced by this horrible experience..
Dont get me wrong: the rooms were nice and new, big tv, free wi-fi...
And one more thing.. If u decide to book a garden view room expect to overview an abandon building site or something like it... Believe me there were no garden to look at...",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3074,Spectacular,50,January 2013,"Apart from the fact that the hotel is located in a naturally stunning place, everything about it adds to the overall experience. The staff are so polite and friendly, we left feeling sad as if we were leaving family. The room was beautiful, clean and had everything we could have wanted. The food was great, the infinity pool on the beach unreal..the only negative was that the sea brings up trash when the weather is windy.
The spa was great I just had time for a back massage on the last day but I intend on going back and doing every treatment they have to offer if the one I did was an indication of quality..so wonderful.
The guest experience created by the staff was unparalleled especially for the ridiculously low price - the level comparable to any Aman hotel, but without having to take out a second mortgage on your house to pay for it.
This hotel has tiny details everywhere you look that create the most idyllic utopia - everything is beautiful, and I mean everything.

I'm already planning my trip to come back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3075,Shoddy and tired Hotel,10,January 2013,"The website pictures bear no resmblance to reality. The lobby is cheap and tatty like the rest of the hotel.The gardens are poorly maintained and need weeding . When we arrived about 25 staff were holding an out door activities session in casual clothes on the main lawn complete with blaring music. We ordered poolside drinks and the waiter asked us if we had a pen to sign the chit ?? When we asked for a lighter or mathches he said he didnt have any and walked off ?? Just appalling service and attitude . We checked out after 3 hours and went back to the Padma in Legian which is divine and a profffesionly run hotel .The Legian is like a bad 3 star Flag Inn hotel thats been put up in a hurry to cash in on a boom .The rooms are miles from reception along slippery ( when wet )open air terraces .. the cheaper rooms are not even a part of the main hotel but across the road in what looks like an old car park , which they dump you out of a golf buggy and then take off .
I have never been more disappointed and amazed at a hotel especially one pretending to be 5 stars .
p.s. whilst swimming in the wet edge pool at the beach there were hawkers standing on the edge shouting at us in the pool to buy their kites ...no security was to be seen anywhere",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3076,Great Times at the Seminyak,50,January 2013,"We recently returned from ten days staying at this resort. We can only recommend this excellent hotel. Our room ovelooked the beach. It was spacious, tastefully decorated and very well maintained and was serviced twice a day. The restaraunt served excellent food. Our package included breakfast and each morning we would linger over a slow brakfast with our three daughters.Breakfast included something for everyone, an array of tropical fruit, muesli and cereals, traditional Bailinese delioghts and western options. The hotel staff were particularly helpful and always attentive and pleasant.

The infinity pool was the perfect temperature and we enjoyed floating in the pool, watching the ocean and the passing parade of people along the beach. Most people sought sunbeds around the pool however we preferred to use the less popular cabanas which are in the garden ( and only a 30 or metrwe walk to the pool). The cabanas are on raised platforms with white curtains billowing. There was plenty of room for all five of us to lie around on sunbeds reading, chatting and regularly strolling over to the pool for a dip.

The Seminyak is located in a great position. The beachfront position is magnificent but in addition it is only a five minute stroll to the heart of the main street of Seminyak. There are great shopping and restaraunt options available. We ate out every night and enjoyed a stroll back to the hotel in the warm Balinese evening.

Cannot recommend this hotel too highly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3077,Bliss By The Beach,40,December 2012,"Firstly this place is well worth considering. Excellent location and a relatively new hotel set by the beach. The rooms are modern, spacious and very clean.

We stayed for a week over New Years and barely left the oceanfront pool.

Breakfast is exceptional and the staff are very friendly and attentive.

Great restaurants close by and if you're organised the hotel can make reservations for you before you arrive.

You'll love it - hard not to enjoy!

Tips: Beware the Garden Wing is over a busy road from main hotel (with own pool). Although v nice has no lifts.

Book good popular local restaurants in advance (note - for non smokers; ask for downstairs because smoking often allowed upstairs).",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3078,Happy holidays,50,December 2012,"Excellent hotel in excellent location. Very helpful staff, excellent housekeeping, luxurious rooms, inviting pools, nice garden. Leaves little to desire.
Shortcomings: During our stay there were for two days problems with the wifi. It worked but was slow. The kitchen is not one of a Michelin restaurant but it is very good. However, I have had better juice and coffee on Bali (I adore Bali coffee). There is too much garbage in the sea and even if the hotel can do little about that, they must remain vigilant about the beach.
I cannot really compare prices to other hotels on Bali and I leave that to others. I also did not go to the spa. All I know is that massages are not as cheap as on the street.
All in all, a very enjoyable stay in a hotel where you want to go back to. Next time in one of the smashing ocean view villas.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3079,Fantastic hotel in wonderful Location,50,November 2012,"This hotel is a real gem of a property, the staff were amazing and so friendly, the pools and facilities were fantastic. The rooms were well appointed and had everything you need. Including rooms service etc. I would recommend upgrading to a seaview room if your budget allows it. The hotel is right on the beach with amazing views from the infinity pool. there are some great bars and restaurants close by and metered taxis are cheap. kuta is about 15 mins from the hotel. cannot recommend it enough, its a new hotel and deserves every bit of credit it can get.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3080,I Have Died and Gone to Heaven,40,October 2012,"[The following review is for The Kahyangan Spa at The Seminyak Resort & Spa. I submit the review here since I cannot find The Kahyangan Spa account at Trip Advisor]

Kahyangan in Bahasa means Heaven. It‚Äôs the equivalent of Mount Olympus in ancient Greek mythology. I assume the name was chosen to depict the heavenly treatment the spa has to offers.

When I enter the lobby, I can see that they are keeping up with the name. The lobby is a mixture between the elegance of Indonesia old heritage with a touch of Arabian Night ambience. The aroma therapy is indulging you with floral scents. The fountain in the middle of the foyer is in the shape of blooming lotus while the ceiling is filled with colorful Batik patterns which you can lost in your own thought for admiring them. Architectural-wise the scale of the lobby is successfully creating a perfect ambience for an upscale spa. Not to mention the high ceiling that creates a divine building proportion.

After you sign for treatment, they will lead you the waiting room through a sheer curtain. You can‚Äôt help feeling that you‚Äôre lost in a luxury of ancient palace. In the waiting room, you will be asked several questions regarding your body condition and what you‚Äôre expecting from the treatment. You will be served a fresh cold towel with peppermint scent and a cup of ginger lime tea.

You will proceed to the locker room ‚Äì which I really love. The locker room is elegant and spacious. You can find all the amenities you need. The high-ceiling shower room with rain-shower is simply divine. In the locker room, you change your attire with a ‚Äì I assume ‚Äì high quality silk kimono. I can‚Äôt even describe the quality of the silk. You have to feel it for yourself.

The open-air Jacuzzi is quite unique. Instead of solid walls, two sides of the Jacuzzi room are covered with metal sculpture with tinted glass facing the garden of the resort. There are two different set of temperature, 15‚ó¶C and 35‚ó¶C. Originally, for best result, it is suggested to dip in the high temperature and the follow with the lower one. However, since it was an open-air Jacuzzi and Bali‚Äôs heat is unbearable, I dipped myself in the cold Jacuzzi.

Later, you will be escorted to the treatment room. The corridor is exquisite. The dim lights, the wooden floor, and the carving for each number of the room are really depicted old-heritage Indonesian ambience.

My treatment room is the best one because it has ocean view. The treatment room also has an open-air bathroom area for washing-feet treatment and also for flower bath. The treatment I had is the signature treatment of the spa which called ‚ÄúKahyangan Spa‚Äù. The 75 minutes treatment literally took me away to the dreamland because I was actually fall asleep. It was really relaxing and remedial at the same time.

After the treatment, you will proceed to the same ritual when you‚Äôre came in, which is to the locker room to take a shower and then back to the waiting room when you served with another ginger lime tea while answering questions regarding your satisfactory.

It was a heavenly experience indeed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3081,Fantastic Location,50,December 2012,"Had a fantastic holiday here. The idea was to relax & recharge. Couldn`t have picked a better location. Hotel is located between Ku De Ta & Potato Head, with Eat Street at the back door. As it was very hot at this time of year, we spent a lot of time at the pool [two of them], which are infinity pools, right on the beach. Magnificent sunsets ! We were upgraded to a Beachside Room which was nice. Buffet breakfast was fantastic, staff friendly & helpful & whole was very relaxing.
Would certainly recommend this place !",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3082,Great new hotel,50,February 2012,"My husband, daughter and son in law and I stayed at The Seminyak in February this year for eight days.
When we stayed the hotel renovation was still occurring although there was no noise or disruption that we noticed.
From the airport pick up to the drop off when we left our stay was pretty much without fault although some of the staff are clearly new and still learning.

Our rooms were ready when we arrived even though it was well before check in time and they were fabulous.
From the large bathroom and balcony to the view (and sound of) the beach to the quaint little touches such as personalized hand written welcome notes and a daily newsletter outlining the weather and events of the day the experience was excellent.
Breakfast each morning was a very pleasant way to start the day.
A special thanks to Sari who made each breakfast service special, remembering all our names, our coffee preferences and even that the boys liked eggs Benedict.

The weekly cocktail party in the beach side chapel, attended by the management team, was a nice touch and what a beautiful venue and spectacular view!!!!

Another nice touch was the complimentary yoga class also conducted in the chapel.
My daughter and I were the only two participants but the instructor was excellent (both my daughter and I practice yoga at home so we know the difference) and we both had a great work out!!

The pool is spectacular with an uninterrupted view of the beach.
The boys whiled away many an hour hanging over the infinity edge watching the world go by,often with an ice cold Bintang in their hand.

This brings me to my only negative comment - service around the swimming pool was a little hit and miss and you often had to go looking for someone to order a drink or a meal.

Another big positive was the front desk/concierge staff who remembered our names and for whom no request was too much trouble.
So much so that on several occasions when we were going to Bodyworks for a treatment (about 10 minutes walk away) they offered to drive us and comeback and collect us at the end of our treatments!!
They also dropped my daughter and I up near the Bintang supermarket to do some shopping one morning - awesome...

My only disappointment now is the prices for a stay at The Seminyak.
We have looked to stay here on two subsequent visits but found the prices far too high in comparison to the likes of The Oberoi etc which are similarly located right on Seminyak Beach but are much more established and have earned their 5 star status and price tag.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3083,Just what you want,50,November 2012,"Stayed here as part of a large work trip November 2012 for 3 nights and I highly recommend this hotel.
Location is beach front, close to trendy restaurants/bars and the renowned Potato-Head Club (worth a visit). Very spacious grounds, very well kept, although take sandals as the pathways get very hot.
The restaurant for breakfast is surprisingly cool in the humidity of Bali, very good selection of food and staff are very helpful and quick to offer more tea/juice etc.
Rooms are large, and the Jacuzzi rooms have the best views as they overlook the gardens and the beach. Had a nose round my colleagues beachfront suite and although spacious with its own pool, I'd actually recommend the room I had! The pool on the beach front is ideal, large size and reasonable bar service.
Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who fancies spending a little extra. Great location and the staff couldn't do enough, especially as there were about 70 of us, thank you!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3084,Perfection!,50,November 2012,"We stayed here for 5 days in November 2012 and can highly recommend this hotel. We walked in to our beach side suite ( we had been upgraded from a standard room) to be met with the best balcony view of the palm trees against the beach back drop. The room was spacious and every detail had been attended to. The bed is the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on - firm with a pillow top, and perfect pillows. So we had the best night's sleep.
The pool is fabulous; it gives the impression of finishing in the ocean and is so relaxing. There were always plenty of loungers and towels available.
There didn't seem to be any kids at the hotel- I didn't see any guest under the age of about 25 and few guests were over the age of 60. The breakfasts were good and in a lovely environment over-looking the immaculate gardens.
There is a complimentary shuttle bus in to Seminyak but we preferred to get a taxi which usually cost about 50 cents. Next door to Ku De Ta and easy access to other great restaurants, it's hard to beat.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3085,beautiful,50,October 2012,"What a wonderful hotel, perfect location right on the beach, beautiful gardens and fantastic staff. Having booked a beach wing room, we found ourselves on the 2nd floor with the expected view but then asked to be moved to a ground floor room for better access to the pool - immediately the staff made the best effort to relocate us. The poolside cabanas were the perfect place to while away the day and watch the activity on the beach.

The location of this hotel gives great access to some of the best restaurants in Seminyak but don't avoid the hotel offerings as all the meals from breakfast to dinner were also very good. The shopping area of Seminyak is in easy walking distance and provides a good variety from high end boutiques to market type stalls.

Having visited Bali many times we would return to this location without hesitation. A great hotel for adults.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3086,Home away from home.,50,November 2012,"Thank you once again to the wonderful staff at The Seminyak Beach Resort. It was our third stay here, in a beach view room, and this time we bought our adult son and his partner. We stayed for 2 weeks, our son for one week and we all had a great time. The gardens are now well established, breakfast is delightful, as is every member of staff you meet throughout the day. We will be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3087,Stunning beachside resort and excellent service,50,November 2012,"We stayed for five nights at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa and it was amazing the service from the staff was faultless.
Cab drivers found my description of the resort name a little hard to understand but once I realized where it was it was easy to describe. After reading other reviews on trip adviser we decided to book in a suite as we didn't want to wind up across the road. We had a ground floor room with a private balcony the room was very modern with a few authentic Balinese touches. We had a king sized bed with two types of pillows each complimentry slippers, dressing gown and stacks of bathroom products replenished twice daily. Love the turn down service and getting clean towels twice a day lets face it we shower more when you enjoy time in the water. The infinity pool really looks like it goes forever when you sit in it and the edge of the pool fades away into the sea and the horizon. The cocktails are reasonably priced for a resort I loved the bali walkiki comes in a coconut reminded me of a picture of my mum in Bali in the 80s. Breakfast is included and delicious the Buffett has a great selection of eastern and western and if something is not on display the staff are more than happy to help track it down which was great for me as I wanted yellow passionfruit everyday. Now I accidentally let slip it was my birthday the next day when asking a staff member to book a restaurant for me and the next day they gave me a cake candles and all which was a really lovely and unexpected touch. I had two treatments at the spa which is beautiful and has resort prices to match but well worth one massage at least so you can use the jacuzzi and sauna. Loved the bathrobes and slippers they provided at the spa. The hotel also has a gym which they didn't mention on their website which is basic but is everything you need for a holiday work out. They also have free yoga classes and Balinese dancing lessons on specific days yoga in the sunset was nice. Wednesday night seafood Buffett is not to be missed so cheap and so tasty. Now the things that I can fault are petty but here goes... Mix up on arrival with our breakfast inclusion due to booking a discounted room via hotels.com they thought it was not included this was fixed and we got our breakfast included. Treadmill in gym cuts out must short circuit or something annoying if your half way through a work out (first world problem) staff come quickly to fix and reset if called. Small minor cosmetic flaws through out cracks paintwork ect which you expect to find in the humidity. We checked out the discovery hotel in Kuta and I'm so glad we stayed at the Seminyak as its smaller and much more personal with the the frills will stay again if I get the chance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3088,fabulous hotel,50,October 2012,"WE stayed at The Seminyak for a week from 27th October 2012 and just fell in love with the whole place - the staff were wonderful and especially the manager Dwi Antara he was great to all the guests staying at the hotel.
We stayed in a Beach Wing room and it was just beautiful really spacious - the bathroom had a wonderful bath, great shower and a glass window/wall bathroom and the bedroom, the balcony was great also.
The breakfast was great lots of variety but would like the area to have more overhead fans working. The infinity pool was wonderful and the actual beach is right infront of the infinity pool and my husband took advantage of swimming in that whenever we were at the pool.
Would highly recommend this fabulous hotel/resort to anyone who wants to experience one of the best Bali resorts and oh so convenient to shopping and other restaurants - literally 5 minutes walk only - right next door to Ku De Ta.
will definately stay here on our next visit to Bali. Maureen+Herb",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3089,Very relaxing,40,November 2012,The pool villas are definately the way to go pure luxury. Breakfast by the pool reading the daily paper what could be better.We would stay again all round quality for money. The rooms are large with a bathroom you could get lost in .,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3090,Terrific,40,January 2012,"We stayed here for a 10 day break in a beach front room, very decent size and the bath is a bonus. We love the position of this resort. Service levels were very high. Pool areas were terrific. Gym was good, but a little small. This resort suited us.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3091,Beautiful Hotel.,50,October 2012,"The Hotel grounds and gardens were lovely and the staff were most helpful.
Very large rooms which were kept clean and the serve was great.

We will be back soon.

3092,"Stunning hotel, excellent service, fantastic location!",50,November 2012,"This hotel definitely has the ""WOW"" factor and is unquestionably the jewel in the crown in Seminyak!
We spent 6 glorious nights here and we didn't want to leave.
The beach suite was spacious and modern, has a very comfortable king size bed, superb bathroom with a variety of amenities and the blockout curtains were a dream! We were in room 3105 on the ground floor.
Breakfast was delicious with a huge variety of food from eggs made any way you wish to crepes, pancakes, fruit, cereals, salmon, cheeses, meats, asian food and lots more! The service is excellent and the staff can't do enough to please.
The infinity pool is absolutely magnificent! There are plenty of comfortable sun lounges around the pool and the view to the beach is breathtaking! There is also another pool with a swim up bar and surrounding this pool are cabanas and tables and chairs.
It was magical watching the sunset from the pool area!
Ku De Ta is next door to The Seminyak and when booking a room make sure to ask for one on the opposite side due to the loud music that can be heard until 3am.
The location is perfect! Only a 5 minute walk to Oberoi St where you will find beautiful boutiques, a great market and many wonderful restaurants.
Also walking distance to my favourite restaurant La Lucciola!
We will definitely be back next year and we're going to bring our friends as well!
Thank you for making our holiday so relaxing and enjoyable!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3093,Nice place - just stay in the main part of the hotel,40,November 2012,"Nice hotel with super friendly staff ..... Good rooms - large with a really comfortable bed and nice bathroom
I stayed in a Garden Room without realising it is out of the main hotel and across the road! Not too much of an issue but makes it feel you're staying in another hotel having to keep crossing the road to get to the main part of the hotel; if you're going to stay here I would recommend paying a little extra and staying in the main part of the hotel
Really nice infinity pool right on the beach.........lovely spot to lay back and catch those rays!
Hotel is in a great spot but worth hiring mopeds to get around...... Tiny gym but an excellent (if pricey by Bali standards) spa.....
Just wish they'd turn off the highly irritating piped music - or change the record!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3094,Paradise,40,October 2012,"Well done Seminyak Beach Resort. You made my honeymoon what it was. Keep up the good work.

The breakfast was a delicious buffet, the staff were always always smiley and polite and the rooms were spacious and comfortable.

The wifi is not great though. It doesn't work very well in the bedroom but it does however work very well by the pool.

The location is perfect - right on the beach and near very nice restaurants.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3095,I slept like a rock,40,October 2012,"I arrived to the hotel soooo tired and ready for my holiday and the staff recognized my exhaustion immediately and were attentive and prepared to assist me in getting to my room as soon as possible. I love their uniforms too (odd mention I know but the branding here was well done).

The room was perfect, comfortable and the sounds of crashing waves filled my ears from my room.

The spa was the best I have experienced to date for a beach resort. ALL the staff were pleasant, kind and attentive to my request for a treatment that would help me sleep and relax with the short time that I would stay there. OMG after I left the spa I had the toughest time staying awake. I immediately fell into my holiday ready to see and do it all after that!

ALL of my special requests were met professionally, eagerly with great presentation. Thank you to ALL the staff here for a great and relaxing mini holiday!! I hope to return soon. Great first Bali visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3096,Still amazing!,50,October 2012,"I'm not sure about the negative reviews on the hotel. You do get what you pay for and this place is worth a few extra dollars for 5 star surrounds!

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in October after staying here in May last year (back then it still was not competed). We still loved it and would go back again when we are next in Bali.

The rooms are great (beach wing) - clean and modern. We had a great room with a view of the ocean, manicured gardens and pool area.

Besides the hotel now being complete, the only real difference from the last time we stayed is the breakfast. It is now buffet rather than a la carte. Breakfast has a good variety of foods and there is an egg and pancake station.

I agree with some of the expensive comments, but only in regards to the drinks. Sure, the drinks at the bar near the pool can be expensive for Bali standards, but its a hotel, so if you want cheap drinks you need to go outside! Having said this, it is a lovely spot to watch the sun set without too much distraction.

The pool is definitely the highlight of the hotel... Just beautiful! Also, there doesn't seem to be too many kids if this is what you are after.

Finally, the staff are friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back for a third visit.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3097,5 Stars all round,50,October 2012,"This property ticked all the boxes for us. We have stayed in many places in Bali - in Villas and hotels in the Nusa Dua, Legian and Seminyak areas. Seminyak has the best beach and is close to good shopping and restaurants so The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa is perfectly positioned. The staff are well informed, attentive, polite and helpful. The breakfast was by far the best breakfast we have ever had in a hotel. A change every day made to the hot food choices - seafood one day, chicken the next and vegetarians are well catered for. The room we had was very close to the beach and the pool areas. It was large and very modern (although a little dark in the entrance where the cupboards and drawers were located). The bed was a luxurious king size and built for comfort. However, the highlight of this hotel were the pools. Both were built as close to the beach as were possible, they are long enough to lap swim and have the infinity pool edging. There is a separate pool surrounded by gazebo type day beds which you could secure an afternoon read and snooze which also included a swim up bar for those who like that. All in all, I would highly recommend a stay at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa to anyone - and indulge yourself in a treatment at the spa - it is well worth it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3098,Not recommended,10,October 2012,"As you can probably see from other reviews, this place is a ripoff. I have stayed at over 20 hotels in Bali, and I would never go back to this place. It is well located in Seminyak, however, my stay was filled with problems: 1. I booked 2 rooms on Expedia. Showed up and they only had a reservation for one. After e-mailing the confirmation to the hotel manager upon their request, they sorted the second reservation, but told me we could not check-in until 6PM (posted check-in time is at 2). I told them this was unacceptable. They went away and came back to say that although we had booked garden view rooms, ocean view rooms were available and tried to upsell me for $50 more per room. I told them that that was unacceptable as I was not paying more due to their error. They went away again and came back offering a single hospitality suite to bridge the gap, which I had to ask my colleague to leave so I could shower up and change, after which I did the same for him. 2. After dealing with the inconvenience of moving from the hospitality room to our rooms, and waiting a very long time for our luggage, we checked-in only to find that the garden rooms were across a busy street from the main resort. This was very inconvenient and quite second-class as the beach and nice pools are in the main hotel area on the other side of the street. 3. After a decent sleep in a nice bed and decent room, I tried to have a bath and then a shower, which after 20 minutes of trying produced no hot water at all. When I met my colleague to go to the gym, he reported the same problem. 4. The gym itself is a closet, with hardly any equipment (one treadmill). The treadmill was not turned on and there was no attendant in the gym, and after 2 minutes of trying, I finally got the treadmill to power up. When I was about to get on and use it, I realized that the seat from the weight machine was one finger width from the edge of the treadmill. This would either have had me kicking anyone using the weight machine directly in the back of the head, or likely seriously injuring me if I ran anywhere near the back end of the belt. 5. When I spoke to the hotel manager and raised these issues, the best he would do for me was cover our breakfasts, but did not take off the price of one of the rooms like I asked. When I informed him that I was moving to a different hotel, he also offered to provide us with free transport and did apologize, however, although he and all staff we encountered were extremely gracious and friendly, they were not empowered to fix the numerous problems we encountered at this property in any acceptable fashion. There are WAY better places to stay in Bali than this hotel, and at the price, it is completely unacceptable for what you get and the issues you will likely encounter. You could easily find a well situated villa in the area that would be a far better value.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3099,"Beautiful resort, well worth paying a little extra for a Deluxe Overview room",40,October 2012,"We stayed for 4 nights for my birthday and really enjoyed the experience. I'm so pleased I booked the Deluxe Oceanview Room, based on other reviews it was definitely worth paying a little extra for it. Our room was beautiful with a great view of the ocean, tropical garden and pool. Beautiful bathroom with amazing bath and good amenities. No need to bring your hairdryer, toothbrush & paste, shampoo & conditioner, nor mositurizer... all provided and all great quality (and I'm a fussy traveller!). Comfortable bed, good pillows too. Buffet breakfast was really good and lots of choice. You definitely need to ensure breakfast is included when booking. The only downside was the average tasting plunger coffee, I didn't realise I could have ordered a latte or flat white (complimentary) until the last day! Also waited forever for my poached eggs to arrive. They need some pre-cooked poached or scrambled eggs on the buffet. Wait staff were attentive and often too attentive forever collecting our plates when we just wanted quiet and privacy. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful pools and more spectacular looking then the nearby Samaya, Oberoi, and The Legian Hotels. I would stay again. For this stay it was just my husband and I but I know my children would love the pools and easy walk to the beach and shops.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3100,Not worth the money,20,October 2012,"This Hotel is grossly overpriced for what it offers. We checked in to be told there were no rooms available with a king bed. When I stood firm on not accepting anything less, one materialised within10 minutes.

The hotel is in a great location as it is right on the beach that is if you pay for a beach room as garden rooms are across the road. Not much else lives up to the 5 stars that it is claiming. There are far better hotels in Bali for the price.

Room are large but dark and woodwork is bashed around, it claims to be a new hotel but there is nothing new about it. Breakfast is good but service needs to be improved there is far too much hovering waiting for you to finish your last bite and then pouncing to remove your plate.

Pool are is OK, although the statues are a bit dated.

What was most frustrating is that at 7am each and every morning garden staff were outside our window with their noisy rakes scratching the paths, which woke us up like clockwork.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3101,Very disappointed,20,September 2012,"While the resort was fine although a bit expensive I was very disappointed to be told when we arrived the King Bedroom we had booked was not available and thus were given a twin room. Considering we booked well in advance and I had actually been in direct contact with the hotel I was furious they did not advise us of this in advance as we would have stayed elsewhere.
I recommend The Padma at Legian where I have stayed several times (and definitely will next time!)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3102,"Lovely Resort, Great Location",40,September 2012,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Seminyak. We arranged airport transfers before we left Sydney and there was someone waiting for us when we arrived. The check in process was quick and we were shown to our lovely room quickly. I had read previous reviews that advised that garden rooms were across the road and therefore we booked a beach side room. The back patio of our room opened up to the resort and a short walk to the pool and beach. The resort was quiet and the grounds were lovely and meticulously maintained by a friendly team of garden workers. I couldn‚Äôt hear any traffic noise from our room which has been mentioned in previous reviews. I loved the free wi-fi. Every hotel should provide free wi-fi!
The buffet breakfast was excellent (the earlier you go, the better service you get- after 9am the service was a little patchy because the staff were so busy catering to the rush). We also had room service delivered on a few occasions which was really tasty and we also went to a ‚ÄòSunset BBQ‚Äô dinner at the hotel which was really enjoyable. Great views over the beach with a band for entertainment and really good food. The staff at the dinner were lovely and very helpful and the hotel went to a great effort to decorate the area where the dinner was held- it looked great!
Staff at the front desk were very helpful in making dinner reservations at local restaurants and helping me to book at tour that I wanted to do. The spa was lovely and I enjoyed two massages there- one that finished with a relaxing bath- lovely! The housekeeping staff were great too. Leaving ‚Äòtowel animals‚Äô on our bed and also they found money we had lost under a chair and kindly returned it to the bedside with a note to us. The hotel also left a Wedding Anniversary cake in our room which was very much appreciated and enjoyed.
The staff were also great in allowing us to use the showers in the spa area to freshen up before our very late flight. We checked out of our room at 12pm and spent the day at the pool, before using the showers at about 6:30pm before heading out to dinner.
Overall we had a great experience at The Seminyak. The resort is in an excellent location in walking distance to many restaurants and the beach front infinity pool was the highlight. Easy to enjoy the days in the pool, watching everything that is happening on the beach‚Ä¶. You can even buy a sarong or a hat over the edge from the cool comfort of the pool!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3103,what beach!!!!,30,October 2012,"View from my balcony.....busy street which we have to walk down to get breakfast!!! We're not even in the hotel but 100 metres up and across the road (light sleepers beware)The hotel may be 5 star but this annex is only 3 star(and NO beach within sight)
Being driven up the road on the back of a golf buggie was NOT the highlight either.....",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3104,"For their price, it's quite standard, but very nice and helpful staff though.",30,December 2011,"I was travelling solo to Bali, and decided to stay at The Seminyak in December 2011. It‚Äôd been only opening for six months, said one of the hotel staffs to me, when I asked him, why a taxi driver from a well-known taxi company didn‚Äôt know where The Seminyak hotel was. The thing about Bali, you can always count on taxi driver to take you back to your hotel, even if you forget your hotel street name, just mention your hotel name to your taxi driver. Usually it applied to a big hotel, and I was assuming that The Seminyak is already well known.
Anyway, what I love about this hotel, is because it‚Äôs located right in the heart of Seminyak, at Kayu Aya Street, there are many upscale boutiques and restaurants along the street. Some are very expensive for local tourist, and some has moderately fair price. The boutiques and the restaurants are just in walking distance from this hotel.
The second I love the most about this hotel is, because they have a huge infinity pools, and they have two. Large and not so large, choose whichever suits you the most. With Seminyak beach lies in front of you, it could have been a beautiful view I‚Äôm sure if I didn‚Äôt come in December. It was rainy season, and the weather is unpredictable. Storm, rain, and windy, it could drive you up the wall if you are trying to work on your tan.
However, the hotels staffs were very helpful, and very nice, they would practically cater to your needs patiently with smile, and sincerity. They probably remember every guest name, because every time, I chatted up with them or met them the hallway, they know my name, and I only stay for four days.
The third thing I love the most, is their breakfast, and coming from a non breakfast person this is really a good review. I could eat almost everything their chef cooked, they had everything, from salmon to lamb, for breakfast! And for the omelet, it‚Äôs probably the best breakfast omelet ever.
There are some little bungalows in their garden for you and your family/friends to chill, waiting for sunset.
The rooms itself has standard d√©cor, typical room you will expect and will get from a hotel if you spend more than US$ 300 per night. It‚Äôs very comfortable though, and there was a free wifi in the bedroom, but due to stormy weather, the wifi connection did not work for almost a day, the hotel staff said, it‚Äôd been struck by the lightening. And speaking of rainy season, the sound of the rambling thunder had successfully waken me up few times, so I couldn‚Äôt fully enjoy their super comfy bed. It‚Äôs almost like the thunder happened inside my room, and I could also hear the sound of the wind blowing. Very noisy.
On their website, they say the room I‚Äôd booked had ocean view. It didn‚Äôt, I can still the sea from my balcony, yes, they have quite spacious balcony, with chairs and table, but I have to turn your head first, because as it turned out the room is in the wing section. The website has the ambiguity meaning regarding their rooms that looking to the ocean.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3105,Beautiful Hotel but where is Management,40,September 2012,"We initially tried to get in to The Legian next door but were unable to secure 2 rooms as requested. We stayed there last year and found it to be excellent. We have been to Bali many, many times and thought we would try this new hotel as we always stay in the Seminyak area and liked its location on the beach. Although set in beautiful surroundings and equipped with good facilities, this hotel is running like a ship without a Captain. The staff are beautiful, friendly people who try to do the right thing but need more direction than they are given to bring the operation up to 5 star standard. Not once were we offered a drink voluntarily by staff while sitting by the pool, twice there were no pool towels because they had run out and when ordering lunch in the pool restaurant they had to bring us a list of the wines they did have because so many were not in stock. Cold beer by the pool was almost impossible to obtain and the local beer Bintang was not available. All of these things could be corrected very easily and it is a shame that management are not paying a more active role in the hotels operation. At this stage we will not being staying there again as there are better options available in the same price bracket.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3106,Jacuzzi heaven!,40,September 2012,"We recently stayed at The Seminyak resort and spa and had a fairly good experience. We had booked online after reading some great reviews on trip advisor and were warmly greeted by all the staff on our arrival, given a frangipani lay and a delicious drink. As we were checking in we were informed that our room was across the road as you can imagine as we're less than impressed as there was no mention of their being two parts to the building and for the price we were paying we'd rather stay somewhere else. However, we upgraded our room and all was well. We had a suite and it was amazing! The jacuzzi looking out over the ocean with bifold windows that open for an amazing view was definitely a highlight. The balcony had a fantastic view and the room was very spacious and comfortable. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and the block out curtains meant we could sleep in. The resort is so lovely you want to go out and see it! Its in s great location close to great restaurants, bars and shopping. Only a couple of negative comments on areas that could be improved; the cabanas say that you reserve them and you receive complimentary water, towels and an intercom so you can order food etc. when we asked to book one no one knew how to book them and it was more first in first served (which is fine) when we did get a cabana there was no water no intercom and we had to go searching for towels. The pool bar insists on playing horrible dance and top chart music extremely loud right near all the cabanas where guests were trying to read and relax. When our room was serviced they did not replace any of our water so we could brush our teeth. Also outside the suites there is a traffic attendant who is constantly blowing his whistle so loud you can hear it in the room 3 floors up with the doors closed.  Our checkout was extremely painful and time consuming. All minor things however, when you are paying the big $$ to stay somewhere it's the little things that count. Usually we stay at the Conrad and not much there is ever overlooked. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3107,Best hotel!,50,August 2012,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in august and really enjoyed it. Our rooms location couldnt have been better, the doors at the back of our room opened right up to the most amazing ocean views, and we were right next to the pool.

The room was luxurious, and the bed super comfy. They also have a pillow menu! There was a great big range of nice complementery bathroom products as well! (also 4 complementery bottels of water daily)

Location of the hotel was great, just a short walk to seminyak square where you will find some of bali's best shopping and not as many hawkers and people hasseling you.. Also up seminyak square there are loads of nice restaurants.

Staff at the hotel were all lovely and helpful. Breakfast was awesome, they have absolutly everything you could ever want for brekkie and more!

The hotel is Right next to ku de ta and not far from potato head. There is also a mini mart accross the road.

Overall a fabulous place to stay and definitley worth the $$&.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3108,Beach Magic,50,June 2012,"In June 2012 my wife and I stayed in the newly completed The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, where we had stayed previously when the old Resor Seminyak was on the site. What a difference! The new resort is beautiful because it has retained the feel of Bali and has maximised the views of the ocean for most of the rooms. There's a beautiful ""infinity"" pool and lovely gardens and the breakfasts were excellent. The staff were fabulous and the service was impeccable. Fantastic location next door to Ku De Ta and a short taxi ride to Potato Head, The Living Room and W. We were fortunate to receive an upgrade to a suite and the room was huge with a full size jacuzzi. We loved every minute of our 5 days there. Definitely returning in 2013, though it is a bit expensive at approx US$360/night. Well worth the money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3109,Wonderful & relaxing break - highly recommended!,50,August 2012,"The Trip Advisor provided good guidelines and feedback from other travellers. Based on this information, we have booked the beach room instead of the garden wing room. It was a good decision because for appro extra $80 we got the best room possible, directly on the beach. The hotel is in a great location, north part of Semenyak, right next to the Oberoi Hotel and the famous Legian Hotel away from the crowded Kuta.

The room was large and clean with comfortable beds and crisp white sheets. Large marble bathroom with a free standing bath tub. The breakfast was included in the tariff and served in lovely surroundings. The infinity pool setting was idyllic. Make sure you get there early to secure your sun bed .

We did not eat in the hotel as there were so many tempting cheaper options outside the hotel but we had lunch by the pool and it was tasty and quite reasonably priced. The food overall is cheap in Bali but alcohol is expensive, especially wine. Bottle of the most ordinary Australian or Californian wine can cost $80!

The staff were eager to help and their response was quick and courteous. I was very grateful for a late check out offered by the hotel as my flight back to Australia did not depart until mid night.

Don‚Äôt forget to have a cocktail and watch the sunset in the Ku de Ta bar, right next to the hotel. It is an interesting place where people come to be seen! Potato Head is another great place for cocktails, about 5 minutes by taxi. Dinner at the Breeze Restaurant in the Samaya Hotel (walking distance ‚Äì next to the Legion) is unforgettable.

We will be returning to this part of the world. Thank you Seminyak Beach and Resort for wonderful 6 days.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3110,Judith.C.,50,August 2012,"Unlike Luciana m , the moment we arrived everything was perfect..the staff from the management down could not do enough for us,when ever we went to restaraunts they offered their transport and then would pick us up when we wanted to return to the hotel.The rooms were perfect with outstanding views.We have visited Bali at least 11 times wher we have stayed at the Oberoi in Seminyak and also Oberoi Lombok ,The Anantara and others and we would rate the Seminyak as one of the best. We will definately return",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3111,Great place to stay - highly recommended,50,August 2012,"Really enjoyed our recent stay at the Seminyak Beach Resort. I travelled with a friend and our room was lovely (Garden Wing Room) and well appointed, twin beds large and very comfortable, bathroom beautiful with a great tub for soaking, staff very friendly and welcoming, breakfast amazing (try heating the chocolate croissants in the toaster!) and the infinity pool by the beach so incredibly relaxing. Wished we were staying longer!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3112,"Great location, beautiful resort & great service",50,August 2012,"Upon arrival we were welcomed with a lei of fresh frangipinis.
We stayed accross the road from the main hotel in the garden rooms with the option of a pool outside.
The room was luxurious, with a stunning bathroom & beautiful balinese furniture & touches throughout the room. Turn down service was great, even laying our frangipini leis in heart shapes on our pillows!
The bed & pillows were comfortable, lighting a bit dim especially when trying to find something in your luggage at night, apart from that beautiful room.

The security guards were great, would stop traffic when we wanted to cross to the hotel.
Our first night we had a seafood buffet dinner, beautiful setting overlooking the beach. They had a 3 peice band which added to the atmosphere was great.
The staff gave amazing service the food was fresh & delicious.

The main pool overlooks the stunning beach, lots of loungers & staff available if you need a towell or want to order food or drink.. the view at sunset is just amazing.
(it looks exactly like the pictures on their website!)

Breakfast was amazing, great range of food for every taste.
The service each day from everyone who worked in the resort was lovely & genuine except for our last encounter, the lady upon checkout.

Before checking out we phoned reception & asked for a statement for our bill. Upon checkout she showed us a different bill charged for 3 drinks we didn't consume. She was quite rude when we were explaining to her that we had placed their drinks along the outside (as we stored our own juice & water in the fridge) & maybe housekeeping did not see this? It was quite confusing as we had just been given a bill that didnt include the so called drinks.
We were persistent in saying we werent going to pay for something we didnt consume, she phoned house keeping & then it was scrapped off the bill.
The way she spoke to us was very rude & was a dissapointing exit after such a faultless stay.

The beach was nice, white sand, (compared to Legian where we also stayed), not hassled as much, not as much beach sellers.

Taxis are everywhere, choose bluebird, they have metres & are really cheap.
Seminyak square was 2 min drive from the resort, lots of restaurants, markets & a mini supermarket down the end which has everyhting you need, above this is a restaurant called VIAVO which had beautiful food & reasonable prices, beautiful view at night.

Great shopping (night shopping too) & restaurants 5 mins taxi ride..

Definately take a trip to Carrefore (sunset rd), its in a 3 story shopping complex which has a range of shops, a food court & the carrefore which is a supermarket, clothing store & house appliances store all in one! There is also a chemist by the carrefore.

I dont recommend this resort for families with small children as it doesnt have a kids club & the pool is more of an adults pool.
This resort is a 5 star beautiful stay, great for couples you will not be dissapointed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3113,Amazing end to our vacation,50,August 2012,"Spent the last two nights of our honeymoon here and have to say they made it a memorable ending! The staff are so nice, the service attentive and genuine. Breakfast has EVERYTHING. They think of everything you could ever want, and are one step ahead.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3114,Nice Hotel with rude receptionist.,20,August 2012,"I'm indonesian who already spent most of my years in the US. So I spoke Indonesian well. I stayed 15days in bali, and spent 3 nights in this hotel, after my stay at W. The hotel was actually nice with the beach access. Down to earth and simple concept. My only concern is actually with the hotel staffs.

The pool was actually too small to accommodate their guests. They served ice water. But I prefer a clean bottled mineral water like any other 5 star resort. The room was almost nothing to be complained, the water heater work well, just the fridge was not cold enough. The bed was comfortable and the linen are fine. Turn down service is there, house keeping very polite, but I face some issues while I was there.

I was visiting one of the boutique there, when I need to call my husband in our room to come and check on the dress I'm trying, I asked the boutique staff to help me call our room, he didn't pick up, then I called the hotel operator, speaking in Indonesian asked her to call my husband mobile, and before I told her to bill it to my room, the operator shouted me ""Do you know it's expensive to call out? Are you stupid or what?"" I was shocked and stunned for a few second before I tell her in english, ""I'm one of the guest from room 101x."" Then she said rudely ""apa lagi sok sok jadi tamu"" (what now, acting that you're guests?) then she hung off. I told the boutique staff, then they were the one apologize to me. I just wonder if this is how they treat each other in this hotel.

And the spa, it was beautiful, so beautiful I really want to get close and see if it's a wallpaper or it's a painting, and when my fingers almost touch the wall, the spa reception said ""please don't touch it!"" I asked her ""why?"" She didn't answer me, she just walk away to show me the spa room. She showed her rude proud face and I canceled the spa straight away. She don't deserve my money, she was so young and rude.

There is a day, I was sitting in front of the reception, waited for my husband asking for some information. I overheard a lady being scolded and screamed out of no reason by the female reception and it really catches my attention when the lady talked back and said ""can't you speak nicely? I only asked you a thing"" And then the other male staff, told her ""what is wrong with you? Why can't you speak nicely?""

And it's really shameful to see a lady reception in a public area screaming to others, in front a lot of guests. I wonder, if they go for a training? and this lady reception don't even worth the job.
I like the resort, it was nice and down to earth. But I'm not coming back, because I'm Indonesian, and I was treated differently here just because I hold Indonesian passport.

I bet the owner who are probably expat need to learn how to train their staff to be more respectful to others.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3115,"Great hotel, wonderful staff",50,July 2012,"My husband and I stayed at The Seminyak, for the second time, in July, and once again we had a wonderful time. We stayed in one of the beautiful suites on the third floor and had amazing views of the sea and the gorgeous sunsets each night. Breakfast was everything we wanted, and the staff that served us each morning were very professional and very friendly, always a happy smile.
Unfortunately due to an illness of a close relative back at home we had to cut our holiday short, and we can't thank the staff enough for your concern and helpfulness. Thank you so much Mr Dwi and all of the front desk staff for your compassion and friendship.
We look forward to seeing you all again in October!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3116,Best Hotel!,50,July 2012,"Really good location, its next to kudeta and within walking distance to shopping area in seminyak. Also there are a lot of nice restaurant around. The hotel it self is very comfy with a nice beach view. Easy access to beach and a nice pool. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Its a really great experience. We stayed at the suite and there is also free wifi. The breakfast buffet is also very delicious, especially its pancake. thumbs up! prob the best hotel i ever stayed at. Too comfortable, i just want to stay at the hotel all day long.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3117,Very good location..,40,June 2012,"Overall, it was great. The room was modern, clean and stylish. A little worn in places (a light fitting hanging from a ceiling wasn't attractive). It has decent, if a little inconsistent, wi-fi access that was free. A comfy, huge bed. A great shower. Decent information on local interests in the area.

The resort was beautiful with its landscaping, restaurant (we had breakfast there everyday and lunch there occassionally), pools (even though there was some tile maintenance needed in one or two places) and decor. The gym, while small, was great. All new equipment, tv, free water and towels.

The staff were friendly, happy and always remembered your name and details once they heard it. Very nice. Helpful too! We had concerns with our transfer to the next place we were staying at but they were happy to call them let us know the results. Very kind and knowledgeable.

The location was great in some ways and bad in others. There are some AMAZING restaurants in the area - big, small, modern and traditional. You have a lot of choice! Shopping is good too. Better than other areas we went - not so much pushy saleperson... There is also a great convenience store just down the road.

But the beach, while beautiful, had hawkers pretty much from 9am to 7pm and later. Most of the time they are fine with a polite smile and a 'no thank you', but some are quite persistent. I'm not comfortable with this myself but if you are okay with this go for it. I did meet a nice guy who sold watches on the beach, Billy. I ended up buying a watch from him on our last day at the resort. Not because I liked the watch but because Billy had been a gentleman in his approach with us.

We walked every morning and most afternoons along the beach. In some areas it was quite dirty. Such a beautiful beach with rubbish on it in areas. However, the surf looked good (I stayed to the pool) and it was always busy in the afternoon/early evening as the sun went down. (Especially with the local boys playing a game of soccer on the beach.

The resort did offer free shuttle services to other areas and these journeys made be appreciate the resort and the Seminyak area even more.

I would definitely recommend this place to someone who hasn't been to Bali before. If you haven't travelled much or prefer a few comforts this place caters to you perfectly. :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3118,AMAZING,50,July 2012,"From the moment we stepped out of our car we knew we were somewhere very special. Stunning entrance, greeted by the most pleasant staff. Check in was an absolute breeze. We were then taken to our 2 bedroom Villa and just said ""WOW"" and we didn't stop saying this the whole time we were there. The staff were truly amazing, so friendly, helpful, polite and remembered our names from word go.The Villa was just gorgeous, 2 huge rooms, incredible pools, stunning living areas, beds heaven. The main pool superb, the spa so indulgent, the sunset beautiful, the food delicious, especially the breakfasts, the grounds immaculate - we just didn't want to leave. We were treated as if we were the only ones there - AMAZING. I can only say do yourself a favour and book NOW you will never want to leave. I wanted to bring the staff and the whole place back with me in my suitcase. Very Satisfied!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3119,Great hotel!,40,July 2012,"Fantastic hotel would definitely recommend this hotel, it's on the beach, great service good all round hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3120,Excellent hotel on Seminyak Beach without the pretention or price tag of some of the others,50,July 2012,"Stayed in a beach wing room here for 5 nights and really enjoyed this hotel. Staff were friendly, always smiling and extremely helpful and really made it so pleasant to stay here. The location is fantastic on Seminyak Beach and close to Seminyak Square.

The room was ground floor and huge, with a lovely outdoor terrace with lounge overlooking the beautifully landscaped gardens. The room decor was a combination of modern and more traditional Balinese. A full compliment of toiletries were available in the bathroom.

Breakfast consisted of a buffet with plenty of choice and eggs made to order. Had a couple of lunches by the pool and they were good too - especially recommend the sate sticks served on a little coal grill.

Cons: While the beachfront pool is beautiful, there are not a huge number of lounges. Guests tend go to the pool early in the morning and reserve lounges and then disappear for 2 or 3 hours. I think the hotel needs to more proactively monitor this and remove belongings if lounges are left unattended for more than an hour. Also, I could hear quite a bit of traffic noise from the room in the beach wing. While you do get used to this, if you are a very light sleeper it could be bothersome.

Compared to a stay at the W Hotel last year, I much preferred The Seminyak. The latter may not be as fancy but the customer service is far superior.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3121,Impressive all round,50,July 2012,"The facilities rooms gardens and pools are all 1st class. Staff always smiling and never hesitate to help, guards are also great, if you pull up in a taxi they come right over and stand there so the taxi wont do the wrong thing rhen stop traffic if you need to cross the road. All the best places to eat are close and there is no crowded sreets full of guys trying to sell stuff and no yobs either. We were there with teenage children and felt very safe.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3122,Very Relaxing,50,October 2011,"Loved our stay, new, clean, happy staff and very relaxing. Resort was luxurious, loved the endless pool that extended to the beach view. Will be back, might try a villa next time.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3123,Great option if you‚Äôre looking for a resort experience.,40,January 2012,"We stayed around New Year‚Äôs, one night in a 1 bedroom villa and other nights in a standard (1 King) room. The property is lovely; the staff professional and courteous. The oceanfront villa was stunning. The standard room was very nice. The food was fine. The fitness center, sadly, was a bit lacking; it was far too small for such a large property. All that said, if you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable resort experience, this is a great choice. It felt, to me, however, a bit too much like I could have been on a resort anywhere in the world. I‚Äôd stay again if I just wanted posh pool time and the like; I‚Äôd probably choose something else (and probably in a different town than Seminyak) if I wanted to experience more Balinese culture.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3124,Absolute heaven!,40,June 2012,"My partner and I stayed at the Seminyak for a week and couldn't have been happier. The room was magnificent and the hotel itself was beautiful with a very luxurious feel. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The staff in particular were very helpful, polite and attentive. They catered to any and all requests we had including booking restaurants, spa treatments, transport etc. The breakfast buffet each morning was delicious and we had room service one day which was yum! Our only disappointment was that it lacked a bit of atmosphere in the evenings and also around the pool bar. This was not a major problem of course. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would happily recommend it.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3125,Divine!,50,June 2012,"Situated on Seminyak Beach, new, friendly and eager to please. Can't wait to return. This time with our children ranging from 10 to 17. Rooms had everything you could want. LOVED the free wifi poolside and in your room - everywhere! Walking distance to great restaurants. No bogans around here. It is high end Bali. Highly recommend this place.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3126,Gorgeous place to relax.,40,May 2012,"A friend and I needed a desperate break from the kids, and decided to go to The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. We were thrilled with our choice.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were helpful and courteous. We had requested a twin share room but had been allocated a King size bed. This was rectified within 15 minutes while we had a drink at the bar.

The room itself was spacious, clean and modern. The beds were generous and comfortable. The turn down service was a pleasant surprise.

We spent our days lounging by the pools in the cabanas and heading out for massages. Most of the time we had the pool (the one with the pool bar) to ourselves. We realised most people were cramming around the gorgeous infinity edge pool, but that was in full sun, whereas we enjoyed the peace and shade of the lagoon pool.

We ate our dinner sitting in the pool a couple of nights, and the staff were happy to pour the french champagne we had bought duty free for the price of a small corkage. Unlike other hotels, we were able to stay in the pool until quite late at night - and were surprised that we were the only ones in there.

The breakfast was really lovely. A good variety on the buffet as well as ala carte choices. We normally didn't eat lunch because we were so full of breakfast. We had dinner in the hotel a few times, a couple of times from the bar menu whilst we were in the water, and once at the restaurant. The food was good - not amazing, but good. It would have been nice to see more traditional Balinese dishes available.

We were here to relax so we didn't go out much, but we did wander a few hundred metres down the beach to Ku De Ta once and have a drink. Given that we could see the sunset from our own pool, we decided it wasn't necessary to go again. The hotel is close to all the restaurants everyone told us about, but we were too lazy to go.

The holiday finished with a lovely positive note as I had an evening flight, and the staff were happily able to let me have my room with no charge until 5pm. This meant I was able to swim, snooze and relax for once last day.

I would definitely return here when on my next childfree holiday. Probably not the best place to bring kids. There were a few around, but it didn't really have the facilities for them as other hotels do.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3127,Best service ever!,50,June 2012,"The service at The Seminyak was the best I have ever experienced in my travels through Bali and beyond. The team were delightful and nothing was too much. They surprised me with a birthday cake - they noticed my birth date on my passport when we checked in - exceptional attention to detail! To add to our great stay, breakfast was delicious and fresh, the hotel facilities were immaculate (especially the pool) and the Bintang cold. What more could you want? Will definitley be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3128,Great service,50,June 2012,"We didn't stay here but we attended a wedding at this hotel and I wanted to write a review after we received excellent service. We came in a taxi and after we had got out and started walking up to the lobby I realised I had left our SLR camera in the taxi!! I was mortified and ran down to the road, but the taxi had gone. I was beside myself, sure we would never see the camera again. The security staff had luckily written down the taxi number (WOW - I couldn't believe this) and so one of the staff reassured me not to worry and phoned the taxi company (Bluebird). He sent me into the hotel where the other wedding guests were and assured me he would deal with it. Within 5 minutes the staff member (I wish I could remember his name) walked over to me with my camera in his hand! I was so happy I went to hug him which he was most awkward about :) The rest of the service we received at the wedding was also excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3129,Location/pool and staff are great,40,June 2012,"I read the reviews on trip advisor and thought we would give this hotel a try. As I have read I found the location brilliant. The photo of the infinity pool on the beach is exactly as you see it and there is a lot of restaurants literally 5 minutes walk away although it does get hard to tear yourself away from the sun loungers around the pool. We found all the staff members friendly and smiling. Someone on one of these reviews complained about the level of English. Most staff speak good English especially on the front desk and some staff are not as proficient but if they have a problem understanding they will get someone who does, you are after all in a Indonesian speaking country. The rooms are contemporary and comfortable and we were upgraded to a suite on the 3rd floor, the bathroom was huge with a spa bath in front of the windows looking out across the sea. On arriving in the room I immediately walked onto the balcony and said to my husband "" it would be great to watch the sunset here with a glass of wine"", the porter heard me and within 5 minutes had returned with two comfy chairs and a table for the balcony.
One of the areas for improvement is the food. It's not terrible, its just not great and with so many places to eat so close to the hotel they will need to improve on this. The dining/bar area overlooking the ocean is just gorgeous at night, crashing waves and mood lighting in the trees, but I can't rave about the food. One other thing that bothered me was the gym, really tiny and only one treadmill. I like to workout in the morning on holidays so I can eat/drink my calories but if there is one person in the gym you would have to wait for the treadmill which is one of the most popular pieces of equipment.
Yes, I would stay here again (only the beach wing, as I don't want to stay across the road in the garden wing) as the staff and location make this hotel a good choice and I really believe they take the feedback of thier customers seriously and are doing what they can to enhance the experience.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3130,Perfect Location,50,May 2012,"My husband and I stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa on May 21 - 23. We found the staff to be very hospitable, and our room was very big and luxurious. The bathroom was one of the best I have ever stayed in. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and would suit all tastebuds as there was so much to choose from. Everything was so clean and the gardens werre beautiful.
The location of the hotel was perfect, my husband and I walked everywhere (there is also a free shuttle bus). We look forward to returning soon.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3131,Heaven!,50,May 2012,"This was my first trip to Bali & I can say that staying at The Seminyak was just divine. the Suite on the 3rd floor was lovely & spacious. The bed was heavenly & having a rain shower with the view of the ocean very relaxing. The people who made up the rooms daily made my daughters day by making towel animals & leaving her little surprises. The staff were attentive & very helpful with anything asked, nothing was too much. The grounds & pool area were stunning & the infinity pool was a great place to laze the day away. Not too far from Seminyak Square & the little market. The only two little things I noted was there wasn't too much shade for the kids and sometimes it was hard to find staff around the pool area when wanting to order something. Will definitely be back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3132,Excellent hotel in great location,50,May 2012,"My wife and I relocated to this hotel in May 2012 when we were unhappy with the place we had booked from Aus. About 12 months old so in excellent condition. We had a hotel room rather than a spa villa but walked out onto the pool with the beach just beyond. Staff fantastic without exception. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean is brilliant, so close in fact that at high tide some splashing into the pool occurs. The hotel is within easy walking distance to the Eat Street restaurants and the complimentary shuttle bus takes you to any other places in Seminyak. Food around the pool was good so it was a surprise that the restaurant was very queit at night. Maybe too much happening outside.
Highly recommended.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3133,Location Location,50,June 2011,"After researching on so many different hotels and finding that 5 star hotels in Seminyak are just as expensive as staying in a capital city in western countries, The Seminyak was offering a great rate for it's new premises.
The staff were attentive, coffee in any style you like with your breakfast, the pool was clean, pool bar even allowed you to design your own cocktails, the room was made every day with a new towel design and the sunset was beautiful.
The only improvement I would suggest are the standard of breakfast (the head chef needs to go tastes how the other top 5 star restaurants' breakfast taste like) but it's still filling to keep you energised for the day.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3134,Excellent Resort @ Seminyak Beach,50,May 2012,"At first I was a little worry about my choice booking The Seminyak Resort for my Holiday with my wife, my first choice was Anantara Resort or W Hotel. But due to the reasonably cheaper rate i go for The Seminyak.
Then it turned out to be our best resort experience @ The Seminyak Beach Resort.
When we first arrived we were welcomed and greeted with frangipani flower garland, cold towel and cold fruit punch. The check in process was smooth and quick. Everybody at the lobby were really polite and friendly.
The Beach Wing room was fabulous.. It was a newly refurbished room with new furnishings and 42' LCD TV and also JBL iPod docking. The bathroom also super nice with stand alone bath tub, separate shower and toilet space with its own glass door. There's a huge see through glass that separate bathroom and the bedroom which has a blinds to get more privacy.
The house keeping make up our room twice daily, where they put in new fresh towels, mineral water and also mosquito coils for the balcony even though there's no mosquito there anyway. they supply 6 bottles of mineral waters everyday!! so we dont have to buy extra water outside.
The hotel ground is not as big as 5 star resort at Nusa Dua, but it has a really beautiful landscape and has a couple bale for spa treatment or just relaxing in it. There's also a chapel and nice pond
The infinity pool also amazing, with direct view to the seminyak beach.
Every morning we always walk along the beach side for about 2-3 Km after having fabulous breakfast. we can see big beach side resorts, kudeta and others because there are no guardrail/fences between the hotels private beach.

All in all it was an excellent stay, even when we went to the next 5 star resort @Ubud we had a bit disappointment because our expectation already set to The Seminyak Resort standard.. :)

Will definitely come back and recommend this resort",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3135,A little Gem in a great location in Seminyak!,50,April 2012,"The Seminyak Beach Resort approaches the end of its first year open and therefore it was a relief to find we had made an excellent choice! We had the most idyllic 3 weeks at this Hotel and almost every aspect of our stay far exceeded our expectations. When we arrived we were greeted by amazing smiles and a welcome garland from the staff in reception - the only thing which would have been welcome was a glass of cold water or juice as the heat and humidity is overwhelming on arrival especially after 29 hours of travel! We had upgraded to the Beach Wing and had requested upper floor - which had not been transmitted by our Tour operator unfortunately. This was not a problem and the Reception quickly sorted out another room for us in a very short time and we ended up with probably one of the best rooms in that Wing! I should point out however that there is an option of Garden Wing at this Hotel and it was not made clear by our Tour Operator that this is located across a busy road and not in the main Hotel grounds so we were pleased we had paid for an upgrade. The rooms are exceptional particularly the Beach Wing and the Suites - one of which we were lucky enough to experience for the last week! The pool area is outstanding and the poolside service is second to none!When we arrived we were disappointed to note the main bar closed at 10pm (there is room service 24 hours for late night drinks however and this service was always extremely prompt!) Due to the openness of suggestions made to the Management staff at the brilliant weekly cocktail party this was taken on board and the bar remained open on some nights to 11pm. The staff at this Hotel were exceptional! No request was too much trouble and the speed of service was amazing! We would personally like to thank: Dwi, Ita, Agus, Ranji, Candra, Sari, Tri and all the others too many to mention for their happy, willing and amazing smiles - they made our stay with them all so so special. We were in Bali to celebrate our sons wedding - he is lucky enough to have lived there for the last 4 years! We were joined by two other couples at the Seminyak during our stay and our younger son who unfortunately was unable to be accommodated at the Seminyak and ended up at the 'W' - therefore we do have a direct comparison and the 'W' did not match up! We arranged a post wedding celebration dinner at the Hotel and that will long remain in our memories along with the Ocean side lunches and dinners we had there - the food was exceptional and breakfast was made for Kings!! We are already planning a return visit for a month next year which is testimony to what was for us a truly magical time in a very Special Hotel! Well done to all at the Seminyak Beach Resort! Namaste to all from Mrs Linda and Mr Chris! xx",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3136,The Best Resort - Fabulous Staff,50,May 2012,"We stayed for 7 nights at the Seminyak and couldn't have stayed at a better Resort.
I have never come across such friendly staff, and have stayed at many resorts in Asia.
We stayed at the beach front rooms. The breakfast was excellent and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are 5 star and extremly well appointed and were serviced morning and night with fresh towels etc provided. The Infinity Pool was fabulous and the staff there were very attentive, more than enough sun lounges, and pleanty of ice water provided free.
My husband got ill while there and the Resort provided transport to the Doctor and waited
for him to return him to the Resort. Public Relations rang through out the day and sent around
lunch for him at no charge
Then recepition were fantastic especially Ita who was very professional and assited with any
queries we had. Also a special metion for Yuni at recepition who was very pleasant and helpful.
We will certainly be returning as there was nothing that we could fault. Far better than the Padma that we stayed at the week before.
Hotel is very well located near very good selection of restaurants, taxi fare less than one Australian Dollar to most.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3137,Fantastic Resort,50,May 2012,"We couldn't have asked for a better Resort or better service during our trip to Bali last week. The staff were absolutely fantastic and the Sea View Suite we had was unbelieveable, I couldn't believe how close to the beach we were. The Resort is in a great location with many great restaurants and shops close by. I would definitely recommend this Resort to anyone travelling to Bali and will go there again for sure in the future. I honestly could not fault the Resort at all, it was the perfect choice to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3138,Seminyak Sanctuary,50,May 2012,"We stayed four nights at the Seminyak in early May, as part of a business group from Perth. Our rooms were located in the Garden Wing which is behind the resort and across a busy (typically Balinese) road. Don‚Äôt let that put you off however, as hotel staff are located at the roadside to stop traffic to allow safe crossing. Also once you‚Äôre across the road, the rooms are so lovely you‚Äôll be delighted. I think the Garden Wing rooms are some of the nicest I‚Äôve seen ‚Äì especially the beautiful bathroom with two choices of shower heads and a lovely deep bath.

We found the breakfast area delightful, with a number of raised platforms that allow for a more intimate setting and surrounded by gardens and ponds. The breakfast choice was excellent. We ordered room service food on a few occasions and that was always beautifully presented, hot and delivered within 30 minutes.

The resort is located along a really nice stretch of beach and lounging by the infinity pool affords a stunning vista. Plenty of sun loungers are available, although shade can be a problem if you have lily white English skin like me. Pool attendants happily re-positioned the heavyweight umbrellas for me though.

Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable and not rock hard as is common in many resorts in Asia. Overall, we can highly recommend the Seminyak Beach Resort. Location, facilities, food and staff were all excellent.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3139,Great Group Holiday destination,50,May 2012,"My husband took a large group of clients to Bali for a golf holiday - 48 in total clients and partners. We all stayed at The Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa. The hotel is split into 2 sections - the main part of the hotel and another 3 floor acommodation, swim up pool, restaurant etc., on the other side of the road, Initially I was a bit disappointed that our group wasn't in the main part of the hotel. But then every afternoon at the end of golf when we had the whole pool, staff and swim bar to ourselves, we were really happy.
The rooms are fantastic, beautiful marble bathrooms, very modern with everything you could possibly want.
Staff just so friendly, lovely smiles and very quite and helpful with any request.
Loved the hotel and would consider staying again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3140,"Don't hesitate, The Seminyak is perfect.",50,May 2012,"Usually on Holidays you try and find the negatives about your Accomodation, at This resort it's hard to find anything wrong, they are really trying hard and it's proving to be a winner all round.
From the moment you arrive it's perfect and it just gets better !! We normally prefer Villas however since we had my Partners 85 year old Mother with us we opted for a resort as it would have been more convenient. What a great choice we made.. The rooms are very spacious, beautiful Bathroom with Bathtub, Airconditioning was perfect and very quiet, Housekeeping is very effecient and noticed that they even lift the beds to sweep underneath. The gardens are very well kept and both Pool areas the best we have been to in Bali so far. They are not huge but perfectly located (infinity Pools) overlooking the beautiful Seminyak coast. From the Hotel Pictures I thought the lack of greenary was not appealing however once you are in that pool nothing really matters. There is one main factor however to the resort that is an added bonus and that is the Staff.. they were fantastic, from the pool Bar staff to restaurant staff at breakfast time and a special mention to Chandra ( Guest Relations) who is desperastely seeking participation for guest events like dancing lessons, aqua aerobics etc he is wonderful and will eventually succeed. The reception staff is extremely helpful and effecient and always offer transport to wherever you need to go. Didn't seem to be too many children and personally do not recommend for small children. I would recommend this resort for the 35 and over bracket as the location is perfect if you enjoy the Seminyak side of nightlife ( next door to Ku de Ta, same street as Potato Head, Huu Bar, Cubana Bar) We noticed it is very Gay friendly as the pool staff had no problems in taking pictures for a rather ""amourous"" couple.... a nice touch I thought.
Overall this is a nice change for Seminyak, we loved it and even though we normally like to try new accomodation on each trip I think we have picked a winner this time and will definetely be trying the Villas at the resort next time. p.s If you are looking for an ideal function venue I would highly recommend it and the glass chapel also looks perfect for Weddings etc.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3141,Go there !,50,April 2012,"We stayed at the Seminyak for seven nights over last Easter. We enjoyed very much the place. It is a classy, sophisticated hotel. We felt welcomed from the whole staff from the minute we arrived (it is particularly appreciated when arriving in the hotel after over 24 hours travel (from Europe) door to door !)
The suite (second floor with sea view) was beautifully decorated with great taste. It was quite vast (roughly 75 m2) with a superb bathroom. It was kept very clean and well air-conditioned.
Nice balcony with comfortable outside furniture. We appreciated the free wifi and the loudspeakers for I-phones or I-pods.
The infinity pool is just stunning as well as the pool bar and the garden. Good food at pool side or in the restaurant at very reasonable prices.
The Seminyak corresponds fully to what one can expect from a 5 stars hotel. Add to that a very dedicated and ever smiling staff that is trying very hard to fulfill each and every request .
On balance, a place we can highly recommend and where we will certainly go back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3142,Hello Semiyak Resort!!!,50,April 2012,"My husband and I are usually Oberoi regulars when it comes to Bali, however this time with it being fully booked we had to look elsewhere. A quick call to The Seminyak and all our requests were accommodated and confirmed in minutes. This hotel has been open for approx 8mths and they ask for your comments upon leaving as they want to be perfect, and they weren't far off!
We stayed in a one bedroom villa with private plunge pool which was beautiful. The gardens well manicured and extensive breakfast buffet.
Every request was seen to promptly.
There are more than enough beach surf breaks to tackle right out the front, and even a free drop off and pick up service to all the local restaurants.
This hotel has definitely won our hearts as a new place to stay in Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3143,Best hotel on Seminyak Beach,50,April 2012,"I have stayed at the old resor hotel which is now the site of the absolutely beautiful new Seminyak Beach and Spa Resort. My husband and I have been waiting for this hotel to be completed over the last three years. We were not disappointed. It is a sophisticated classy hotel. Hotels of this level in Seminyak do not come cheap so dont expect to pay less. Room rates are competitive with the Legian and Oberoi which in my opinion are tired and dark hence massive refurbishing in progress. I have stayed at the Samaya Villas and this is equal. The restaurant food is inexpensive for a hotel of this level. It is limited but sitting on the edge overlooking the beach....well who cares. Also there are so many great restaurants within 5mins. The main infinity pool is stunning whilst the small beachfront pool is my favourite. Swim up pool bar great. Try the delicious chicken satays for lunch. Breakfast fresh and delicious. Service great ALL STAFF are trying so hard to please guests and make their stay perfect...remember this is a new hotel and like all new businesses there will be a few issues to perfect. So to those reviewers who comment about staff with poor english...go away!! When in Italy etc I dont expect everyone to speak fluent english
The gym needs to have more than one treadmill and cross-trainer...too small for the hotel so something for the hotel to address. This superbly located new and beautifully decorated hotel is my new seminyak beach address. Highly recommend to those who like the quieter classy side of Bali We stayed in a beachfront ground floor and a beachfront first floor room in north wing. I personally think the 4 absolute beachfront north rooms are perfect We stayed over the easter holidays",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3144,"Best location, beautiful pool area and great staff contribute to a relaxing holiday right on the beach.",40,February 2012,"Only one issue was the food which has from recent correspondence been addressed. As for the rest, it is a magnificent complex,of hotel and villas with the beat pool area on Seminyak beach. Staff go out of their way to assist and the gardens and rooms,are well maintained. Can't wait to go back for another week holiday. Ask for either a villa or a beach wing room; not a garden room which is across,the road, but a bit cheaper. Great value for money.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3145,Infinity pool right on Seminyak beach,40,April 2012,"PROS
True beachfront resort. Infinity pool is right on the beach is good for a dip especially at sunset.
Location right in the middle of the upmarket Seminyak area (boutiques, chi-chi restaurants, top-end hotels). Between Ku De Ta and The Legian hotel.
Spacious, beautiful, shiny new rooms (we stayed at 1st floor Deluxe room at Beach Wing, could see the sea from our patio)
Lovely grounds, villas, and beachside lounge area.
Food was very good.

CONS
Service is inconsistent and needs dire attention. Hotel is making an effort, but often fails to communicate the guest's requests or needs among their own staff. Front-desk services are fine, but once you step away from the lobby, you are ignored and forgotten.
Pool service is slow and staff scarce.
Spa not open for business yet (as of April 2012) - strangely, I heard conflicting versions from two separate staff members on whether it was.
Hotel lacks the buzz or ambiance you would expect in a high-end property in Seminyak. Public areas layout, design, and lighting was quite boring.
Note: the sea is quite rough here - no swimming was allowed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3146,Do not stay here! Not worth your money!!!,30,April 2012,"We stayed here for 5 nights over Easter and we were very disappointed. The service was absolutely terrible! We had to wait 45mins for a drink and over an hour for our food while we were sitting by the pool. The staff can hardly understand English and when you ask them for something they looked as though they had no idea. Our face towels were never replaced even after numerous requests. The gym is so small for such a big hotel. You would often have to wait over 30mins for the treadmill as there is only 1.
As for the rooms...we stayed in a garden room and they do not tell you that the garden room is across the road and not along the beach. When we got there they told us because we are in a garden room that we can be driven by buggy to and from the main hotel. Everytime we requested the buggy we got the impression that it was too hard work for them and we would often have to wait for them to get the Buggy even though it was meant to sit out the front.
The rooms are small and I woke up one morning covered in bites...bed bugs!

The pool is quite nice. When ordering drinks they come in plastic cups and the cocktails are loaded with alcohol therefore being to strong to drink. The food is pretty gross for breakfast and lunch. There was not a lot on the menu for lunch.

This is not a 5 star hotel. You can find much better in Bali for a better price. I will never stay here again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3147,Surprising!,50,April 2012,"We stayed in a garden view room which is situated across the road from the hotel (approx 50m walk). We paid approx $350 per night through agoda.

The hotel is under one year old and the staff were lovely.
On arrival we were given a frangipani lei and a delicious drink. We were taken to our room which was surprisingly large with a clever layout.

Lowlights - no lift and we stayed on the third floor
Highlights - too many to mention them all, infinity pool overlooking the beach was spectacular, breakfast yummy, pool for the garden rooms was also great and hardly anyone else used it, hotel very scenic and the gardens were beautiful, great bed, staff wonderful and very helpful, location unbeatable.
We will definitely stay here again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3148,Average,30,March 2012,"We are frequent bali travellers. We choose to stay in 5 star suites on all visits.
Unfortunately after much excitement and waiting we checked into the Seminyak.
We got rushed through reception with no warm greeting. The customer service compared to
other resorts was poor. The staff tried but unfortunately lack the experience that other hotels seem to naturally have. Our rooms got cleaned once a day and this was usually around 4pm. This doesnt work when you have guests visiting your room with bed/dishes not collected or made. When staff press your doorbell they press it over and over again until you make it to the door. They didnt realise we were sleeping one day and charged in our suite like it was a party room making noise and not respecting the privacy your room should offer. We are not the type of people who like to complain but with this resort felt we should voice our opinion. The food was about a 7/10 and staff seemed to offer you the menu after you have eaten your buffet breakfast. Things just didnt run smoothly. I dont feel they have had the training or warmth other hotels seem to naturally have. Really unfortunate because we had high expectations before we arrived and thought about checking out early many days.

My last thought before i sign off is that be careful when you have a masaage at this resort. I booked in for a relaxing massage and had two staff members in the room while i was trying to relax. One was giving the massage and other girl i could hear walking around cleaning up.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3149,Hassle Free,40,March 2012,"We have visited Bali for many years mostly staying in the Legian area. This time however, we decided to splash out a little. I highly recommend this resort and am able to because of the numerous resorts and hotels we have stayed at. The staff is extremely friendly and could not have made our stay more welcome. From the reception staff to the cleaners I was amazed how hard they tried to please you, always a smile or shuttle ride to surrounding areas. It is a new resort and right next door to the Kudeta. Very close to all other great restaurants and shops. We booked the ocean room a nice clean room with a good bed and all other modern facilities. The breakfast is great! We didn't see the garden rooms but yes they are on the other side of the road. However, we did check out the villa and oh my gosh it is to die for! So beautifully designed!. The pool area is fantastic and relaxing. When i arrived home i noticed that i had left a piece of clothing at the hotel which had been placed in their lost and found and they promptly returned it. The prices may need to be looked at and adjusted It is maybe a little too expensive when comparing to other 5 star resorts as far as room space and other benefits usually included. I would have rated it a 5 if the price was a little more realistic. Regardless, i would definitely return to this place as for me it was completely hassle free and that's what a good holiday is all about.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3150,"""AVOID THIS HOTEL""",10,March 2012,"We had a dreadful experience at this hotel and I recommend to avoid this hotel. The senior staff members are bad-mannered, horrible and unprofessional. We thought we lost our camera and reported it to reception only to return from dinner to find our room had been entered by three staff members who took it upon themselves to search our room for our missing camera without first seeking our approval. We also returned to our room to find our safety deposit box wide open with money, jewellery and passports all exposed. The safe had been manually opened as our pin number no longer worked to lock it. When we approached the senior manager he verbally confirmed this was their hotel policy. After this event we felt unsafe to continue staying at this hotel and immediately checked out. Also the quality of the food and beverage is simply appalling and to top it off I left the hotel covered in BED BUG bites from my stay at the hotel.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3151,Wonderful property,50,March 2012,"We have just returned from staying at The Seminyak Resort and Spa - what a wonderful hotel. The staff are excellent and the rooms are beautiful, the beds are sooooo comfortable! If you have the chance do yourself and your tastebuds a favour and have dinner in the restuarant on site it was a truely amazing experience and the food was some of the best I have had in Bali. Thanks to all!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3152,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff, great location",50,February 2012,"We loved this hotel.

The rooms were a great size. We had three girls sharing and had plenty of space for everything. The fittings were all very modern in both the bedroom and bathroom. There was also a nice balcony with plants to provide privacy.

The location was ideal. It was right next door to ku de ta so we were able to walk to the shops, to restaurants, and to the spa.

We were invited to a cocktail party on our last night with free drinks and nibbles which was lovely and we were also treated to a complimentary 3 course meal at the hotel restaurant. The restaurant was often empty however i definitely recommend it. The food was amazing and well exceeded our expectations.

The staff were lovely! Every staff member greeted us as we passed them and they were all very cheerful. The lobby staff were very helpful, they made restaurant bookings for us and went to the trouble of finding out where some home wares we liked were purchased from. One staff member even brought us all a red rose each one night, which was lovely.

i would definitely recommend staying on the beach side rather than the garden side. We stayed on the beach side and it was so convenient. Those staying on in the garden wing would have to cross the road and walk a little way to get to the pool/ lobby/ breakfast.

The breakfast buffet included eggs & omelets, waffles, pancakes (all made to order) fruit, muesli, porridge, toast ( a wide variety of breads), juices, plus Balinese dishes amongst other things.

The hotel provided complimentary yoga classes, aerobics classes, Balinese dance classes, fruit carving classes and some activities for children as well.

The only negatives I have were that there is a window between the bathroom and bedroom, and even with the blind down the light shines into the bedroom which is annoying during the night. However torches are provided for you to use during the night. It was also a little windy at times as we were right on the beach, but it wasn't an issue for the most part. Finally, the spa was undergoing renovations while we were there but it was said to be opening the following week and it didn't bother us too much anyway.

Highly recommended!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3153,Fantastic Resort!,40,December 2011,"Have just returned from this resort after a stay over the new years eve period. Fantastic balinese style accommodation! We travelled in a group of 16 and were all really happy with the staff, service and facilities. Location is also great, within walking distance of many shops, restaurants and spas.

Shuttle Service: the hotel staff were always happy to organise and provide transport whether it be just up the road or a further drive.

Buffet Breakfast was excellent, great variety of food, looked forward to it each morning. Only downside is that there is only one restaurant and one bar at the resort. A few more options for dinner and lunch would be good.

Stunning infinity pool and pool attentants very attentive in providing towels, water etc.

I would advise staying in the beach wing as we did where all the main facilities are locares, as the garden wing is across the road and guests would have to walk across for breakfast, pool use and so on.

All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to help you. Would definitely recommend this resort and will be staying again!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3154,"Lovely resort , great pool on beach!",50,December 2011,"Lovely place great food, & pools, unfortunAtely the spa not completed . Bit pricey",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3155,Turned away!!!,20,November 2011,"As we are frequent visitors to Bali (about 20 trips and many more to come) and we are currently staying at The Legian Club ( which is fabulous, amazing very special), I decided to walk next door into The Seminyak, to have a look around. My daughter is coming to Bali to meet us, but is staying on for a few extra days in december and wanted me to have a look at The Seminyak, as a possible hotel for her and her husband. Unfortunately when I went to enter the hotel frrom the beach, the security gentleman, refused me entrance. When I explained why I was there and that I was staying next door at The Legian, he just asked me to leave...always with a smile on his face. In all of the years, inc times of heightened security, I have never been denied entrance into a hotel in Bali or anywhere else in the world. Needleess to say, I wont be recommending this hotel to my daughter or staying here in my future visits to beautiful and friendly Bali!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3156,"They Can Do Better Than This,,,",20,October 2011,"We stayed there last Oct, and it should be our best reunion holiday for me and my sister, however it turned into something that we hate. Well, where should I start? Ok, we came to the resort late at 7 pm, and still had to face the fact we have to wait a bit more, because they had to move and prepare our room, because they made the mistake of locating our room. (they blocked us with the wrong bed arrangement, even though we put already in the reservation). And we had to argue too!The villa is not really recommended for small kid, due to the pool and the pond location. The villa is great, but the AC was leaking, the ceiling around the AC was moldy and a bit rotten and the shower drain was stuck!
We had nice sleep though. Breakfast, the food was great, and the chef (chef Agung) was superb!! Try their waffle,,,best waffle I have ever tasted!Only the waiter was not really well managed!No one greeted us when we came at the restaurant, may be they were too busy. And even one of the waiter took our salt and pepper shaker away from our table without asking and he did it right in front of us!! He move the shaker to other table, because other guests needed it and they did not have any. Another morning, 3 gentlemen came and sit at the restaurant for breakfast too, and we were really sure that they were the managers of the resort. However, they did not sit in manner and smoking. Helloo,,,do you mind?Small kid next to you?
Housekeeping staff did their best to keep us happy, only they always came late for servicing our room. But they were so courteous. Gardener was the best staff with their big smile, always! Security, they forgot how to act not so rude when asking our guests, or even us!
But I must say the location and the view of the resort was great and stunning. They could do better to combine with their good service. if they would like to charge the room service with the price of 5 stars resort, they have to do better!!At least the food should got a taste and the cocktail should not olny taste coconut milk. provide us clean day bed cover too would be great.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3157,Fantastic. Highly Recommended,50,November 2011,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 10 nights in early October. I fell in love with the hotel the moment we arrived. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming. This Continued for the duration of our stay. Our beach wing room was spacious, clean and had an amazing ocean view. The hotel itself is in the perfect location (literally next door to Ku de Ta. The facilities are superb, andnthe location on the beach is second to none. The ocean front infinity pool speaksfor itself. The photos on the website do not do it justice.
This Seminyak is a must stay when in Bali.
Thank you again to the staff. We will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3158,Wonderful hotel!,50,November 2011,"We stayed at The Seminyak for 15 nights in Oct/Nov and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff, from the front desk, breakfast area, pool attendants to the room cleaning staff, were all delightful. So friendly and helpful. Sari, Sudy and GD at breakfast were excellent, very attentive. The buffet breakfast was great. The Blue Bird taxi reps in the lobby were also friendly and helpful. Our ocean view room on the second floor was spacious and clean. The position on the beachfront was fantastic, and the close proximity to the shops, spas and restaurants was perfect.
Another lovely touch was the complimentary cocktail party at poolside every Thursday evening, to meet the staff as well as other guests.
Thank you to all at The Seminyak!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3159,"Exactly what we want, cant ask for more",50,October 2011,"My husband and I staied at The Seminyak for 6 nites in mid Oct 2011, we both loved it very much.

Staff - We got the staff 's attention very easily, nothing is too much trouble for them, extremely helfpul with all the enquiries. They knew our name and which room we are staying by the 3rd day.

Room - We got an Ocean view Suite on the 3rd floor, the room and the view was fantastic. It was clean, very new and spacious. Love their pillow so much that I looked forward to go to bed every nite after a big day, had a very good sleep every nite. One thing I didnt do, was I should have asked if I can purchase their pillow.
Although the hotel is still doing some construction work, but during our stay, we couldnt hear any noise at all, indeed it was very quiet.

Hotel location n shuttle service - Hotel is located right next door to KuDeTa, and about 10 mins walk to the Seminyak Square, excellent location. One thing I really like was the hotel were happily to arrange a shuttle for us to take us to anywhere up to within 15 mins drive at the time that we want.

Bathroom - I've read a previous TA msg that someone had a trouble with the shower water tempreture, so I was fully aware of it, and luckily it didnt happen in my room.

Spa bath - it was prepared with some nice petals, since we got there very late on the first nite, I planned to enjoy it on the next day morning which I can open the bi-fold window which is facing the ocean, unfortunately all the half prepared water from the nite before was gone, we told the front desk about the leak problem, very soon they sent a guy up to fix it. Because we had the DND light on, they had to call us to double check if it's ok for the guy to come in, which I really appreciated it as I've heard in some other hotels that the house keepers or whoever it is just used their key to get in to do whatever they have to do while the DND sign's on.

Breakfast - full buffet style, we love their local fruit - Salak ( snake fruit, becoz the skin of the fruit looks like snake's skin, however, they named in snack fruit at the buffet table) Must try.
Love the Balianese style breakfast, the dumpling soup, the fried glass noodle, the sambal sauce, the steamed chicken meat paste wrapped in banana leaf, so juicy, fresh and tasty.

We enjoied the breakfast every morning!

The infinity pool - how can I miss mentioning it. Love it so much with direct access to the soft sand beach. Pool attentants are great, looked after us well, the area was very clean, towels were provdied. During the afternoon, the attendant came and asked the guests if we want any drinks from the bar. The last 2 days of our stay, there was 1 family with 2 kids were using the pool at the same time as we did, however the noise from the kid didnt really bother most of the people around the pool as they didnt running around the pool, the parents had a good control of them. Thank God!

Spa center - still under construction, however, they shifted the spa/massage service to the first floor, so it's available. Gym center is nicely set up.

Overall - this is exactly what we want from a relax holiday in Bali, a fantastic hotel in great locaiton, with wonderful room and view, comfortable bed, clean, new, brilliant staff, great customer service, we never had to wait for longer then 2 mins before we got someone's attention. Great pool, quiet enviroment, nice food.

Cant ask for more!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3160,Lovely resort very helpful staff.,50,August 2011,"We spent a week here in August 2011. Lovely resort , great by the pool. Staff very nice and willing to help with all enquiries. No hot water for showers the whole stay only warm. Which was ok as it was lovely weather. Close to all restaurants and shops, direct access to beach. Room staff were excellent. Only concern was on check out they wanted to charge $50 (one way) American, transport to airport which we cancelled and got blue taxi which cost $7.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3161,Loved it!!!!,50,October 2011,"I stayed at The Seminyak on 2 separate occasions with 5 other ladies. It was excellent!!! We stayed in beach wing rooms. First time I had a room on the ground floor which had a nice sized balcony and steps down onto the large resort garden (you can't actually see the beach/ocean from these rooms though).On my second stay I was on the first level up and could actually see the beach from this height, the balcony in these rooms were a little bit smaller though. My preference would be for the ground floor rooms in the beach wing (less stairs to walk up/down & better balcony). The infinity pool & swim up bar pool were fantastic. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent & made our stay. Buffet breakfast had a great selection. Overall, the resort was spotlessly clean & just the place to sit back & relax. I would definitely return to this hotel!!!!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3162,FANTASTIC!!,50,July 2011,"The Seminyak is the most beautiful place we have stayed in in Bali!

Some work was still being done to the resort when we stayed in July/August, but overall, it was absolutely fantastic!

The most enjoyable part of the resort was the staff! They were ALWAYS friendly, always helpful, just grateful to be of service to us - they are just amazing. Such beautiful people too, said hello to us every time we walked past, it was lovely. Be assured you will be looked after by the staff!

Will stay there definitely if we come again. :)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3163,"Beautiful Property, but Lacking Some 5-Star Qualities",40,September 2011,"My wife and I spent 4 days at The Seminyak. We had a wonderful time, but could tell they had just been open a short time and were going through somewhat of a learning curve. While the lobby itself was pretty basic, the staff was very freindly and efficient. We enjoyed a 3rd floor Oceanfront Suite. The room was specious and very well appointed. It did not dissappoint us in the least. The grounds were nice but probably need a season to really grow out. We spent a lot of time at the beautiful infinty edge pool overlooking the Ocean. There is also a second pool with a nice swim-up bar.

The restaurant was excellent. They definately got that right. Our breakfasts were fantastic and the fix price dinner option is worth every rph.

We fell in love with the staff. They were all very friendly and would bend over backwards to please. They would always great us by name and seemed to know what we had done that day. It was really pretty amazing. A nice service they provided was a car and driver to shuttle us around the town.

While this was our first visit to Bali, I really get the sense that the owners are trying more more for providing a traditional Bali experience than a trendy touristy resort...kudo's to them for that.

Areas the hotel will need to address if they are serious about being a ""Premium Beach Resort"" are:
- Dirty room service dishes can't be let sitting outside suite doors for over 24 hours.
- Need to provide regular bar service at the infinity pool. (We never had anyone come to us asking if we wanted drinks or something to eat).
- Need a bar other than the pool bar. (If you want to sit at the bar to have a drink, you have to be in the water).

Overall, my wife and I had a great experience. We would return and recommend this proerty to others.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3164,Poor service for the offered rate,10,September 2011,"After staying at the Legian and W, nearby properties to this hotel, I turned down by the appearance of the lobby using cheap material, old style decor and not providing efficient check in. Room is ok, not finish yet missing some function. The service was very bad, not much selection for breakfast. Staff up to manager level need to be trained better if want to compete with other hotel and villas on the area. Big Big difference experience, one of the worst. If you willing to pay the rate they the hotel offer, you can get a better service and experience in other properties.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3165,When finished it should be wonderful,40,June 2011,"A very similar experience to the previous review, with some minor frustrations over the unfinished aspects. We also booked many months ago when the soft opening was scheduled for December. The staff are wonderful and the pool area just lovely however the building noises and the unfinished areas did detract from the overall experience. We stayed for 9 days and hardly got a cab at all as the location is great. The hotel has a shuttle that is very flexible with times and drop offs so that was an added bonus. Breakfast wasn't up to our previous seminyak resorts and I agree that some of the design aspects are curious (glass bathroom making midnight toilet stops a bright light wakening experience!). All in all still a lovely resort that will hopefully be top notch when the works and garden are finished.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3166,Amazing when finished.,40,May 2011,"Having stayed in the ""Made for Western Tourists"" Nusa Dua last October, we made the decision to stay a bit closer to the heart of it. Seminyak stood out as the place to be, as it was close to Kuta and Legian, but far enough away from the footy trips. So the search began for places that weren't too old, not too far away from restaurants, shops, the beach and value for money. Easy.

We stumbled upon the Seminyak onlineously site of Resor), which was a brand new Hotel due to be open in December 2010. It was in a great location, close to restaurants (Jalan Kayu Aya is the eat street of Seminyak) and right on the beach. We booked a Garden Wing room as we don't spend much time in the room and couldn't justify paying more for an upgraded room. This was in February and as yet the Hotel hadn't opened. Our Travel Agent assured us it would be open by May.

May came and yes the Hotel had opened, albeit a soft opening. We were greeted in the temporary reception room with a cold washer and refreshing drink. Coincidentally, Reception opened a few days later and it is very nice. We had been upgraded to the Beach Wing as the Garden Wing was not yet finished. As we arrived at night, we were unable to see how much works still needed to be done, but first impressions were great.

The room was luxurious, although not sure why you need a see through toilet door in the bathroom. The water in the shower was not very warm, though this wasn't a great problem and did improve as our week went on. Wide screen TV had all the usuals cable channels and IPOD doc was a nice touch. The housekeeper would leave an artistic towel display each evening on the end of the bed which was different but fun.

The gym was not ready in the Hotel, so I had to be driven to a local private gym five minutes away. I received three free visits, then I had to pay after that. I am not sure why I should have to pay for extra visits just because the hotel wasn't ready. Having said that the drivers at The Seminyak and the staff at the private gym were brilliant.

The pool area is very nice. We pretty much had it all to ourselves as there weren't many other guests. This will obviously change once it fully opens. They have a weird system where you have to sign in for beach towels and sign out once you are finished for the day. We have never had this before. Wasn't a huge pain, though, not sure why it is done. This will be hard to police when Hotel is full.

We only ate in the hotel for Breakfast. It was an A La Carte Menu and was very tasty, especially the pancakes and fruit salad with yoghurt. They served beautiful fresh juices and all types of coffees. Can't comment on the quality of the other food there, though you get much better value for money outside of the complex.

We had a bit of a gripe with security staff. Nearly every time we tried to re-enter the Hotel, we were asked if we were staying there. Bear in mind there were very few guests staying, and it became a bit annoying after a while. This will be a problem when the Hotel is full and guests are coming across the road from the Garden Wing.

In terms of the incomplete works, this wasn't that much of an issue. Some drilling and hammering during the day but not too bad. It probably just impeded our privacy a bit with workmen walking around, but they were all pretty much discrete.

Overall, this Hotel is going to be a star. It is next door to Ku De Ta which is a great place to just kick back and relax while the Sun goes down. All the staff were very friendly and the grounds are well designed. The test will be when they are full. We plan to come back to see it when it is completed.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3167,Potential to be one of the best 5-star resorts in Bali,40,June 2011,"Just got back from staying at The Seminyak for 4 nights. Badly needed some R & R and Bali is always my choice for de-stressing. The Seminyak is the perfect place to do this. My room no. 3118 (beach wing) was a mere 10 steps from the beach! If being near the beach is a priority for you as it was for me, staying at the Beach Wing is a must. The Garden Wing is across the busy road so I wouldn't recommend it.

My room was on the ground level (there are 2 levels) and I used the balcony door to access the rest of the grounds and beach more than I did the room's front door. Service-wise, the staff try really hard although there were a few hiccups - front desk checked in another guest on my 2nd day there and mistakenly gave them my room! Luckily, although I was in my room at the time, I latched the door and the steward who showed them to the room couldn't enter. Must admit, it was a bit of a shock although they apologized very nicely. I guess accidents do happen but if I hadn't latched the door...........

Having said that, staff from reception to the breakfast restaurant to the pool staff were all very friendly and ever helpful. Grounds are beautiful and once all the landscaping and renovations are complete, this property will be one of the most sought-after beachfront resorts. They also have the most beautiful chapel right on the beach - perfect for romantic wedding services.

My room was spacious and fittings elegant and tasteful. The bathroom and amenities were well-thought out and planned.

Having stayed in more than 40 properties across Bali, I have to say that this one is certainly in my top 5 and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3168,This will be seminyak's best resort once fully complete,50,May 2011,"Words can not describe this new hotel. It's fresh, clean and such a nice place it will be one to watch. The resort was not complete when we stayed but who cares when they had such wonderful rooms and great service and most importantly the best views you could ask for. The villa is what you want if you can afford it worth every cent. If I have any suggestions it would be to have Mozey nets around the beds. The hotel staff do their best to satisfy you in every way. Thank you for making us luv Bali.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3169,"What a fantastic, clean new five star resort",50,May 2011,"Even though the resort is not finished it is still breath taking. First time I have travelled to Bali and this place has made me want to come back every year. We booked beach wing room and when we arrived we were very tempted to see the villa. If the rooms were amazing we just had to see what the villa had to offer. We did not hesitate to arrange the upgrade asap. Words could not describe the villa, Perfection.... Worth every bit extra. Strongly recommend this if you can afford it. The staff at this resort are so friendly, helpful and will go out of their way to do what they can. When we arrived I was a
little upset the spa service was not available but this was solved. Staff arranged the service to come to my villa from outside the resort. They made everything possible. Thank you to all the staff. This was by far the best resort we have stayed in for a long time. If I could give any suggestions to make this a better place I would have to recommend mossy nets around the beds in the villas. I have been eaten alive at nights. Thanks for the wonderful experience. Ps best location for shopping and dinning. Once fully complete watch out seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3170,Beautiful! - but not finished...,40,April 2011,"The Seminyak will be a beautiful, 5 star resort - when its finished. Excellent location right next door to Ku de Ta, on the beach, exceptional staff. Infinity Pool is great, needs plants to grow a little, smaller pool not real clean... Spa building not complete, Garden rooms across the road no where near complete... reception does not look finished, restaurant and kitchen area a work in progress. The staff were wonderful, always a smiling face and only to happy to help with a lift to shops or nearby restaurants. Rooms are really beautiful, contemporary with Balinese touch. Will stay here again, but not until later this year, when the workmen and jackhammering is complete.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3171,Construction Sight,10,April 2011,"Easter a five day break with a girlfriend what a disaster we holidayed at a construction sight, food lousy, rooms average, staff lovely but you have to feel sorry for them when greedy owners open a Hotel still under costruction and expect the staff to keep guests happy. No spa or gym available for use, wasn't game enough to put my head under the water in the dirty pool",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3172,Great Location for fantastic price.,50,April 2011,"Stayed at this resort for 4 days in early April. Even though the property was not yet finished the hotel did their very best to accommodate us. We stayed in The Room -Beach Wing, and both twin beds were large with fresh comfortable bedding. The highlight was the infinity pool which overlooked the ocean as well as got a fantastic breeze from the water during the day.
KuDeTa was located next door, so it was only a short stroll from the beach to visit. The location of the Seminyak was perfect with only a short stroll to great restaurants, bars and the boutiques nearby. The staff would drive us into town whenever we wanted to visit Legian or Kuta, the car would also have water bottles in case you wanted to take one with you on your shopping trip. Overall I would definitely be back and look forward to seeing the property once it has fully opened.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3173,O.K. hotel (before renovation),30,October 2008,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights just a couple of months before they closed it down for full refurbishing (they should be re-opening in December 2010).
The location of the hotel directly on the beautiful Seminyak beach is great. That was also the only thing that was truly great about the ""old Resor Seminyak"". The rest of it was o.k. The rooms were in a range of a good 3-star hotel, without frills, but with nice balconies. Breakfast was a bit disappointing although we loved having it just next to the beach, on the hotel's terrace. The pool was nice and spacious.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3174,"Great hotel, great location",50,November 2009,"This is an incredible hotel especially for the price. Our room was very spacious with a nice patio with a view and a great bathroom.

The bathroom was huge and open to the air which is great when showering.

The pool area is beautiful and just steps from the beach. The pool also has a swim up bar.

there are hammocks all around the property for quiet impromptu naps.

Also, the location is in easy walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants for all budget types. Next door is the very nice Ku De Ta which is great for sunsets but pricey.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3175,My Stay at Hotel Resor Seminyak,40,September 2009,"I had a very good stay at Hotel Resor Seminyak. Service staff were very friendly and courteous and they are very helpful in providing tips to guests. Food has a good variety and . The hotel is near shops and the airport.

3176,Goodbye Resor!,40,July 2009,"The Resor is a lovely hotel with lush grounds and beautiful rooms. The staff were extremely friendly which was made it even more amazing given the fact they were going to be without a job due to closure on or around July the 1st. The breakfast on the beach was a highlight. The pools were gorgeous! What a shame it will be demolished to be replaced with a more upmarket, boutique style hotel which will no doubt will not be as affordable.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3177,a short break,40,July 2009,"My teenage son and I had a wonderful time at resoe seminyak,
plenty to do,
right on the beach,
other families to socialize with,
rooms clean and comfortable,

We are sorry it is being demolished and hope the staff and general ambience of the resort remain when it reopens.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3178,Resor Seminyak,30,June 2009,"I stayed there for 2 nights with wife and 2 young kids. Got a free upgrade as the hotel couldn't give us adjoining rooms with my parents-in-law. The food was okay. The location by the beachfront was a plus. Our kids loved the big bathtub in our room. However, stay was badly dampened by the fact that the aircon was not working properly and the toilet not flushing properly despite asking service staff to fix it. I don't think I will be back.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3179,great spot for the money,40,June 2009,"great spot for the money - right on the beach away from the hustle and bustle of kuta, lots of options for eating out on jl. laksmana",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3180,A lovely spot,40,June 2009,"I was actually pleasantly surprised given some of the bad reviews. I think for this part of Seminyak it represented excellent value. Yes, the hotel is dated, but it certainly wasn't uncomfortable. Our room (a deluxe) was cavernous and had a sort of dated, stately grandeur about it. The breakfast was plenty for me - bread and fruit, bacon and eggs etc, rice and noodles, cereal, juice tea and coffee. The only very small downside was the staff, who though not rude, weren't particularly helpful, i.e. wouldn't help with making bookings for restaurants or other services. I guess the hotel is a little in need of an update but I understand that is happening in July 2009.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3181,Wonderful & Joyous Experience,40,June 2009,"My wife and I had doubts about this resort and this was our last choice in terms of location & pricing. But upon arriving at the resort, we were pleasantly surprised. Very nice Balinese exterior and interior but jaded. It's low density with a huge garden space for relaxing and playing with kids. 2 pools, both kids friendly. Perfect family holiday resort.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3182,Resor Semyak Review,30,June 2009,"Overall the hotel was good. It had a good service, the staff were attentive and responded to requests immediately. Had a small library but were filled with german and french books only. Has a small swimming pool for sunbathing. Restaurant was litterly on the beach with great view of sunset & the moon. Ideal to go for a stroll anytime.

Downside was the water for shower and bath was salty!! Make sure you DO NOT make the mistake of drinking it!! Very unpleasant experience.

I would go back to the hotel if i visited Semyak again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3183,GREAT INTRODUCTION TO BALII !,50,June 2009,"We were met promptly at the airport by a friendly, knowledgable driver.
Taking the delicious [inclusive] breakfast while watching the waves roll in was glorious! Wish we could have stayed longer but it was time for helpful staff to arrange our trip to Ubud.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3184,Rajab H. AL-Zahrani,40,June 2009,"I like the hotel in general and if i come again i will stay on it if they improve the comments i stated above. the hotel has a very nice location on Seminyak beach, far enough away from the madding crowds but close to many great restaurant opportunities, some within walking distance.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3185,Great Value,40,June 2009,"I booked this hotel at the last minute as I was in Bali for a retreat and still had no set plans as of two days prior to the retreat's end. I wanted to be on the beach but didn't want to break the bank, and having come from the retreat I was looking forward to having my own room and services like a concierge and room service.

The Resor Seminyak delivered on all counts. It was not as luxurious as my retreat accomodations in that the bed was not as comfortable and the linens & upholstery were visibly tired. The bathtub also needed to be recaulked and failed to drain the first time I took a shower. However, housekeeping promptly took care of the problem. It must be noted that the room was spotless and everything else worked perfectly (TV/minibar/hotel provided electrical adaptor/etc).

I also requested a late check out as my flight was not leaving Bali until close to midnight and I wanted to shower after spending the day on the beach and before heading out for my LONG flights back to NY. Although they were unable to let me keep my room, they did give me another room in which to take a shower and it was more than sufficient.

I would stay at the Resor Seminyak again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3186,family stay in Bali,40,May 2009,"This is a evaluation for the second room. all just the same. Can recommend the place. Would not like to stay in the crowed. All nice clean and quite. Beach, pool very nice. Hotel should consider a safe inside the room. Lot of hassle to get the valuables in and out. Not much in walking distance but taxis are readily available.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

3189,I'll can't wait to go back!!,30,May 2009,"I read PROS and CONS before booking to this Resort and i have to say that, now i have experienced, my conclusions are POSITIVES !
OK some room are dated... but hey! you are in a 3 star hotel.
It is a nice location, away from the crowed beach, next to fabulous restaurants, 2 minutes walk from the best shopping street (high end). The team has been very nice with me (although i heard few people having a row while checking out because of a bill - but you have to reconize that some customers can be evil as well).
My room was a bit dark and dated but a lot of attention was put into it (minibar well provided with chocs and nuts as well, flowers, anti mosquito product, 3 size of towels, soap, shampoo, bath bubble, body cream, hashtray, matches, balcony, hangers, nice bed matrice very confortable) and all very clean.
Personaly i would come back to this hotel. Because for this price in this location, it is worth it! YOU ARE ON THE BEST BEACH.(and do not expect a 5 star hotel when you book for a 3 !)",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

We went to Sarong the new restaurant up the road which has fantastic food , there are so many great places to eat close by .",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3191,Fantastic location and staff,40,May 2009,We stayed 2 nights here and loved it. Getting massages outside right on the beach was the highlight - heaven. The breakfast on the beach was excellent too. The rooms are a little dated and I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel if you planned on spending a lot of time in your room - but in this location who would want to! Would definitely stay here again.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3192,"Great location, OK room",30,May 2009,"Resor Seminyak is very well located on Seminyak beach, far enough away from the madding crowds but close to many great restaurant opportunities, some within walking distance. The grounds are very nice with a couple small pools. The beach is quite nice.

On the down side, the room was just OK, a little cold and boring with a hard bed. And only two small pillows! Renting boogie boards was pretty expensive (50,000 rupees/hour), this should be free to guests. Nevertheless, for Bali it was good value for what we got.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3193,Luxury location for budget price,40,May 2009,"After a lot of research we decided to stay in Seminyak for our Bali vacation so we could have a more peaceful beach and still be close enough to travel to Kuta, Jimbaren, Uluwatu, etc. Taxis are easy to grab from the gate of the hotel and cheap ($2-3 to Kuta for example).

---

ARRIVAL: Upon arrival we were supposed to be picked up at the airport, but no one was waiting. Not the end of the world... we grabbed a $7 taxi and 20 minutes later pulled up to the hotel. The lobby is warm and welcoming, a large open living room feel with thatched roof, stone floors and leather chairs. It certainly doesn't feel like the lobby I expected at the low price we paid! Rooms are steps away down lovely stone paths with waterways, plants and fish ponds.

---

ROOM: Our room (112) overlooked the ""golf course"" which appears to be a holdover from the 80's, but the greenery and quiet were a nice treat as we sat out on the terrace. The room was spacious and adequate, large comfortable bed with clean soft linens and lots of water pressure in the shower.

---

POOL: There are two pools, one near the spa (bigger of the two) and the other near the restaurant (more kid-friendly with a wading section). Both were clean, decently maintained and offered lounge-chair seating. The sunken bar offers service from the water or at pool deck tables with friendly staff, moderate prices ($2 small beer, $3 large) and yummy locally roasted garlic peanuts. You can order from the restaurant menu here too, but outside of the hamburger we ordered, calling the food mediocre is kind.

---

STAFF: The hotel staff was really wonderful to us, helping arrange surfing lessons, car service and a guide for a day trip to Ubud, car service with return to Jimbaran for dinner, and car service and a guide to Uluwatu. Also, our arranged car service to the airport went smoothly.

BREAKFAST: Included in our stay was a daily American buffet breakfast which again wasn't spectacular but the service was friendly and helpful.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa

3195,Better hotels around Legian for the money,30,April 2009,"Overall I think you can get a cleaner room for the same price in Legian, maybe you are paying for the Seminyak location itself. Being right on the beach is nice but on the 3rd day the hotel ran out of beach towels for a few hours.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3196,Resor Seminyak,30,April 2009,"Having stayed at many hotels on Bali, we were very disappointed with the service provided at Resor, esecially when taking the price of rooms in to consideration! The rooms are very dated and toweling very old - needs urgent replacing! The food was average with breakfast being very disappointing - the range of options available limited and the same every day. The pool and surroundings are lovely. The staff are helpful and friendly.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3197,Seminyak on the beach at a reasonable price,40,April 2009,"Resor Seminyak is an ideal destination if you want to avoid the 5 star price. Has a great location, imbetween The Legian and The Oberio, right next to Kudeta.
The grounds are right on the beach, making for a wonderfully relaxing time and a great location for morning breakfast with waves breaking 50mtrs away.
A little dated (as at April 09), scheduled for a major renovation June 09.
A clean resort styled in true Balinese, staff are very helpful and would recommend.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3198,Very disappointing,20,April 2009,"I found this hotel very poor compared with anywhere I've stayed in Bali. Don't get me wrong the location is fantastic but the resort is in desperate need of an upgrade. The bathroom was dark and dingy and overall the hotel was quite dirty. The food at breakfast wasn't fresh and the staff weren't anywhere near as friendly as most other resorts in Bali - and they messed up our booking! So despite the great location, I would recommend staying somewhere else.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3199,"Its a dream, the hotel, the location and most of all the staff!",50,March 2009,"We have stayed at Resor Seminyak four times in the last 2.5 years! We got married there last August and went again for 3 weeks this March! I read all these reviews where people are complaining about the linen or the room and it in my opinion is far from the truth. We had 30 people stay for our wedding party and everyone just loved it! It is great value, on a beautiful beach and the rooms are clean and roomy! We have stayed in other hotels many times all over Bali and this is by far the best!!!! They are fun loving people and are so excited to see us everytime! The massages are great and they have a nice breakfast, and i am fussy when it comes to food. The pool is perfect and with the guys in the pool bar making it even more fun. You can sit by the pool and watch the ocean! (2 pools) There is nearly always a beautiful sunset, the beach is not as crowded as Kuta or Legian and the sellers on the beach are just gorgeous! Bob for watches and Johnny for glasses, mona for Jewlery! I love them and they are now all our friends! We would not stay anywhere else! Love it!!! Love Bali!! Oh and the have fantastic 5 star restaurants at cheap prices in Seminyaks main street!! La luciola, Ultimo, Ku De Ta, all to die for!!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3200,"Great location, nice hotel",50,March 2009,"Pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews, didn't disappoint. Booked the cheapest room available at ¬£75 a night and had a partial sea view. Room was fine with TV and hairdryer and we were picked up from the airport (a 20 min drive). Pool was lovely and location of hotel on beach was impressive. Hotel grounds have balinese touches which were lovely. Managed to bodyboard outside the hotel as there were decent waves every day. Breakfast was great - especally if you manage to get a table by the beach - cereals, eggs cooked to order, pastries, fruit, juices. Sunset visit to Ku De Ta next door a must. Ate at Rumours (a 15 min walk) a few nights - busy, good food, not expensive - rose wine good. Weather was fabulous and March appears to be fairly quiet - can't wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3201,Good location,40,March 2009,This is an excellent spot if you wish to stay in Seminyak. It shares it beachfront location with much more expensive hotels such as the Oberoi. The hotel itself is set in a beautiful garden but the rooms are a bit old and simple.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3202,Great place.. great price!,50,February 2009,"What a great surprise! This place is situated nicely between 2 really pricey hotels! Both of which are above $300 a night! The hotel staff, I felt went above and beyond. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. Loved when I checked in and they knew my name! Great shopping and restaurants are within walking distance!!! Totally recommend staying here.... I can't wait to come back! Great value for your money!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3203,"Resor Resort, Bali",40,February 2009,"The Resor Resort on the beach in Seminak, Bali is a good choice if you are looking for value in a prime location. You'll trade the sparkle and flash of neighboring hotels for enough cash to buy dinner at the La Lucciola...a fabulous restaurant 500m up the beach. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Body Works Spa and 10 minutes walk from several other restaurants and shops. It's best to take a taxi if you are going to the main shopping area on Jalan Raya Seminyak...we walked the 3 miles with our young girls and all felt we deserved the ice cream across from the Bitang Market and the taxi ride back home (under $5 round-trip).

The Australian kids are now back in school and when combined with the uncertain times, the hotel had plenty of available rooms. We brought my daughter's friend along and were able to upgrade to a larger room adjacent to the pool. The deluxe pool-view will give you room for the king-size bed and two twins. The room and the hotel are clean, but just a little worn around the edges. Umbrellas around the pool could use a mild bleach wash to remove mildew stains. If you are willing to look past these bits, you'll have a great time at a nice hotel",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3204,Great for small children,50,January 2009,"After reading mixed reviews of this hotel, I was prepared for sub-standard rooms in a great location. Happily, this was not the case at all. While not incredibly luxurious, the hotel is very nice, and there is nothing at all wrong with the rooms. We upgraded to ""superior"" because we thought two cots would crowd the standard room (in the superior room there was lots of space, even with the cots), and it was wonderful.

This resort is great for people with small children because:
- it is right on the beach
- there is a lot of wide open green space for them to run around, including a football pitch
- there are two nice pools with children's section - you can find shady bits any time of the day
- the staff are incredibly child friendly

They don't have a kids room or any organised activities for children, but we got babysitters through the hotel several times and they were fine.

My only complaint (not even that) is that the restaurant is really average. That said, you are within a very short walk of a number of excellent restaurants. Ku De Ta (also very good for kids for breakfast and lunch) is a two minute walk down the beach.

We also found it very reasonable. After booking standard rooms for $100 a night (in low season), we upgraded to superior for $112 and thought it was very good value.

Oh, only the deluxe rooms have sea views.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3205,Not my first choice in the future,20,January 2009,"The hotel is relatively old, and in places the age shows, not directly run down, but not up-to-date. On the other side it has beautiful garden features, 2 pools and ample open spaces for its size. There is a regular free shuttle bus service to Legian which is handy because the hotel's location is relatively out of the way - which is excellent if you want to avoid the crowds of Kuta!
Taken the price into consideration I would in future look for something else.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3206,Beach front hotel,50,January 2009,I really like this hotel. I've been in this hotel twice and the staff are very very good indeed. It's like they have been programmed to be happy and useful. Resor seminyak provides a shuttle bus from the hotel to Kuta hotel. Great location because is far away from all annoyance you got as a tourist but close enough to Kuta if you want to go clubbing and dining out.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3207,"love the Resor, but oh no!!!!!",40,October 2008,"the Resor is a great quality hotel in a fabulous location. i have stayed there a few times now over the years and the standards seem to have remained the same. the staff are really lovely, rooms a big and airy and the location on Seminyak beach is excellent. while i was there though we were told that they are closing in the early new year, for about 3 years and will re-open as a five star hotel..as if Seminyak needs more of them!.. Seminyak is becoming more westernised with upmarket villa developments and familar branded shops moving in - such a shame. If you are staying in this area, make sure you get out and eat at the local warangs, away from the western/indo food in the upmarket hotels.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3208,Too expensive for what you get,20,September 2008,"We paid 100 USD for the room however, the room was dirty - there were ants under the blanket, bed was uncomfortable and very small pillows. The bathroom was old with rust and was really dirty. I had to place tissue paper on the toilet seat as it looks nasty.

Breakfast was pretty average - we went to Kudeta instead for real fresh orange juice.

To be fair - the garden, pool and location were really good. Very convenient for shopping, clubbing and close distant to nice restaurants.

Check out process was really slow.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3209,dreadful experience,10,August 2008,we booked into this hotel for 3 days at the end of our trip in Bali it was the most expensive hotel that we stayed in during our 3 weeks there and the worst experience of our trip. the hotel is very dated and the lobby and corriders are dark and dingy . when we arrived we were left waiting in the lobby for one and a half hours for our room to be ready. we were shown a room with a balcolny view of a building site when we complained we were told thats all that was available. im not sure that was true. the bed was covered in small insects and the hotel had to be fumigated during our stay. the worst thing was the costant repetetive beats from the ku da te club restauarent next door their full moon party made it impossible to sleep all night when it was so loud it shook the glasses on our table! the spa facilities were a joke very dark and dingy with ants crawling around a dirty old plastic bath with dettol handwash to wash down after being scrubbed! the location is the best in that area the pool is great the waiters are lovely but the lobby staff couldnt care less,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3210,I would not recommend it,10,June 2008,"Our stay here was a really bad experience, particularly as it was our honeymoon. In general the rooms extremely dated and run down and not at all of the standard I would expect from the hotel as described in the brochure. We paid extra for a better room but it wasn't worth the money. It had a dated blue bathroom suite and no balcony, no view and no outside space. We encountered numerous problems at this hotel. After the first night we woke up to find the bed was full of tiny insects. We were understandably horrified and asked to be moved to a different room however they were unwilling to do this. The mattress was changed and the room had to be fumigated. After they had changed the bed covers that evening as I was inspecting the bed (to check for insects) I turned one of the pillows over to discover that it had dried blood on it. Again I was absolutely disgusted with this and the bed covers were changed again the next day. During our stay in this room the toilet made a very loud gurgling noise constantly which made it difficult to sleep. We were reluctant to complain about this as we had already complained about so many things however two days before we were due to leave this hotel the toilet flooded the bathroom. The hotel staff were just going to leave us in a room without a working toilet however this was totally unsatisfactory to us. After we complained bitterly they moved us to another room. This was very inconvenient to us as we only had one day left to go in that hotel. I really would not recommend it as we had nothing but problems during our stay there.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3211,we really loved,50,March 2008,my wife and i spent 6days at this resort in bali march 2008 and found it really great. The staff were really helpfull and freindly and the food and entertainment were good. We would like to return in the future.Th onsite spa was very good and the person who ran the wood hand carving shop made bespoke items at a reasonable cost his name was(Yangdi).If you go do have something made or buy apainting;silverware as this is a poor country relying on tourists.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3212,Relaxing Resor,50,March 2008,Our 5 nights at the Resor were very enjoyable. Our enjoyment was increased greatly by the attitude and service of the friendly and helpful staff. The grounds of the hotel are lovely and the location between the two best breakfast venues in Bali (La Lucciola and Ku de Ta) was perfect. We paid a little extra for a superior room which was very spacious and well equipped (apart from useless hairdryer which cut out every 30 secs). This was the first time we have stayed in North Seminyak and we will definitely return - Resor is a little gem.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3213,cheap luxury,50,June 2007,"I stayed at the Resor Seminyak twice the last two summers and find it an excellent choise! The first time I had only booked for three nights but ended up staying three weeks at the resort.
Great service, good breakfast, fantastic location on the Seminyak beach far away from the craziness of Kuta. I stayed at several hotels on Bali but will for sure choose this again next time I am back!",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3214,Love the Resor,50,January 2008,"Our 4th stay at Resor Seminyak in 10 years.
We have got to know some of the staff quite well, who are always very friendly and helpful.
Starting to look a little rough around the edges outside (from being right on the beach) but soon to be knocked down and rebuilt - which in some ways is quite sad.
Just a nice distance from the madness of Kuta if you want to escape - but only a 10 minute trip on the free shuttle away.
Walking distance from the endless line of restaurants on Jalan Lasmana.
The all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet is a highlight and Happy Hour from 3.00-6.00pm with 1/2 price drinks at the sunken poolbar is another. The spa is great and very reasonably priced.

Will be interested to see if the charm is still there when rebuilt.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3215,Not up to standard,10,December 2007,"I stayed at the Resor Seminyak Taipan Village. They gave me a room directly at a busy street. Very noisy and full of mosquitoes. The TV broke and had to be replaced, the replacement had to be replaced as well. Front desk service is not friendly and lazy. Arriving in torrential rain I ask the concierge for an umbrella, he responded that there is one in my room some 300-400 meters away along a busy street. Management not well educated and thus not able to train staff accordingly. Breakfast buffet not good. It is a tour hotel, for large tour groups at discouted low rates. I won't visit again.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3216,Great place for a break,40,November 2007,"Spent a week there after the hustle and bustle of Singapore.
Everyone really friendly and the hotel was good value.
Although looking its age a little it is the staff that make it a great place.
We were on half board and although the food was good the evening meal was never busy, most prefering the short walk to all the other local places.
Booked a trip covering the main sights through ""Asian Trails"" ended up we were the only two on this with our own taxi and driver complete with guide.
Excellent value and a hell of a day out covering the dance, a visit to the temples and lunch overlooking the volcano to mention but a few.
It did rain but it was mainly overnight and the days were fine if a little humid",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3217,A great hotel!,50,August 2007,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Resor for two weeks at the end of August into September in a deluxe room. We found the hotel to be very well maintained and very clean/tidy with no signs of age. The staff all went out of their way to ensure our stay was a happy one with the typical Balinese warm hospitality. Our room overlooked the pool and the ocean and being very spacious with a Jacuzzi was fantastic. The staff prepared the room twice a day so it always looked immaculate. As for location, if you don‚Äôt want to pay the super high prices of the Legian and Oberoi then the Resor can‚Äôt be matched. It's right next to Ku De Ta and a short walk to lots of good restaurants and bars. A 25 min walk south down the beach will also bring you to Kuta beach and the town behind for further options. I hear what the previous person has to say, I did see the Villas over the road and did think they we're in a bad location. If you can manage to get a room in the central complex, especially a deluxe room then you'll be happy, we were!!!

3218,A tired hotel,20,July 2007,We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and were very glad it was not for longer. Our stay was in the rooms in Taipan village. The accomodation was far from the main hotel and was small dark and dingy. The room including the ensuite although clean needed updating .The statement from the front desk was but the hotel is 18 years old !!!! A poor excuse This hotel is German run and it functions Just about . The fact that an item was stolen on arrival in the reception did not endear this hotel to us.,The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3219,resor heaven,50,April 2007,"We spent 10 nights in Bali at the beginning of April. This hotel is a little gem! It had a truly Balinese feel which we wanted. We spent an evening next door at The Legian and found it your typical 5 star but it felt very sterile and unfriendly.
At the Resor Seminyak we have made friends of many of the staff and intend to return next year.
Placed right on the beach with beautiful grounds and two lovely pools it was heaven. We walked miles alpng the sandy beach. Ther is a lovely little beach side cafe staffed by balinese towards Tanah Lot and we had a large snack, 3 courses with 5 drinks for¬£5! Also you must go to Ultimo, it says its an italian resturant but they serve a wide range of food. Its looks very upmarket and the food is to die for. We had 4 courses each with wine, cocktails etc for ¬£20. The only critisisim of the hotel is if you are on room only as we were the food is a bit pricy compared to outside.
But the friendliness of the staff made up for this with live music and dancing every night.
Our room was spacious, clean, plenty of hot water etc.
Cant wait to return.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3220,"Great location, adequate hotel",30,December 2006,"We spent 8 nights at the Taipan Village in a Deluxe Room over Christmas. Our main reason for selecting this hotel was the location - which is fantastic. If I could stay at the Legian I would, but budget prevails and this is the only moderate priced property I am aware of in walking distance to KuDeTa and La Lucciola. We have stayed before in the main hotel but found the rooms a bit lacking in character. Preferred the room in Taipan Village, back from the round and upstairs. It was clean, although the linen was a bit tired, and nice in an authentic way. The bathroom was semi-open which I always like. A reasonable size - we got two cots in there along with our super king sized bed and a good range of television channels, including Disney, which came in handy when it rained for two days straight.

The buffet breakfast was adequate - great for the kids, although I preferred to wait and indulge in one of the better eating establishments close by. Didn't have a lot of room service, which is expensive considering the local competition, but what we had was ok.

Pool area is nice, although can get a bit rowdy if you get a heavy drinking crowd. Nice big toddler pool for kids and plenty of sunbeds.

Nice staff, forgiving of children and friendly.

If you're not into hanging around the hotel for most of your holiday this could be a really well priced, well situated option for you.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3221,Nice Place,40,November 2006,"We‚Äôve stayed twice in this hotel, and feel it‚Äôs a good place to stay if you manage to get a good deal on the higher end rooms. The location is unbeatable, in the middle of trendy Seminyak, and near the Legian hotel and Ku De Ta restaurant. Go to Ku De Ta for breakfast (order the ricotta pancakes), sunset cocktails, and dinner.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3222,Great hotel and great location,50,September 2006,"Stayed with my wife in this hotel in sept, both in our fifties, for one week and absolutely loved it.
It is right on the beach and in lovely grounds.
The staff were friendly and helpfull.
Breakfast was very good with a choice of hot and cold and you sat overlooking the sea.
The pool and the pool area were both nice and very clean
We ate at the resturant most days and the food was varied and well served up.
Out bedroom was large with a king sized bed in it, and had no problems with our shower or hot water. TV with all english channels.
The hotel is old but that adds to the charm of it, next door is The legion a five star hotel, which we looked around, it is very modern and looked like any other five star hotel anywhere! When we return to Bali we know where we will be staying, The Resor Seminyak.
A great hotel at a resonable price",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3223,Best holiday ever,50,August 2006,"I've written my opinion about 2 hours ago but as it's not been posted, here goes again. We stayed for 3 weeks in one of the most beautiful places we've been to and we're 63 years old and well travelled. The breakfast sitting looking at the Indian Ocean, the smiles on the faces of all the staff, even the gardeners, their genuine curiosity, the way they knew your names after 2 days and yet weren't too familiar - all added to our most memorable holiday ever. The sunsets are spectacular and although the bathrooms may need a little refurbishing they were immaculately clean and there was always a flower on your bed.
Perhaps because I live in Southern Spain I wasn't bothered by the mosquitos as some people say and in August the weather was brilliant. We didn't notice the heat. There's a brilliant Restaurant/bar round the corner from the hotel called Reflexions which can't be beaten for food, friendliness and price. All in all, the experience of a lifetime. I can recommend it to all. Thanks Putri, Ad√©, Puto Mita and all the others.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3224,"So so, but cheap",30,August 2006,"I have little sympathy for people who fail to take precautions against musquitos if travelling with small children to a tropical destination and try to blaim the hotel for their own stupidity. I feel that tells us more about the travellers lack of experience, than the hotel quality.

I spent 8 days at RS from Aug 26 untill Sep 3rd. I did not pay much (about ‚Ç¨55 a night), but still was expecting a little more.

Positive:
The grounds are large and well kept
The location right on the beach is excellent
Right next door to KuDeTa (one of Bali's best restaurants and also the most expensive one)
Price

Negative
Rooms are run down
No steady water temperature in the shower (really quick changes from cold to piping hot. I think that's dangerous, but it is also a pet peeve)
Restaurant is above average for Indonesion food, but way below for other food. Save some money and don't even try any burgers or sandwiches!!
Staff is friendly (everyone is on Bali) but speaks very little English and is mostly clueless

All in all a one-time-experience for me. Strangely chaotic hotel, considering it is owned by Germans. Frequented by them as well, so be prepared to get up at 04:00 to claim a seat at the pool or tip the pool attendants and they will do it for you.

I would stay at the Sofitel (again) in Seminyak next time. More expensive, but far better.

My Seminyak favourites:
Cheap: Resor Seminyak
Money no object: Oberoi (because I like the location better than the other expensive ones)
Best of both worlds: Sofitel Seminyak",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3225,Staying here with a baby? Read this,30,August 2006,"We spent a weekend at Resor Seminyak last week. We arrived to stay in one of the deluxe villas around 8pm and were disappointed to find that it was very close to a road where motorcyles were loudly making their way up and down. The bellboy said it wouldnt be too noisy but we asked to change rooms. None were available. There was a big mosquito net around the bed and the bellboy advised we make good use of it as their were quite a lot of mosquitos. There was no net for the baby cot so I called reception to request one. After 3 more calls to chase it up over the next hour, we were finally told the hotel didnt have a net for a baby cot. After we had unpacked and put the baby to bed, we were then told we could move to a quieter room after all. We declined as we'd already unpacked & the baby was asleep, but then had the worst night sleep in the history of man. The baby had to sleep in our bed, under the net, the roaring of the motorcycles was only semi-drowned out by the intermittant clunking of the airconditioner.

The next afternoon, we packed up and moved rooms & unpacked again. We ate at the hotel restaurant that night, and had a reflexology massage at the spa afterwards, where unbeknown to us, the baby was being bitten alive by mosquitos in his stroller. He was irritable all night from the bites - another bad night sleep for mum and dad. We left for home feeling absolutely exhausted.

The beach is nice, the pool area is good, lots of shade. The restaurant food is standard/average. The initiative of the staff left a lot to be desired, especially that of the ones manning reception when we arrived. I asked to speak to the manager but he/she never seemed to be around.

If you're staying in the villas, ask for one away from the road and take your own mosquito nets if travelling with children.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3226,4-5 star with 3 star prices,40,August 2006,"Looking for a more relaxed resort on the beach, this is the one! Great grounds, pool and beach area and lovely rooms at a good price. Before heading to Lombok for complete serenity, we stayed here for one week for our honeymoon. They have a wonderful oveanfront SPA and friendly service all day. Fun activities for kids and adults at night, but only a 10 minute taxi to Kuta for all the nightlife you need. The great Kudeta restaurant is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel and with live music and a great beach view bar and outdoor restaurant...who needs more. And for us surfers, the break outside the resort can be perfect at times.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3227,Wonderful time at the Resor Seminyak,50,March 2006,"The Resor Seminyak is a lovely hotel. We have been there twice and stayed in the attached ""Tai Pan Village"" which consists of a few cute bungalows in a beautiful garden. I'ts much nicer to stay in one of the bungalows - believe me, although the hotel rooms are slightly closer to the beach. The beach is the same one you have in Kuta (on the sunset side of Bali) just in a more quiet area. The hotel is next to the ""Oberoi"" and the ""The Legian"", two of the most expensive hotels on the island. The hotel has two pools and the breakfast is great - especially because of the great beach view! We will definetly go back to the Resor Seminyak and would recommend it to anyone.",The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa
3228,Relaxtion,50,April 2005,"Having never been to Bali I found this to be a great hotel and a great experience. The hotel I would say is just below excellent for it's standard but above average would not do it justice.

The room I had was 1 below the best option (I think), not sure what it was called, but is was large had it's own A/C, massive bed and tele showing the english Premiere League night and day (awesome). Bathroom was a little below par and there was some renovation works going on 2 floors below but you didn't notice that and it would most likely be over now any way.

It had 2 pools, both nice but nothing flash 1 had a bar in it and the other had the restaurant by it, both right next to the beach so if you want to get salty it was always an option. Happy hour, as in most places went for a bit longer than an hour (not to sure about Balinese time keeping) but it started at 4 and went on till about 8.

Menu wasn't that flash but apart from club sandwiches mid aftenoon by the pool and breakfast who eats at the hotel anyway. What we did have was reasonable for the price.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the taxi drivers were always up for some bargaining.

It is in a quieter area but only about ten minutes to Kuta so you get the best of both worlds. The restaurants were fairly cheap but upmarket and the food was great, about 10 mins walk you could get to 20 odd eateries serving a range of different styles either indoor air conditioned or out door for the less sticky months.

If you are looking for a quiet holiday where you are not too far from the action then I would recommend this place highly, probably suited to those of us who are mildly affluent, not filthy rich but not hard up either.

By the way it is ""Resor Seminyak"" not Resort
