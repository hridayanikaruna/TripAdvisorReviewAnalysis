0,Good location and not lacking anything,40,March 2021,"Booked during covid, and paid about USD 6/ night (IDR 90.000). Not lacking anything, the room and bathroom was clean, located near many itinerary, and the famous Warung Cahaya, Sate Babi Bawah Pohon, and gift shop “Agung” is only a few steps away. The service is pretty good, early check in is available (might vary in other day, remember i stayed during covid). There’s a convenient store next door, so you can grab a beer or any neccesities there.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
1,Room full of smoke,20,December 2019,"Well..
This hotel is good actually..
Comfy, but there is no room for non-smoking people (really non smoking room and non smoking around it)
When i was complaint about this to receiptsionist but no respon just said ""i'll check it"" thats it.
As a result, our room is full of smoke..
We barely can't sleep because of it...
Need some improvement.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
2,Could be much better.,20,October 2019,"I stay for 1 month during October. The staffs in general are friendly & helpful. However, the hotel's linens clearly needs to be replaced. Some have black spots all over, which are pretty gross. In addition, their mop often leaves the room smellier than before and their hot water tank is pretty small, so I had to wait for some time before I could have a hot shower. On top of that, for this 1 month alone, I have experienced 2 blackouts, 1 at night and the other one this morning, which each lasted about 30 minutes. All they offered were apologies, no compensation at all. When I suggested that there should be compensation for my inconveniences, the girl at the reception just directly said no. I am no expert, but I have stayed in so many hotels before and have seen better ways of doing business than that. Hopefully they will fix those all soon.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
3,Staff Holiday,40,February 2019,"With the good lady wife and some associates we booked two rooms that were located near to the reception, the rooms were standard clean and comfortable, the staff maintained the cleanliness over the several days we stayed to very good condition.

The facilities were good and communication with staff was very good and able to answer any inquires we had and resolve any issues we had during our travels.

The hotel was centrally located to restaurants and stores with ease off access to other attractions, without being in the tick of Kuta.

Aside from the poorly maintained bikes that we hired from the hotel, the experience and service that was delivered by the staff at Casa Dasa was exceptional, and very happy with the accommodation.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
4,Budget Stay,30,August 2018,Not to expect a Bali wow from Casa Dasa. This Boutique Hotel is situated in busy street and therefore a noisy area. Rooms were not fantastic but acceptable for a few nights stay over and quick shower. Breakfast available but not a great variety at all. Staff friendly.,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
5,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,10,September 2018,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

When I first arrived I was taken to a room with 2 single beds even though I booked and paid for a queen size bed. When I informed the member of staff ""Martin"" he didn’t seem to care and said “do you want to see the voucher?” I'm not enitrely sure what he meant by ""voucher"" however this has nothing to do with me as I booked and paid for a queen bed.

After 20 minutes of being on the phone he took me to another room with:
- lights that didn’t work
- hairs all over the bed
- a toilet seat that was completely broken
- walls which were all stained
- what seemed to have been cigarette ash on the window ledge right next to the bed
- insects in the room
- a very pungent horrible smell throughout the room.

When I approached him again and reported these problems along with photos that I took of the room he didn’t seem to care at all, he didn’t apologise and simply said we needed to contact the agency for a refund.

The room and hotel looks nothing at all like the photos and I would strongly advise people to think twice about booking a room here.

A very sad start to a trip in such a beautiful country!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
6,Great accommodation at an exceptional price,40,June 2018,"Nice and clean room, a great selection of tasty breakfasts, a pleasant swimming pool, nice and helpful staff, close to dining options, near food, room with free rental scooter.

Thank you, we were very satisfied :-)",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
7,Great value for money!,40,June 2018,"It is our first visit to Bali and I have to say, Casa Dasa did not disappoint. It's a very small hotel which makes the staff extremely personal, they all know when you're in/out of the hotel and are very welcoming. Because of this, I'd say it's perfect for families with kids as it's very secure. The rooms are done out nicely however I wouldn't say they are the cleanest (a few light stains on bed sheets and a big scuff on the wall), having said that, staff do a good job every day doing their best with everyday cleaning and tidying up. Overall, the service of all staff made the hotel for us! Beautiful pool area, and drinks available at the poolside. Staff members picked us up from the airport, very hassle free and also free of charge and then dropped us off in Ubud for a fee of 350,000IDR which was great. Staff are willing to go the extra mile to look after you, in terms of booking the right taxis, sorting any additional requests, etc.
Considering how cheap this hotel was, we were really impressed with the room and service provided. Thank you Casa Dasa!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
8,Average,30,April 2018,"Amenities is very limited, they only provide 2 bottles of water, tea and coffee, 2 bathtowels and toilet paper. The room is clean but the bathroom has a weird smell, like mouldy smell. AC is cold which is good for tropical island like Bali. The main lobby is still under maintenance, so you have to go to the back road for check in. Staff are friendly.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
9,Value for money and lovely staff!,40,February 2017,"We stayed at Casa Dasa in Legian back in February this year. Although a little further back from the beach and touristy-type spots than what we would have liked from our first stay in Bali, we were definitely impressed.

Firstly, the accommodation was really cheap for us – totaling around $110 for 2 people for 3 nights. We had a room on the ground floor right next to the pool area which was great as we weren’t too used to the climate.

The room itself was standard for South-East Asia accommodation. Great air conditioning which was definitely a must while in Bali, the bathroom wasn’t in the greatest condition but that was fine, bottled water was supplied and topped up daily and beds were remade with clean sheets etc. daily also.

Overall, if your wanting to do Bali cheap and aren’t wanting to have the boutique experience the whole time, I would recommend this hotel! When we were staying it was off-peak so some renovations were being done however with this being updated I’m sure it would make for a lovely place to stay.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
10,Maybe check for other options,30,September 2017,"We found it very difficult getting into the pool, tiles are Very slippery in pool and the surrounding area around pool,with wooden planking lifting when trying to walk on,also around the pool,Getting in there a Very steep step, the only way to get in and out, no ladder.
Tiles in the room were also very slippery in shower/ bathroom/ and in the room.
The towels very old with holes in them, no hand towel we bought 1 and left it.
Mini bar was good value and access to hotel bar was Very compatible.
The safe in our room we could take it with us as it wasn't ankord down. The door to the room had dropped so hard to open close. Our toilet was leaking a strong smell of sewage all the time was present we spoke a couple of times but they just cleaned it and put moth balls down , it didn't go to well with my asthma.
It's away from everything, with some cheap and nice food areas close by.we stayed for 12 nites, the staff where great,",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
11,Awful AVOID,10,July 2017,After trying to charge us more for one room instead of two we were given a small room for three of us with a mattress on the floor. Towels were disgusting grey and thin! Bedding smelt damp and unclean. Walls were covered in small bugs the bathroom was revolting with a stench worse than sewers coming from the drain! The ceiling was damp and falling down. This was an awful hotel so we left early without a refund as the man on the desk told us it wasn't 'company policy' to refund. Really not a nice experience.,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
12,Lovely place away from the centre,40,May 2017,"We stayed here for only one night, we opted for the cheapest room which was still beautifully clean and fully equipped. The staff were very friendly and the poolside bar was nice and cheap. It's about half an hours walk to the beach which wasn't a problem for us. Also mopeds are always more than happy to give you a lift! Breakfast wasn't included which was a shame but other than that it was faultless!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
13,Amazing service and beautiful friendly staff,40,May 2017,"My sister and I stayed here for 6 nights the rooms are clean and its in a great spot, the beautiful staff can't do enough for you, The lobby is getting renovated at the moment but you really don't hear it",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
14,Holiday,50,February 2017,"Great budget hotel at great price
Great location
Seminyak bintang supermarket and 66 withing walking distance
Shopping is awesome
Many different restaurants to choose from
Night market is close with many local warung to choose from
Supermarket across road plus gym
Italian restaurant german restaurant chicken restaurant babi guling restaurant just opened",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
15,Reception staffs were not good,40,January 2017,"The Hotel is under renovation atm so it doesnt have lobby whatsoever. The reception was located in an awful small room. The staffs said that they upgraded our rooms from standard to superior. In fact, when I checked on other various booking site the lowest room class is superior indeed. I don't know why they told us they 'upgrade' our room. Do not lie. Reception took a little long.

But, the hotel it self is really nice! Nice pool and restaurant! Feels so homey!

The superior room is big enough for me, clean, aircon is working fine, I get all basic amenities that I need.

Cons:
- small hotel sign, i couldnt find the hotel at first. Make a bigger one soon please.
- staffs
- broken bathroom door in room 111
- really bad reception

Pros:
- everything else is good!
- Cheap",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
16,Feel like home,40,December 2016,"I often stay in casa dasa legian. I love to stay in suite room. there is living room and bedroom in separate area. There is also bathtub on the bathroom. They only have 3 suites, sometimes I stayed in deluxe room. There is also living area in separate area. The minus is only one thing, need renew for towel and I found one damp room (deluxe). Love to come back to stay there with new towel and good smell room.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
17,Good staff,40,November 2016,"The room we had was good , The staff was very helpful and kind and especially Lala the receptionist was the kindest person I met in Bali she was so helpful and so professional . Thank you Lala for making our stay better !",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
18,Not bad,20,August 2016,"You get what you pay for. It is very small but the rooms are ok, we stayed in the standard room for the first night but it was way too dirty and the shower didn't work, so we upgraded to the best room, which was much better but still not the best. Didn't have a huge range for breakfast.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
19,Smelly room,10,July 2016,Well the photos are very deceiving. The room we got was smelly and both doors in the room had broken locks. When I wanted to use the toilet I had to put a bin behind the door to keep it closed. Very happy to be out as we only stayed one night. The bed was very uncomfortable and pillows were old and very flat. Also the room did not have a safe.,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
20,There is worse out there but only just.,10,June 2016,"There are some positives about this hotel:
It is cheap.
It is relatively close to minimarts, the beach, markets and we'll know fast food outlets.
It has a good pool (just not as big as in advertising photos)
Friendly staff with good language skills.

The Bad and Ugly:
Dated, unclean rooms.
A mattress that has seen better days.
Toilet shower area combined with electrical connectors close to water (Anyone hear of OH&S).
Dirty linen and towels.
Flat pillows and only one per person.
The entrance door to room 13 very hard to open.

I would certainly not stay here again.
Do not put you faith in the advertising photos.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
21,Not so boutique really,20,July 2016,"The photos on the booking.com site are deceiving to be honest. The rooms are not pleasant to the eye. The linen on the bed is not crisp white like one would expect, the bathroom is not clean, the furniture is not clean. The pool area and the bar area are nice, however much smaller then the photos on the net. Overall I'm glad we're only sleeping here one night.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
22,Nice Clean Room and Pool,40,May 2016,"From the front side, this hotel looked so-so, but inside you'll find honest and loyal staff with cozy room and nice surrounding area. Situated near the famous Sunset Road, this hotel has minimarket, traditional market, and a lot of other shops nearby.

The swimming pool is small but nice. I only had one complain about the room: The temperature of the hot water was always changing. I need to readjust it lot of time to keep the heat comfortable. Other than that, this hotel is perfect.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
23,Very pleasantly surprised!!,50,May 2016,"Staff very friendly, breakfast order and made fresh. Great location for us as we had
a scooter. Legian/Seminyak not too bad for traffic. The rooms (deluxe) was very
spacious. Would definitely stay here again. Pool is small but also fantastic.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
24,Casa Dasa was great,50,April 2016,"very clean property. rooms were well taken care of. staff was very friendly and helpful. A/C, Fridge, shower worked well. Pool was small but clean and great for a refreshing dip. Didn't get to try food but Bintang was ice cold. For the price you can't beat it and location is outstanding. 4.5 stars so hell I will give them 5.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
25,"""wonderful Boutique Hotel"" thank you casa Dasa...",40,November 2015,"The first day i arrived in this hotel,i really surprise cause everything is unexpected.i have think that before this is just small hotel,without any services or just a simple room,but i am wrong ,the hotel is great ,room is big and clean,garden is nice and also with mini swimming pool,at least i can swim again after the beach..they have a great location to seminyak beach, just 15 minutes by walk and going to another souvenir shop and local food...the staffs are very nice and friendly and very helpful,,
thank you we will come back again...!!!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
26,budget hotel with a great value,40,October 2015,"Good area, Seminyak is within a minutes with bike. comfy bed, everything is clean, friendly staff, stayed there almost every time i visited Bali for more than couple times now. Breakfast also pretty vary.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
27,Great Budget Accommodation,30,November 2015,"Cozy and comfortable, the rooms are quite dated. However, the room rates are dirt cheap and the staff are pleasant. You will be hard pressed to find better value for accommodations in Bali! Its a hotel for travelers on a backpacker budget.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
28,Best staff ever,50,March 2016,The hotel is nice and simple with different kind of accommodations. Rooms are clean and nice. They have good breakfast and bar. Everything was very good. But I really appreciate to the staff. Everybody were very friendly and helpful. I'll come back to this place one day and I hope to see these people again!,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
29,Nothing to be complained.,40,February 2016,"Cheap price, addordable room, good rain shower, spacious and clean. Everything work properly, ac cold and hot water running very well. Location is not to be the main issue since it still near to legian and seminyak. Good hotel!

The coffee n tea making facilities placed inside the drawer under wash basin.

Clean towels, good shower.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
30,Nice hotel location not so strong,40,December 2015,"15 mins walk from Double Six beach and 15 mins taxi ride from Laksamana the main restaurant Road in Seminyak.
Nice hotel and the Suite rooms are massive with 2 large areas and separate shower/toilet area.
I had a junior suite which was a good size with a balcony.
Breakfast choice is good, the staff are all friendly and helpful. There hotel transfer service is very reasonably priced at 125,000 rupiah (£6:50). Location could be better, but try out the local Indonesian restaurant next day for a freshly cooked, low priced meal.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
31,Bali Trip 2016,30,January 2016,"The toilet produced horrible smell. Water from the tap taste different. You have to buy mineral water. However, since we spent most of the time with outdoor activities, we didn't care much. Breakfast was okay. Staffs were friendly and kind. The swimming pool was calm and I think they didn't use chlorine since the water smell nice.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
32,Nice staff,30,January 2016,"The location on nakula street make convinient for us. We book 2 nights standart room. Got room on 2nd floor. Quick check in and check out. The staff is nice. Since the hotel ran out motorcycle to rent, they help me to find one. 2 days motorcycle rent 100k. The room quite big. Ac and water heater working well. 2 bottle mineral water everyday. Wifi didn't working well. The room not so clean. Sticky floor. Dusk in wardrobe cabinet. Bed not comfortable. Blanket to small for 2 people. Pillow has to be replace. The breakfast is nice. 38k for set breakfast. Nice swimming pool. Limited parking area. Lcd tv but the channel limited and not so clear. Got fridge in the room. But no soap, shampoo, etc.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
33,My Casa Dasa stay,30,November 2015,"Arrived late due hold ups..the girl Lala at reception was so lively to tired old me.
My first night was in room one...at the bottom floor near the front...Noisy dark and smelly. She tried to make it as nice as possible for me and promised me a new room next day.
I am now in room 13 still budget but upstairs with deck and windows that let a breeze in...clean and light... I will spend another two weeks here now.
It's so handy to everything in the Legian Seminyak area...great shopping and food.
Bustling and a real time Bali experience

This hotel us great for the budget conscious.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
34,Sweet little treasure,40,September 2015,"Spent for only a night at Suite Room. were underestimated at first before checked in, but then surprised a lot. With the very cheap rate, their bedding, their furniture, sanitary, closet, bath up.. the best !!! they're all modern :)
The room is large, i mean LARGE !!! with own living room. Breakfast was good, But the swimming pool is so cold, maybe because its in the middle of alley, and the wind blows so hard. it is 8,5 for all for this kind of 2* hotel",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
35,AVOID! Worst hotel ever!,10,October 2015,"Can I first start by saying the staff we met seemed polite and friendly and the hotel is very close to the centre of seminyak....there the positives end.
Dirty bedsheets, dusty/dirty walls and furniture, rubbish from previous customers in drawers.
Our bedsheets were stained and not cleaned over the 3 nights we stayed.
The whole room smelled like a sewer and there were ants/flys everywhere.
The bathroom and shower/toilet combo were disgusting.
Towels were not changed/washed, merely just rolled up again for next day.
My boyfriend felt ill the whole time we were there, coughing constantly - he's from a farming family so has a decent immune system!
The walls even had stains on them and the floor was covered in dust and dirt.
We slept on top of the bed and left first thing every morning (showering at a friends hotel nearby) and would not wish this place on our worst enemy. If all your interested in is a roof, air con and a dirty bed then by all means but if u actually want to enjoy ur hotel AVOID!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
36,$28 per night for a superior room. Excellent value for money. Hotel is spotlessly clean and modern.,50,May 2015,Stayed here in May for 16 nights and I were more than comfortable. Clean and modern is how I'd describe this HotelLondon small but well equipped. The Legian good market is across the road and is safe clean and cheap food,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
37,Save your money,20,August 2015,"Hotel came in our package...went with friends and our names werent on list, budget rooms, smelt like sewerage, bed mites, toilet under shower head, bad area, breakfast was budget. Book the higher priced rooms as are slightly better. Staff were very helpful and friendly.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
38,Value for money in Legian/Seminyak,40,July 2015,"For the price, especially in Legian/Seminyak, Casa Dasa represents good value for money. The hotel is reasonably modern with comfortable bed, flat screen TV and fridge in the room. The pool is a decent size, with small cafe next to it. For me all round service has been good. On the downside the location is quiet far from the main areas of Legian/Seminayak. You really need to have a bike it you're going to stay here. The stated distance to the beach on the hotel booking websites is 15 minutes walk, I'm pretty sure its longer than that as it takes around 10 minutes to get there on a bike. Also its quite near some busy roads so can be a little noisy with the sound of traffic, especially if you're near the front of the hotel. Some reviewers have complained about sound problems caused by plumbing - I've heard some noise but not enough to affect the stay, so maybe some rooms are worse than others. Originally planned to stay here for 3 nights and ended up staying for 5, so it can't be that bad.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
39,Avoid at all costs.,10,June 2015,"Room had a massive noise issue, when I went down to change rooms they said thats just the plumbing, which means they actually knew about the noise issue and still booked the room out anyway. I was absolutely disgusted that a hotel would boo k a room with such issues.

They wouldn't let me change rooms that night and I decided to leave the next day. They refused to refund me for my none stayed days.

Internet doesn't work, you can get a better hotel at a cheaper rate with a better location. I would avoid this hotel at all costs.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
40,"Affordable, clean rooms and nice service!",40,June 2015,"I stayed one night at this hotel during my visit to Bali, the staff are so friendly and so sweet, the rooms are clean; however the walls are a bit dirty. But I must say for the price, the accomodation is of very good value. We were about to miss breakfast and they call us form the kitchen to check if we still wanted the breakfast or not!

Very kind staff, always ready to help!

The room we stayed in had a funny structure, the bathroom and showers starts on the left as you enter the room and then the basins are on the right of the corridor!

Why not?!!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
41,Second last on my list of hotels I have stayed in,20,June 2015,"Apart from the spaciousness of the Balcony Suite Room, there's really nothing I can compliment about this property.
- Suggest you book the room without breakfast included. You can get better choices and there is a local food market and McDonalds nearby (if you don't mind walking). At least you get better quality food. There are only three choices for breakfast - American, Continental and Asian. You have to write your order on a piece of paper and give it to the staff. There are only three tables at the 'Restaurant'.
- The fridge in the room was empty. Mini-bar? None!
- The floor of the Suite was unswept and not mopped. Likewise the balcony.
- Housekeeping is terrible. Towels were not changed and they merely folded your used towels to look as if they were replaced with fresh ones. You would be able to see and smell the difference between a used and fresh towel. At least, their beach towels smelled fresh and crisp to touch.
- All shelves and bed panels are grossly dusty, which means the staff did not do a proper housekeeping, like wise with the comment above on the towels.
- Gave feedback to the staff that there is no flask to boil water to make beverages, nothing was done. They put in the complimentary tea and coffee, but did not have the sanity of the mind to include the flask to boil water.
- Bedsheets and pillow covers were stained.
- Water pressure from the shower was intermittent and the toilet floor was slimy.
- Bring your own shampoo and body soap/foam as the housekeeping staff may fail to refill it.
- Be prepared to put up with noise from noisy stayers, especially when they sit at the 'restaurant' near the very small pool.
- No safety deposit box in the room even though it was advertised.
- Some staff are polite and some are plain discourteous!
- Do a 20 seconds walk across to Circle K and stock up your own bottles of water. The two small complimentary bottles of water will not suffice and you will need to pay RP3000 if you request for an additional bottle of water.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
42,"Fair price, good if you are on a buget",30,April 2015,"There isn't really a lobby area, just a small office, but that doesn't really effect your stay, the room is good size and so is the bathroom, could do with refurb but not essential for the price you pay, would use again if I needed a fair price hotel in that area",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
43,Excellent.,40,October 2014,"It was our first time in Bali, the hotel picked us up from the airport on time. We arrived to reception whom gave us some info on the area. Our room was pleasent. double room, tv, fridge, towels, aircon. The pool was a lovely little area perfect after a long day touring. All the staff were always smiling and always happy to help.

lovely little hotel and got a good deal as well.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
44,It is what it is - and for that it's great! Book the superior!,40,December 2014,"I missed my flight and needed 1 night accom in Seminyak at late notice! I jumped online and booked this hotel and it was really cheap - I think $26 - the standard room was pretty old - but we didn't we didn't expect much more for the price. Location is awesome - if you have scooters - 2 min ride from Seminyak beach and near a supermarket ! The pool is small - but really nice! Before I checked out - I asked to see a superior room - it was about $6 more - but so much nicer! and book room only - Sea Circus is an amazing breakfast spot not too far from the hotel ! This is where I will stay every time I come to Bali now - I loved it... and for the people that want to get out and see Bali - Perfect! . Nice to sleep - nice pool - Great ""low cost"" accommodation, it's not pretending to be 5* - so review it that way!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
45,Not really a good hotel,20,December 2014,"+ friendly staff
+ breakfast was okay, but not the juice
+ cheap
+ air con is working good

- ants everywhere, even in our bed!
- very noisy
- our sink was blocked
- terrible location, 15 min walk to some nice places to eat and to the beach. There is not really a footpath so u have to walk on the street.
- no one came to empty our bin or fill up the toilet paper",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
46,Nice budget hotel,40,September 2014,"Stayed for a week, they picked me up from the airport @ 23.30 after booking accommodation a couple of days before arriving. Room was nice & quiet, friendly staff, nice breakfast, movie channels to keep me entertained while I was ill... Local convenience stores literally across the road, under a min to get to one & 2 mins to get to other tops (unless there's traffic, as that one requires crossing a road). I would definitely stay here again. Great location for shops & food. Was weird having a toilet in the same room as shower room with no separation but not a biggy. Hot water, wi-fi & staff that will answer any questions & help when they can.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
47,Worst hotel I've ever stepped foot in,10,September 2014,"I arrived today and to say I was disappointed is a complete understatement. We had asked for a twin room and got one double bed in the tiniest room I've ever seen. The room stunk, the door didn't lock properly, the toilet and shower are in one tiny room together and it STINKS!! We complained to the manager who did absolutely nothing and just sat with his friends and smoked. The soap in our shower was used and the toilet paper hadn't been changed, the room clearly hadn't been turned over. I mentioned I was a travel agent and booked it myself so I knew exactly what we were meant to receive. It is also located next to a construction yard so it was very noisy! It was that bad we went and booked at another hotel. DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
48,"Nice hotel, just a bit unorganized",30,August 2014,"When we arrived at the Hotel, they told us that they had overbooked the rooms, thus we would be upgraded for 2 out of the 3 nights of our stay until our original room was available. The room was very nice for the price with a comfortable queen size bed and flatscreen TV. The shower had no hot water and the toilet/drain smelt terrible after the first use for the remainder of our time (not by our doing). Dont bother to book with breakfast in the morning because the first morning we got 1 grilled cheese each, the second morning we got 1 croissant each, and the third morning we got some sort of chewy egg. Make sure you insist that your room is cleaned the next morning because when we came back from our first day, the breakfast plates were still there with small ants everywhere.
When it came time to move rooms, instead of us packing and then unpacking and then packing the next day, I agreed with the host that we would stay in the upgraded room for the final night and forfeit the breakfast we had already paid for the next morning, yet it still came.
All in all, it is a nice little hotel within walking distance to the shops and beaches, it just needs to get much more organized in terms of service and booking. Maybe we just had bad luck but just be wary.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
49,Nice place,50,August 2014,"Recomended to you , Beautiful place, located not far from the beach and the airport Close to the traditional market His service is very friendly Perfect

50,Fantastic budget hotel,40,August 2013,"This was the first hotel that I stayed in whilst travelling around Indonesia.... Unsure of what to expect - we were hugely impressed with our find. Great location, WONDERFUL landlady (who cooked us breakfast every morning) and great location. The room was very big, clean and modern. Very impressed, would definitely return.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
51,Great place!,40,March 2014,"A great place and good value for money (we found a cheap deal online)

Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights - the rooms are big and very clean with a big tv! Nice balcony with some chairs outside our room. Staff and friendly and really helpful.

I would say the only thing that let's this place down slightly is it's location - it's not far to the beach and restaurants (about 10/15min walk) but it takes with a bit of time as there isn't a path and you have to watch out for peds. But otherwise, this place was spot on!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
52,Excellent accommodation for someone looking for great stay,50,September 2013,"I recently stayed here I had never been to bali before
I was picked up at airport and taken to hotel
They were expecting me and I just showed id and in my room
The young lady who manger is very nice(ashame she married)
But very friendly close to beach about 10mins walk but u can also hire scooters from here
Rooms are clean and tidy air cond and good showers
They also building a swimming pool which be great next time I stay",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
53,"The Price is Right... Oh, there was a roach, too...",40,August 2013,"Given that I'm used to budget traveling, I didn't set my expectations too high for the hotel because it is a budget hotel and what you pay is what you get. So here is my list:

Good Points:
1. They weren't strict with our reservation AT ALL. Our reservation was technically only for 2 people, but my cousin stayed in the hotel the night before so they already knew her. She transferred to our room (so we were 3 all in all), but they didn't credit the additional person in the room. They just made it clear that breakfast would still be for two.
2. They allowed us to print of flight itinerary regardless of the number of pages the IT had. They were just eager to chat one of us up when the pages were being printed (and to think all the pages were colored).
3. The location is good if you want to experience a legit low-cost location of Seminyak. It still gave us a provincial vibe, but had all the necessities we needed i.e. mini-mart, coffee shop, SIM card store, market place all along the same road as the hotel. If you're up for walking, Sunset Road is just 10 minutes away and there's a building with establishments like McDonalds and Starbucks. So yes, for location, I'd give this a thumbs up.
4. While prepping to reserve/book the room, Lala was very quick to coordinate with me especially if I had inquiries on the room, etc. She'd reply within the hour and the responses would be very complete.
5. They provided 2 bottles of mineral water in the ref (yes, there's a ref). You can also refill your water bottle in the common water station near the lobby.

Bad Points:
1. We found a big roach on the night that we stayed. We had to kill it and throw it in the trash. It felt like I was still in the Philippines.
2. The shower is in the same room as the toilet so when you take a bath, the toilet seat and bowl will automatically get wet. I, personally, don't like this set-up and prefer a designated area for shower that will make sure the water doesn't splash elsewhere.
3. There were a lot of mosquitoes in the room when we got back at night. Not sure if one of the windows were kept open but they lent us their insect repellant. I've never seen a ton of mosquitoes in a single room my entire life.

All in all, the hotel was okay. Again, don't set your sights too high because it is a budget hotel. I mean, if you are traveling, the main purpose would be to go around the town to see the sights and eat and not to stay in the hotel to watch TV, right? Oh yeah, they have cable TV so we were updated on a lot of current events.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
54,Perfect for the price,40,June 2013,"First time to Bali and I booked Casa Minha having seen the reviews here. I was on a very tight budget so 190 euro for 9 nights accommodation was ticking the only box I was concerned about.
On arrival I was greeted by a lovely young lady who checked me in with little fuss and she showed me to my room.
My room was large with the all important air con. Huge bathroom and a family sized fridge to keep your water etc cool. 32"" TV with a great selection of channels.
Next morning as I nursed a bit of a hang over there was a knock on my door which I assumed was room service to make up the room. I opened the door to find a young lady with my breakfast on a tray (nice touch). You could set your clock by this service, 8am on the button every morning.
WiFi was available in the room, great for annoying the people back home(Ireland was 7 hours behind me)
On my third day my girlfriend arrived from Thailand to join me. She was not on my reservation but there was no extra charge for her staying 6 nights with me.
All in all, Casa Minha was great for the price paid. Only 1.5 k to the beach with pleanty of shops along the way.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
55,Bit disappointed,30,May 2013,"Stayed here 3 nights having read the amazing reviews. Our experience wasnt very consistent with these reviews.

Positive - large room, comfy bed, AC worked well, big flatscreen TV

Negative - dirty bathroom looked like it hadnt been cleaned in months. Breakfast was a bit poor (toast and tea/coffee). Room was shabby no handle on bathroom door from where it had previously been kicked open and wardrobe doors were jammed wouldnt open properly. Our room was always full of mosquitos and we kept door/ windows closed. We never had our rooms made up or our towels changed. Location not great on corner of busy road and about 25 mins walk to beach.

We have stayed in far worse places, but our experience did not warrant the price or the reviews others had left.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
56,Perfect,50,April 2013,"Best service, the rooms are clean and modern and the friendliest staff, who go out of there way to insure you get the most out of your trip (an especially big thank you to Ibu). Location is great, out of all the craziness but you are just a quick taxi ride or walk to night markets, shops and the beach.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
57,Amazing,50,January 2013,"The staff at Casa Minha are amazing, extremely helpful with everything, drove me places I needed to be, scooters, tailors, shops....everything!
Rooms are really comfortable and clean, aircon, fridge, comfy beds, plenty of cupboard and draw space...
Location is perfect as the beach is a few minutes drive away with heaps of restaurants, bars and shops.

Thanks guys you made me feel very welcome!!
....see ya soon =)",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
58,Great choice for the price,50,March 2013,"Nice and friendly staff. Close enough to the main street and to the beach but far enoughfrom the craziness. The room was very clean and comfortable. The owner offered her own driver to take me to Sanur. Air conditioning, cable tv, fridge...amazing for the price!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
59,Great place,50,September 2012,Nice friendly welcoming owners. Centrally located not far from the beach but not in tourist trap Kuta. I stayed there for 2 months and had a good time thx to Santi and Helio. The service staff has been very helpful and patient with me.,Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
60,Dirty,20,February 2013,"The place seems to have been constructed in the past year, so the room looked new but my recent experience wasnt good. The sheets looked dirty, the bathroom + fridge hadnt been cleaned and when I saw the roach is when I decided to leave.

As nice as they were and as great as the location (2 minutes away from minimarts and across from an awesome local market) I wasn't up for it.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
61,Casa Minha excellent place to stay,50,February 2013,"Casa Minha made our stay in Seminyak, rooms are very clean and fairly spacious. The staff are incredibly friendly and could not do enough for us, including transporting us to and from the airport. We had such a great experience that we returned there during our short stay in Bali as it is fairly near to Denpasar airport. i would definately recommend this accomodation.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
62,"""Casa Minha is Minha Casa""",40,December 2012,"If you do not like this hotel, you are very hard to please :P We used to stay there in a group like 2-6 people. The service and rooms are worth the money, sometimes it can be noisy but that's the whole fun ;) Check in, check out super easy. Rooms were cleaned to an excellent standard every day & this is something I would notice if it was not. The breakfast every morning although I never wake up at breakfast time lol Everyone I met there was lovely.

It is less than 30 min to go to the shopping centre and clubbing at Legian. A taxi ride of about $2-$3 or you can borrow the motorbike if it's available.

If you are after a smaller hotel, clean, good times- I highly recommend. I haven't tried yet to stay in other hotel in Bali coz once I stayed in CASA MINHA, I found this hotel to be only my choice to be MINHA CASA or MY HOME in BALI :) Homey, simple and friendly",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
63,Your homey stay in Bali!,50,February 2013,"Casa Minha, as the name say, is 'my house' & that's exactly the feeling I have anytime I stay there & yes this was not my first stay & definitely will not be my last! Casa Minha is a homey residence for your vacation or business stay, short or long term stay, whatever your needs Casa Minha is one of the best stay in Bali at a very good location with good amenities & at very reasonable rates! And to complete the stay is the friendly services by the management & staff that will treat you as a family!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
64,Personal service,40,November 2012,"One of the many great things about Casa Minha is the personal service provided by the two managers who run Casa Minha.
Helio and Santi are beyond reproach with the service they provide from the moment you get to Denpasar Airport when you are greeted by either Helio or Santi. to the moment you leave you will find both very attentive to your needs.
Santi has numerous contacts which is so beneficial to anyone who stays there as she can more often than not get all your whims catered for from playing golf, surfing, dining, diving and general day trips to parts of the island most people do not get to.
The rooms provided are adequate for couples at the moment but I understand there are new extensions planned which will be villas set up and catering more for the family.
The food provided at the future Franks cafe is still in the process of being worked on but Helios beer chicken is definitely a dish that you should try which is one of Helio's specialties.
The bintang is always cold and with the introduction of a coffee machine in the very near future you will be able to have freshly brewed coffee first thing in the morning.
Overall I found this hotel delightful but the service provided was exceptional and I would recommend it to anyone who is restricted by budget.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
65,We had a great time at Casa Minha!,50,June 2012,"I stayed here for 5 months but it is also very suitable for short stays. The locations is very good (close to the beach, shopping street, a local market and a gym). The rooms are very nice and very clean and new. The owner is very kind and always helpful. She has a lot of good tips about what to visit in the surrounding area and Bali. When I come back to Bali I would definitely stay at Casa Minha again!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
66,Wonderful Place,50,December 2012,"Casa Minha is a very good place to stay for Holiday, the environment is so friendly and it is very cheap with a good quality. It is close to the Shopping center, Clubs, Restaurants, Bars, and much more. And also The Internet connection is excellent.",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
67,My Home in Bali,50,December 2012,"Casa Minha Bali is a funtastic place to stay with reasonable room price. If you travel to Bali and want to stay in a good hotel with cheap price, then Casa Minha Bali is a perfect choice. Located in Seminyak area, close to Double Six beach, close to a gym and supermarkets, makes me easy to get everything I need in walking distance yet when you get in the room, it was so quite and peaceful!

It's location is perfect: close to a local market, the beach, the shopping street of seminyak. gym and all other benefits! Very good price/quality ratio.

72,Above and beyond the call of duty!,50,January 2013,"These guys really do take the meaning of outstanding service to a new level. The owners will literally move heaven and earth to help out their guests.

I got stung with a 1.5 million RP fine from the cops for not having an original copy of the registration for a hired scooter. Went back to the hotel and told them of my experience and the owner jumped in the car with me, went back to the cop, took his details and threatened to report him. The guy s*** himself! Ended up getting all my money back!

These guys really treat their guests as if they were their own family. You won't find another hotel as unique in all of Kuta, Seminyak or Denpasar. Find out for yourself!",Casa Dasa Boutique Hotel
