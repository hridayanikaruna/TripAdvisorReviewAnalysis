0,A Wonderful Experience,50,April 2023,"Kanishka provided us with the ideal holiday in Bali! It is centrally located in Seminyak. Just walk out the door and there are all the shops, restaurants and facilities.
The rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. Our room came with a private pool. The staff are friendly and helpful. We highly recommend Kanishka!",Kanishka Villas
1,Great stay at Kanishka Villas. Will be back again!,50,April 2023,"Great villa to stay at. Very close to things to do and places to dine. Had a wonderful time exploring the area and meeting people. Found accommodations to be first rate
and room to be immaculate. Staff very helpful and friendly. Enjoyed stay so much, am
extending visit to stay at Gending Kedis to enjoy Bali longer.",Kanishka Villas
2,"Golfing plus, holiday",40,April 2023,"On on our previous golfing holiday with mates, we decided to finish off the trip staying in the 'fun' area of Bali, we had a couple of nights at the Kanishka Villas in Seminyak.
A wonderful place.. really clean, comfortable and convenient location.
Close to some good shopping, restaurants and not far from several enjoyable and active night spots.
Many of the Villas have a small, private indoor pool.
Well appointed rooms with Balinese arts, very polite, helpful staff who certainly made you feel at home.
Great value, and we would definitely recommend.",Kanishka Villas
3,Kanishka villa,10,April 2023,"Our stay was for 3 nights, it was a horrible and uncomfortable stay. Service was horrible. The worst staff. Upon checking in and checking out the housekeeping werent helpful with luggage and everything else. The villa was very dirty and not at all maintained. The pool was dirty, all ac was very hot, water from shower was very small, wc was dirty, most of the bulb lamps were off, safe deposit box in rooms were always getting jammed and had to be reset, sofa was old, Upon cleaning, the housekeeping didn’t clear the rubbish bin for 2 days until we had to remind them. At nite, we could hear a lady crying and a man shouting from the next door villa, therefore, walls are very thin and very disturbing. Parking was available infront of each villa, but sadly another car took our space and when we requested and alerted the reception and security that we wanted to park our car, they were rude, not helpful and said that it’s ok, just park far. In the end, we had to park 6 villlas away. Overall, I would rate our stay 2/10. Across kanishka, same lane, there is another villa called Minggu villas. The owner, the staff, the manager and the villa was all up to mark. I would recommend that.",Kanishka Villas
4,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!,10,February 2023,Do not stay here. the place was filthy dirty. Bathrobe had excrement stains. blood on the mattress topper. Damp and mold in every room. Moss everywhere in the garden area. Broken decking. The chopping board was disgusting dirty.,Kanishka Villas
5,Family holiday 5D4N. Both good and bad about this hotel,30,January 2023,"Everything you see on photo is true but actual are much aged.

Design are great but everything feels like a 50yrs old grandma.

From sofa to kitchen to bathrooms with stained toilet bowls and rusty taps, everything else are ok.

In fact the best part of this villa is its private pool but the pool is not kids friendly as it is about 1.3m deep and good for adults mainly. If your young kid swims have to prepare floats.

I took a 2 bedroom villa and the layout is great, pity that everything feels so worn and old and stained. If not this villa I would highly recommend.

Rating,

Location 8/10
Villa design 9/10
Condition of villa 5/10
Service 9/10

There are no mini bar, no resturant on site as only room service provides.

Have room service spa but I have not tried.

Not a modern traveller villa as not enough power points for now modern traveller's that have to charge multiple devices.
My tour agency booked this for me and at less than usd 300/ night for a 2 bedroom villa it's ok.

Overall,
if you are a budget traveller that needs 2 bedrooms and can live with old furniture and equipments in a resort,this villa is good.

If you are a modern traveller that except clean rooms and have high standards for resorts, better consider abit more.

I would still recommend this resort if you like rusty and more authentic villa holiday experience for a low price.",Kanishka Villas
6,Great place to stay in Seminyak,40,October 2022,"We booked this villa due to its great location, which is near several shopping centers and beaches we wanted to check out.
The villa did not disappoint, it has several amenities, including a microwave, a water cooler a coffee machine, a toaster a stove, and a big refrigerator. It also has cutlery’s that get cleaned by the house cleaning crew everyday.
staff were very helpful and cooperative.
The only thing I think that could be improved is the cleanliness of the pillows.
I also wish that they put a railing to the sides of the pool so people don't fall down when walking without paying attention.
In essence: it's a wonderful place to stay, with multiple great places to check out nearby, and good services.",Kanishka Villas
7,Bad experience,10,October 2022,Very bad experience. We are in honeymoon and the bed sheets were dirty and air conditioning is not working good for the room and electricity cut 2 or 3 times at night so the problem they don’t take seriously so we got same problems every day. I don’t recommend for couples or honeymooners,Kanishka Villas
8,Nice & Good Villa,50,August 2022,"My first time visit here, and everything well done, all superb, they prepare everything , clean room, good jetted tub
They always clean room everyday, and every noon they prepare everything like spray insecticide and put some insecticide coil at the back yard to avoid mosquitos
Strategic location, but not noisy at night , Like it so much
I will back here again when I go to Bali",Kanishka Villas
9,This is the beginning of either a sad or happy tale,10,August 2022,"A dear friend of mine is sadly dying with a terminal illness. The end will come soon but in an amazing act of strength he wanted to return to his beloved Bali for one final holiday. I agreed to join him and to relive old memories we decided to stay at Kanishka Villas in Seminyak. My friend made the initial booking via Agoda however for reasons he can not explain, that booking was duplicated from one to two villas for identical dates. When he realised the error (some 72 hours later and more than a month before the scheduled stay he contacted Agoda to advise of the issue and seek a refund of the duplicated booking value. Agoda said they were unable to assist since Kanishka had the funds. Now we are here and Kanishka are saying they are unable to assist. There is no reasonable excuse that between them these two organizations can not find away to correct this situation. Ample notice was provided to Agoda and Kanishka is not booked out, although had the relationship between booking agent and facility been closer this also would not be a reasonable excuse. He has been trying to contact the Sales and Marketing Department of Kanishka who are apparently empowered to resolve this matter however the phone number provided by staff at the Villas does not answer ..... This review will be updated as the matter comes to a conclusion as will my report on the Kanishka Villas",Kanishka Villas
10,pandemic takes a toll,10,January 2022,"This was my second time visit, the first one is pre pandemic I would rated 5/5. But sorry for this time I rated 1/5. When we arrived, we booked room with private jacuzzi, the room was not clean enough, the carpet is old. I didnt expect this when we arrived. The jacuzzi then has trouble, so we request for changing the room; which I spent the night on my first time. The room was so dusty, the jacuzzi is dirty, and also has trouble, there was dead milipede in bathroom shower and the room is so hot: 30 deg c (I have a room temperature) I was afraid my son couldnt sleep with such hot room.

And at night we were sleeping around 9-10am, And I was wide awake around 1am, I could hear a strange sound outside room, like there were someone outside, the sound was like knocking on the door and sound of tree leaves, but somehow it was so noisy I couldnt sleep until pass 2am and I was crying because I was afraid. Then my husband woke up too and said he could hear someone knocking.

It seems the pandemic take a toll on this villa, I have feeling the villa was empty for quite sometime. Then we check out the next day even we booked for 2 nights.",Kanishka Villas
11,"2nd Time staying here. Quality severely deteriorates. INSECTS, COCKROACHES, EVERYWHERE!",10,August 2020,"The first time I booked this villa in February was one of the best stay I've ever experienced. Breakfast was full of variety, villa was clean and spacious, price is affordable (I stayed in Villa 13). Because of this, I decided to return in August (I booked the 2BR villa on the 16th of August 2020 until 20th of August 2020 and stayed in Villa no 1). To my surprise, the quality of this villa became SO BAD that I feel compelled to write this review. Please, I beg the management of Kanishka Villa to take note of this review and return the state of the villa to its former glory.

Big Issues:
1. CLEANLINESS IS NON-EXISTENT. On my second day in the villa, there are LOTS OF COCKROACHES coming out from ALL OVER THE PLACE. I called the housekeeper to spray the whole villa, but there are still cockroaches, both alive and dead all over the villa. I have a huge phobia of roaches and this experience haunts me until this very day. I cannot enjoy the villa after this event and I am scared of going to the bathroom throughout my stay (luckily I did not see any roaches after the second day). The explanation from the housekeeper is that on that day, the villa is undergoing a mass routine spraying. So insecticides in the form of smoke is sprayed all over the villa. That's why the roaches started coming out of their hiding places and lots of dying roaches. However, THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. They should've done this when there are no guests staying at the villa and they should've anticipated this by closing the villa.

2. UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE. I called the receptionist numerous times but most of the time, there were nobody to answer the phone. When I walked out of the villa to the reception desk, I saw that there was no one around. The explanation from the staff is that there are only one staff that day and the villa is severely understaffed that the lone receptionist has multiple jobs so most of the time, he is not behind the desk. This is very annoying. There was one time when I called at 10-11 pm for 30 minutes (with interval of 5 mins) but there was no one to answer the phone. In the afternoon I also called several times around 12 noon but no answer either. They should have arranged for a dedicated receptionist seeing that they advertised ""24 hours concierge service"" on their website. The reality is far from it.

3. BROKEN FACILITIES. On my first night, the AC in the up stair room is broken. I called the technician and it turns out that the freon is depleted. These kinds of things should have been checked before the guests arrived since the maintenance took 30-45 minutes done in the night and it is very disturbing for the guests (and breach of privacy). After he was done, the AC is not very cold either (but enough for us to sleep). I asked the technician why the up stair room AC is not as cold as the down stair room and he said that it's because the AC down stair is DAIKIN but the up stair one is not. This is ridiculous. They should have the same standard for each room. How could each room in the villa has different standard for AC. I remember back in Feb I did not have this issue (the AC in villa 13 is cold).

4. Same as number 3. Broken facility but this time in the bathroom. The Bathtub in the up stair room is broken due to several things. First, the hot water cannot come out. After technicians are called, they said to wait a moment. They tried repairing it for 1 hour and coming and going multiple times but it was not repaired. The hot water eventually came out, but only for 1 min and then the water is cold again (not even remotely enough to fill the bathtub). The hot water storage capacity is not enough to fill one bathtub. Eventually, I decided to take a bath in the cold water, but after several minutes laying there, I realized the bathtub is leaking. With the position of the tab closed, the water slowly drained out so in around 5-10 minutes, it was already almost empty. Totally cannot be used to take a bath. Also, I noticed there was some filth coming out from who-knows where. Please look at the pic I attached, there was some black thing that I dont know come from where after I filled the tub.

Small Issues:

1. Mosquitoes. LOTS OF MOSQUITOES in the villa. We need to constantly spray the villa. On my first night, my friend is awoken in the middle of the night because he is bitten by mosquitoes. In the morning, we request the housekeeper to change the spray because there was SO MUCH MOSQUITOE BLOOD on the linen (my friend stay up for 1 hour trying to kill the mosquitoes inside the veil [kelambu]).On our second night, we sprayed the room first every night and the issue is solved but these kinds of things should have been anticipated by the staffs before the guests arrived. They should've sprayed the room first on our first night.

2. Breakfast selection is so limited. Back in Feb, the selection is diverse (there was cereal, fruits, etc.. an entire book filled with breakfast menu) and we have so many options to choose from. Now, the menu is severely limited (only fried rice/noodle and western option). Only one piece of paper. The standard declines rapidly.

All in all, I WOULD STAY AWAY from this villa if I were you. The STANDARD has DECLINED SO MUCH in just several months. With the Covid going on, there was tons of better villas and hotel that are discounted that is 10000x better than Kanishka Villa and SOOO MUCH better price/quality ratio.",Kanishka Villas
12,Average,30,March 2020,"Stayed in two bedroom pool villa for 3 nights.
Room was clean but old.
Very limited choice for breakfast.
Ordered in-room dining. Did not like it.
Air conditioning need to be upgraded.
Staffs were excellent. Great shuttle bus service around Seminyak area.
Good location but would not recommend for a longer stay.",Kanishka Villas
13,Favourite villa ever!,50,January 2020,"It is our 3rd times stay at kaniskha villa. Always enjoy our stay there.

They offer reasonable price with excellent services!

Fast response butler, free shuttle around seminyak, quiet and peaceful vibes even though the villa is located in a busy Seminyak street.

You can easily find restaurants, supermarkets, spa and massages, shops on walking distance.

Their breakfast also tastes really good ☺️

Since I was there since 2015, I think it is time to renovate the property because it's become older and some parts are old and dull.

But overall, Kaniskha always in our heart and our ""go to"" property when we go to Bali!

Thank you!",Kanishka Villas
14,"Poorly kept, not worth the money, dirty.",20,December 2019,"I booked this villa based on its rating on trip advisor. It is absolutely not worth the money paid. The villa is tired and aged. Furnishings are worn. Mattress is lumpy, pillows stunk so bad they must be damp or musty inside and desperately need replacing.
Thé robe in the wardrobe was musty and smelly as though it had been used many times by others and never washed. This is not what you call a luxury escape away.
The bathroom had a terrible smell which I think is the chemical used to seal the flooring. It’s a strong chemical smell. The shower was mouldy. I felt dirty taking a shower there. Again this isn’t what you expect when paying so much for a hotel. There are so many options in Bali. Don’t waste your money.
Lastly, I upgraded to a pool villa before arrival and I was told we would receive a 10 min welcome massage upon arrival , we were never offered anything like that.
The food is mediocre. The pool was nice but the experience was let down by the tardiness of the furnishings and the cleanliness.
I believe the owners need to invest some money in upgrading the villas. It’s just not up to standard, with so many competitors around. I wish I’d gone back to some of the other villas I’ve stayed at before or booked a 5*hotel.
This villa is a 2 star property at best.
Probably the most poorly furnished property I’ve stayed at in Bali .",Kanishka Villas
15,So close to being really good,40,November 2019,"Lovely place and service was spot on. The Villa was beautiful and being able to come back and dip in the private pool was great. We would take a mid day dip before going out to dinner every night. Then another before bed, so relaxing. The villas are off the main Street so pretty quiet which is nice. It was about a 20 minute walk to the beach which we enjoyed stretching out legs each morning. A lot of good restaurants with in walking distance. So location is a big plus. The bedroom ac was weak, living room one was really strong. Place could use a freshen up but all in all nothing serious. They had water problems for a couple days but it was main line issues no not their fault. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",Kanishka Villas
16,10 year visit,50,November 2019,"We have been coming here for 10 years, staff are like family. Great destination, looking forward to visit 11 in 2020, it’s home way from home for a very relaxing holiday. Private pool villa is excellent. 👍👍",Kanishka Villas
17,If you are going to book make sure you book a two bedroom villa if you want air-conditioning in your eating area,30,February 2019,"Rooms need to be renovated, they are looking very tired. We complained on arrival as the main area we would be living in had no air-conditioning and to their credit they upgraded us. The food included in our package was pretty awful, however the kitchen and dining area was huge and well appointed although you had to walk around the pool to get to the bedroom. The second bedroom was locked so I do not know what the upstairs area was like.
There is an outdoor bathroom which is completely private and a lovely space, the breakfasts were good and whilst the bed was firm it was not uncomfortable. The staff do everything they can to make sure you are comfortable. In our package we had a massage thrown in and the two ladies who came to our room were professional and polite. The massage was also very good.
location wise, it may not be the best part of Seminyak, however everything we wanted to do was no longer than a 20 minute walk away. However there are great restaurants at your door step and all the shopping you could want. We didn't use the pool (although it looked inviting) as it rained every day (dang) so I would check the best time to go to Bali before booking.
We were in room 11 and I would be requesting the same room again as it was quiet and serene, far enough away from the main st to not hear any noise and it was very safe.",Kanishka Villas
18,Return visit,50,October 2019,"Second time here in three years. First time I’ve returned to the same villa. Staff are the same and still amazing! I have not experienced better service in a villa anywhere. It truely is like a mini hotel.

The villa itself is better than I remember it and extremely well maintained. Also just had new bathrooms done.

You won’t find a better villa on the coast at this price or level of service. Highly recommended",Kanishka Villas
19,Awesome experience,50,October 2019,"Kanishka Villas was where we stayed for.our first visit to Bali. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The villa with pool was immaculate and the food service was tasty and timely. I would recommend Kanishka Villas for couples as a chilled, romantic stay. It is walking distance to a lot of restaurants and the beach and if.you don't want.to walk, there are plenty of.tsxis and scooters to catch a lift. Excellent overall",Kanishka Villas
20,"Amazing place to stay, private.",40,September 2019,"We stayed at this venue for 5 nights and had a great time. Located away from the main disco area but in a location close walk to beach and restaurants. Private pool and ver6 friendly staff. Would have no reasons to not go back here.
Great value, great staff. Appreciate your privacy.",Kanishka Villas
21,Kanishka Villas,50,August 2019,"Perfect location in the middle of Seminyak. Kanishka Villas has the most friendly staff and security guards. Great customer service! I would 100% recommend.
Our rooms were cleaned daily and breakfast served right on time.",Kanishka Villas
22,Great location fantastic staff,40,June 2019,"A hotel villa. Staff were fantastic, top level service from each and every person who works there, the staff made our 3 night stay very special . It is a 10 min leisurely walk to beach and great shopping nearby.",Kanishka Villas
23,Looks are deceiving,10,December 2018,"The photos in the brochure and net are deceiving with the villages looking clean and modern however the villas are old, noisy dirty and infested with rats.

My daughter was watching tv in the living room when she noticed something from the corner of her eye, she then looked and as she screamed the rat run away and hid underneath the pool.

My family and I ended moving to Nusa Dua where there are upmarket hotels.

I would definitely not recommend this villas.",Kanishka Villas
24,Everything is good,40,July 2019,"This was a difficult one to review, cos everything is good, but the 1 bedrooms pool villa was a little run down. They are just getting a little old and the maintenance that has been done is a little rough.
But the layout of the Villa is great.
The location is excellent, with Kunti street having some of the best restaurants I have eaten in Bali.
The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble, and they always arrive at the door with a big smile.
The food was good, and always arrived quite quickly.
The complimentary in-house massage was excellent.
The air conditioning was icy cold.",Kanishka Villas
25,in the age of social media who needs privacy,20,June 2019,"For the full long read review, please see the 1st of this series of groupon reviews on hungry fizzio at blogspot

good location, overintrusive service, house itself was ok...nice big indoor lounge area instead of the standard outdoor version, decent sized pool...

besides the fact that 2nd floor can frickin look right into our ground floor villa's bedroom!!! Where is the privacy.

A good looking facade that hides more than a few problems underneath including poor privacy, poorly thought out layout and design.

TL:DR – a reasonable experience if you bring a $200 per night expectation. Not worth $300+ per night, and definitely not worth rack rate of $504 per night. Privacy a real issue. Need to rethink interior design elements. Forgot to give me my massage (but gave it back to me when I demanded it afterwards)",Kanishka Villas
26,Excellent villas and location,50,July 2019,"Stayed at Kanishka villas for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom. The villas are huge with everything you need. The outdoor showers are very relaxing.
The staff were all great and we're only too happy to help.
Breakfast served in Villa each morning was nice and there was a good selection to choose from.
20 minute stroll to the beach and about a dozen restaurants within about 100m from the villas.
We will definitely stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
27,First time in Bali did not disappoint!,50,June 2019,"We booked Kanishka Villas for 2 nights in June 2019. Smooth communication and swift airport transfer ensured my first time arriving overseas and in Bali was relaxed.
Our room was fabulous, staying in the 1 bd hot tub suite. Tasty breakfast included both days included several vegetarian options and fruit. Amenities in room were lovely. Easily organised for us a transfer to our second accommodation and held our bags in reception while we did some shopping. Tidy room, would highly recommend Kanishka Villas for their service and for a wonderful stay!",Kanishka Villas
28,Worst Experience EVER,10,April 2019,"My partner and I stayed in Kanishka Villas an our last night in Bali. We came to Bali for my birthday and specifically chose Kanishka as there was a jetted tub and the place in the photos looked spectacular. However our experience in Kanishka Villas has made it one of the worst places I have stayed at in Bali ever (I’ve been to Bali a good 4 times and I have villa hopped a lot) !

1. We tried to use the jetted tub and wanted to fill it up with warm to hot water. Despite waiting for 45 minutes the water barely filled less than half of the tub, and the water went from Luke warm to cold. Since it was pretty late at night we decided to give it another go the next morning. On top of that, the shower did not have warm water either.

2. We woke up early to fill the jetted tub again. The water was piping hot and turned cold again in 20 minutes. The tub could not be filled again. This time we lodged a complaint with the reception and a maintenance guy told us to retry after half an hour. Half an hour later, the jetted tub was empty. The plug for the jetted tub seemed to be faulty and hence the tub will NEVER be filled completely. After giving up on the jetted tub, the shower had no hot water yet again. We called up reception a good 3-4 times to complain but no action was taken until the very last minute around 11am and we were already showering using cold cold water and it was already time for check out.

3. The interior and decor were old, mouldy, and not maintained well. The floor in the bathroom area was dirty upon arrival and we had to call reception up to give it a good sweep. Taps were rusty as well.

4. Upon checking out, we further complained to the receptionists. The girls at the reception were not very sympathetic to our situation and refused to give us a refund.

Totally not worth the money we paid for the 1 night stay. There are definitely many other better accommodations out there that are more up to par to their ratings, and I would definitely not come back to Kanishka Villas again.",Kanishka Villas
29,Marina and Colin,50,May 2019,"We stayed in Kanishka Villas for a week! All the staff at Kanishka were wonderful! Breakfast came in time every morning, our complimentary foot massages were amazing as were the couples massages
We had in our villa. The pool was cleaned every morning and our room was made up daily with clean towels etc. I loved how our bed was turned down for us every night! I would highly recommend Kanishka villas. Lily on the front desk helped us to hire a motor bike and also with our transport . We will be back.",Kanishka Villas
30,Average,30,January 2019,"I booked kanishka villas for my mini-moon.
The front of desk staff we very lovely and friendly. The villas are a little worn and aged needs a little bit of a face lift.
I booked this place as it's stated it has a butler service but it seems they don't it's more like room service staff. It did have a pleasant stay other than I they had vanished a pillar outside of the villa I was staying. I became faint and sick from the fumes as they were stuck in the bedroom even though all doors were closed all day. I had to demand to be given another villa to stay.",Kanishka Villas
31,Fantastic stay for our honeymoon,50,April 2019,"Our stay here was for five nights. We had a private pool villa and wow! It has been amazing. The staff have gone out of their way to assist. The villa is very clean, being serviced twice daily. Breakfast is fantastic, a great selection to choose from and arriving promptly every morning. The location is great, walking distance to so many things in Seminyak. The only downfall would be the temperature of the shower but given it has been so hot we have been fine with this. Thanks for making our stay memorable.",Kanishka Villas
32,Great spot in Seminyak.,50,April 2019,"We stayed at Kanishka Villas for second week of our honeymoon and were blown away when we walked in. The one bedroom villa itself is more like a house than a hotel room. Fully self-contained kitchen, lounge room and dining area, then you open sliding doors onto a private pool and deck. There are stepping stones that lead across to the bedroom and bathroom. Some of the decor is a bit battered and worse for wear, but it’s all perfectly functional and you don’t even notice it. The staff are lovely, and the 24-hr butler service is fab. We had a deal that included and lunch and dinner, but with all he food options nearby didn’t get a chance to use them. Massages are done in your villa, which was amazing. And breakfast comes to you every morning, so no queues at the buffet. Housekeeping is twice a day, once to clean and restock, and once for a turn down service and a spray of the rooms for mosquitos, and to light coils in the outdoor bathroom. The location is perfect, right in the middle of Seminyak, with shopping and eating just next door. There can be a bit of street noise heard in the villa, and with the large villas opposite, you may also be privy to some of the party noise that goes on in there, but once you’re in the courtyard and bedroom, most of that disappears. If you’re not too hung up on staying right on the beach, I’d say give this place a try. I’d happily come back.",Kanishka Villas
33,Horrible ... totally ripped off ... please avoid,10,April 2019,I never write any review but the feeling of being cheated and being robbed off my vacation made me to write this one. We came for a family vacation and from the time we checked in our experience was nothing less than horrific. The staff at the reception are totally impolite and doesn't have any basic knowledge on how to be pleasant to the guests. The villa is supposed to be a 5 star accommodation but it was no way close to a 3 star. They don't even have a their own restaurant that we have to order from the limited menu they offer which they get it from outside. The shower was not working properly and the entire villa was outdated lacking any sort of maintenance. The toiletries they offered were of very poor quality which u wont expect in a 5 star villa. The front office staff were not accommodating any of the requests and were trying to avoid whatever you ask for. Over all it was an unpleasant experience and i couldn't beat myself more for choosing this Kanishka villa as for the money i paid the experience was terrible.,Kanishka Villas
34,Ripped off,30,April 2019,"Nice room and good location, service and staff very helpful but bathroom was very smelly and jacuzzi very dirty on the bottom and we had to drain water and clean it then refill jacuzzi(not something you want to do on your holiday) - we ordered a one bedroom suite with jacuzzi for 4 nights but 1st night we got a standard suite. Cheaper room loosing at least $100 we asked if we could get free mini bar to make up for the lost money (spent $20 on mini bar) but refused and no refund was offered. Rest of the stay we got the one bedroom suite as ordered but was completely different to what was advertised disappointed wouldn’t come back and would definitely not recommend as we lost $100",Kanishka Villas
35,Amazing private pool villa,50,March 2019,"My husband and I had an amazing stay at Kanishka. The pool villa is tucked away and you barely hear anything from the outside.
The location to the Main Street of shopping was just around the corner.
A water filter supply of water was enjoyed in the room as well as complimentary bottled water daily.
Our villa was cleaned daily with mosquito coils lit in the evening to deter the obvious.
The bed was a little firm for my liking (I’m precious, I sleep on latex pillows and mattress) and the pillows were large and voluminous however too big for my small shoulders.
Highly recommended staying here if you are a couple wanting privacy. We don’t have children and that’s how we like it so the private pool was bliss. Wish I had more photos to post.",Kanishka Villas
36,fabulous seminyak location,50,March 2019,"Superb location in Seminyak, near good restaurants, Taco Beach; Made’s Warung, Queen’s Tandoor Indian food.

Fantastic friendly service.
Travelled as a couple.",Kanishka Villas
37,An awesome stay,50,March 2019,"Stayed at the private pool villa and really enjoyed the comfort and cleanliness of the villas. The staff are very friendly and sincere. The breakfast had lots of choices and was freshly delivered to our room which was included.

I really recommend Kanishka Villas to anyone that is going to be staying in Saminyak.",Kanishka Villas
38,Disapointing,30,February 2019,"We were very disappointed with our stay, we had asked for 5 star accommodation, but when we entered our Villa we felt very let down, the bedroom was clean and comfortable but we had a very small closed in terrace with a jacuzzi and only enough room for 2 chairs and a table so no where to relax and no sun loungers. There was no bar or pool to sit around which meant we had a 25 minute walk to the beach if we wanted to sit and relax outside. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast that was brought to our villa each day was very good.",Kanishka Villas
39,Seminyak Escape,50,February 2019,"After we attended the wedding on the Bukit Peninsula, the girls wanted even more boutique shopping and the boys were looking for a few sports bars to some watch live sport so it was off to Seminyak where we stayed at Gending Kedis’s sister property; the Kanishka private villa estate. It was conveniently located right in the heart of Seminyak just off Jalan Raya Seminyak near Bali Deli Supermarket. The girls were ecstatic that there were so many nearby shopping expeditions to be enjoyed and the boys went from Mrs Sippy to Potato Head and Nirwana Sports Bar. We were able to walk to Ku De Ta and Seminyak Beach and there were plenty of great casual dining opportunities in our street along with ATM’s and convenience stores. The Villas were fabulous with private plunge pools right next to the lounge areas and the bedrooms were exceptionally spacious. Kanishka has wonderful staff, an excellent standard of modern accommodation and the perfect Seminyak location. We will have no qualms in re booking at both properties or referring all of our friends and family.",Kanishka Villas
40,"Kanishka Villas worst stay ever
Not worth to be rated 5 star and its over priced.",10,February 2019,"They served me a coffee and the milk was spoiled

Also they didnt even had a univetsal adapt.
The hotel staff was running their own side business selling us tour tickets and pocketing money.
Requsted for an universal adapter but they didnt had none. Shock to know the hotel doesnt provide an adapter
Very bad customer service. Didnt help us on our check oit.
They were more intetested in checking out the fridge if we have consumed any of the items.
It was my birthday and there was not even a wishe or proper welcome from the hotel.
We had to help ourself with the luagge while leaving the hotel.
No airport transfer.

No proper information or guidance from the staff.
Overall very unplesant stay for us.",Kanishka Villas
41,Perfect Seminyak location,30,January 2019,"These villas are a little bit older well loved and perfectly located to Seminyak eats and shops . We walked into a lovely open plan living area , fully equipped , through the private open air pool area then to bedroom and bathroom . We enjoyed our 4 nights here , breakfast set up at table every morning and nothing was any trouble for the staff , would def stay again .",Kanishka Villas
42,Worst Experience Ever,10,January 2019,"Nothing like the pictures on the website, bed sheets had stains that looked like poo stains. The villa needs a lot of work and should not be listed as a 5 star villa. Had book for 10 nights only managed to stay there for 1 night and had to check out and find another place.",Kanishka Villas
43,6* Accommodation,50,January 2019,"Thank you all so much for our fantastic stay, from checking in,our 6* Room (in our eyes) to our tour, you couldn't of done any more to make our stay perfect. Breakfast was amazing & the staff are so welcoming, efficient & friendly. Will definitely be back.",Kanishka Villas
44,"Great Villa, fantastic location",40,January 2019,"Stayed I. A one bedroom pool villa. Service was great, breakfast delivered to the villa each morning was great. Great sized villa, with large bathroom, including open air shower. Short stroll to the Main Street of Seminyak, lots of shopping and restaurants on the door step. Has a convenience store and the start of the lane way. Villa and pool kept very clean. Enjoyed the stay here immensely.",Kanishka Villas
45,Honeymoon in Kanishka,50,November 2018,"We bought the 4D3N package in Fave.com and it was totally worth it. The price is around Rp4.740.000 (around 300USD) for the stay in the private pool villas, breakfast every morning, one romantic dinner, one airport transportation, and 20 mins of massage. Worth every penny.

The location is very strategic and you can easily stroll around Seminyak, not so far to from the beach for the sunset.

The service is incredible, we really had a pleasent stay there. Not to the mention their food is very yummy (for the dinner); for the breakfast not so special for the taste but very instagramable haha. Please try their beef strogannof pizza, super delicious.

The villa is also so comfortable you got everything there the kicthen is all set, living room with tv, nice bath tub, cozy big bed, life is good.

The only down part of my visit is that the one bedroom villa with private pool is all full booked so I got the two bedroom villa with a private pool, which makes the room bigger and that is very spooky at night when there is only the two of you in the house🤣",Kanishka Villas
46,3rd time in the Kanishka,50,October 2018,"I stayed in Kanishka for 3 nights in October 2018. This was my third time staying in Kanishka. And just like before the service was excellent; we got breakfast to the villa, housekeeping every day and the staff helped us with everything we needed. We had a 2 bedroom villa with a private pool. The villas are extremely spacious and have a really nice vibe and decor. The bathrooms too were so beautiful with a whole lot of plants and an outside feel to them. Also the location of Kanishka is excellent, being right in the heart of Seminyak. Theres are restaurants just 2 min walk from Kanishka, and many boutique shops around. The beach is also near, 15min walk or just a 5min drive. This was also the first time we had motorbikes while staying in Kanishka, as previously we used taxis.
Overall we had a great few nights in Kanishka. I can definitely recommend.",Kanishka Villas
47,Our accommodation at Seminyak,50,November 2018,"Our stay at Kanishka Villas was incredible, this being our first trip to Bali. The staff were always helpful and obliging. The facilities were clean, comfortable and relaxing. I would recommend Kanishka Villas to my friends.",Kanishka Villas
48,Bad end for our honey-moon,20,November 2018,"We booked to this Villas for the last 2 days of our honey-moon. The room given was old and damaged, when we Tried to zwitch on the Massage-pool (it is not a jacuzzi), a lot of dirty comes out and regulations was not working. They changed our room, the New one was a little bit Better, the air-opened bathroom is to warm, a bad idea for Bali. Two stars almost for this Villas. Before leaving they asked us about the payment of some water from the mini-bar we didn't drink, after a discussion we payed for it. Photos on booking.com are photo-shop Made, it is not as it looks like.",Kanishka Villas
49,Good stay with spacious villa and attentive staff,40,November 2018,"We were quite worry after we made the booking and read the negative reviews. However, it turns out fantastic. Especially the swimming pool. My gal and myself enjoy our stay so much here. The staff is very helful for all of our requests too. Breakfast selections are good and they send the breakfast to our room with our selected timing. They also send some sweet desserts in the evening to the room too. Will definitely come back again.",Kanishka Villas
50,A little disappointing,30,October 2018,Booked a 1 bed villa which was rated 4.5 stars and looked magnificent on the website. Was quite disappointed as we were actually given a two bed apartment and the furnishings were extremely tires. No hot water all week in bathroom even though we advised reception it wasnt fixed. Also had to request for unit to be cleaned on two occassions.,Kanishka Villas
51,BEST VILLA,50,September 2018,Amazing villa absolutely stunning spent my honeymoon there. Staff go out of their way to assist and really friendly. Amazing staff at housekeeping. Will definitely be staying there again. Thank you so much to all the staff at kanishka villas,Kanishka Villas
52,AMAZING RETREAT - DONT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,50,September 2018,"My partner and I are currently staying here at the end of our 2 and a half weeks travel through Bali/the islands and I honestly cannot believe there are any negative reviews about it - I never write reviews but I had to say something. The staff are attentive and friendly - super accommodating. The villa itself is immaculate, spacious, tastefully decorated, and is equipped with mostly anything you could need - we hardly felt the need to leave and if you do need something you can walk one minute to the mini mart. There was a hot bath literally waiting for me on arrival filled with rose petals, all the food we got was tasty and well portioned, breakfast was included and there is a shuttle to drop you anywhere in Seminyak. It’s a lovely 20 minutes walk to the main stores and hot spots. Anyone complaining must have expected the Ritz or something because I cannot fault this place anywhere.",Kanishka Villas
53,Good but dated,40,September 2018,"There's lots to like about this place. The lounge and bedroom, on the surface look lovely with the big balinese style furniture, and the rooms are certainly big enough. However the kitchen and bathroom were very dated. As we had come to pretty much just rest, the plunge pool and the comfortable lounge for hanging around in were great. The food is adequate (just). The staff were lovely, friendly and (except when we really needed it) accomodating. Don't be mislead by the word 'butler'. The services provided by the 'butler' were only what you would expect from a place looking to please it's clients. The one time we needed something special it was not possible for them to provide (we had both succumbed to 'bali belly' and wanted some hydro coco liquid from the minimart (2 minutes walk away). We rang reception but they said 'no', we had to go get that ourselves. Obviously if we could have walked that far we would have. So apart from that, the faded nature of bathroom and kitchen and the poor food, it was good.",Kanishka Villas
54,Nice Villa,50,September 2018,"An ideal villas for couples as it is very private and my first time having breakfast in a villa instead of going to restaurants where u can choose to eat like a buffet spread. Overall the service the hotel staff i would like to say 10/10.

I will definitely come and stay here again with my future partner",Kanishka Villas
55,Below Average,10,September 2018,"Old and in need of work, The included breakfast was rubbish couldn’t eat it had to go get our own. Kitchen and fridge full of ants. Decor old and worn. Kitchen was not functional. Photos on web site must have been taken when new. Staff were good though.",Kanishka Villas
56,Nice Villas in Seminyak,40,September 2018,"We stayed at Kanishka Villas for 7 nights in a two bedroom pool villa. It's everything you would expect in Bali, lots of wood and marble and friendly welcoming staff. The villa has plenty of room with a downstairs lounge area overlooking the pool and an upstairs lounge in the main bedroom. The pool with its own small waterfall feature is a nice relaxing spot to escape from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. There are plenty of good restaurants in the general area so it's not necessary to head down to ""Eat Street"" everytime for something to eat. The WiFi was good and there is a good selection of movie and TV channels. We only had breakfasts from the kitchen which were delivered to our villa and they were very nice and considering it was room service it was very well priced as were other meals on the menu. The only real negative we found was the level of noise that entered the villa from outside. I think this was due to the main bathroom being open to the outside and it allowed a lot more noise to come through into the villa. Still,this didn't ruin our stay.",Kanishka Villas
57,Great stay for honeymoon,40,October 2017,"Stayed here for our honeymoon last September. Had a great time, staff attentive, regular with their cleaning & mosquito control.

Villa was beautiful, private pool, large living space. Breakfast was great too, arrived exactly when requested.",Kanishka Villas
58,Jacuzzi one bedroom villa in August peak season,50,August 2018,"Service was excellent start to finish.Very attentive staff and our suite was very clean. Jacuzzi suite is located upstairs. We bought a Groupon package that had rose petals in pre-filled tubs, pre cooled air conditioned room, local fruit platter and swan towel with flowers on our bed greeting us upon arrival.
It was a great start and it got better. The package has 30 minute massage for each person and it was very professional - a great intro to the spas they offer here. They have a huge spread for the breakfast service. Coffee and omelette was nice and warm upon arrival - such a generous spread!
At night they bring mosquito coils and fumigate your room (with your consent) so the bugs don't bite. There is a nice sheer mosquito netting over the bed anyway.
they noticed it was my birthday when they obtained my ID and sent a small birthday cake too , which I thought was really really sweet.

Would stay here again!",Kanishka Villas
59,Warm Balinese hospitality,50,July 2018,"The staff at Kanishaka Villas truly made our experience in Bali that much better. They were always hands on polite and ready to help and advise accordingly.

The villas were always pristine. The staff always fumigated and laid out the mosquito nets in the evenings so bites were a none issue:-). Kanishika Villas definitely lived up to what we saw in the brochures.

Many thanks to Agus,Edward and Puta to name a few. You guys were great and made our stay very accommodating. We shall be back.",Kanishka Villas
60,Very good experience,50,July 2018,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kanishka villas, very good hospitality from the staff at the villas who were all so friendly right from when we arrived until the day we left. The efficiency from staff was also impressive as they were always there at hand to help with anything from booking excursions, to booking transport and also any late food order we needed to make. The villas are also very well maintained and live up to the pictures displayed in their images. I will definitely be staying here again when I come back to Bali and I would highly recommend Kanishka Villas for a good relaxing experience and holiday.",Kanishka Villas
61,Beautiful villa and great staff,50,August 2018,"Kanishka villas was nothing short of amazing. Friendly helpful staff, great food, WiFi and sound system. Our pool was also amazing and the villa itself was just like the photos. A stay I won't forget.",Kanishka Villas
62,A bit ordinary,30,June 2018,"We were in a villa at the rear of the property. It was very pleasant, but because there are villas upstairs above our villa, our courtyard was always in shade and quite noisy at night, and the water was cold. Not the private paradise we were expecting.
We timed that it took us about 40 minutes the first time we walked to the beach, past every shop, massage salon and tattoo parlour in Seminyak, dodging motor bikes: the hotel map is just an optimistic guide. It is far from the beach, a $4 taxi/half an hour journey. Not a fun walk if you just want to walk for leisure and exercise. It's very close to the freeway, so convenient when being dropped back. It was a good half hour drive to the beach and to restaurants like Sardine, due to position and traffic.
Was there a butler service? I saw the man who bought the breakfast, and we spoke to someone in the office most days. No-one seemed particularly friendly or helpful.
The food is bought in for breakfast, from another kitchen somewhere, so the hot breakfast is not hot and pretty ordinary. You are better to go out.
Our villa was clean and we did enjoy our stay, but Seminyak is just so crowded, and not my cup of tea!
Conclusion: OK villa, too far from beach for us, and bring your own shampoo and conditioner and soap, theirs was pretty ordinary, and hardly replaced during 5 days.",Kanishka Villas
63,One of the best stays I ever had,40,May 2018,"Spacious & clean villas, courteous staff, beautiful rooms and peaceful. This place is everything I need in my vacation stay. It's perfect for everyone - couples, families, friends..

Location is perfect. Lively streets and beach on walkable distance. Staff is really helpful. They can also arrange a 2-wheeler for you with pick and drop.

Only drawback was breakfast menu. It's not very exhaustive.

Whenever I visit Bali, I would love to stay at this place again.",Kanishka Villas
64,Romantic,50,June 2018,"This villas are very romantic..
I have stayed in one bedroom pool villa for 2 nights..and it totally worth it...
Very good are facilities available...
Butler on call 24 hours...
Breakfast served in villa..",Kanishka Villas
65,I’m in ❤️ with Kanishka Villa,40,April 2018,"Our stay is for 4 nights... I would like to say thank you to Staff Agus for your all your prompt service & recommendations, me & Husband really appreciates so much. It’s a perfect stay for honeymoon, families or Travelers that love to keep away from nightclubs. Our rooms no.19 (pool Villa), really love the cozy master bedroom. Housekeeping will come twice a day to Ensure your room is clean and tidy.. room facilities is well equipped. The staff is always smiling and greet ❤️❤️
If you’re looking for nearby restaurants, I would recommend WARUNG ITALIA, just 1-2 minutes away from the Villa... should try the pizzas, yummy! 🍕
-seminyak beach , it’s about 5-10 mins walk, can ask the friendly local for directions
- self laundry is just opp Villa (laundry 2 go)
-If you’re planning to buy souvenirs, go to AGUNG BALI, the price is way 50% cheaper than buying on the streets
Dear Kanishka Villa, Thank you for this wonderful memories... This Villa would definitely a come back for Us❤️💋",Kanishka Villas
66,"A relaxing holiday in a private villa in Seminyak, Bali",50,February 2018,"I loved everything about the facilities, service, ambience and privacy my husband and i enjoyed at Kanishka Villas, Seminyak, Bali. We were thoroughly spoiled, with breakfasts daily, a choice of lunches or dinners, all served in our dining room by attentive, polite, smiling staff. Our villa was cleaned daily and special touches like an evening beverage with pastries, our four-poster bed turned down and the private pool cleaned fof our enjoyment. We had booked a romantic dinner for two to celebrate Valentine's Day and were delighted at the way our patio and pool were decorated for our special celebration. Kanisha Villas is set in a quiet laneway, with shops, restaurants, supermarkets, beauty salons and art galleries along the main street. It is also a short stroll or a chauffeured complimentary drive offered by the Villas to a major shopping precinct along Seminyak Road and not far from the beach. In the evenings, colourful beanbag cover the shores and guests are entertained to live music. I highly recommend Kanishka Villas to travellers looking for a quiet retreat, pampering and privacy away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas in Bali. I can't wait to go back for another stay in Paradise.",Kanishka Villas
67,Best holiday ever,40,April 2018,We had an amazing time in Bali. Staying at kanishka villa is very relaxing. We enjoyed having breakfast served every morning while our kids enjoy swimming at the private pool. Definitely a yes for a return visit.,Kanishka Villas
68,The best holiday I have had,50,April 2018,"Kanishka Villas have private pool, butler service, a la carte breakfast, daily room and pool service and bed turndown, outdoor bathrooms, kitchen and dining area, very reasonably priced meals served in villa, massage in villa, airport transfers and local transport in Seminyak. In-room barbecue cooked at poolside and served at dining table was unbelievable. Plate of cakes delivered to room nightly. Located in a very quiet area of Seminyak. If you want a relaxing holiday with all amenities this is the place for you. Cab fare to Kuta and Legian only about A$3-4.00. Ideal for families or two couples as one double bedroom and bathroom is located next to the pool and second bedroom (with lounge) and bathroom is located upstairs",Kanishka Villas
69,Luxury in the heart of Seminyak,50,April 2018,"Our stay in a two bedrooms villa was great,

Kanishka Villas is located in the heart of Seminyak, on a quiet private street a couple minutes walk to the busy Jl Raya Seminyak and a short drive away from double six beach (the hotel offers a free shuttle service to take you around Seminyak which means you probably won't even need to book a cab if you stay in the area).

There are several restaurants and spas on the same street of the hotel (we tried Bale Bali and the Meiso spa, both highly recommended) and a lot of shops on the main road but honestly the villa is so comfortable that you may well prefer to stay in and lounge by your private pool.

Both bedrooms had a queen size bed, en suite bathroom and a flat screen TV. The living room/dining area was spacious with direct access to the pool, a large TV, DVD player and stereo and a fully equipped kitchen with several appliances such as coffee maker, toaster, a microwave etc.

Breakfast was included with a choice of continental, American, Indonesian or vegetarian food. Although we didn't order in because we wanted to try the restaurants nearby, the hotel kitchen offers (I believe round the clock) in room dining

The villa was serviced every day which means the entire house is tidied up, the pool cleaned, the towels changed and the dishes washed up and there is a turn down service at night. Every time we interacted with the staff we found them friendly, attentive and willing to help

I am trying hard to find something I didn't like about our holiday at the villa but all I can think of is that I wish we'd stayed a few more nights!",Kanishka Villas
70,Ok ....But nothing special,30,February 2018,"We had the jaccuzi room for 2 nights and were not overally impressed. The room was a bit dated, the bed was rock hard and the jaccuzzi was old, rusty and took up to half hour to fill and the water was slightly brown.

We then paid for the upgrade for the pool villa which was a step up. This was very nice but the furnishings were rusty and dated.
The room service was awesome, cleaning was good, our airconditoner leaked and we had to get room service in twice to fix this - the bed was again rock hard which they eventually found a mattress to change on our last night. Staff very friendly and helpful. Location is good if you want to be near the markets, the beach was a further trek.
for the money we paid i do not think it was worth it - my advice get the pool villa as the private pool made the difference :)",Kanishka Villas
71,Great stay,50,March 2018,"Stayed here for 6 nights in March, didn't want it to end!
The staff are so friendly and helpful. We stayed in a one bedroom villa which was located away from the street and was very spacious.
Breakfast was delivered every morning, and later in the day the mosquito net put down for you.
The location was great, a 10 minute walk to Seminyak Square, but with plenty restaurants and shops even closer.
Cannot recommend this place enough :)",Kanishka Villas
72,A stay close to perfection,40,February 2018,"I will start with the positive aspects: the pool villa we stayed in was spacious, in pretty good conditions (we got a towels hanger situation but appart from that the room was far from being ""tired""). It was big, it was plush, it was authentic. The pool was decently sized for a 1 bedroom villa, very private (no windows overlooking). The breakfast was ok (I liked the Monday special, it was really - but some other days not up to standards), staff was very nice and considerate. Location, although not exactly walking distance to the beach (which can be very annoying if you stay in jacuzzi suite since there is not common pool), was still quite central. walking distance to bars and eateries. Very nice massage place RIGHT IN FRONT (Soothe, I strongly recommend).

I would have given 5 stars if the reservation people were a bit interested in customer service. I have to mentioned that I am not one to request for free upgrade (never happened), and here my request was not exactly a request for free upgrade since there was a false advertisement situation on the partner's website.

I booked this villa for a short trip celebrating my partner's birthday. The website through which I booked the villa, Hotelquickly, was not clear at all, it mentions ""villa double bed"" and shows a picture of a bedroom with a pool clearly showing through the windows. When I understood that it would be a different category than what was advertised, I immediately contacted management (about a month before check in) to see what this was about and to ensure that they would at least try to allocate me to the type of bedroom advertised. After all, it's low season, I saw recent comments of people being upgraded and in my case, I am more than anyone eligible for an ""upgrade"" since the website was showing a pool villa. The reply I got from Retno (in charge of reservation), was very underwhelming, he was informing me that I didn't book a pool villa but a jacuzzi suite and didn't offer a solution, his only solution was ""Regarding this matter, please kindly contact Website hotelquickly for the clarification.""
After seeing this, I decided to email him again and ask him to pay more attention to my -very detailed- email.
His subsequent answer was :
""We received and acknowledge your booking for one bedroom jacuzzi suite and will provided accordingly.
Regarding free upgrade, it will be considered based on our availability and situation.
For upgrade request will be charged at USD 50,-net/night/villa.""
The reply was very impersonal and cold. I simply replied: ""Given the very obviously confusing screenshot of HotelQuickly's website previously provided, I really hope that my case will be treated as a priority in case of availability of pool villa for a free upgrade upon arrival. Although this information was not given directly via your website, these agencies by selling rooms for you are representing you (with your authorization) and should not constitute a waiver of responsibility if the website is not clear and seems to be selling pool villas (while actually selling jacuzzi suite). ""
To which he replied again ""Please contact HotelQuickly's for the clarification.""
Okaaaay.

Upon arrival, I was told by the person at the counter that I was allocated to a jacuzzi suite (very tired bedroom, cracks in the wall, humidity on the bathroom ceiling) and that he couldn't provide ""free upgrade"" as it depends on reservation people (who are never onsite). He told me that he had 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom villas available; but that he would have to charge me for the upgrade. He explained to me that Retno never mentioned a free upgrade in the reservation system and consequently, his hands were tied. He advised me to check in the jacuzzi suite, and email Retno later to see if the upgrade is possible for the second night.
I emailed Retno as soon as I got in the room, a bit shocked that despite the bedrooms being available, and despite him saying that he would provide free upgrade, he didn't keep up with his words. I never got a formal reply to my email but reception called us in the morning to inform us that we'd be transferred to a 1 bedroom villa, finally.

2 days before check out, I emailed Retno, to inform him that the morning of my check out, it is my partner's birthday and I would appreciate if they could do something about it: I suggested birthday cake for the breakfast, and rose petals the night before to make our stay a bit more special. Retno replied ""we are pleased to provide a birthday cake and will be served together with your breakfast."" I honestly was weirded out that he wouldn't acknowledge the rose petals part (at least to refuse or offer to charge me for this), but I was glad to finally receive a bit customer care.

2 days before my checkout, I was informed that my flight got cancelled, and that I was allocated to a 5pm flight (the day of my partner's birthday, we had a surprise birthday party to attend in Singapore....). That was bad news for sure. I first called the reception, to ask for a late checkout. They informed me that they would charge me 200k for a late checkout. I was not satisfied, I got a lot of free late checkout in other hotels (most hotels would offer this for free, especially during low occupancy), they told me to email reservation. I emailed Retno to inform him, and to asked him for late checkout, forwarding him the flight company's emailing informing me of the new flight timing. He replied to me that I could check out late if I agree to pay 500k. So basically, through reception I am being charged $30 more than reception for late checkout ? How cheap is it, during low occupancy, to even charge for a late check out, especially given the circumstance (flight rescheduled by the company + the day of my partner's birthday) ?!

This greedy attitude from reservation really disappointed me. For the rose petals, it would be fine for them to offer to charge us (although there are a lot of pictures on TripAdvisor with rose petals in the bathtub or on the bed - why a different treatment for us ?). As for the upgrade, why upgrading people who didn't ask for it, while we had a VERY legit reason to be upgraded (= false advertisement by partner website). Moreover, other websites were selling jacuzzi suite with a picture of a room with a pool. I strongly believe that the hotel should own this problem as this is not customer's responsibility that THEIR partners are wrongly advertising.

Nonetheless, we had a great stay, special thanks to the sweet girl delivering us breakfast almost every morning. Her badge says trainee, she really deserves to be hired. She was a delight.
The pool villa was very pleasant to stay in, and I would definitely recommend staying in a pool villa.",Kanishka Villas
73,Elite Villas in Seminyak,50,February 2018,"Most visits to Bali finish with a few shopping days in Seminyak.
Again, we chose to stay at the Kanishka Villas...a beautifully appointed elite complex, close to many boutique shops and restaurants.
Had a two bedroom villa with private indoor pool...great to wake up to in the morning and for a refreshing ""dip"" at the end of the day.
The villa was comfortable, spacious, well equipped, especially for preparing meals if desired.
Staff are very ourteous and helpful with a good knowledge of the area.",Kanishka Villas
74,Another great stay at the Villas,50,February 2018,"Enjoyed a short stay this time at the Kanishka Villas 9in Seminyak. Wish we could have
stayed longer as there are great restaurants nearby which we enjoy visiting. Our room
was great, as usual, with the pool and tropical settings. Enjoyed a short walk to visit
shops and restaurants. Just didn't have enough time this trip to do more. Will plan
to stay longer at this Villa to really appreciate their location with things to do.",Kanishka Villas
75,Beautiful Villa,50,March 2018,"Beautiful little villa not far from lots of restaurants & bars. We chose a villa with a private pool and it was very spacious with an outside bathroom. Pool steps are very steep when it gets to the last one, I am 5ft 4 and I had to stand on tiptoes to have my head above water. Mosquito nets are put out on the bed & also coils in the living area. Helpful & friendly staff who collected & dropped us off at the airport. Would recommend for anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak",Kanishka Villas
76,Beautiful little hideaway,50,February 2018,"Large villa sizes, polite staff, good breakfast, near lots of local restaurants and spas. Short drive from the beach. Free bus service which will take you wherever you want to go in Seminyak at certain times. We really enjoyed it here and was made to feel very welcome.",Kanishka Villas
77,"Quiet hideaway, perfect for couples.",40,February 2018,"Fantastic location in side street off Jl, Raya Seminyak. Great location with friendly staff.

We stayed in a One bedroom pool villa, which consisted of kitchen, living, dining, large bedroom with half open outdoor bathroom. Bedroom and living area were separated by private plunge pool with two pool recliner chairs. Perfect for that refreshing dip after busy morning / afternoon shopping.

Some of the furniture is looking a bit worn but that is due to the exposure to the elements.

Service was perfect. You preordered what you would like for breakfast and your 24 hr Butler would deliver it to you in the morning. Anything you required they would assist.

Room service menu and prices also reasonable.

Overall, thoroughly recommend for nice romantic retreat.",Kanishka Villas
78,Best Honeymoon ever!,50,February 2018,"Our Kanishka Villa is absolutely beautiful and the service is amazing! Never greeted without a beautiful smile or hello. We have complimentary breakfast every morning and let me tell you there’s enough to fill my 6,2 hubby up and start our day off the right way (with full tummies). After being out in the sun it’s so refreshing to jump into the pool for a swim before you head off out again to explore some more. All in all
Kanishka villas you’ve made our trip one that we will never forgot thanks a million xx",Kanishka Villas
79,A great place to stay for rest and relaxation.,50,February 2018,"We arrived tired and disorientated at Bali airport but as soon as we stepped into the Geding Gedis resort we were instantly rejuvenated. The flight from Sydney had been arduous as the airline had run out of water and the A/c was limited. On arrival late evening at Geding we were immediately immersed in a relaxed, tranquil feeling. The kids loved the resort and initially were never out of the pools and we did not want to venture too far. Subsequently, we did, taking them to the Safari Park and the Waterbom which were only a short distance and the resort supplied transport at a very reasonable rate. We stayed in Villa 10 which was great and would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this wonderful resort to our friends and relatives.",Kanishka Villas
80,Ok but nothing special,30,January 2018,"On arrival we had an upgrade from a jacuzzi suitor to a one bedroom villa with pool. This was very nice but on further inspection the furnishings were becoming dated and tatty. Room service was excellent, cleaning was good, no facilities other than what us in the villa. TV reception poor, not that you want to watch TV on holiday, never worked out how to use the surround sound system though. Staff very friendly and helpful. Location us good but you are a good half a mile from the beach.",Kanishka Villas
81,"Disappointing, no onsite pool",30,January 2018,"We arrived with several other couples after a cruise. We all waited In a lovely 2 bed villa with Private pool. Our room allocation which appeared to be totally random was an upstairs room with a jacuzzi. No pool. No seating area. Just a bed and bathroom. Ok but a little shabby. The pillows were stained,not nice. The website indicates there is a pool onsite, there isn't. So if you have a jacuzzi room you have no access to a pool. We had told our travel agent this holiday, which was not cheap, was to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary but the staff just said there were no pool villas available. The website also says there is a shuttle bus, there isn't. The breakfast was good. This area of Seminyak was the budget end, lots of building work going on and thousands of mopeds in the very busy surrounding streets.",Kanishka Villas
82,Very disappointing,20,January 2018,"My wife and I were booked in to these villas as part of a Cruise and stay holiday, ie 7 day cruise in Indonesia and 4 days in Bali in the Kanishka Villas.
When we arrived, along with another 12 or so guests,we were taken to a 2 bedroom villa (which smelled of damp) as the reception area was too small to check everyone in at the same time. Only 2 of the rooms were ready and we had to wait for an hour or so before we eventually got our room.
The room itself was passible, the bathroom was open -air with the shower outside.The towels left a lot to be desired,thin, grey and obviously well passed their best, although handy for mopping up the dangerously slippy and wet floor due to a leak under one of the sinks.
The power kept going off and on which was annoying but at least there was a torch in the room (I wonder why???)
I don't recommend ordering breakfast served in your room, unless you like cold fried eggs, cold bacon and cold and rubbery toast which I got on the first morning.I told the Butler and he did apologise.I opted for tea and toast the next morning but no difference.We went out for breakfast the remaing 2 days.
We had a jacuzzi outside on the private terrace but it took nearly an hour to fill it then we had to empty it as it was full of dirt out of the jets/ taps, it took over half an hour to empty before we could clean it and then another 45 minutes to fill by which time we were off the notion.
On our last morning we found a huge dead cockroach in the bathroom..at least I thought it was dead until I went to pick it up....it flicked over and started scampering round the bathroom, I mananged to 'dispose' of it to the great relief of my wife.
Finally. I would like to say that the staff on the whole were very good and friendly but, in my opinion, the management need to step up to the mark and take note.
I can only comment on the villa we were in,but in my opinion, the villas could do with a refurb, the brochure is somewhat misleading and in it's present condition is not worth its 5 star rating.
We would not recommend Kanishka Villas",Kanishka Villas
83,Honeymoon 5th Dec 17,50,December 2017,"My husband and I checked into this hotel and spent 10 days here. The hotel staff are very friendly and go out their way to please their guests. I wish I took their names, both the male and female staff were lovely. Any requests we had were dealt with straight away. The villa is beautiful. Delicious breakfast is brought to you every morning by your butler but you will have to order your food a day before (the specials are great!). They also serve delicious lunch and dinners.The rooms and pool are cleaned daily.

Kanishka Villa has special packages such as romantic meal packages which we ordered. It was absolutely beautiful. They set up the romantic meal in our villa by the pool with candles, flowers and even have a small Bluetooth speaker which you can connect your phone to, to set the mood.

At around 5pm the staff come into the room to let down the net curtains around the bed, mosquito coils are placed in the bathroom and mosquito spray is sprayed in the rooms and living room. However still bring your own mosquito repellant cream/sprays.

A variety of yummy mini cakes are put in the living room daily. Kanishka villa is located in a great area. The area is surrounded by many restaurants and shops (also 24-hour chat cafe restaurant down the road and a 24-hour shop next door). The high road leads straight to Kuta beach. We couldn't adjust to the time zone so we spent a lot of our nights riding around on our mopeds and eating at the 24-hour restaurant. Thank you, Kanishka for making Tim and Jennifer's honeymoon special!",Kanishka Villas
84,Honeymoon perfection,50,November 2017,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and it couldn't of been better. Our private villa was perfect for our needs, with our private terrace for our breakfast each morning.

The staff couldn't of been more helpful, everyone greeting us with a smile and hello.

Would recommend!!!",Kanishka Villas
85,Horrible Breakfast!! Unhygienic place!! Lots of mosquitos!! Zero privacy!! No Security!! Non cooperative staff!!,10,December 2017,"We stayed in Kanishka villa for three nights (8 December 2017- 11 December 2017)and we had very high expectations but the staff was uncooperative . The swimming pool in the villa was dirty and was open even the bathroom was open, no privacy & security! Food was hopeless! Lots of mosquitos and insect and unhygienic environment!
Very high penalties!! Air conditioning was not up to the level ! Not satisfied!",Kanishka Villas
86,5 night November stay,40,November 2017,"We stayed here for 5 nights in early November, we paid just over $100 Aus a night, and for that price you really can’t have many complaints. We stayed in a jacuzzi villa, which we found beautiful and very comfortable. They clean twice a day, serve you breakfast in your own private deck area, and also come in spray/ light coils to get rid of mosquitos. The staff are very friendly and helpful and can arrange Taxis, meals and activities for you on request.
Being ultra critical, the place could do with a lick of paint and a bit of maintenance, the free shuttle anywhere in Seminyak they seem a little reluctant to provide unless you push for it, and it’s a little further from the beaches than we realised ( a 20 minutes walk). But for 5 star you pay top dollar, for this price you can’t really go wrong here.",Kanishka Villas
87,Fabulous stay,50,November 2017,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay at Kanishka villas. We had the most amazing stay, don't let the negative reviews put you off. We felt so welcomed from the moment we arrived. All members of staff were amazing and so friendly. They came and cleaned our villa thoroughly every day, aswell as the pool area. We had complimentary breakfast delivered to our room every morning which was very nice. The villa itself was beautiful. We stayed in villa 16, a 1 bedroom pool villa and it was lovely and open and the private pool was great. We had air con in the bedroom but not in the living area. The only negative i can say is that there are quite alot of mosquitos, but they do come around with mosquito coils and spray the villas. There is also a mosquito net around the bed. Do not worry about the bad reviews on here, this place is amazing, the staff are lovely and I can't wait to return some day.",Kanishka Villas
88,Loved it 💜,40,November 2017,"I would definitely recommend Kanishka Villas
The staff were all so very helpful and friendly from my check in to departure
I booked a jacuzzi suite gorgeous clean room
There is a deck which had a day bed great spot for breakfast with nice cool breezes
I only gave 4 stars as I had a top floor west facing & if I had been out all day the air con took quite a while to cool down the room 😟
That's my only negative
There are heaps of cafes and restaurants within a short walk and spas from $$$ to $ and shopping
Enjoy your stay I will be back 😊",Kanishka Villas
89,Nice stay,50,September 2017,We stayed here for 3 nights at their Luxury Villa No 12. The villa was nice and the best part was that the villa was located very strategically in the city area. The rooms were well maintained and safe.,Kanishka Villas
90,Location location close to everything,40,September 2017,"We stayed for 9 nights in a 2 bedroom villa. The staff were very obliging and we were spoilt rotten. With breakvfast brought ieach morning and the cleaning service morning and night we could not ask for better service. The rooms are a bit dated and the furniture has the odd scratch but given the age of the complex it is in pretty good shape
Having ou own pool was great for the hot afternoons. We would stay here again",Kanishka Villas
91,"Beautiful, spacious villas",50,August 2017,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Kanishka Villas for 5 nights to wrap up a 3 month trip around Asia in luxury. We definitely were not dissapointed. From the moment we got there the staff were so helpful and lovely and they couldn't do enough for us during our entire stay.
We stayed in the private pool villa which was huge for 2 people. The idea of having a seperate dining/living and bedroom/bathroom areas was great and you could also open up the doors completely in the living area to the pool area.
Breakfast and the room service we ordered was great and surprisingly the room service was actually quite reasonable for such upmarket accomodation.

My only negative through the whole experience is that there was way too much chlorine in the pool. If my boyfriend or I were in the pool for any longer than 15 minutes, it would actually start to burn your skin and we both had sensitive skin for days afterwards. When I saw the pool being serviced I understood why, the guy that cleaned the pool threw about 4 big handfuls of white chemical from a bucket into the pool every morning, way too much for the size of the pool. I would be especially mindful of this if you have kids that are going to be putting their faces under the water or if you have sensitive skin.

Apart from that minor flaw, our stay was great and we would definitely come back.",Kanishka Villas
92,Luxurious Stay in Private Villa,40,November 2016,"Great place for stay, totally Romantic and Luxurious. Booked a Private Villa for 3 days which had a Private Pool as well along with Jacuzzi. Villa's were very beautiful and spacious, rooms were very comfortable. Only thing I think they should work upon is Food. They provide Breakfast exclusively in your Villa but there Menu is very short. On a long holiday I guess Lavish food is something every Traveler would look upto, for which I would rate them Poor.
Apart from that Amenities, Food, Accommodation and Service they are 5/5.",Kanishka Villas
93,"Kanishka villas, may not come again unfortunately.",30,August 2017,"Spent 6 days here. Lovely, friendly staff. We booked full board, but found out on arrival that the menu was not what it seemed and you are limited to only the main dishes, this was not made clear when we were making the bookings. But the staff corrected this quickly. Very pleasant stay.

But would not come here again, lots of problems with the villa, I assume probably all have similar issues, mainly wear and tear. Taps not all always working in the baths (children could not have a bath for the first few days as water was not flowing properly), hot water running out, showers not fully functioning, decor needs significant upgrade. Lots of limescale around taps, baths and showers.

The private pool is why we booked, but lots of chlorine, can be very bad for the skin. My daughter was excited for this part of the villa but ended up with slight burn marks over her face.

Shame, as everything else was great, food, service, location, staff and the privacy.

If you want to enjoy the facilities, best go else where.",Kanishka Villas
94,Secret Gem,50,June 2017,"Secret Gem

Kanishka Villas is a positively fabulous find in Seminyak. Our two bedroomed villa was luxurious with all the state of the art conveniences, free Wifi, cable TV, villa food and drink villa service everything you want for a relaxing stay. The rooms are designed to the highest standard leading onto your own beautiful waterfall pools to enhance the tranquil and restful atmosphere. Fresh tropical fruit is provided every day which I especially like as part of the healthy diet which is theme that runs through the whole organisation. The room service is fabulous providing delicious a la carte standard meals to your own personal Villas for romantic dining. One of main advantages of Kanishka Villa is Seminyak which is a renowned attraction in Bali. Not only does it have a fabulous beach there are many international restaurants providing delicious food from all over the world a great place to try Balinese cuisine which is spicy but not hot, wonderful. The Ultimo, Made's Warung is the place to go to give your taste buds a real treat. There are fashionable boutiques and night clubs that ensure you will have a wonderful time, guaranteed, one of my favourite places. All of this was within an easy walking distance from our Villa so no need to drive, brilliant. Driver and airport transfer is also available, the staff and management have thought of everything to make your stay the best you have ever had.

95,We felt like royalty!,50,July 2017,Stunning villas located in Seminyak. We stayed in a 2bedroom pool villa. We never wanted to leave our villa. The breakfast served to us in our villa in the morning were amazing! The only thing which was a bit hard was as we had to young kids the bedrooms were separated by the pool which we didn't feel right leaving the kids in a room on their own so my husband and i had to each stay in a room with 1 of the kids. But these villa's were beautiful! Ideal for families with kids maybe a little older - or 2 couples travelling together!,Kanishka Villas
96,Could be better,30,March 2017,"I had called in advance to ensure the reservation staff block the villa I liked in the pictures, however when arrived at 11PM it was a disappointment. They did move us to the better villa the next day and once there it was a classy 2 days... Staff are very friendly and helpful with all requests, cleanliness is to perfection.
Will surely stay again if the prices drop on a sale time...",Kanishka Villas
97,Amazing stay - Highly recommend,50,June 2017,"Hi all,

I never leave reviews anywhere but I feel the need to do so for this one. I just recently spent a week in Bali at Kanishka Villa and it was an amazing experience.

We had the villa 22 with a private jacuzzi. The room was beautifully decorated, clean, with a beautiful bathroom and a great outdoor space. The breakfast is served in your villa at the time you prefer and you will find a great choice of meals that should please everybody.

We had an issue with the jacuzzi and they took action immediately, repairing it within 15min.
The staff is friendly, helpful and everybody always have a smile on their face.

There is a very convenient shuttle service available as well, for free, drop off only.

This hotel is very well located in Seminyak and most of the taxi drivers were able to find it.

For the price, this is definitely a gem.

I highly recommend to stay in this hotel and I personally will come back.

Thanks a lot for making our stay unforgettable!",Kanishka Villas
98,Great service,30,June 2017,"The villas is clean just a little bit old. The bathroom door a bit loose and there is leakage around the basin area. However the staffs are friendly, able to suggest some nice place for food, place to buy souvenirs and place to visit in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
99,Serenity,50,June 2017,"Tranquility
The villa is lovely, with its rustic setting you feel like your in Bali. Rather than a cement block. It may be a bit worn in areas but so is Bali . Its huge bathrooms two sinks big bath. outside ambiance while showering fun. Wifi works good. Security 24 hours. Right at the door step of everything food shops massages. Breakfast to your room coffee late is the best. The room service is thorough always smiling they will assist you with everything. Pool is a perfect size quite big. Thank you kanishka for a no hassle relaxing holiday. Ps the Balinese ple are warm caring ple and live a simple life. Something us westerners should think about when being to fussy.

100,Blissful Bali,50,May 2017,"Our stay at Kanishka Villas was amazing.
The villas are a quiet oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.
Located a short walk from Bali deli on JL Kunti it is perfectly situated for your Bali experience.",Kanishka Villas
101,Don't listen to negative ppl,50,June 2017,"Omg this place is amazing!!! Service is amazing, the staff are so attentive and caring. Any thing we requested we received and breakfast every morning was superb definitely coming back. Room 9 is def a 5 star",Kanishka Villas
102,Average at best,30,June 2017,"My partner and I stayed for a week in one of their two bedroom villas. We specially ensured to book a villa that had an enclosed lounge/kitchen area as the mosquitoes are terrible in the area. We found the Villa to be comfortable and with some nice features. However the small breakfasts became annoying and the constant interruptions from the hotel staff (they service your room up to four times a day). On a positive note the staff we friendly and the location was really good, but a few changes would need to made for us to consider staying there again.",Kanishka Villas
103,Below average,10,June 2017,We booked in Australia before we left but wished we had looked at the villas first. A waste of money really. Our room wasn't ready on time and when we did get the key we discovered no hot water and half the powere points not working. We told reception we were not happy as the villa was very different to the website photos. The villas are older and not well maintained although they do appear to be building new ones it was disappointing as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The girl on reception was not very sympathetic to our situation and refused to give us a refund. Too many good accomodation options to ever consider this one again,Kanishka Villas
104,Wonderful experience!,50,June 2017,"When we first arrived we were both greeted with a warm welcome from Bli Putu. He took our luggage and gave us a tour around our villa. He gave us simple and helpful instructions on how to operate the villa as well. The next day the employees have given us great and wonderful service! Bli Putu have also given us great suggestions to travel around to in Bali. Over all the experience is unforgettable! I will be returning here again for our next holiday!

Thank you!",Kanishka Villas
105,Cant wait to leave.,20,May 2017,"Did much research on this villa and looked at many reviews was very disappointed .
Bed in villa was so bad sleeped on couch for 7 nights with mozzys.
Next to the shower if you like a freeze- burn effect and no water flow this is the one of choice.
Bedroom floors are fantastic if you would like to put a claim in for compensation for breaking bones with it being very slippery in areas.
Must not forget to say asked 7 times for use of the free shuttle offered and not available.
If you like up early with your room cleaned and in evening disturbed all lights switched on whislt relaxing watching a movie, often asking for the simplest thing such as a coffee cup choose this one.
Must not forget to mention no villas have much sun on pools so dont choose if you wish to swim and enjoy.
Many many stays in bali and definitely will not choose again.
Only good thing is not that far to walk to shops and fantastic massage place across the road.",Kanishka Villas
106,Tranquil and totally relaxing villas,40,May 2017,"Lovely rooms, pool area, lounge area and kitchen. Furniture is funky but could be updated bit. The bathrooms are outdoor/indoor. The location is excellent, next to Bali Deli and Seminyak Raya. Overall a great stay.",Kanishka Villas
107,"Nice room , staff but bad breakfast",20,May 2017,"Nice room and very convenient but a bit old
The staff are very helpful and nice
There are free shuttle in Seminyak area till 8 PM
For the second day we ordered American breakfast but it was the worst American breakfast in my life Poor quality of ingredients",Kanishka Villas
108,Great Honeymoon Home,50,April 2017,Stayed here for my honeymoon and I made a great choice. The room was clean and lovely. Breakfast is served to your room which was lovely. They bed was so comfy and romantic as well. Only thing was that i wish the bathrooms had curtains so that the sun doesn't come in at 6am! anyways great location as well!,Kanishka Villas
109,Our little Seminyak home ♥️,50,March 2017,"We just finished our 7 nights stay at Kanishka Villas and we had a lovely time! The staff are always so willing to help, and are all very friendly and courteous. The villa we had was spacious, with a private pool - that was perfect, as we are a Muslim couple, and I wear a headscarf, it was nice to be able to swim with such privacy - with high walls surrounding the pool/courtyard area.

The housekeeping was excellent too, twice a day with good mosquito repellent regimes.

Breakfast was great - you need to order what you'd like either the evening before or in the morning, and it's brought to your villa and set up beautifully on the dining table. Portions were always generous and the pancakes were DELICIOUS and fluffy and literally to die for!

The villas are lovely even for entertaining guests, and we found the staff really helpful when we invited a few friends for dinner.

If you'd like somewhere in the heart of Seminyak, hugely accessible to all the local amenities, while being a private and homely place - kanishka is the one!

Our only criticism - and this is perhaps deserving of a total 4.5 star review - is that the villa needs a little bit of maintenance work - with some creaking floorboards on the decking and we also had a bit of a problem with our kitchen tap one evening whereby the kitchen flooded as the water spurted out uncontrollably from the tap! A bit of maintenance and overall touch ups would for sure restore this place to an epic villa :)

Thanks once again Kanishka for making our stay in Bali so memorable! 😊",Kanishka Villas
110,Lovely place,40,April 2017,"We had a good time when we stay..
i have a combination stay and the villas is very different with Gending Kedis
Kanishka is more modern n located in seminyak which is good for tourist who love to eat and party..
When we stay we also have a fruit basket and snack tea cake..
but kanishka need more improvement.. when we stay, we cant use the bathtub.. the cold water run very slow.. but overall i really have a pleasant stay 😊",Kanishka Villas

Thank you very much :-)",Kanishka Villas
113,First time,20,April 2017,"My husband and I have just returned from our first visit to Bali. We stayed at Kanishka villa 17 and were a bit disappointed. The staff were wonderful, and friendly, but there is so much wrong with the villa. The whole villa needs a good makeover from..... lounge should have been thrown out 5 years ago along with the mouldy stained cushions, bed and pillows were like sleeping on slabs of concrete, pool needs to be drained and fixed up and less chlorine put in (skin felt like it was burning at times) lamps were stained and leaning, no laundry bag or ""do not disturb"" sign as stated in the info file. We went over to relax but found their was no where comfortable to sit/lay, even the banana lounges were made of that hard plastic. So we left feeling more stressed than when we got there. Going somewhere a bit cooler next time 😔",Kanishka Villas
114,Complimentary breakfast is amazing!,40,April 2017,"PROS:
- Lots of room for 2 people
- Gorgeous layout & design
- Aircon is amazing
- Having water filter in kitchen was a life saver
- Great being so close to convenience store & massages
- Butler service was very handy
- Breakfast menu is extensive & was part of our accomodation which was a great way to start each day
- Bed was super comfy & the mosquito net was great
- The shower had good pressure
- Cakes/cookies every night were a nice touch
- Complimentary shuttle bus available into Seminyak Square

Day 4: they turned our aircon off
Day 5: internet stopped working
Day 6: DVD player stopped working, no turn down service
Day 7: brekky order was wrong

- TV's are old & cannot be connected to laptops + they have bad reception
- Can't hear doorbell from bedroom
- Bathroom floods when it rains heavily
- Laundry service is expensive. 28 items cost us $78 AUD.
- Even the staff admit that the internet is temperamental & fleeting
- Safe is not big enough to store laptops

These Villas are absolutely gorgeous, but a few aspects of the service needs to be fixed up. Very expensive, but nice to have a home away from home.",Kanishka Villas

117,Beautiful villas with easy access to the hustle and bustle,50,March 2017,"We just love this villa. It is so beautiful and really well set out. The two bedrooms have four poster king size beds and the upstairs bedroom was huge. The kitchen is small but does the job. The staff are lovely and look after you really well if you need them. The bathrooms are balinese style so you will find them open to the outside in parts. Don't worry, the staff spray and provide mosquito coils. It was actually nice having a bath (which is huge) while hearing the outside sounds of the birds etc. It is easy to walk into Seminyak Square or down to the beach in Legian - although may take about 20 mins. Easy to get a taxi. There is a Mini Mart next door with Circle K about 50m down the road. Certainly would recommend this villa.",Kanishka Villas

122,"Great location, great value for money.",50,January 2017,"My family and I have stayed in many different villas in Bali over the years but we keep coming back to Kanishka Villas because, while they're not the most luxurious villas we've ever stayed in, they're clean and modern,the staff are friendly, breakfast is good (especially the chef's specials) and the room service food is good and reasonably priced. But most of all, it's about location. They're just across the road from Bali Deli, and a very short walk to Warung Mades, Queens Tandoor and Bun & Bo. Additionally, shopping in Seminyak is at your front door. I've given the villas a 5 because of the location and they're great value for the price if you're on a budget. Highly recommended. One tip: if you want to book half a day (so you can relax before going to the airport), make sure you do this early as the villas today are very popular and booked out well in advance.",Kanishka Villas

I love the livingroom, kitchen , pool , bed and bathroom , all of it !!

But i don't like the bed , a bit uncomfortable. But just a bit.

And for the wifi, the connection is not so good but it's ok

I think that this villa need more security lock for the main villa door, because even the villa crew are already told us about the time for the crew visit , but i feel a bit annoyed for sudden visit to our villa , they can just open the door from outside while us stay in the bedroom.

I will definitely visit again. Very good central location right next to restaurants etc",Kanishka Villas
126,Its an amazing villa with all amenities,50,January 2017,"Its a super and best villa to stay here..its give all the facility of your need.its feel like seprate bunglaw with drawing room, dining area ,pool,bed room and kitchen with all things..it has some problem for veg. Breakfast. Its cant give breakfast unlimited and limited choice of bf..its location is also fine..",Kanishka Villas
127,Just lovely ...,50,December 2016,"Lovely place tucked away just off the main drag in Semnyak. Lovely villas, airy, well maintained and well appointed. The vills are showing their age just a tad but we would happily stay there again. Great for living (ooh la la) a-la-naturel!! But as is always the case with resorts like this, the greatest assets of all are the people that greet you with genuine warm smiles and happiness - amazing. The larger sister-resort at Jimbaran is also lovely. Might try that next time?? What a delicious problem to have! Christine and James",Kanishka Villas
128,Modern Villa,40,May 2016,"This villa good service and welcome staff, facilities is complete, enjoy and nice stay here.
if you trip to bali don't forget try stay here and enjoy with fiew, near to the beach doublesix and thank you for all staff, crew for your welcome to us.",Kanishka Villas
129,Expect more for pricy Villa,20,December 2016,"To spend this amount of money on accommodation we where disappointed.
Arrived and room wasnt ready, 30minutes later we went into the villa. Beautiful looking but mosquitoes everywhere inside. They sprayed but the Villa wasn't sealed from outside. We couldn't stop mosquitoes coming in. Then the bedroom stunk of a dead animal, they bought in ladders etc to find what the smell was but couldn't locate it.
After wasting the day we where located to another villa that was sealed from outside.
They have open aired bathrooms which wasn't good, mosquitoes and too hot to put makeup on etc.
Then my son developed rashes which was from the pool water, chlorine was too strong.
Would not recommend.",Kanishka Villas
130,wondrfull stay,50,November 2016,"This is a great place.... quiet , a little hidden, but near to everything including the beach... great price, spotlessly clean and gracious staff. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.... Seminyak quite busy these days but at Kanishka I found I could escape the streets and relax. It is a quiet but serene establishmen The breakfasts are awesome also. Plus the beds are so comfy....",Kanishka Villas
131,Apathetic staff spoils an otherwise excellent accommodation place,20,December 2016,"We booked a three night stay from 28th Nov to 1st Dec.

Villa 19 had what we desired; a private pool, huge living room area, and a bathtub in a large toilet. The bedroom had a king size bed with aircon in very good condition.

Noise isolation can be an issue tho, as it is an open air concept outside of the bedroom.

Breakfast had a great selection and was mostly done very well (especially the scrambled eggs). However, we cannot say the same for the food served outside of breakfast. You will be better off walking out to get better options.

Room service was alright. The staff was always smiling and were generally well-trained to do their jobs. Though there was that one time when a centipede crawled out of the bathtub drain when it was unplugged, and we did not have the means to remove it without killing the poor guy. We called for assistance, which only arrived a good 20 mins later.

The cream-of-the-crop came on the third day.
We took many blue bird taxis on day 1 and 2, and we only paid a metered fare of between 7-12,000 rupiah for short distance rides. Then our luck ran out.
We flagged down this taxi who drove us to our villa, but the driver insisted for us to pay a minimum fare of 20,000 rupiah, despite the meter showing 13,500 rupiah (which was already higher than what we were supposed to pay for the same distance), which sounded very fishy to us. After a short exchange with the driver, we asked the front desk for assistance, but to no avail. They told us to pay the meter, but upon hearing that the driver is asking for a minimum sum, they advised us to pay him that minimum sum.

We found it very hard to believe that the staff at the receptionist counter had no idea which taxi requires a minimum charge for a flagdown, and which didn't, or whether there was supposed to be a minimum charge in the first place. Only at that point, they told us to just take the Blue Bird taxis, but unfortunately, the one we took wasn't a Blue Bird taxi. Thus, we still had to pay the minimum charge, as demanded by the driver.

It was already a very unpleasant experience to be talking to a local who intended to rip us off (which is the norm there), but it gets worse when we requested for assistance, and we didn't get any. We didn't know yet if he was trying his luck, but it was sad how the staff stayed out of it. It was only after some research and asking other drivers, that we found out it was only for calling taxis that you have a minimum charge.

When it finally gets down to it, customer service isn't simply about just doing your job. It's also about prioritising your customer's welfare in your decisions. We are very disappointed in the way Kanishka handled this incident. It wasn't because we had to pay the extra 5000 rupiah. We were on Kanishka property, and we expected Kanishka to help us, especially since the driver was starting to be aggressive. However, because they took that step back, we no longer felt safe in the Villa.

Despite this, if your requirements are merely good facilities, then this might be the option for you.",Kanishka Villas
132,Great Accommodation,50,November 2016,"Our stay in one of Kanishka's private pool villas was amazing. No matter how hot and busy it was on the streets of Seminyak we new nothing about it once inside our relaxing, luxurious and private retreat. We received excellent customer service from the staff who always made us feel like we were their only customers. Also we found great restaurants, spas, shopping and 24hr convenience store within 5min walking distance.",Kanishka Villas
133,Our favourite part of Seminyak,50,November 2016,"We booked our 7 night stay though Luxury Escapes and were a little worried after reading some less than positive reviews that it may disappoint.
We are 5 nights into our stay and just love our Villa 18. It has everything we could ask for - beautiful pool, comfortable bed, large bathroom and generous living/dining area.
We have complete privacy and the only sounds we hear are birds and the water feature in the pool. We had the in-room massage and would highly recommend it!
Breakfast (included) is simple but lovely. The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is perfect. Great massage salons and eateries all within a very short distance. We will happily stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
134,A place to stay in Seminyak,40,November 2016,"These villas are located in the center of Seminyak which is very handy to the shopping centers and the restaurants in the area. The villas come in different sizes and we chose a one bedroom suite which came with a spar. The room was lovely as was the out door area. The bathroom was a great hit as the shower was the biggest I have encountered. The staff in the reception need a special mention. Nothing was to hard for them to find, help with or organize transport. We had a breakfast each morning (Included in the price) which could included a continental or cook breakfast. The unit we had was upstairs and at the back of the unit complex which was requested as we didn't want the road noise. The only negative is that if the other guests are having a party it could be noisy as the sound travels. The villas are well kept and are serviced every day including changing the linen and towels. The service staff could not be faulted including spraying for Mozzies at night. Great mid price place to stay",Kanishka Villas
135,Is it mosquitoes or bed bug?,30,November 2016,"We supposed to stay in 1 BR with private pool but they gave us 2 BR eventhough we can only use 1 BR which is fine for me but the air conditioning in my bedroom wasn't working well, too hot to be exact compare to the living room (super cool and nice) called the technician to fixed it but still not cold enough, let's just sleep without blanket then but we couldn't slept well either it's too hot or too many mosquitoes. Must be both combo I guess. The staff puts the mosquitoes repellent in villa's area everyday but we still got the mosquitoes bites in the morning after and more bites day by day.
Before I booked this villa I did check all the review about it, there's some bed bug reviews so we got paranoid is it mosquitoes or bed bug? Even now while I am writing this review all the bites still itchy. We told the staff about this issue and they said it's just the mosquitoes. Yeah hopefully it's just mosquitoes, annoying mosquitoes indeed. But despite all those issues, the villa was great and spacious, the pleasant staff, breakfast and room services were wonderful that's why we mostly spent our day time in villa. But I don't think we will come back to stay here, definitely gonna try another villa. Thank you.",Kanishka Villas
136,Kanishka Villas experience,30,October 2016,"Our experience during our stay in this hotel isn't fantastic. Our expectations were not met as the air conditioning was not working well. The room was not as clean as we expected, there were stains on the floor tiles, spa tub and wash basins. However, staff of the villa are courteous and respectful.",Kanishka Villas
137,Comfortable and safe,40,September 2016,"With all the mixed reviews, I was a bit nervous but our 2 bedroom villa was quite lovely. Bed was comfortable in super size bedroom. Tropical open air bathroom took some getting used to (be warned you can hear EVERYTHING villa to villa from the bathrooms). Pool was small but did the job. Kitchen small with minimal provided; however, the fridge is a great size. Service was lovely with any issues quickly dealt with, and the mosquito repellant turndown happening every night. Room service was not bad. We had a party villa across the way and security dealt with them well. There are some good shops, restaurants and spas just around the corner but it is bit away from beaches and the main restaurant and shopping strips- which was actually a plus, and taxis were easily found on the main road.",Kanishka Villas
138,"Great location, great services",40,May 2016,"We've been there for a couple day in may 2016. The services were good enough i think, since it was our first trip together as a married couple..
The location is very strategic which is nearby to any other famous spot in bali. Seems like we're going to visit the villas again at our next trip.. Hhe",Kanishka Villas
139,Beautiful villas and fantastic service,50,October 2016,"The villa was wonderful, lots of room and the pool is superb. The only negative would be the fact that the bathrooms have one open wall which is quite nice but also far too hot for us Kiwis! Didn't want to put make up on in there, just too hot. The staff are fantastic, so lovely and friendly and we had a wonderful holiday. Thank you!",Kanishka Villas
140,Could be better,20,September 2016,We booked a four night stay through Luxury Escapes and in arrival realised this place was not as described. We could not fault the staff but the rooms were shabby and maintenance needs to be carried out more regularly. Doesn't look like the photos,Kanishka Villas
141,Fantastic stay in Seminyak,50,September 2016,"Stay at Kanishka was undoubtedly a wow experience for me and my wife. We had booked a villa with private pool. The villa, with its modern construction, and big toilet, and spacious bedroom and hall, was beautiful, and the pool was so good that we lost interest in checking out places outside. Staffs were polite, and behaved well. The only downside in my observation with the stay was, the wifi connectivity was quite poor. There were construction works happening in the nearby villa, and hence we were not completely happy with our privacy, since we were on a romantic vacation. But keeping minor issues apart, the stay at kanishka was a bliss.",Kanishka Villas
142,Value Stay,30,October 2016,"Based on availability, I stayed in a few upgraded rooms (the 2-bed pool villa and a 1-bed pool villa). The rooms were decently clean and reasonably appointed, but little to no sun around the pool area which made it less appealing. The location is a bit out of the way, there was a shuttle that would take you anywhere is Seminyak, but dependent on availability (not a big deal because taxi fare was very cheap). The staff were reasonably pleasant by Bali standards.",Kanishka Villas
143,Not satisfied really,30,September 2016,"I and my wife have been staying here for honeymoon. I d like to mention some major dissatisfactions about this villa.

First of all, we unfortunately havent had any proper wifi accessibility. It seems connected but due to the very low signal level, it is not possible to go online. Cant even checked the emails.

Secondly and more importantly; jacuzzi ans water-basin are really in a need of mainteance. Both are worn-out and not working properly. We have had 6 nights here in kanishka and unfortunately we werent able to use jacuzzi even one time. Because there is no possibility to fill that jacuzzi with that low level flow. Eventhough the water left open, the jacuzzi can not be filled up.

To sum up, staying in this place does not make me feel that we have been staying in a villa. It was more like renting a flat without no bath.

I am sorry to say that but we are bot satisfied with our room...",Kanishka Villas
144,Lovely villas & fantastic service!,50,September 2016,"My friend and I stayed here for our last 4 nights in Seminyak (We stayed in Gili T for 5 - amazing) and the service we received was exceptional. The villas were always clean and housekeeping came twice a day and left complimentary cakes in the evening. Breakfast is served in your room and the staff go out of their way to help you, including arranging excursions. As a guest at the villas, a shuttle service is also offered for free. My friend and I will be recommending to all of our friends and coming back next year.",Kanishka Villas
145,Bali stay,20,September 2016,"We stayed in the jacuzzi villa. Room was okay - a bit dirty. The jacuzzi took 45minutes to fill and jet holes were full of green mould and slime. Not impressed with $$ and quality of what we received. Breakfast food was not great, however staff and location was great. Wished we stayed in a pool villa or a central hotel with pool.",Kanishka Villas
146,"great service, friendly staff, nice and cozy villa",50,September 2016,"Initially I thought this Villa is not cozy at all.
I red some of the bad review…
However after decide to stay here, here’s what I thought amazing:

1. the staff are very friendly!

2. the environment is quiet and comfy (evethough it is in the central of Seminyak – amazing right?).

3. no mosquito at all… (they do the fogging every evening though)

4. the breakfast for me (Indonesian) are plenty (I choose American bfast), and its goooood hehehhee.

5. the pool is clean, however the wall inside the pool is a bit harsh and keep scratching my toes. You need to wait till the sun really spread well maybe around 10 AM. Otherwise its chilly.

6. room is large, clean, and so is the bathroom. Everything is perfect. And I don’t feel this villa is old at all lol.

Bottomline is, I really enjoy it, and i like staying here. For sure I will come again, and hopefully they still provide the same service with great staff, food etc.

Thanks Kanishka!",Kanishka Villas
147,Homey Villa,40,August 2016,"I went to this place at 8 August until 11 August, there 3 of us, i had 1 baby with 1 year old. At a glance i'm very stunning with this villa, very nice place, cozy and and neat, you will feel like home at first.
They are preparing you to stay long, they give quite complete utensil and very nice kitchen.
In the living room, they give you nice home theater.
The swimming pool is also satisfying.
I get the villa for 2 bedroom, but i cant use the 2nd floor.
The bedroom is good, but the mosquito is the only problem i got so far.
But if you rent a car, it will be quite nuisance because the entrance is quite small",Kanishka Villas
148,Superb Villas,50,January 2016,"The villa we were staying at was amazing.It had a swimming pool , Kitchen inside the villa. Drinks, Fruits, Tea, Coffe everything was available in the villas itself.

It was a lifetime experience staying in such a kind of villa.

The staff was also very warm with us.",Kanishka Villas
149,Cool villas cool place cool staff.,40,August 2016,"This place was real cool ... the staff were cool and the rooms were cool. We loved it. Went to Bali with group of friends to party and we stayed here. Would stay again as not that expensive... was laid back and in a cool area.

Only problem is it is not cool coming back to Aussie and work. Planning a trip again at end of year. Check out the restaurants nearby... if in doubt ask the staff they are the coolest.

All I can say is that it was the coolest place we have stayed in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
150,A hidden treasure,50,July 2016,"I was unable to fly due to volcanic activity, the airline I was flying on , which shall rename nameless ... put us up at a hotel we did not like. We went to trip advisor and found Kanishka Villas, we were pleasantly surprised at the price. We also found some tasty cheap restaurants near by. In the end we were quite pleased to have our flight delayed, as it turned out to be a blessing. As when we arrived in Darwin everything was three times the price. The staff were so nice and helpful at Kanishka and we really missed them when we got to Darwin. If you ever get stuck in Bali with volcanic ash .... try Kanishka Villas in Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
151,Good value stylish design,40,July 2016,"I was attendinga government conference in Bali, after it finished I was able to escape for a few days afterwards I tried some villas in Seminyak. The initial one was nice but very expensive so I tried Kanishka on an off chance, when I was walking by and found it to be not only a better standard but a much better value for money option. The villas was tastefully appointed and I enjoyed the layout. I had a wonderful three day stay where I did my eat, pray love thing before(massage daily and spa) returning to the family who are living in Paris, although we are from New Zealand.

The staff were most gracious, and I enjoyed this option of stay, as it was much more intimate than the large brand hotels.... be nice to return soon for more eat, pray love pampering in the not too ditant future. .",Kanishka Villas
152,Wonderful,50,June 2016,"Stayed here for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom pool villa and had a wonderful time. Staff was great and the room was amazing! We stayed in villa 16, which is more towards the end. This was great because it was very peaceful. There are big group villas in the same alley, so it can get a bit noisy if you're more towards the front of the property.
Some of the villas are in the shade so the pools are a bit chilly. Make sure you request a villa with a pool in the sun (#16 is in the sun). Don't forget to bring insect repellent, there are a lot of mosquito's.
Kanishka is centrally located and close to everything. The restaurant next door, Warung Cabe Rawit has delicious food. The massages at Soothe Reflexology, just across the street, are very good.",Kanishka Villas
153,Perfect breakfast,50,August 2016,"Actually, I was worried that this villa will be crowded due to its location in Seminyak, but I was dead wrong.
The villas, especially the ones I stayed in, the one bedroom-jacuzzi villa, is quiet and peaceful. I even hear the sound of cricket and bird chirping there.
I stayed for 4D3N there, the room was perfect, there' s a daily cakes provided and the various breakfast was nice",Kanishka Villas
154,Made our holiday,50,July 2016,"My wife and I are semi retird and we indulge in holidays from Dundee to Bombay to Rangoon. I am not the usual traveler to write reviews but on this occasion I felt compelled to do so, as our stay at Kanishka literarly made our vacation.
The ambience and friendliness of the stff was incomparable, although we did notice the geniune friendliness proffered by the balinese people in general. The staff were incredibly well trained so all credit to the management. Being experienced travelers my wife and I really appreciated the value for money, that these villas offered. Bali itself was marvellous, the staff recommended some wonderful day trios which we thouroughly enjoyed. The location was excellent and the area had a vitality that was infectious. This is probably the best stay we have encountered since I retired from the army six years ago. I have no hesitation in recommending this property.",Kanishka Villas
155,BEAUTIFUL VILLA ++ NICE BED ++ NICE HOUSEKEEPING BUT ....,50,August 2016,"it was short getaway with my friends for celebrate bridal shower for my friends and i choose 3d2n for jacuzzi room, buy this from groupon.com, overall the room was nice,, the bathroom was huge, clean room, house keeping always cleaned my room around 11PM and include nice breakfast and dinner at first day,.
but when i check out, receiptionist ask for extra charges Rp 600.000 because she said in high season but i don't want and tell her that when i booked this hotel by email from Mr Retno, i didn't get explain that this august is high season so i didn't want to pay and then it resolved, so you need to print your email when u booked so u can show them your mail for avoid extra charges. overall all was good.
Ooh, u can ask more free towel.

Thanks GSA Kaniskha",Kanishka Villas
156,Beautiful villa.... But....,30,February 2016,"Was on a short getaway with my husband and I was at the one bedroom villa with the private pool for 3D2N... The villa is huge and very cozy... The staffs are very nice and helpful. But our air conditioner in our room was very hot,then we complained about it but maybe the ac needs to be fixed and the second day the staff were opening us the room upstairs which is good...
However,there's a rat inside the villa...when we're going out and i just left some food at the dining table,i think the rat has stopping by the dinning table...
The pool is very nice but it's way too cold...
The breakfast and the dinner is just average....i was expecting a nice breakfast...
Overall,the villa is clean...staffs are very kind and helpful...but i think it still needs to be improved....",Kanishka Villas
157,Great for a couples retreat,40,August 2016,"Amazing place. Very happy we chose Kanishka villas. Beautiful people, great service and extremely helpful. Fabulous location, walking distance to everything, if not the free shuttle will drop you off. Reception organised a driver for us to do a few tours and he was amazing. Knew all the best spots. Great restaurants and coffee shops right out front. Definitely be back! Thanks for a great experience.",Kanishka Villas
158,A really nice place to stay... location location location.,50,July 2016,"My wife and I are travelled from our home town of Cleethorpes in England, it was a long flight but we were not disappointed. We have been to Bali five time now and this property was definitely the best in terms of service, value for money and service. Best of all was the location, it is close to everything shops, restaurants, beach and bars. I met a Scottish chap that seemed to be in charge and he was a gold mine of information on Bali, as he was a long term resident and we had a coffee with him and he told us all the Do's and Dont's... most illuminating. The design of the villa's were excellent, I enjoyed showering in the open air and also the extremely comfy beds which assisted us with our jet lag. We stayed for ten days and were only just beginning to get to know the place when we had to leave. Next time we are going to stay for longer as ten days is not enough when encountering such a long flight. We will most certainly stay here again and I hope the villas and surroundings have not changed too much on our return..",Kanishka Villas
159,Amazing Villas,50,July 2016,"The place is really very good, hospitality is excellent, also it's location is perfect, as all the shops as well as the beaches are closeby and at a walkable distance from the villas. The hotel staff arranges for all sorts of comforts and makes sure you have a plesant stay in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
160,Not worth the money,30,July 2016,"We recently stayed at kanishka's 1 room jacuzzi villa.Was very much disappointed with jacuzzi.The wall space just above the jacuzzi was not clean.The bath robes were not clean.We had air con cooling issue also on one day.They repaired it at night 10.30 and spoilt our holiday evening.Initially they did not tell that we would be charged extra for the snacks and bar items kept in the mini fridge.We thought it was complimentary, but they cheaply charged for mineral water and a packet of cashew that was kept inside the fridge.The only nice thing was speed service.Not at all worth the money.Thumbs down",Kanishka Villas
161,Not up to Expectations,20,July 2016,"Seminyak has loads of pool villas and by loads I meant loads! I'm rather disappointed with Kanishka because what you see in the photos is not what you get. The villa we are currently at (we are here now with 2 more nights to go) is dated, furnitures are old, toilet & bath tub is leaking, hot water is not consistent, faucet at sink is not working and it's shower head is defective. Even the towels provided are old & frayed. Breakfast is provided, but portions small, and food is not good. We have stayed in other pool villas before, this is by far the least satisfactory. Sure, it's location is quite central, and it's staff very friendly (this is a common trait where tourism is a big chunk of their livelihood & it's expected).
But this villa - not worth our dough. Very disappointed.",Kanishka Villas
162,Only good thing about this place is the staff,10,July 2016,"We booked to stay here through Luxury Escapes in which we thought we were getting a 5 star villa this was certainly not the case. The first 1 bedroom we checked into had water damage all over the ceiling and the bedroom smelt mouldy they then moved us to another villa which the bedroom was full of mosquitos and also smelt mouldy, the sheets had stains on them and there were loose wood planks around the pool area which could be very dangerous. We were meant to stay here 7 nights but only stayed 2 hours and then checked out and booked into another hotel. Very disappointing. The owner needs to do some serious work here. The staff were very accommodating and apologetic. My advise- don't stay here.",Kanishka Villas
163,Getting better all the time,50,July 2016,"I hadn't been to Kanishka in Seminyak for around 5years so I was pleasantly reminded of all the attention to detailed service and great amenity of the location in the Seminyak area. The rooms are always spotless and give a great feel of the true bali. Thank you to the Kanishka teams for always trying to provide great service with a smile, hope to return soon. Enjoy your stay",Kanishka Villas
164,Maintenance and Service a poor show!,20,June 2016,"I'll start with a few of the positives first...Nearly all the Staff @ Kanishkas on the ground are very pleasant, and friendly. The Villas are quite comfortable, have a tropical flavour, and quite spacious. This area of Seminyak is very close to all local shops and amenities, a good position.
However...The Kanishka Reception, if you can call it that, is so, so, tiny, with a small 4 seat couch, and one other chair! On our first inspection of our villa (19) all seemed ok, after all your on holiday, we had asked for a pool with sun, these are, as we now find out, unavailable due to the villas placements and the upstairs separate Jacuzzi area shading the lower pools, by the way the pools are very deep @ 6' the whole length, but they are nice tho. The internal design of the Villas is nice, but all are getting very tired, and in dire need of a refurbishment and a good repaint. Maintenance were called the following day as my partner was not happy with the shower, moreover no hot water, pressure going up and down, and spraying everywhere else but where it should, Maintenance said there was a stone in the pipes, has been for years, apparently, but they will have this same problem with all the showers! and so they didn't attempt to fix, Also the shower floor is very filthy with a build up of slippery scum, don't go in there bare footed, wear thongs. There is no restaurant there at all, however they do cook breakfasts there in a small ""Kitchen"" and deliver an ordered (previous night) breakfast to your accommodation, unfortunately you will find this to be cold when it arrives, and microwave is so small, the plate will not fit in there...Money needs to be spent here, as there is a lot coming in from tourists, however the owner is a Scotsman! hence no money is being put back in.
In conclusion I would say that for the prices that they charge per night, you can do a lot, lot, better, for under half the price, with a much better superior tropical Villa with pool, great restaurant & staff, close to shops, restaurants & beach up the road in Seminyak at Aria exclusive villa and spa, check them out!
Two Great restaurants down the road is the Kayana, and Biku, both highly recommended. Don't forget dinner @ Frankenstein's live show!",Kanishka Villas
165,Not at all like the Internet photos,20,June 2016,"Poorly maintained and just generally shoddy in appearance. We paid for an upgrade to a pool villa after purchasing voucher on Scoopon for a jacuzzi suite. Unfortunately the way the villas are configured, there is minimal sunshine in the courtyards and the pool areas. The pool water remains freezing cold, in other words, you need to leave the villa to get some sunshine, which is what you go to Bali for! We were going to be moved to another villa on our 5th day after my complaint on the 2nd day (when another was
Would become available) but this villa (16) was the same but with the added disappointment of no air con in the living area, therefore we declined and continued to stay in our villa, number 11. I did demand a refund of our upgrade costs due to not being able to use the pool, when I've returned home and checked my account, it was short of the agreed refund amount. Also the outdoor bathroom is terrible and good luck trying to get wet under a shower that just sprays water everywhere but on you. We've stayed in Bali many times and this was the most disappointing.",Kanishka Villas
166,Shody maintenance,20,June 2016,We booked in for a week. We had maintence people there for the first four days. No hot water in the shower. The hws was turned off so they new about it. Air conditioner not working in bedroom. Took two days to fix including new circutry and new fan. Several other minor things but management definately need a shake up.,Kanishka Villas
167,Nice design,40,June 2016,"I stayed 1 night with my uncle and aunt.
We ordered 1 bed room with swimming pool and it was great, stuffs are nice and design was great !!
Villa has high potential to be romantic villa and the price also worth it.
Even it located in alley but it's located in seminyak so we got easy access to anywhere.
Absolutely come again next time.",Kanishka Villas
168,Kanishka Villas Seminyak,30,June 2016,"I booked the above having an understanding that it had AC
To find it only in the bedroom was disappointing. It was incredibly hot and I had to request a fan to be able to sit outside to eat breakfast. The breakfast was average.
Our AC broke so we had to move.. I requested an upgrade but not available .
The Villa was a good size. The bed was comfortable .
Clean and maintained well. Staff courteous ... English speaking average.
Great location... Recommend pool villa as minimum... You could cool off regularly .",Kanishka Villas
169,Not up Market,30,June 2016,"We stsyed here in 2012 and they were very good. Today however a different story. Nothing but problems. Aircon not working, electrics in and out. Mould and peeling paint work.along with many other items to many to mention. Service is only the cleaners nothing else. Will not be comming back.",Kanishka Villas
170,Not so good,30,May 2016,"We have been travelling to Bali for 40 years and like to stay at different places. Kanishka Villas were recommended by Luxury Escapes and as their deals have always exceeded our expectations, we booked for 5 nights at Kanishka and then for 7 nights at the Fairmont, Sanur, again with Luxury Escapes.
The villas are far from the beach so if you like to walk in the early morning there is only the footpath along the main road.
The villa itself is self contained with its own pool, but there is no restaurant so breakfast from a set menu was delivered to your room or you had to go out for it. There was no buffet breakfast and the menu choice was limited.
The living and kitchen area were nice enough but they could definitely do with blinds on the large windows as the sun streamed in there until lunch time which made it quite hot – plus if you wanted to watch TV in the morning over breakfast you just couldn’t see the screen. To get to the bedroom and bathroom you had to walk along the side of the pool which required everyone to take care as the steps could be quite slippery and there was nothing to stop you falling into the pool if you slipped. The bathroom had an outdoor shower which was in need of maintenance as the spray went everywhere except on the person showering! The kitchen tap was falling off and those in the bathroom one needed a bit of work too.
We were booked for 5 nights but left after 3. We were very disappointed with Kanishka.",Kanishka Villas
171,Nice,30,June 2016,"First time visiting with my Wife and 1yr old. Found a deal on Groupon for the Spa Villa. The room was nice enough, it was upstairs above a pool room so that could be quite noisy when being used. The bathroom, shower, toilet and spa are all outside. Breakfast was included pretty basic but was nice. Short walk to most restaurants.
The staff were excellent, very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. If i could rate them separate they'd get 5/5.",Kanishka Villas
172,"Not so flash - really aged villa, over priced & with too many interruptions",30,May 2016,"My partner and I stayed here in May this year. We loved the look of the layout online & were lucky to get a deal through luxury escapes for $1400 for the week. We stayed in villa 18 that had the 1 bedroom layout with the pool in the corner. This villa was a little disappointing to be honest, it doesn't suggest that its a 2 story villa in the photos & you can hear people stomping around upstairs - the bathroom and villa entirely was rather aged & I would be seriously annoyed if I paid the price of what was $4500 (or something ridiculous like that) that was being asked if you booked directly through the villa. Its really not that crash hot, the staff are lovely don't get me wrong but there are really nicer places to stay in Bali.

In addition to this we didn't really feel like we had much privacy - we would probably have a knock on our villa door about 4-5 times a day.. its really nice that they just want to help & offer services etc - but seriously it didn't feel like we had any privacy at all. They knock on the door for breakfast which is standard so I'm not complaining about that by all means, then knock on the door about an hour later to clean your room (again standard), then another 30 minutes or so after those people leave you get another knock on the door asking if they can clean up your breakfast, and then theres another knock an hour or so later offering complimentary cake, and then another knock for a newspaper & then another to spray for mosquitos..and so on. I really am not one to complain & wish I saw the do not disturb sign earlier (which wasn't very obvious) - this was driving us bananas.

What really annoyed me is my partner was suffering from a heat rash and was sleeping in the room which I decided to sit and watch a movie to escape the heat for a bit - you can't hear people knocking on the door when you are in there and it was only because I saw something move that I went out of the room & there were some butlers standing in the kitchen as they had let themselves in to provide another round of complimentary cakes (which he had already mentioned the previous day not to bring) - ya'd hate to be bloody sleeping naked as the kitchen is right next to the glass doors of the bedroom!

The breakfast was pretty average & a lot of the times cold by the time they brought it to you (they don't cook it at your villa).

Oh and the WIFI - pretty much non existent, first few days we had no WIFI at all which we use a lot to contact our families back home in Aus. If there was WIFI the signal was so weak that you couldn't make a phone call on viber anyway.

I just wanted to give everyone a really honest opinion, we've been travelling to bali every year for the last 4 years and never have a bad word to say, but this accommodation honestly wasn't the best for the prices they are asking.",Kanishka Villas
173,Romantic villas in Seminyak,40,May 2016,"The villas are located in a small road in Seminyak, what makes them completely isolated from noise, what is great. The villas are very big, with lot of space for a couple and a lot of amenities (pool, kitchen...). The place is quite comfortable and the staff very nice. The only small ""but"" is they aren't well maintained and even the first impression is very good, after the second day you start to see some things... But overall, we had a great time there and we enjoyed a lot the place. We will probably repeat again.",Kanishka Villas
174,Awesome property and close to everything you need in Bali!,40,May 2016,"This was my wife’s second stay at Kanishka Villas, but the family's first. I was pleasantly surprised. The villa was spectacular with an indoor pool, very generously sized rooms and bathrooms. And the location was fantastic too. Whatever you need – shopping, touristy locations, restaurants, beachfront…everything close by. I and my family just loved it. We left with a ""pampered"" feeling!",Kanishka Villas
175,Relaxing villa,40,March 2016,"Stayed here for a week it was a good location close to shops restaurants .the villa was nice but it could do with a revamp looking a bit tired ,staff were good breakfast to your room was lovely always on time ,television reception was very poor ,but it was still a nice place to stay",Kanishka Villas
176,Busy area Seminyak,40,April 2016,"Our booking was recommended to us, the facility was clean, secure,& the people were courteous, the in house delivered ibreakfast was amazing, we booked a smaller villa which had a few problems but once we go it all sorted we were upgraded to a very nice villa, the staff were helpful.",Kanishka Villas
177,Functional 2 bedroom pool villa,30,May 2016,"As with most Bali Villas there are positives & improvement points for Villa Kanishka. We stayed in Villa 9 for 7 nights with another couple & 4yo. Overall we enjoyed our stay.

On the positives:

1. Transport to your Seminyak destination throughout the stay. This is a bonus as the villa is not within walking distance of the beach. They also happily transported us to numerous restaurants.

2. Large rooms & generous living spaces that were well fitted out & comfortable - the pool was sizeable enough for a daily dip to cool off.

3. Baths & large showers in both bathrooms.

4. A good daily breakfast delivered to the villa & petit fours delivered each evening.

5. Walking distance to numerous shops, restaurants, spas.

Points for improvement:

1. Shower heads!! Simply the worst shower heads which sprayed all over the place yet you felt like you were not getting wet. These need replacing.

2. Towels. A two bedder with 4 people staying please provide 4, not 2, pool towels. The bath towels & flannels also need replacing. Not quite threadbare but not far off.

3. The upstairs bedroom is overly hot even with 2 air conditioners running. This is because the outdoor bathroom door slides open & it is unable to be locked when in use & the front window has a 1 inch gap under it - letting in the hot air (& mosquitos)

4. Outdoor daybeds (2 not 4) are new and very chic - but supremely uncomfortable.

5. Wifi was intermittent.

All these things said this is Bali & the Villas do not promote themselves as 5 star. The staff are nice and accommodating & we enjoyed our stay as I am sure you will too.",Kanishka Villas
178,Nice relaxing villa,40,April 2016,"Stayed with another couple in a 2 bedroom private pool villa. Staff were friendly and helpful. We got a special via luxuryescapes.com, wouldn't pay the normal price they advertise to stay here. The villa itself was in pretty good condition, some small things could be fixed. The area is prone to its of mosquitos so they spray quite regularly. Definitely recommend taking your own insect repellent and sleeping with it on.

There isn't a restaurant here which didn't phase us, but it meant you had to ring and order your breakfast the night before which was kind of annoying.

The villa is located about 1.5km walk from Cocoon (Double6 beach) and has lots of nice restaurants close by. Would stay in the area again!",Kanishka Villas
179,Well positioned,40,May 2016,"Easy walk to where its all happening in Seminyak. We initially booked a jacuzzi villa but it seemed somewhat limited and once upgraded to one with a private pool, we never looked back! Really friendly staff and comfortable. Its our first time in Bali, so difficult to compare value… Excellent wifi.",Kanishka Villas
180,Peaceful place but rather run down,30,April 2016,"Very nice villa with private pool, though the first villa we stayed at was not really in a good condition. Shower head couldn't dispense water, and the bath tub was leaking. Asked for a change in villa and we got a better one this time round.

The staff there speaks fairly good English, although they didn't seem to be the most helpful around.",Kanishka Villas
181,Tired and far from Luxury,30,April 2016,"Recently stayed for 7 nights with another couple, we have all been to Bali several times over 20 years. These Villas are well past there prime, after 3 days of no hot water in one room that couldn't be fixed and a broken toilet, we were moved to another villa. In this villa the toilet in one room was not fixed to floor properly, villa supplied hair dryer caught fire while being used and on the final night a section of plasterboard ceiling collapsed in bedroom. However the Staff were excellent and responded promptly and courteously and meals were great. The Villas themselves were adequate but certainly not a Luxury villas as advertised. It appears that the management is trying to boost the standard of the facility by adding other features such as in house meals, massage and trips and meals to Jimbaran. We certainly wont be returning to these villas again.",Kanishka Villas
182,so-so,30,April 2016,"Old facilities
1. water leakage from the wall when using Jacuzzi
2. Jacuzzi tub loses water slowly. Therefore takes a long time to accumulate the water
3. Air-con is loud and slow in cooling
4. Using water boiler caused power shutdown

Likes:
1. In-room breakfast service
2. Location is good. Private and near popular places
3. Staff has a good service attitude",Kanishka Villas
183,A little out of the way,30,April 2016,"The resort is nice but a little too far away from the centre of Seminyak. The villas are OK but not great if you want a quite romantic get away. Idea for families with kids who can be a bit noisy at time. The biggest problem is the bed in the master bedroom are rock hard, was like sleeping on a pallet of bricks. We asked to change villas but was told all the beds are the same. We eventually cut our stay short to get a decent night sleep in another resort.",Kanishka Villas
184,Awesome villa,50,April 2016,"We booked the villa through a groupon deal. At first we thought it was kind of expensive because Bali is known to have good cheap villas, but when we got to our villa we felt it was worth it.

The villa was HUGE. there was a fully functional kitchen, living room, pool, bedroom and bathroom.

Living room/kitchen: daily breakfast was served in the living room, if you want breakfast before 7am they provide a breakfast box with breads and pastries

Pool: pool was amazing, however there was a lot of natural shade from the trees so we didnt get much sun to sun tan

Bedroom and bathroom: both were huge and comfortable.

Pros: they do have a shuttle service that brings you to anywhere in Seminyak, however, it's subjected to availability. The breakfast was so so but there was a lot of food. the location is good, very near the beach and there're many places to eat outside the villa

Cons: it was expensive but if you can afford it you should try it. There were some mosquitos. Housekeeping didn't clear our dirty cups in the morning. the internet was also a little slow, i couldn't load instagram or snapchat.",Kanishka Villas
185,Great luxury villas in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"Loved this find in Seminyak. Beautifully presented villas, very helpful staff and the little touches that make a holiday easy. Our villa had it's own private pool which we used extensively, living spaces were open to the outdoor, but the bedroom was enclosed and air conditioned, that with a mosquito netted four poster bed meant that sleeping was very comfortable.
The in house menu offered a good selection, breakfast was served in your villa each morning. One of the best services was a drop off services to anywhere in the Seminyak area, given the humidity it was great to get to your destination and then wander back at your own pace.
I would certainly recommend Kanishka Villas.",Kanishka Villas
186,love at first sight,50,May 2015,"im a repeater to this villa. i love the ambience, modern luxury meet traditional balines.
love the room, love the large bathroom, love the air flow in our living room. love the massage. the location is near to the most famous place in seminyak.
btw i stay in villa no 2, beside the lobby hotel. one bed room private pool.",Kanishka Villas
187,Nice stay,40,April 2016,"Great air con, breakfast and night's sleep in the bed, really helpful staff and the outdoor bathroom was really nice. Appreciated the mosquito repellent in the evening, very easy to ask them to come at a different time if it will interrupt your time.
There were two downsides to the stay, our wifi was absolutely useless and impossible to use but we didn't really need it which was lucky. Also, the hot tub for our room took absolutely ages to fill up which was really inconvenient and a shame because it was the reason for our stay.",Kanishka Villas
188,love this villa,50,March 2016,I was there for honeymoon with my husband. Breakfast and dinner was good. The service was great. Also the room and pool. The place is near from shopping center but still quite and private. I will go back there if I have chance.,Kanishka Villas
189,It was pleasant but could do better.,30,March 2016,"The service was great, the staff and their hospitality were very warming but I would have to say that several issues could have been done for our stay here last month.

First the air conditioner in the master bedroom was not cold enough. So for 2 nights we slept in quite warm temperature in our room. I didn't bother report this to the front desk because we were staying just for 2 nights.

Second the private pool in the villa kept getting filled with leaves from the 2 trees surrounding it. We had to ask the room services to clean it every time we wanted to swim.

Third, around 6 or 7 pm every night room service would come and spray mosquito repellent through out the villa which really disturbed our rest time.

Fourth, every night before the next day we had to call the receptionist and confirm regarding our breakfast menu the next day. I really think this is unnecessary, management should serve the breakfast whether or not we call.

Despite all of that, it was a pleasant stay. But a villa such as this I would recommend for those traveling with kids or families.",Kanishka Villas
190,Beautiful but...,30,April 2016,"We arrived at the airport where we were greeted by a staff member from Kanishka he was lovely and helped us with our bags to the car. He didn't speak much English and didn't really understand much of what we were saying.
Arrived at the villas and were greeted by a welcome drink. We checked into a spa villa for the first 3 nights of our stay as there were no pool villas available. It was clean and tidy. But looked a bit dated and some parts were dirty from age. We soon found out not to let them clean our room each day as they would turn our air-conditioning off and then returning from a hot day out wasn't very nice.

Checked out of there and into our first pool villa 14b. Again was nice, clean and neat but dated. Some parts of the deck felt like they were going to fall through. Next morning when we were in the main living area and shocked by how many mosquitos in the villa we noticed that there was a whole door panel missing from our sliding doors and they had tried to patch it up with a curtain. I wasn't very happy about this and asked if we could change rooms which thankfully we could. We changed to room 1b which is a 2 bedroom villa. This was very nice however I must say its a bit annoying that the sun beds don't see much if any sun every day so the whole unit is pretty dark all the time and the pool stays very cold.

The aircons in the bedrooms don't seem to be very efficient and we found ourselves hot some of the warmer nights.

I also wanted to mention we booked the accommodation through Luxury Escapes which included a couple of extras like a trip to their sister company in Jimbaran bay to see the fish market and take part in a cooking class. We were very excited to do both but waited over an hour for the rest of the guests taking part in the tour to arrive (well that's what we were told) then we were driven to the market in what seemed to be one of the staff members cars and on the way the aircon stopped working and only 2 windows would open. It became a very hot ride to the market and we had to go back to the hotel in this same car. The cooking class was not a class it was more of a demonstration of some things they cooked. Most of the sauces were pre made and the cooking part of other things was done in the kitchen after we had finished. Nobody else cooked except the chef.

The website and brochures also boast about high speed wi-fi. It was far from high speed when it worked and most days we would have periods where we wouldnt bother with it as it was so slow. Dont think youll be able to load even a short facebook/youtube video through it. Some days it would just drop out and reception would say they would send somebody but the next day it still wasnt working.

Over all the holiday was amazing but there was a bit to be improved on.",Kanishka Villas
191,Convenient & comfortable,40,March 2016,"We had an enjoyable stay in these villas recently. We stayed in Villa 18 and it was clean & comfortable and very private. The photos on their website are an accurate reflection of the 1 bed pool villas.

The location of the villas are great with lotsa shops & restaurants close by and the beach front is an easy 15-20 minute walk.

The service was friendly though a bit patchy at times.

Some of the areas where they could improve is the wifi service which was free but not very reliable and the linen (the towels have seen better days).

This is not a five star luxury resort but they're not charging 5 star rates so on the whole I thought it was good value.",Kanishka Villas
192,Great return visit,50,March 2016,"Have returned to this property several times, the last time early this month - March.
Great time to be in Bali - weather was beautiful. This place has not changed in years,
still the same wonderful place with excellent staff. Rooms were immaculate - clean
and well taken care of. Everything worked! Am looking forward to another visit next
year if all goes well.",Kanishka Villas
193,Enjoyable Seminyak Resort,50,March 2016,"As is also now standard for any visit to Bali, we spent a couple of nights at the Kanishka Villas, in the busy shopping and entertainment area of Seminyak.
We were in one of the two bedroom villas, (one ground floor and the other upstairs).
There is also an small but adequately sized pool on the ground floor level.
Extremely well appointed and equipped, very convenient to some very good restaurants and shopping, Kanishka is priced right for an enjoyable stay in this part of Bali.",Kanishka Villas
194,25th Wedding Anniversary,40,March 2016,"booked a 1 bedroom private pool villa to celebrate our special time, the villa was comfortable but starting to age as with most asian hotels. All meals are served in the villa as there is no restaurant in the complex, villa is equipped with small kitchen, dining and living rooms.
Would stay here again but would look for special offers in regards to pricing.",Kanishka Villas
195,Excellent Honeymoon,50,September 2015,We stayed here for our honeymoon in September and we had an amazing time. We stayed in a pool villa that was out of this world with open plan living room opening up on to our own private pool. The staff where friendly and helpful and were always on call of we ever needed something. Loved our stay now we're just saving so we can return.,Kanishka Villas
196,Fantastic Pool and Outdoor Area,50,February 2016,"We stayed at Kanishka Villas for 11 nights in a one bedroom pool villa. The villa was exactly as the photos promised - the villa was very private and the staff very helpful. Try using D'Va for transport and hiring motor bikes (its located just at the entrance to Kanishka Villas) bikes are about $5-7 per day (cheaper than using taxis) and Gede one of the drivers was great.
We requested Villa 19 as we knew it has the most sun - usually up to 2pm each day (enough to warm the pool). Would definitely recommend Kanishka Villas for those wanting peace and tranquility.",Kanishka Villas
197,Wonderful staff,50,February 2016,"we set of from Henley in England and it was a long flight I slept very well but my wife is a bad traveller and it took her 3 day to recover, as it was over 23 hours door to door. The staff were jolly nice and helped my wife's recuperation considerably. Attending to her every need as she could not get out of bed. During this time I went to learn body boarding at the nearby beach which is a pleasant 5 minute stroll. A lot of the Australian chaps were extremely adept at this activity and were kind enough to pass on a few tips. My wife when better joined me in the evenings for a stroll along the beach, unfortunately the mosquito's liked her and she was badly bitten... once again the staff came to our rescue using a traditional cure off a peeled banana to sooth her bites which became very itchy ... this certainly did the job. The villas are self contained and extremely pleasant and have a variety of different restaurants only a few minutes away. My wife plucked up the courage and tried a Balinese dish which she enjoyed. The staff again gave us a lift to the airport for our trip to Australia ... all in all a jolly relaxing experience. If my wife is up to it we plan to stay a few days on our return leg back to England.",Kanishka Villas
198,Lovely quiet little villa,40,February 2016,"We stayed in Kanishka villas for 5 nights our honeymoon and had a great time there. We booked a single room villa with a beautiful private pool. Friendly, helpful staff, clean bathrooms, nice bedroom, well serviced villas with staff who also come in the evenings to set up mosquito nets and mosquito coils. Breakfasts are good and delivered to your room. The only downside to this is that by morning, the mosquito coils have burned out, the living area is outdoor and we had to spend a lot of time fending off mosquitoes rather than enjoying our breakfast.
Cooking class was underwhelming and could benefit from a rejig.
Overall, we had a pleasant, relaxing stay.",Kanishka Villas
199,Fo manager not qualify to handle complaint,10,February 2016,"We stayed here frm 12-15 feb. Our flight at 1550 to jkt. We cant get any late cake out at 1pm. The reason is already guess waiting. Actually this is low season. Somemore we had complaints, every nite at around 12 midnite the electricity off. It happens for last 2 nites. Water shower unstable hot n cold water. Sofa stink. Automatic closet water pressure is not appropriate at all. Parking lot to small. The manager should be more flexible with the guess coz if no guess they cant earn money for living. And he dont know at all how to handle the guess!!!!!!! If 2 star hotel or villa its ok he handle the guest very straight. Come on this is 5 star villa but the way he handle guess like 2 star villa. The sofa villa is dusty. Tv not clear. Last but not least , while i'm still talking on the phone, the phone cut off and he didnt try to call me back. How rude!!!!!! Pak FOM better you improve your skill n behaviour before become FoM!!!!!!",Kanishka Villas
200,A quiet retreat,50,February 2016,"I work for a high tech firm in Silicon Valley and every year we have a week of brainstorming far away from the States. The 5 star resort where it was held this year was very nice but I always feel like a battery hen trapped with my fellow colleages. I serindipidously stumbled across these villas which were perfect for my needs and I was able to escape, get my imaginative juices flowing and evaluate the days developments. The Villas were unobtrusive and very private and I enjoyed the walk at night to the restaurants and the near by yoga center. The staff were always there to assist, but like the Vilas themselves were unobtrusive but ever present.. I found the proprt to have a calm ambience which helped my thought process and I introduced it to some fellow colleages and we are planning a trip there during the fall. Cool thoughtful rooms...and I was even able to watch the Superbowl live.",Kanishka Villas
201,Luxury Resort,50,July 2015,"We stayed here for 2 nights. This is a complete luxury resort created in between the Kuta market. The room had 2 LED, one in the lobby and another in the bed room. Total green villa. One cannot imagine the size of this Villa from their door.

Staff was helpful. We booked a single room pool villa. However, there was no availablity of that when we reached there. Therefore, they provided us 2 room pool villa.

Buffet was good. They serve at your room. You get only selected option to choose from, but that is enough for 2 person.",Kanishka Villas
202,Less than expectable,20,February 2016,"We arrived not expecting to be attached to two more villas and a villa above us if we had known this then we would not have chosen these villas.First night the male occupant in the next villa constantly spied on us over the wall,to do this he would have had to had stood on a chair really no privacy what so ever.
Then couldn't sleep for the occupants in the villa above constantly slamming doors until the early hours of the morning which went on for three nights.
There are heaps of Mosquitos, and the living area is so hot and humid you have to sit in the bedroom to keep cool.
The villa needed a good clean really dirty in palaces,we also so mice on more than one occasion.
If you want a clean villa and relaxing time then this is not the place for you.
These are not villas more like apartments and don't come cheap and is not the star rating as it states.

FEELING RIPPED OFF.",Kanishka Villas
203,Nice but out of the way,40,February 2016,"We stayed here with another couple and it was very nice the lounge room and the pool (2bed villa) very very good some Mozzies around but not much you can do there. The bathrooms are outdoor so very hot and steamy but looked very nice. The water pressure in the shower was almost non existent, our sitcom broke one night and 3 of the staff did everything they could to fix it but they could not fix it so the have us a fan and fixed it the next day, but they put a very big effort into trying to fix it.
Overall it was very nice a little bit out of the way but that can be good sometimes too.",Kanishka Villas
204,A greatv little place,50,February 2016,My husband and I took our two children on holiday to Bali. At first we stayed in Kuta but found it a little overwhelming and not very relaxing. We stumbled upon these Villas while browsing the trip advisor site. It was a move well worth it. We had a nice pool that got lots of sunshine as the kids were kept busy during the day. The staff organised baby sitters for the evening and my husband and I were able to enjoy ourselves at night as the nightlife was only a stone throw away. My husband really enjoyed it as the Villas are very close to the golf club and he managed to get three rounds of golf in. I was able to get a fair amount of shopping done and found the beach was very close where we took the kids to watch the sun set every night. I found the place very clean and tidy and the staff helpful and friendly ...very pleased we moved from Kuta to this little gem.,Kanishka Villas
205,Good but still irritating,30,February 2016,"The villas are good to look at with the good view of pool.
However it is not clean enough as it is shown in the picture.
When we pay the money, we expected a better quality and clean.

The villas has mosquito's living in it which cannot get rid of them by anyway

The insects inside the villas giving you the sense of stinks

The worst part is the bathroom
OMG!!!
Who is the stupid interior design who made the bathroom open from upside ??
Mosquito's will bite u when u are showering or doing anything
Insects are having fun in that.

For sure I do not recommend to visit this villas for anyone.",Kanishka Villas
206,Terrible place,10,January 2016,We arrived to these villas for the second part of our honeymoon what a let down. First we got room no 4 with pool that only gets 2 hours of sun each day then we asked to be moved. They moved us to room 18 with pool which was so pretty to look at. Wow what a night to remember 😩 first the water was hot we had to get them to replace then we had no internet was told the IT manager would fix but never showed up and last while I sat down to have a drink I see a big rat up on the kitchen sink . When I complained They had no other room except for no 4 which we decided against the next day we spoke after catching the rat in our room on there home made trap I showed the pictures to the manager who was very apolagatic. He offered us there sister hotel but we decided against and they gave us a full refund back.,Kanishka Villas
207,A relaxing time in Bali,50,January 2016,"I can thoroughly recommend Kanishka Villas. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff. Our one bedroom villa was amazing and we loved the pool area. We also loved the fact that the main living area was air conditioned, which meant that we could immediately cool off after a hot shopping expedition..The location was great too with several good, cheap restaurants in the street and a short taxi ride to the main hub of Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
208,Classy place,50,January 2016,My friend and I stayed here for six nights in early January when we were touring southeast Asia. We found it a delightful place and my friend who is an interior designer just loved the decor in the villa and throughout. It was close to everything we required but also had a private and secluded feel.The four poster bed was incredibly comfortable as we both walked miles shopping and sightseeing and needless to say had a wonderful nights sleep. as some other places we stayed in Asia were much nosier and we did not sleep as well.All in all I would recommend anone this place who is travelling in that part of bali and keep an eye out for the tastfully designed rooms.,Kanishka Villas
209,"Very Good Property, Conveniently Located.. Slight pro-activeness needed from the staff",40,January 2016,"Hi stayed at Kanishka Villa for 5 Nights (4 in Jacuzzi Villa and 1 in private pool villa).
Hotel is conveniently located and has many restaurants/bars in the area.

Check-in was smooth and quick.

First impressions of the villas were very nice. Pool villa is amazing. Rooms were clean and fresh. The breakfast served was also good.

The air-con needs major repairs (or may be Bali was so hot that even Air-Con couldn't do their job at day time) as even at 16 degree set, we felt hot in the day. Other thing was that the hot water stops coming in the jacuzzi after 15 minutes. Needed a bit of pro-activness from the staff to get these fixed.

Good job in keeping mosquitoes out of the villas, we didnt face any issues there.

Other wise, the stay was very pleasant and we would definately recommend this hotel.",Kanishka Villas
210,Awesome Stay,50,April 2015,Well what can i say. Having our own pool in out villa was awesome. Daughter got to swim everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it. Family of 5 with 2 sons n 20's. Plenty of room. it was one of the best rooms to have with kitchen facilities so we made our own breakfast. villa was close to supermarket for easy shopping. Plenty of activities to be done. we hired a driver to take us around Bali. Super friendly and honest. never felt like i was being ripped off. look him up on facebook.

211,Charming and peaceful,50,January 2016,Wow this place was a nice surprise... I thought it was going to be very expensive but I checked with trip advisor and I got a great price. I had business in Seminyak and Ubud so it was very convenient. The rooms wer spacious and most pragmatic with quaint open air showers that made one feel at one with the elements. Staff were great and most helpful ...I even got dropped off to near one of my meetings. It was also a great place to unwind as I had several bars and cafes to go and write up my reports. The villa with the spa's were my choice as they rounded off my relaxation before climbing into the large four poster bed. If I have anymore business in that area of bali I would have no hesitation about returning to this property. Incidentally on my last two days I moved to its sister property which was called Geding Gedis in Jimbaran where I totally shut down from work and ended up in a villa with its own private pool.... nice to escape work. (if you do go there try the Bubur Ayam for breakfast),Kanishka Villas
212,Awesome place,50,January 2016,"I stayed at the Kanishka Villas in Seminyak from the 15th - 21st with my brother and my boyfriend in the two bedroom villa 10. We have loved our stay here and would certainly book here again in the future. The staff are all really friendly and helpful. The breakfast that you order the night before is delicious.
My only complaint is the mosquitos. It felt like there was always lots of them around. The hotel staff are on to it though. They provide mosquito nets on the beds and spray every night.
Overall a really nice stay.",Kanishka Villas
213,safe and secure and serene,50,January 2016,"Amazing place ...best I've been to in Bali ...we have traveled there 30 times and now have at last found a home away from home. It is close to the beach as I am a keen surfer, but also close to shops and nightlife...when you are back in the Villas it is so peaceful. Staff were awesome even by the high Balinese standards....can't wait to go back.",Kanishka Villas
214,Highlights & Lowlights,30,January 2016,"This resort would likely have been simply wonderful when new.

Alas, new it is not. And it has not been all that well maintained in my opinion. Lots of discolouration in the walls, sinks that don't work, safes that don't seem to work anywhere in the resort, etc, etc.

The rooms are nice enough, with a really cool outdoor bathroom feature, which sounds magical, until one realises the resort is infested with mosquitoes. They do spray copious amounts of flyspray and light coils of an evening, but it doesn't make a lot of difference. Plus the rooms are designed such that they don't seal well, so one is constantly battling the pesky mozzies. Our kids were eaten alive in the 2 days we were there, despite our best efforts to protect them.

The pools in each villa though, are wonderful, and it is a pure delight to be able to slip in and out of the pool at one's whim, in total privacy. The beds are comfortable enough, although the villas all seemed rather dark.

The service is good, and the food was reasonable, but in all honesty, 2 out of the 3 meals I had, I did not really enjoy. There are thousands of food options within 5 minutes walk of the resort, so if you can get a cheaper price without breakfast included, I'd do that next time.

But sadly, I doubt very much there will ever be a next time for me. There are many, many of these villa style resorts to choose from in Seminyak, and I have no doubt many of them are better maintained and designed than Kanishka. I did enjoy my stay, but next time I will be taking my business elsewhere.",Kanishka Villas
215,Quiet surroundings in Seminyak,40,November 2015,"Having stayed at the same Villa in Seminyak for many years, my friend and I decided to try somewhere new and booked a 2 bedroom villa at Kanishka. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome and were immediately shown to our villa. The overall feel of the villa was comfortable and well appointed and having previously stayed in more traditional villas, it was nice to relax in an airconditioned lounge! The furniture was comfortable but were showing signs of wear and tear, particularly the wooden furniture. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pool deliciously cold! Their free shuttle bus to Seminyak was a feature we used frequently and the staff were polite, friendly and prompt with their service.",Kanishka Villas
216,Lovely!,40,January 2016,"I stayed at the Kanishka Villas for 9 nights and it was very enjoyable. Having the Private Pool made dealing with the heat easy. The room service and housekeeping attendants were very polite and helpful however the guest services were a little rude at times, with their favourite word being ""no"" Other then that I have no faults. A lovely stay!",Kanishka Villas
217,Sumptuous,30,December 2015,"My wife and I embarked on a two month vacation around Asia to escape our Chicago winter. We initiall stayed at the Kanishka Villas in Bali in Indonesia....it was magnificent...this experience was enhanced by the time we had stayed in other villas throughout Asia as we could evaluate properl, therefore, we returned back there early as we realised we could not get any better after some of the good and bad experiences we encountered on our sojourn.
The stay in the villa Kanishka was simply a luxury and subsequently found it easy to access the shops and beach ....the staff were polite and incredibly helpfull, and even my wife who can be quite demanding could find nothing to complain about. A specila thanks to a lady called Yani who we saw regularly around the hotel as she was a mind of useful information about the area and places to go see. The villas are quiet and private but close to everything and I will not hesitate to recommend this place as I encountered some places that did not come close to the atmoshere or feel of this place.Thanks Kanishka.

218,Another fantastic stay at Kanishka,50,January 2016,"I stayed at Kanishka villas for a few nights with my friends in the beginning of January. I’ve stayed there before and this time was just as perfect as the last time. From the very beginning to the end of my stay the staff made sure we had everything we needed, they were always happy and very helpful. Upon check-in we got greeted with a nice welcome drink, after which we got into our most magnificent villa with a private swimming pool. The rooms were massive and have a nice Balinese decor. Our villa had everything you could ask for. It had a fully equipped kitchen, a lovely big living room and dining area with a big flat screen tv and dvd player, master bedroom with a bed in which I had the best sleep and a spacious bathroom.
Every morning we got breakfast brought to our villa. The breakfast was delicious and definitely one of the highlights of my days. The villas are located in a great place. There are a lot of restaurants and nice shops in the area and the walk to the beach is only 20 minutes or 5 minutes by car. I recommend Kanishka villas to anyone looking for a great luxurious place to stay in the heart of Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
219,Worst Resort I have Ever Stayed At,10,December 2015,"I stayed at the Kanishka Villas in Seminyak for several days in late December. It was the first time I have ever been so shocked at the conditions of a hotel or resort that I took my kids and checked out after one day. Why?

1. Upon checking in, the power to the villa went out. We waited for over an hour sitting in the dark with our suitcases while the check-in attendant tried to track down an engineer on their mobile phone. Not a great start.

2. When the lights went on, we wished they hadn't. The place was poorly lit and gloomy. The bathrooms were filthy, one of the toilets literally had some kind of dirt (like as in loose gravel, not a stain) all over it. I asked the front desk to send someone to clean it up, they never arrived.

3. The towels in the bathroom were grey and threadbare, frayed from what looked like years of use. Some of them actually had outright holes in them.

4. The layout of the place was awful. This is one of those villas with a private ""plunge pool"", quite expensive at US$400/night and a real year-end splurge for me and my kids. The pool in these places is usually situated outside the living area, but this one was smack-dab in the middle of the living room. If one went into the pool, it was impossible not to splash water all over the floor which was then perilously slippery and needed to be mopped up (this was the only use we could find for the threadbare towels, perhaps those staying there before us came to the same conclusion which explains how disgusting the things were). The pool was also filled with all kinds of leaves and refuse, I don't think it had been cleaned in months (if ever).

5. Somewhere right next to the villa there were kids shooting off some kind of fireworks, which were both very noisy and worrisome from a fire-hazard perspective, as the villa is made of mainly, yes, wood.

6. The villa was plagued, and I mean PLAGUED, with aggressive mosquitoes. I know that mosquitoes are common in Bali resorts, but the places normally take measures to minimize their presence (such as smoke coils etc). Kanishka Villas must be located in the worst possible location for this, becasue we were eaten alive non-stop the entire stay.

7. The front door, which is the only exit, was broken and could not be closed without being locked. Every time anyone went outside, or someone came to service the villa, the door would remain open and because it led directly out onto a street there were constantly strangers stopping and looking inside from the street. it was extremely annoying.

8. The internet wifi was complimentary, which was a nice touch until we realized it only worked 20% of the time and was so slow that it was impossible to load a news page onto an ipad. let alone - gasp - stream a YouTube video. The second day there it stopped working altogether and the network wasn't visible any longer. At 10am I asked the front desk to look into it, they said ""the engineer is rebooting the system, it'll just be another 5 minutes""....which went on until we finally cut our losses and checked out later that night.

9. The final straw, and what forced me to take my kids and leave the place, was the little bite-sized cakes they left for us around 7pm on our second day. The cakes themselves may or may not have been edible, we will never know becasue when we came back to the place in the evening said cakes were being consumed by two big rats that were on the dining table. The rats fled when we walked in but they left some nice souvenirs in the form of droppings on the table. We realized at that point that these little pellets that were strewn about the floor when we checked in weren't bits of gravel from the foliage next to the pool, but in fact more rat droppings.

Do not under any circumstances go anywhere near this place. It is a total disaster and should be closed down. I feel particularly bad for the nice Japanese couple we saw checking in as we left. It looked like they were on their honeymoon. Brrrrrr.",Kanishka Villas
220,Intimate Villas/Suites with Value for money,40,December 2015,"We had booked the 1 Bedroom Jacuzzi Suite at Kanishka Villas for 5N on our honeymoon. Advance booking through Expedia 4 months before the stay helped us get the room at under INR 5000 per night! Truly value for money.

The Villa was beautiful and big with an outdoor Jacuzzi tub perfect for honeymooners. The staff had taken extra care to keep it spic and span for our stay. Kanishka is at that perfect location which is close to the main market area of Seminyak (Bintang Market) and also walking distance from the street they popularly call the Eat Street. At the same time it is a 5-minutes drive from the La Plancha Beach making it an ideal stay location.

The staff at Kanishka is extremely friendly and warm with prompt service. Would highly recommend this place for value seeking travelers to Bali. For vegetarians, there are quite a few restaurants around Kanishka which serve delicious Italian/Chinese/Indian vegetarian food. So you do not have to move around too much for veggies.",Kanishka Villas
221,Peace and quite. Amazing villa.,40,December 2015,"The villa staff is friendly and very helpful, the service is quick and efficient. The room is luxurious, beautiful, and clean. The jacuzzi need to be secured when it is not use to keep its cleanliness, also use odourless mosquito repellent. Overall 4 out 5, definitely gonna stay here again.

P/s find a good taxi driver preferable a Balinese driver to go around Bali and book him for a whole day..easy to move around.",Kanishka Villas
222,Amazing,40,November 2015,"The villas were very spacious and luxurious. We had breakfast brought to us every morning and set up on our dining table.
It was quite a long walk to the beach, but really centrally located, not far from the Bali deli.
All the staff were amazing, they offered great advice. On arrival they had a home made juice ready for us and wet towels.
The pool was great, bed was comfortable and bathrooms nice.",Kanishka Villas
223,Not good at all,10,December 2015,"Hi..
I wouldnt really recommend this hotel because the hotel is not situated at a very happening place..as compared to alot of other hotels in seminyak...moreover when you book a villa you think of a dream home but it wasnt anything as such..

First when i went to the hotel..i had to wait for 45 mins for my room to get all setup...which is still ok as the checkin time as per the hotel was 1400 hrs...however when i went to my villa..the first thing i saw was the water spilled on the floor and it was coming out of the AC...the AC of the villa wasnt working and my mood was spoiled...i called up admin and the person tool almost 45 mins to fix it and then asked me to wait for 30 mins for it get cool...which didnt happen and then again called up admin and the made me waited for an hour before they shifted me to another room...now since it is very hot in bali and also these villas are not centrally airconditioned so the other villas ac wasnt effective as well...eventually i had to leave it after 2 nights where in i had paid for 4 nights and move to another hotel...",Kanishka Villas
224,Very quiet and relaxing,50,December 2015,"Beautiful rooms here, the staff are so friendly and warming and the room service was of a high standard not to mention the food was brilliant, and the refurbishment of amenities was so spot on, 5 minute walk to Bintang supermarket and surroundings you really can't go wrong !!",Kanishka Villas
225,"Great accomodation, great location, great staff!",50,November 2015,"We spent 5 nights at Kanishka Villas. Having read some reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to give it a shot and we weren't disappointed. The accomodation was in really goo condition, well looked after. The staff were very friendly and accomodating, always greeting us with a smile and a few words. The breakfast was of a decent standard for a hotel/villa - you can obviously get better food in a restaurant but the convenience of having it delivered to you room each morning made it well worth it. The location is awesome too - really central, which you realise once you get your bearings. We made the mistake of following the cost for a car from the airport listed on the website (300,000 RP). Do not pay that. Either get a meter taxi from the airport or negotiate no more than 100,000 RP.
The little Mexican restaurant next to the hotel is really good food. Also checkout Spa Bali - we tried everywhere and this was the best value. Really close to the hotel too.
One of the staff at the hotel was legendary - Sandy Made. He knows a lot about the local area and can really be trusted to not rip you off. Some of the younger guys will... You can contact him sandramade6@gmail.com - say hi from Tegan and Joo.",Kanishka Villas
226,Pleasant experience,40,November 2015,"The villas were pleasant and spacious. We enjoyed the outside shower and the overall privacy of the place. The Wi Fi was good. The staff were very pleasant and friendly and went out of the way to accommodate our needs. The place is about a 20 minute walk to the beach and close to restaurants, bars and shopping. We would stay here again when visiting Bali. Susanne and Larry",Kanishka Villas
227,Over priced for what you get.,30,November 2015,Booked through Luxury Escapes. Pretty disappointed when we got there. Tired Villa with an outdoor bathroom that let all the bugs in and also vermin overnight. Toilet was on the nose also. Would I stay there again? No don't think so.,Kanishka Villas
228,Holiday,50,September 2015,"If you want a 5 star amazing beautiful villa then this is it, close by to everything but away from the busy streets of Seminyak.. Breakfast got a bit boring after our 2nd night could do with a bigger selection, I wasn't use to the butlers coming in and cleaning up after us but they made our room and our stay so comfortable. Myself and my partner loved it here.this was our last place to stay in on our two week holiday,thank you to the beautiful staff here we can't wait to return with our children.",Kanishka Villas
229,Pleasant stay with friendly and helpful staff!,40,October 2015,"We were well attended to and service was mostly impeccable.

Staff were really friendly and could speak simple conversational English so communication was not a problem.

The villa is located near the main street, so getting around or getting a taxi wasn't a problem. They even have shuttle service, even though we didn't get to use it.

Airport transfers were also available at an additional IDR 356,950 (after 21%tax) each way upon request.

Complimentary in-villa breakfast was great too! We had made special requests for breakfast to be sent at a specific time as we had to go on a tour at 8am. Staff came by promptly and even called our room to inform us that they were at the door.

Cons:
1. Reservation process got a little frustrating as they had exceeded their mailbox quota and all emails bounced back.
2. Mosquitoes in bathroom & private pool area - villa is well aware of the problem and burn mosquito coils daily.
3. Housekeeping - was generally quite well done (they even helped tidy the place when they came to put the mosquito coils and we were not in); except for one day where the dishes were not cleared and the food on the dishes was scraped and placed in kitchen sink hole. So... We washed our own dishes ourselves when we returned from our tour that night.",Kanishka Villas
230,Private but everything nearby!,40,October 2015,"We stayed on our final 6 nights of a 15 night trip in October 2015.

The villa was very spacious, especially first two people. We were appointed one of the two bedroom villas (however the upstairs bedroom was locked as we only paid for a one bedroom). The villa itself was very beautifully constructed and arranged.

We had to cross over the pool via 'stepping stones' to get from the main lounge/dining to the bedroom/bathroom. This was quite fun for us, but for anyone with small children this may become an issue! The decor however was stunning, and the semi-outdoor bathroom was lovely (although it does allow the bathroom to get very warm, so make sure to close off the door to the bedroom to avoid letting the cool air out!). The kitchen was a good size, with complimentary water and utensils etc.

Super important to keep doors closed as much as possible, as mosquitos began to get quite annoying once they got inside - but this not really a huge issue! The repellents were replaced each night by the staff.The butler service operates well, and they were always very prompt with tending to our requests! The staff at the front reception were lovely, and very helpful to us when we planned a last minute day trip to Bali Zoo. They made all the calls/arrangements for us despite it being so last minute!

The villas are in a fantastic location. Mostly quiet street with very easy access to main shopping areas. The sports bar directly across can easily become a 'go-to' place for a quick meal/drink/game of billiards.

Kanishka was beautiful!",Kanishka Villas
231,A bit far from beach,40,October 2015,"Beautifully appointed villas. Friendly staff, problems with villa acted on quickly. The semi outdoor bathroom was very hot, could do with a fan in it. There is a rather long walk to the centre of Seminyak, they do offer a free driver, for the Seminyak area, for drop off, have to find your own way back.",Kanishka Villas
232,Service excellent!,40,October 2015,"We stayed at the private pool villa for 3 nights. The villa is very spacious, service was excellent. The service staff are always smiling with greetings. Their command of English is good. The location of the villa is within tourist spot. So there are dozens of restaurants and bars around the area. As the villa is surrounded with trees, have a mozzie repellent on standby. We got stung by a few. Breakfast was served right to our doorstep with a few choices you can choose.",Kanishka Villas
233,WOW,50,October 2015,"We were very impressed with our accommodation. We had everything we needed and the staff were amazing...nothing was too much trouble, and our choices for breakfast was great... we alternated between American and Bali breakys and was a great start to our busy days. The staff came back and cleaned up....we didn't have to do anything, it was all done for us. And the massage I received was magical. I would definitely recommend staying here.",Kanishka Villas
234,Safe Haven,40,September 2015,"We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa with another couple. The villa was beautiful and spacious. We loved the private pool and water feature. With a romantic decor, both rooms were a delight to stay in. However, the bathroom amenities upstairs are not as good as the ground floor suite. The balcony upstairs needs some renovation. The open spaces in the living/dining rooms were gorgeous for our complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was plentiful but the range quite limiting. The service staff were mostly friendly and helpful. Mini cakes were bought to the villa each night and mosquito coils replaced. The villas are located very closely to each other making noise an issue if you have noisy neighbours.The villa offers a free shuttle service to any location within Seminyak (this was particularly useful as the beach was not closely located) In terms of cleanliness, we found that the standards could have been improved. The sheets had stains in them and there were ants running about. The phone in our rooms didn't always work. Never the less, the villa was a great choice for our stay in Bali. We very much enjoyed the hospitality of Kanishka.",Kanishka Villas
235,Kanishka Seminyak,40,October 2015,"We booked a package deal through Luxury Escapes for an eight day trip to Bali. Kanishka Villas have a private pool or jacuzzi in each villa and are very spacious inside. Although the rooms are lovely the decor and fittings are showing their age and could definately do with updating.
The pool only recieved about 2 hours of sun during the day which meant that the water did not heat up at all and we found it rather chilly though this may be a good thing in summer. Sun bathing is also limited due to the high walls around a relatively small courtyard.
Staff were lovely and polite and responded to all requests.
A little far from the beach if you have little children. About a 20 min walk, though taxis are abundant and cheap.
No restaurant on site but they do have a good room service menu and there is a huge selection of eateries in a pleasant walking distance. Breakfasts, served in your room was amazing.
Overall, a great trip and if you want room to move instead of the usual motel room, these villas are certainly worth a look.",Kanishka Villas
236,excellent villa,50,September 2015,"The staff at the villas were excellent, everything very clean, had villa with private pool which was throughly enjoyable, room and bed comfortable.
just one word of warning if you book room with jacuzzi all up stairs and not suitable if you can not go up and down.
would recommend to anybody
unfortunately traffic in bali is getting worse, so allow time to go any where
wifi system a bit hit and miss could be improved",Kanishka Villas
237,Faulty Towers reprised,20,October 2015,"We spent 10 days in Bali with the last 2 nights in Villa 1, Kanishka Villas. Villa 1 is located directly behind the small reception office, which is just as well because of the multitude of visits staff had to make to our villa.

Upon arrival we walked through the front door/gate to see what looked to be a lovely 2 bedroom villa with private pool. Then we noticed the continuous loud hum of the water pump through the living area walls; we were located directly behind the reception area AND the water pump. The noise was 24 hours a day. Then we discovered the wifi worked for only a few minutes; staff had to keep resetting the wifi with it only ever lasting a few minutes. We gave up in the end - very inconvenient as my son had planned to conduct business meetings via Skype as well as do some post-grad study.

The whole indoor area just had a feel of grubbiness and being in need of a good scrub. The website photos look great but when you inspect in person you notice things are dated, chipped, dirty walls, rugs with large patches missing (moths?), dusty corners etc. The mosquito netting over the beds looked like it needed a good wash, the sheets looked badly washed and the white towels were grey and almost threadbare with many stains and marks on them.

When we went to go out on the first evening we realised that we had no key to lock the three living/kitchen area sliding doors; both bedrooms were separately lockable. When we asked for the key we were told that they had no key and would come the next day to have keys made. This meant we had to ensure no personal belongings were left in the main area. The next morning two young men came and a couple of hours trying to fix the lock. They managed to remove one of the locks and have a key cut - the other 2 living area doors remained without keys.

Staff come to do a 'turn-down' service between 6-8pm & spray the rooms for mosquitoes & light mosquito coils by the pool and in the bathrooms; both bathrooms are open to the outdoors. Despite being hyper-vigilant about closing doors I woke at 3am as I'd been bitten by mosquitoes just about everywhere including eyelids & ears. This didn't happen to me at the other 2 places we stayed.

The staff were very polite, however, given Kanishka Villas is advertised widely on English-language websites, their standard of English was mostly, at best, extremely basic. It was frustrating trying to get staff to understand any requests you made. Some staff were also lacking in personal hygiene & unkempt uniforms.

Breakfast each morning was fine but there were no order sheets, so you had to make up your own - something I've never experienced before.

Please note that both bathrooms are outdoors & located on the furthest side of each bedroom which can be a little inconvenient as you've got to unlock 3 doors to reach the toilet & also make sure your mosquito repellent is applied to your skin.

This was the most expensive place we stayed in Bali but the worst. We thought we had saved the best till last in staying at this Villa - we were so wrong. In all good conscience I couldn't possibly recommend this place.",Kanishka Villas
238,Spoiled!,50,September 2015,"After a very long day of traveling, I was looking forward to my stay at Kanishka Villas. I was blown away the moment I entered the 1 bedroom villa (with pool). The layout of the villa is sublime and the decor is very tasteful. My pool had sun until about 1p. There were a lot of mosquitos (even with bug spray and the villa's spray down each night) but it is a small price to pay to have an open air villa. The bedroom is completely enclosed with an open air bathroom attached. The staff were incredibly friendly. I would recommend putting the ""do not disturb"" sign out if you want to have quiet mornings; otherwise, your doorbell will ring two or three times (cleaning + removal of breakfast). (A pain when you're in the pool to answer the door.) Location is also great. Several great restaurants, spas, and shops near the villas. I wish I had spent more than three nights here because it was so peaceful, quiet, and close to some amazing shops. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Bali.",Kanishka Villas
239,A kind recovery...,50,September 2015,"We were really looking forward to our stay here after reading rave reviews and it being highly recommended by friends and family. But unfortunately we were double booked due to a fault in the online booking system. Hey, it happens. But how did they resolve the situation?.... By transferring us promptly to their sister hotel in Jimbaran Bay to a 4 bedroom, double story luxury villa at Gending Kedis Villas. We were on our anniversary, so the gesture and the kindness was simply out of this world. Extroadinary! Now we know which two hotels we'll always turn to in Bali. Outstanding. Thanks, truly.",Kanishka Villas
240,Great villa at great location!,40,September 2015,"The location of the villa is just a 15-min walk to Seminyak Square, few min walk to great spas like Prana and Chill, food like Made's Warung!
Shuttle bus service was available to popular places like Kuta Beach.
You can have breakfast in in the villa, but u can skip it as it's not fantastic. I stayed in a 1-bedroom pool villa, but I didn't get to swim in my 3 night stay as the pool was super cold. Lots of mosquitoes too, so be sure to pack in insect repellent!",Kanishka Villas
241,Great villas!! Worth every penny spend,40,September 2015,"Love the villas here. Stayed from 17-21sept. Booked jakuzi but got upgraded for one bedroom pool villas for 2 night. Love the large bathtub and my son enjoyed it too. Breakfast were delicious and served in villas every morning. Great hospitality, love the location as it near with a short walking distance to cafes and main street. The only cons was mosquitos. Make sure bedroom door were closed properly after dawn and turned down service. Mosquitos patched were helpful if u have kids",Kanishka Villas
242,Brilliant holiday at a great price through luxury escape,40,September 2015,"Taxi collected us from the airport to make great start to our break. staff very helpful and could not enough for us. Service always pleasant and courteous. Highly reccomended. Although the fittings and fixtures are looking a little tired now the layout and the modern styling were brilliant, with both the living and bedroom units looking straight out over the private pool. Loved the bathroom with its open feel, yet everything still very private. Shame the pool was a bit too cold for us to go in. Convenient location right next to shops and eating places. Enjoyed exploring all those little alleyways and corners in Seminyak. Great value for us.",Kanishka Villas
243,A trip to Seminyak,40,September 2015,"very good actually, the accomodations were fantastic as was the service.

One thing to note the ground floor rooms were devoid of any view what so ever, which is not exactly a bad thing, if skinny dipping in the in room pool is your kinda thing.

My only complaint was that the food was less than sepectacular,
it was not bad by any means and definately edible, but there are many other options which are better than eatting in the hotel",Kanishka Villas
244,Great value package booked through luxury escapes,50,September 2015,Had a great week in villa 10. Nice quiet location only a few minutes walk from plenty of shops and restaurants. Great pool and loved the outdoor shower in the bathroom. Lovely friendly staff who were always willing to assist. free shuttle to other parts of Seminyak.,Kanishka Villas
245,Perfect Holiday,50,August 2015,From the time we arrived the staff and service was excellent. We stayed 7 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful 1 bedroom pool suite which is ideally located close to shopping and a short walk to the beach. We will definitely be returniing.,Kanishka Villas
246,Beautiful Relaxing Holiday,50,September 2015,"Firs day home to the cold again. We had a wondeful week with Kanishka cannot speak highly enough of all staff who go out of their way to make your stay perfect. Room service meals were lovely, pool kept clean,always a butler on call if required transport shuttle available or will call Blue Bird taxi for you. Would we go back? Definitaly if sa e deal offered.",Kanishka Villas
247,BETTER THEN THE PHOTOS!!,40,September 2015,"My partner and I stayed here for 9 nights recently. We arrived at night but as soon as we walked in we were amazed by how much bigger the villa was compared to the photos! We woke up in the morning and was pleasantly surprised. Although the pool is quite shaded and a bit to cold to swim in even in the warm weather, the size and design of the villa made up for it. Breakfast included everyday was lovely and it is in the most PERFECT location. At night it is quiet, yet only a 1.00aud taxi to Seminyak and close to beach walk, Legian etc. if there was a downfall, I would say that some of the finishings in the villa do need a little love and care and the pool could be warmer, but we were so happy with our stay! Thank you so much!",Kanishka Villas
248,Wundeful Holiday,50,August 2015,"We (couple) were very excited! Exzellent Service ! Wonderful helpful attentive Team. Some Problems with breakfast Service in ordering, but: Communication is all!
Next Year we will come again . After an accident with the Scooter, the staff was very, very helpful! The Service to protect mosquito attak was really fine and a daily part of the bed Service.
I can really recommend this small, little villa.",Kanishka Villas
249,great way to relax,40,August 2015,"We had one bedroom villa with a pool. We loved the way the room opens out onto the pool. In the bathroom and dining area there openings with with plants and access to the outside environment.
The decor is very comfortable and the bed is quite large. I am 6'4"" and had no problems.
The management is most obliging and all the staff are friendly and helpful . Nothing is too much trouble.
The breakfast is delicious , served on time and hot.
I suppose if you look hard enough you can find fault but the odd dog barking and roosters is part of the charm.
Situated in a quiet lane off a not so busy street the setting is safe , as there is ample security and accessible to numerous restaurants and ample shopping.",Kanishka Villas
250,Kanishka review,30,August 2015,"I recently stayed at Kanishka Villa at Kunti Marg in August.Though the villa is beautiful, but the room service is very poor. The shampoos, body lotion were stinking.Complementary fruits which were kept were not fresh.So many mosquitoes in the room.",Kanishka Villas
251,Beautiful Villa!!,50,August 2015,"We spent 4 nights here for our first stay to Bali and loved it. I had booked a Jacuzzi suite, but was pleasantly surprised when we were presented with a pool villa!
We had our breakfast delivered to the room every morning as requested, the staff were lovely, and the villas were very quiet, especially seeing as they are situated fairly central. We ordered room service a few times for other meals, and the food was beautiful.
The only small downfall, is that as the villas are semi-open, we could quite clearly hear the children of the family next door early in the morning whilst they were playing in the pool etc, and we were a bit self conscience of making too much noise ourselves so that we didn't disturb other guests. Other than that though, we cannot complain.
Thanks for the great stay Kanishka Villas!",Kanishka Villas
252,Close to everything,40,August 2015,"We booked a private pool villa, which we got. It was a pity that it was to cold to swim!
Breakfast was served in the room each morning, and cleaned up by making a phone call, very upmarket, as long as you remember to place your order the night before. It is close to everything with out you knowing it, at first you actually feel in your in the middle of now where, by the time you do some exploring you realise you are actually close to everything !
Overall, if for newly married couple, would be ideal from privacy and spacious room point of view, the villa is actually broken down into three distinct areas, lounge dining kitchenette, pool outdoors area leading onto master bedroom, with big bath, outdoor shower, quite stunning actually.",Kanishka Villas
253,Disappointing End!,30,August 2015,"We stayed in a one bedroom villa for 6 nights. I had booked directly with the hotel so had to pay upfront upon check-in. We were advised after being escorted to our room that we had been over charged for the accommodation, and that this would be refunded on departure. Unfortunately when we checked out the power was down so the refund could not be made, and was advised it would be refunded the following day. Its now been a week since we have checked out and still no refund. We had called the hotel while we continued our holiday in Ubud 3 days after we had checked out and was told its still processing. I have also recently sent another follow up email yet still no response. Very disappointing end to a holiday. My advice if you have been overcharged by this property make sure you receive the refund before departure.",Kanishka Villas
254,"Great location, beautiful villa",40,August 2015,"We are a group of 6 who stayed at Kanishka Villas for 2 nights. Unlike the sister property Gending Kedis, Kanishka does not have 3-bedroom villas thus we were allocated a 2-bedroom villa with extra beds for the 5th and 6th persons. The 2-bedroom villa was spacious and definitely sufficient for 6 persons.

Kanishka has a good location, a quaint environment but still near to many shops i.e. massage, convenience stores, boutiques, beauty and cafes. Though not located within walking distance to the main part of Seminyak, the property has free one-way transfer in the day to any place in Seminyak and taxis are readily available. The villa is beautiful and cozy, and has a very comfortable living area. We also had no problems with the WiFi connection throughout our stay. However, there were several things which disappointed us, with the amount we paid for the stay.

1. The bathroom on level 1 has an open concept - it wasn't entirely enclosed so it was prone to strong winds. For both nights, winds were so strong at night that it was unbearably chilly during the shower.

2. The villa did not have some essential things such as the hairdryer, which we called and asked for, but the staff on duty told us there wasn't any extra hairdryer left in the whole property. After we insisted on them finding one for us, they did so, after an hour later.

3. The television reception was really terrible too which we asked for a technician to fix, but to no avail.

4. Breakfast orders were mixed up for both days despite several calls. One of the staff on duty even dropped by our villa to take our orders, but orders were still wrong!

I would still recommend the villa for a stay, but probably wouldn't return for a second stay.",Kanishka Villas
255,A hidden gem!,50,August 2015,"This place is difficult to find! Make sure you look out for signs when you try and find the hotel because it's tucked in a little street. When we first arrived, we were given a free upgrade to a villa because our room was not available. So, it was already shaping up to be a great stay. The villa was gorgeous and very well maintained. It felt so luxurious. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and my partner and I really appreciated the mosquito prevention measures they put in place every night. Also, we'd come home after a day of exploring to find they placed little tea cakes on the table. It's these little touches that made our stay here very comfortable. Breakfast would be delivered and set up in your villa at any time you wish. I only wish that the food was warm upon arrival!
It's very close to everything: eat street, bintang market, Seminyak beach and all of the wonderful restaurants and bars are a stone's throw away. I would definitely stay here again, thanks Kanishka for your wonderful service!",Kanishka Villas
256,Needs a facelift,30,August 2015,"Kanishka Villas is in a great location close to all the action, the position of the villas is hard to beat. Staff and management friendly and helpful but it's not enough to compensate for tired furnishings, a bit grotty and quite old fashioned the villas were disappointing..... Taps don't work, safes don't work,air conditioning was hit and miss and the TV reception was terrible. We moved villas because of noise but the new villa wasn't any nicer,and overall I was left feeling completely underwhelmed by our 5 night stay at Kanishka. Better value for money can be had in Seminyak. I wouldn't stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
257,Exqusitie villa and excellent cervice!,50,August 2015,"Beautiful, spacious villa with excellent service from the friendly staff!
Approximately 15 minutes walk from the gorgeous Seminyak beach and Seminyak square. Countless bars, restaurants, pubs and cafes everywhere, which are fantastic value for money! Make sure you take a trip to Potato Head Beach Club for drinks and food at sunset, only a 25 minute walk or 10 minutes in a taxi (which costs about £1.50!!!). Would highly recommend Kanishka villas!",Kanishka Villas
258,One bedroom villa with outdoor jacuzzi,40,August 2015,"We stayed 2 nights after a 3 week budget holiday throughout Indonesia.
So, having 2 nights here was luxurious!
The service was amazing and staff very friendly and accommodating.
Special touches were made with breakfast being served in the room, afternoon little cakes delivered and turn down service in the evenings.
The rooms are spacious and as mentioned in previous posts a little worn, but nothing to complain about considering the price p/n.
Overall, very good value for money. I would definitely return.",Kanishka Villas
259,Wonderful,50,August 2015,"We spent 10 nights in a 1 bedroom villa with private pool at Kanishka and it was more than expected. It is in a great location, set back a few minutes from the beach and the noise that comes with that, so if you're looking for access to Seminyak with the opportunity to retreat from it too, Kanishka is perfect. Worth noting - we rented a scooter for 10 days for £30 total and it made getting around very easy. Kanishka also provide a free shuttle bus you can request whenever.

The villa itself is incredibly spacious and well-built, with large bathroom that has beautiful tiling and large 4-poster bedroom with air con and wardrobe space. The living area is huge and is integrated with the pool area - I can't overestimate how great the private pool option is. They don't get all day sun, so if you plan on staying in your villa all day every day sunbathing then Kanishka isn't for you. We had villa 19 and had sun from early morning until about 1/2pm from memory, which was great for us.

Some reviews we read made us worried these villas were tatty and old - they're not. There may be the odd sign of wear (very few) but the villas are predominantly all outdoor spaces so this is not beyond expectation. In fact, everything was to a brilliant standard.

The inclusive breakfast is brought to your room and you order the night before. There are limited time slots but only 2 out of the 10 mornings was our request not accommodated and we were given another time option within 15 minutes of our request. All requests made to reception were dealt with within minutes - every time. Loads of options, good quality mostly; again, cooked for you and brought to you, can't really complain!

The room is serviced daily and in different ways - to clear breakfast, to clean and make up the room, to leave cakes, to prepare the bedroom for mosquitoes, pool cleaned. Overall the staff couldn't do enough to help.

We had 2 different spa treatments each, a detox bliss (their special) for £30 for the both of us (£15 each), a 90 minute treatment all full body massage followed by facial and a harmony package (2 hours: full body massage, facial, body scrub) £20 each. This is done in your room, so it's a truly relaxing and private experience. It is a very high standard, clean (some reviewers were appalled at the equipment and didn't take the massage - this is simply ridiculous) and ultimately relaxing and professional experience. Highly recommended.

Highly recommended!",Kanishka Villas
260,My 17 night in Kanishka Villa,40,August 2015,I really appreciate the quality of service. We could call the staff and they always brought us what we needed very quickly. The staff is very kind. We spent really good holidays thanks to the team of the Kanishka Villa.,Kanishka Villas
261,Fantastic place great people very helpful accomodaing,50,August 2015,Fantastic accommodation beautiful people couldn't do enough & got us to airport in 30 minutes so we didn't miss our flight think they were glad to get rid of us lol food delicious 24 hr butler shuttle bus to surf every morning secure rodent insect free great holiday,Kanishka Villas
262,Great Spot,50,July 2015,"I was worried that Seminyak was going to be another Kuta having only been to that part of the island. But I am pleased to say Semiyak was great a cross between Singapore and Bali. So much so my wife spent most of her time going around the shops. I was left alone in these great villas, with the coldest beer and a great big TV screen that showed all the football games. I got to lie on the comfiest bed I have ever slept on and had a ball. When I ran out of beer the staff were only a phone call away. The staff desrve a special mention as they even helped my wife on her return with her many shopping bags. This is a great palce to stay and I will be dreaming of it when its starts snowing back in Glasgow. Jimmy McGuire Glasgow Scotland",Kanishka Villas
263,July 2015,50,August 2015,"Had a wonderful holiday at Kanishka Villas, Seminyak . Komang picking us up at the airport. Amazing, clean and magical Villa. We had our own pool. We had breakfast served in our room each morning. We felt like royalty, from morning to night the staff were amazing. Security always there to look out for you if you needed advice on anything. Definitely a place to go back to!!! Loved it.",Kanishka Villas
264,Excellent Getaway,50,July 2015,"We wanted a real getaway and Kanishka Villas gave us exactly that (also, thumbs up to an awesome Groupon deal). Gorgeous, comfortable interior - the turn down service was nice, plus you get little snacks on the living room table each night. My favourite thing about the villa was the bathtub in the ""al fresco"" bathroom, perfect for soaking in after a long day exploring the island. Staff were very helpful and pleasant as well. The villas are however quite a distance to the beach (if you plan to walk under the hot, hot sun) but there are shuttle services available. Other than that, you've got an array of great food, shopping and spas neighbouring the villas so you're in good hands here.",Kanishka Villas
265,Good place for honey moon !,50,July 2015,"The villas is very awesome and suitable for honey moon. The room, bathroom and jacuzzi decoration design is unique. The hotel crews provide a very friendly and unforgettable service. They help me fix up the table lamp immediate after I called.",Kanishka Villas
266,Very pleased with our stay!,50,July 2015,"My husband and I stayed in a lovely pool villa for a few nights at the start of July and had a fantastic time!

I must say reading some of the other reviews made me a bit apprehensive but I could not fault a single thing! Villa was clean and neat, pool was awesome with sun hitting it in the morning, breakfasts were satisfying (never delivered to us cold or late as some have mentioned?) and above all staff were very friendly and helpful!

Situated in a great spot close to many restaurants and shops. A fair walk to the beach but loved site seeing along the way and we don't mind a good walk anyway! I found it fairly quiet and tucked away (had no noise problems) and very relaxing.

Would definitely recommend and would love to visit again!",Kanishka Villas
267,Was it perfect ? No. Was it amazing? YES,40,July 2015,"Nothing in this world is perfect, but when the time came to say goodbye their job had been done. I have never felt more chilled out and relaxed after a break . Our villa was a beautiful calm retreat from the full on bustling world outside the doors. It was quite noisy in the evenings when people came home after a day out as the noise did carry a fair bit but it was lovely to hear people having fun!! The staff were just amazing, always smiling and extremely respectful. The location of the villas was great in the fact that we had Bali Deli 1 minute walk away and this is a one stop shop for fantastic food, beer and currency exchange, there are many restaurants including the best pizza ever, and it was a lovely walk to the beach stopping in at Lucky Bar which is owned by Aussie Emma and her husband. We were stranded by the ash cloud for 6 days and the staff especially Sally couldn't have been more helpful turning what could have been a stressful time into an opportunity.",Kanishka Villas
268,Overall fantastic but many renovations needed done to make it perfect,50,June 2015,Water has affected the timber flooring in the bedrooms and the taps in bathrooms are just silly. The spout does not reach the sink and water goes everywhere. The downstairs bedroom stinks of mould. A makeover is needed.,Kanishka Villas
269,Don't do it!!,10,June 2015,"I was going to fill in the Guest Satisfaction Survey but just ticking the boxes was not going to let them know how we really felt about our stay. We booked our visit in August last year after buying the deal through Luxury Escapes. We have been so looking forward to staying in a place that advertised such luxury. Our first impression when we walked in on 23/06 was ""wow"" this is beautiful. We very quickly realised that on the surface it looks beautiful but the overall quality at Kanishka is very poor. We expected pure luxury and quality as you advertise. The overall feel of the villa was unclean. We tried to get room service on our first night at 8:30PM and were told they couldn't do it because they were fully booked. They advertise till 10:30PM!!

When we received our breakfast the next morning it was average. The fat the food had been cooked in tasted old. There were chips, cracks and stains on the crockery.

The bathroom is very old and shabby. The lighting terrible, I struggled to put my make-up on every day and when my partner was shaving he struggled to see what he was doing.

We just about had to stand up on the wardrobe to get the air-conditioning unit in the bedroom to go. We had to ring maintenance twice to come and get it going for us before we realised how close we had to get. I am quite short and had to get my partner to turn it off and on.

The sliding door in to the bathroom made so much noise opening and shutting it if one of us got up to go to the bathroom at night it woke the other up. Same with the sliding door out to the decking .. which creaked so bad you thought you would go through it!!

We ordered our welcome massage for our last morning (since we couldn't get any other time .. again we tried to book for 6pm after a day out and were told that they shut at 5pm) when the massage therapist showed up at our room, there was no smile, she barely said hello and the filth on the massage bed was disgusting, we lied and told her we weren't feeling well and didn't feel like the massage where really the thought of lying on the bed made us feel sick. When we tried to tell her she didn't even understand English, we had to ring reception to tell her we didn't want it. This I understand in the street but not at a so called luxury villa!

You advertise state of the art stereo .. I had to lie on my stomach on the filthy floor to access the DVD player! Needless to say we didn't use it.

Private pool and pool deck .. one of our reasons for choosing this accommodation was the private pool and deck so that we could sit in the sun and relax in privacy. That would have been lovely if it ever had any sun. We dipped in the pool only once as it was too cold.

Part of the package was also Chauffeur and airport transfer. None of the staff asked or communicated in regards to checking out and transport to the airport it was only when we used the pick-up driver for another service that he mentioned staff had booked him. He then charged up 200000 Rupiah.

This complaint is by no means directed at the staff. This comes down to management standards and staff training.",Kanishka Villas
270,"Beautiful, relaxing stay at Kanishka Villas",50,June 2015,"My partner and I spent five incredible nights at Kanishka Villas as part of a Luxury Escapes package. I could not recommend Kanishka more highly. We were picked up at the airport by a lovely staff member who checked us in and carried our luggage to our room. All of the staff members at Kanishka went above and beyond to assist us, and were happy to make any bookings that we needed for restaurants and massages. The room was cleaned every day and the bed turned down and mosquito coil lit every evening, which was a pleasure to return home to.

The villa at Kanishka was stunning, and so much bigger than we expected! The outdoor shower was luxurious, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The food was wonderful - we tried something different for breakfast every day and were never disappointed! As part of our package we got a complimentary massage and lunch in our villa, which was one of our favourite parts of our whole trip!

The wifi was slow, but we weren't there to check Facebook - we spent every morning reading and swimming and had the most relaxing stay, and I think switching off from the internet was a blessing in disguise! Kanishka is surrounded by great shops and restaurants, and just a short distance from the beach - we walked there in about 20 minutes. We cannot wait to return to Kanishka and would recommend to anyone!",Kanishka Villas
271,"Impeccable service, attention to detail...Wot a joke!!!",20,June 2015,"We booked a Luxury Escapes package and the details of inclusions, as per Kanishka Villa's website was NOT as promoted or advertised. The ""in room chef serving scallops & crispy duck"", that was just a choice of nasi goreng or fried rice from room service menu. The BBQ party....headingout for dinner with 2 other elderley couples to Kanishka's property in Jimbaran, no buffet selection as we were all expecting, just a set 3 course dinner..definitely not our idea of a PARTY!!After we complained, our rooms would be cleanedbut without beach or bath towels, no mosquito spraying daily, we had to buy mortein & mozzycoils, no beds turned down.. all which had happened prior to us trying to ask for what they advertised!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND...guests we met also spoke of what was advertised they were disappointed they did not get either. Breakfast also arrives cold each day and yr tea/coffee supplies are not topped up when they clean the room either.",Kanishka Villas
272,My Best,40,June 2015,"I've stayed 2 nites in here for romantic traveling around bali for our first time and this place was great! The villa with private pool inside, big bathroom with bathtub, great experience when we stay in this villa, so relax and peace.

We love the food too, overall the breakfast and romantic dinner is quite good, i suggest to choose american breakfast and the chicken steak have good sauce, the taste very yummy.

Maybe for future development, this villa can provide more electric socket near the bed for recharging phone batery. Hopefully can back to this villa again in the future. :)",Kanishka Villas
273,very comfortable n romantic home,50,June 2015,"I've stayed 3 nites here and have a romantic birthday celebration.
I loved their dining in villa. Their breakfast have many choices.
The view of the room was really relax n romance, suitable for the couple's stayed.
Overall, i love everything inside there.",Kanishka Villas
274,Great for a getaway,50,May 2015,"Stayed in May with a friend , these villas are great and the service was impeccable. The pool villas are the go after reading reviews I was a little concerned but researching accommodation I do not believe that the pool villas are worth every penny. Food was great and was sent to our villa as requested. My 2nd time at the villas and I will be back.
The breakfasts were also very good. Nothing was too much trouble.",Kanishka Villas
275,Different Room Standard,40,June 2015,"We were travelling with a group of 3 couples in mid June'15, after confirmed the hotel reservation we were sceptical about comments on Kanishka villa, which were highly polarised. After checked in to the jacuzzi room, frankly, we were quite disappointed on the room condition where the timber flooring is in bad condition, uneven, with some drilled holes (I believed it was due to termite infestation control. Upon request to change the room on the following day (as it was fully booked on the first day), to my surprise, the condition of the jacuzzi room allocated is entirely different from the one we stayed, I believed, the room had just been refurbished. Suggested the hotel management to relook into this, as we have no qualm on the location, hotel staff service (in fact they are quite efficient), it is just the different conditions between the older and newly refurbished room. Being a 5 star villa, this should not had happened, I am sure the hotel management would not want to let this unpleasant guest experience to tarnish the good name of the hotel.",Kanishka Villas
276,Average but could be better,30,June 2015,"Room - was fine. We booked 1BR with Jacuzzi. Lighting was A bit too dark to my liking and had problems with mosquitto but I am glad they provided us with the coil.

The property needs a bit more of maintenance. Looks old and run down.

Staff - were excellent. They helped and assisted when we need them.

Breakfast - was not the best for many reasons.

Location - great",Kanishka Villas
277,Honey Moon,50,June 2015,"This villa is so wonderful, it has a peacefull environments, romantic situation and complete facilities, especially for the services is the best serve and gorgeous servants.
The location is near from the stores & culinary foods that makes us easy to eats & shopping.
Thankyou for making our honeymoon becomes delightful. I would like to enjoying kanishka villas once again in our next trip to Bali.",Kanishka Villas
278,No reservations on check in,10,June 2015,"I had paid the entire amount two weeks in advance and on the day of check in the hotel staff told me that I don't have a reservation. Later I was not given a villa and transfered to a villa one hour away - Gending Kedis. The villa was just not appropriate for my type. Scary and old.

I will never recommended Kanishka villas for such gross error. My honeymoon mood turned out to be a spoiled sport.

No compensation for their mistake.",Kanishka Villas
279,Average stay that can be better,30,May 2015,"Check in was quick and friendly staff. Villa was gorgeous, just like the pictures! However if you are not a fan of insects, probably not a fantastic choice. Encountered centipede at the open air shower during the first night. Ants and some creepy crawlers crawling around sun lounge area. Our pool requires daily cleaning as there were 2 frangipani trees near the pool where flowers & leaves keep falling into the pool despite cleaning moments ago. Only used the pool once as I am extremely paranoid about dirty pool waters.

Friendly staff brought us to our villa and to realize that the key couldn't open the main door. He then brought the set of master keys to open ours and told us that they will bring our keys later. Uncertain about the security and safety about our stuffs locked in the villa.

Booked the 1 bedroom villa with private swimming pool and realized that there's a second bedroom upstairs. Staff told us that ours was a 1 bedroom villa, hence no access to the second floor (fair enough), but they sold the upper floor which made us really uncomfortable as we don't know if upper floor can look down into our villa or not.

Aircon didn't work in our bedroom, require engineering to fix it. The villa requires quite a bit of maintenance and faucets need polishing as it looks really worn-out.

Strictly no topping up of our breakfast (porridge was nice, but kids' portion served) we tried trading bread and fruits for a bigger portion of porridge but unfortunately we can't.

Villa can arrange return transfers at USD 50. We chose to take their cabs and were warned by my friends about paying a lot more as we are tourists. Ended up we paid IDR 200,000 from airport to villa (approx 15 mins drive) as drivers around there said there were no taxis that run by meter from airport. Staffs were friendly and helped to book only Blue Bird taxis which runs by meter, it costs us only IDR 45,000 from villa to airport. *by the way, all taxis there are blue (different shades) and with a common blue bird logo, kinda difficult to differentiate for first timers.

Overall, it's an average stay, for the amount paid (even with Groupon deal), I would probably choose another villa.",Kanishka Villas
280,Very Disappointed,20,May 2015,"Let me start by saying that we have stayed in many Villas in Bali.
The staff and location of this Villa is second to none. On arrival reception for our check in was over crowded by other guests checking in. There is only a 2 two seater couch and a tree stump. Due to the lack of space we had to wait in the heat after our 7 hour flight.

After 25 minutes or so of us waiting in the heat ( lucky it wasn't raining) we were shown our Villa by a staff member.

No massage on arrival as part of our package was offered. The Villa at first glance looks ok. It's not till you have a good look around that you find that it is overpriced and in need of some maintenance . Clean I would say not. The sheets and pillows were stained. Towels grey instead of white and threadbare. Floors in serious need of a mop.

The Internet was intermittent at best for the first 2 days, with having to log in every few minutes . The mosquitoes were horrendous , with large amounts of water around the Villas , which only seems to attract them. No amount of spraying or coils will assist in their control. The front door to Villa has a number of cement slabs with stagnet water in between , great for breeding mosquitoes.
The locks on the doors will require a lot of patience to gain entry and lock after you leave. Having 2 bent keys did not assist in this case.

The breakfast you had to order the night before, system seems to work well once you get used to it. Although, the further away you are from the front office the colder your meal becomes when it does arrive.

The pool did not get any sun, so the water was quite cold. If you are of small statue don't even think about getting into the pool as the first step getting out is waist height. Being 6 foot tall , I found it still a challenge to get out. My wife who is shorter then me saw me struggling and didn't attempt the Kuma Satura position to get out.

As part of our package we were supposed to get a 3 course meal. As requested by the staff we gave 2 nights notice and a specific time. After waiting 25 minutes after the expected time that meal was supposed to arrive, we decided to eat out. On leaving the Villa we were greeted by a cane basket sitting on the ground but no staff member, it was later revealed that they were in the Villa opposite spraying and doing a turn down service. Not bringing our hot meal as arranged. Hence the meal was cold.

There is supposed to be a turn down service with the spraying of mosquitoes on a daily basis. On the 6 nights that we were there we got the turn down service a total of 2 times and the spraying of mosquitoes only on 1 occasion. That was the last night we were there.

The fruit platter on arrival was growing fur and mould. Staff overlooked this bowl, never replacing fruit daily as per the deal. 4 days later we decided to throw it out cleaning staff did nothing about it.

The water container that was supposed to be a water cooler was not working. There was water in it but not cooling at all. Who knows how long it has not been working for ??

If you are a non smoker be wary of this establishment as the smoke from upstairs would often drift down to our Villa due to open ceilings and missing walls. Nice touch when you are trying to eat a meal at the table. This was mentioned to the staff on numerous occasions. We were told that there was nobody up stairs . On further investigation it was discovered that several staff members used the upstairs Villa as their very own smoking area throughout the day away from prying eyes.

All of the above issues were raised with the staff on many occasions. Seems the further away from the office the less service you got.

As stated earlier we have stayed in many Villas, and know that there are better Villas for similar prices in Seminyak. We were disappointed with our stay. But still managed to have a great vacation.

Would I stay here again.......that would be a firm No. Would I recommend Kanishka Villas to family and friends........ Another firm No.

Overpriced and over rated. We have many photos to back up this review.

We will return to Bali next year , but not to Kanishka Villas.",Kanishka Villas
281,Private pool!,40,May 2015,The staff are wonderful and the villas are beautiful. The highlight was definitely the private pool and the low light was that the wifi kept dropping out. Awesome location with amazing restaurants and shopping nearby.,Kanishka Villas
282,perfect getaway experience!,50,May 2015,"The place is awesome! We had the chance to stay here by getting the discount promo on some discount website. Love the villa, love the private pool, love the position of the villa, love the treatment from the staffs of the villa. We had no issue with bugs or any other lizards that some people write here. Thanks Kanishka for the amazing experiences!!",Kanishka Villas
283,Perfect Position,40,May 2015,"This is our second stay at Kanishka and still love the staff,position and rooms here. They are in the perfect position to explore Seminyak and beyond. The only problem we had was in the upstairs bedroom we found it hard to sleep because of the noise from the villas across the road. Apart from that the villas are perfectly set out for privacy and comfort and they are only 200 mts from my favourite cafe called The Shelter.
Hope to be here again next year....thank you Kanishka.",Kanishka Villas

285,Beautiful kanishka villa seminyak,50,May 2015,"Hi, I stayed in kanishka villa seminyak on 8 to 10 may 2015 and i find that the villa is really beautiful, clean and there is no gecko or lizard , unlike other villas that my friend has stayed in seminyak. It was such a pleasant and wonderful experience. As this is my first time staying in villa, im really thankful for the great hospitality of the villa butler, to provide complimentary bread/pastries every evening and the staffs who brings in the mosquito coils into our villa every evening. The breakfast spread is also sumptious and im so thankful that i made the right choice to stay in this villa. Mine was one bedroom villa and its really huge, comfortable and clean. Thank you Kanishka Villa for making my mother and me an awesome stay over mother's day weekend.",Kanishka Villas
286,Kanishka Villas Awesome,50,May 2015,"My husband and I have just returned from 11 days staying at Kanishka Villas, Seminyak Bali. What beautiful villas they are...well maintained and so close to all the eating cafes, restaurants and shopping.

Our Jacuzzi Villa was beautiful, clean and decorated to high perfection. Only small complaint was that the door lock kept sticking, so we did report it a couple of times - just hope they act on it as some visitors may not be as patient. Didn't worry us as they attended to the problem immediately.

The staff were amazing, friendly and so helpful. They attended our room daily for cleaning, topping up with fruit and cakes, provided a downturn at night and lit mozzie coils. Fogging was also undertaken on extremely humid days.

You can walk easily to all the shops and eating places. We even walked to Seminyak Beach.

I would highly recommend the Villas to anyone who wishes to be in a central location that is more for the mature visitors who don't want the craziness of Kuta.

Thank you Kanishka for a wonderful stay. Hope to be back again in 2016.",Kanishka Villas
287,Very surprised!,50,May 2015,"I had read some of the reviews and was a bit worried having already booked the villa. We wanted something very central to Seminyak and found it! When we arrived they gave us a complimentary upgrade to the two bedroom villa (Villa 2). It is close to reception and security. You walk into the dining and living area, which is catered and maintained by the 24hr butler. The private sunbathing and pool area is located between the living area and the bedroom, both of which are exposed. This causes a few issues with mosquitoes, but the hotel smoke bombs serval times a week and they burn coils at night.
The bedroom was very comfortable, the shower and toilet are separate and are again outside closed walls.The local bars can often be heard at night because of this.
You have to place your breakfast order everyday by calling reception, if you happen to forget, you get no breakfast. It is served to you at the dining table in your room. It all felt very nice.
We had great service while we stayed and would certainly return.",Kanishka Villas
288,Gem of a place,50,May 2015,"We stayed for 2 nights at villa , it was one of the best experiences we have ever had.. Everything was perfect .. The villa pool was clean and well kept , service for everything from towels to cleanliness was just incredible .. Breakfast was hearty and suggest to try their Indonesian rice and noodles .. They are as good as they can get .. The whole setup made us feel like we should live on .. The place is very close to everything in seminyak .. The hotel staff was service at its best .. Definately recommend this place to everyone and would live here again if revisiting ..",Kanishka Villas
289,Nice Stay,40,April 2015,"bought a deal from groupon singapore. given the price, the stay was considered very nice. But both my wife and I are not the nature loving kind, hence, the amount of plants in the villa is not really what we would be comfortable with.
And the number of lizards as well as mosquito definitely add on to the discomfort
however, service was good and staff was polite and understood us. The shuttle service was good and brought us to wherever we want to go.
it would be a nice place for people who enjoy nature as it was relaxing",Kanishka Villas
290,Exceptional!,50,April 2015,"This is my first time staying at private villa (since I had voucher from groupon). Me and my bf stayed there for 2 nights (including Nyepi). I stayed at room with private pool vila. The room is huge. It is divided into 3 parts, living room and kitchen; pool; and bed and bath room. Living room and kitchen is spacious, even 2-3 people can sleep on the couch. Kitchen and all the cooking equipment is complete, and it made me happy since i plan to cook during Nyepi.

Everything is provided so it wont harm you if you really want to stay private and lie low in the villa!

The pool was nice although water is a bit cold. Pool is at open space, it links living room and bed room, so it will rait you a little if its rain and you have to move from living room to bed room.

Everything is nice. Bed, bathub, big bathroom, and kitchen. It is walkable to many location in Seminyak. And more importantly, the food is really great! Must try the appetizer of jeruk bali and salmon. Great!

Thing is, it looks exactly like the photographs in the advertisement. So you won't be upset with this villa! Definitely will come back!",Kanishka Villas
291,Kanishka is Beautiful,40,April 2015,"My husband and I are staying at Kanishka as I write this. We have a two bedroom villa with a pool, just beautiful. The staff couldn't be any more helpful, nothing is too much trouble. They are friendly and willing to go that extra mile. Thank you all.
The villa is almost perfect, there is nothing missing, from kitchen to bedroom and bathroom, everything is here. It would be easy to nit-pick, but really, it would be silly. Our only little moan is the Mosquitos, but the staff are quick to come with mossie coils when we need them. The bathrooms are outside, and surprisingly, the bugs aren't bad and it really is special. Love Kanishka, will be back next year with the family! Only 5 days left, really not long enough!",Kanishka Villas
292,Carole,40,April 2015,"Our family had two villas here for 9 days.
Great location , walking distance to everything, staff were lovely and looked after us very well . Breakfast in villas every morning was great and plenty of choice.
Probably ready for a bit of an update, but very clean and rooms serviced daily .
Would be very happy to stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
293,Heart of Seminyak,40,March 2015,"My wife purchased 7 nights at these villas for my birthday. I started to read some of the previous reviews and was a little bit apprehensive. We arrived on March 17 and well what a pleasant surprise. The 1 bedroom villa was great (we have stayed in numerous villas in Bali). It is up there with the majority of them in that price range. We were in Villa 16, very secluded, pool in the sun most of the day. If you want to just relax it was ideal. Also, if you wanted to go shopping 3-5 minute walk (everybody walks slower in Bali) plenty of shops. Close to nightlife, bars and restaurants. Staff were very helpful and considerate, breakfast served in Villa every morning. Nothing was a problem for them.
Beach approx.15 minute walk or about $3.00 in taxi.
Highly recommended.

Allan & Rosalie",Kanishka Villas
294,Great Villas,40,March 2015,"Have stayed here 3 times. Good location just down from Bali Deli and an easy walk to beach and shops. 2 bedroom Villa is lovely probably not suited though to those with young kids as pool is right by lounge and bedroom 1 and staircase to 2nd room on the steeper side. That said we've stayed here when our children were 4 and 7 and as long as we set limits with stairs and pool it was fine and they loved it, it's just something to be aware of.
Staff are very friendly and we love if here, and will return again.",Kanishka Villas
295,Romance and Serenity,50,March 2015,"I stayed in the 1 br private pool villa. It was wonderful, got all the privacy i needed with my husband. We traveled as a group of family but stayed in 2 different places. I'm glad i chose Kanishka Villas. The service they gave was excellent. The AC wasn't working properly in the bedroom but once i complained about it, they repaired it right away. Breakfast was served in the villas everyday, mmhhh what a life...jumped into the private pool every morning and evening. We had a complimentary romantic dinner served in the villa. Bottom line it was all about my husband and myself. A complete romance and serenity. They better prepare another villa for us next year, definitely will come back. Thank you Kanishka team for a very personal service...",Kanishka Villas
296,Prime quality villas at Seminyak.,50,March 2015,"As in past visits to Bali, we stayed at Kanishka Villas in Seminyak for the last couple of days of our trip.

The two level, two bedroom villa we were allocated (one on each level), was great for our needs. Both bedrooms had en-suite bathrooms.

Downstairs was the beautifully appointed living room and kitchen. Plus and indoor swimming pool.

I noticed the management had installed a large glass partition between the living area and pool...a good addition !

Service as in the past was excellent, as is the location, being close to some nice and reasonably priced restaurants and good shopping.

Overall, a wonderful place to stay in Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
297,Privacy,40,March 2015,This is my first time that I haven't stayed in a big resort in Nusa Dua. I chose a private villa in Seminyak for privacy and romance. This place is great. Own private pool and when you need something staff are very quick to assist. The villa is large and has a full kitchen. The living area is all open and the bedrooms are air conditioned. The only negative would be the free shuttle. You have to book it early. We got ready for dinner headed to the office and was told the shuttle had left and wouldn't return for sometime.,Kanishka Villas
298,Beautiful Two Bdrm Villa with excellent location,50,March 2015,"Stayed in a two bedroom villa with an upstairs bedroom. Lovely setting with lower bedroom opening to a pool. Service was first class - check in fast and efficient with friendly and very
courteous staff. Everyone smiles at this place - even the gardeners and maintenance people.
Location is perfect, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Terrific Mexican restaurant just
a few doors down from the villas. Hope to get back next year for another visit!!",Kanishka Villas
299,GREAT,50,February 2015,"Very recommended,
Service excellent,
good ambience, good food,
near boutique, restaurant, motorbike rent,
15 minutes to kuta or legian
but the wifi connection is not good

well i will be back later...see me next",Kanishka Villas
300,Best service & very clean,50,March 2015,"It's our fourth night tonight at Kanishka villas & we are absolutely loving it. We are in villa 16, which is nice and quite and away from the main road. The service is very efficient and everyone is extremely nice. I highly recommend this place especially for couples. We are on our honeymoon and the privacy we get here is perfect.",Kanishka Villas
301,"Beautiful villa, beautiful people, beautiful experience",50,February 2015,"Arrived and was created by friendly staff and wonderful welcome drink. The villa was beautiful, very clean and well maintained throughout our stay. Staff were great with cleaning and putting out coils for mosquitos every night. The breakfast was quite standard but yummy and they were flexible which was great. We had to leave very early one day so they packed us a breakfast to take away with us which was lovely.
The shuttle bus to seminyak town was great as it is a bit out of the way. So either use free shuttle bus or get your own scooter.
Didn't go to the spa as it was very expensive.
Surprised my boyfriend with a birthday cake on his birthday with the workers singing him happy birthday which absolutely made his day.
Thankyou to all the staff you were all so friendly and welcoming.
Would definitely recommend and be back :)",Kanishka Villas
302,Wonderful week!,50,January 2015,"We had booked a week at Kanishka through the Holiday Club, and after reading a mix of reviews on trip advisor, I was a little nervous about staying there.
However, on arrival, we were blown away by how great these villa's are!
On check in, we were offered a refreshing welcome drink and were shown to our villa's, accompanied by butlers who took our luggage and showed us around the villa.
The villa is large and spacious with tasteful decor and everything you could ever want in a self contained space! The size of the villa was about the same as a townhouse, so more than enough room for 3 of us! The 2 bedrooms (one up stairs, the other across from the pool) gave plenty of privacy, and would be perfect for 2 couples travelling together.
We loved the outdoor bathroom, as it gave the villa a real tropical feel!
The pool was much larger than we had imagined, and was plenty big enough for the 3 of us to refresh after hot Bali days!
The location of the villa was fantastic, with great bars, restaurants and shopping within walking distance or a cheap ($2 Aussie dollar) cab ride to some great beach clubs - Potato Head, Ku De Ta etc..
The villa was clean and fresh and we loved the turn down service every night, including lighting mosquito coils and spraying bug spray.
We had no problems with insects, rodents or mosquito's as reported by others!
I feel so lucky to have stayed in such a beautiful villa and can't wait to go back again!",Kanishka Villas
303,serious relaxation,50,January 2015,"This place is very hard to leave. Beautiful villas, great location, fantastic staff who really care and great value for both accommodating, food and drink. We felt spoiled. What more can you ask then a wonderful night sleep, big breakfast, dip in the private pool and just chilling out in private! We will never stay in a big hotel again.",Kanishka Villas
304,"Tranquil, relaxing, beautiful stay!",50,December 2014,"My partner and I stayed in Kanishka Villas from the 27th of Dec to the 3rd of Jan. Upon arrival, we were greeted with friendly and welcoming staff that showed us our room and answered any questions that we had.
We were given complimentary breakfast each day, which was served on time, warm and fresh. The living room has two air conditioning units and the bedroom has one, which work to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. The pool and sundeck do receive some sunshine during the morning hours, (we stayed in villa 15b) though due to the tropical trees and plants surrounding the pool, there is not constant, unbroken sunlight, which was fine with me as it was rather hot in the sun.
The staff will return an hour or so after serving breakfast to collect the dishes, and will then change the bedsheets and clean the villa each day. During the evening, they come in to light coils and spray the room to help rid the mosquitoes. I found the coils to work wonders, as I wasn't bitten while they were burning.
The bedroom's air conditioning stopped working about 2 times during our stay, but after a quick call to the front desk, they would promptly come in fix it within a few minutes. I don't quite understand the negative comments on here, as I found our stay to be welcoming, relaxing, and better serviced that in a lot of the accommodations that I've stayed in in Australia.
Kanishka Villas offers a shuttle service within Seminyak, and will book restaurants and provide directions to any destination that you ask for assistance with. They were incredibly friendly, facilitating and the villas are beautiful.
It is surprisingly quiet considering the hustle and bustle of the main streets is just a short walk from the villa, allowing for a relaxing stay. We would definitely return!",Kanishka Villas
305,Summer getaway,50,December 2014,"I highly recommend Kanishka villas as through my own experience, the place is comfortable, relaxing, easy (as breakfast can be ordered and served at your doorstep every morning) and above all, the staff members are kind. I found it a great little place to spend my trip in bali with family and friends.",Kanishka Villas
306,1 star for the room and 4 for Zen,50,January 2015,"We spent one night at the Kanishka Villas on 17th January, 2015. We were very wary of the vermin situation leading up to our stay. We didn't mind the villa itself, it was cute and the spa bath was awesome.. Location is another plus being down Jl Kunti, close to Bali Deli and Prana spa. Lilzbah restaurant is directly across the road and there's a place to hire bikes out the front too.

Now we went out for tea on night one. We came back and saw some mice (not rat) droppings on our bed, we also heard scratching so safe to say we didn't sleep well that night.

Next day, we went to share our frustration as we emailed the villas before our arrival stating that the first sign of vermin, we'd be out the door.

We spoke to Zen (manager). He was extremely empathetic, apologetic and extremely helpful. He suggested that we move to their sister villas - Gending Kedis in Jimbaran.

Please read our review our Gending Kedis.

But I want to say, if the vermin problem gets 100% sorted, if housekeeping were on the ball (2pm and still no one changed our room, we were out by 10am) and some of the linen etc got refreshed.. This would be a good place to stay. Please also note they are trying extremely hard to fix the vermin issue, being an open air villa. It is quite hard.

I also want to say a huge thankyou to Kanishka Villas for the way they handled our complaint, they really saved the holiday for us. I would return the favour by giving this place another go once all issues have been addressed.",Kanishka Villas
307,Comfortable and privacy,40,January 2015,I enjoy the breakfast daily provided. That is the best ever dining experience that i had for the breaskfasy. Kanishka also given high privacy for us. My wife and I having a great time together in the villa. Also satisfied with the promt service provided. Will definitely come back again next time.,Kanishka Villas
308,Fantastic 4 STAR villa's,40,January 2015,"Our stay at Kanishka Villa's from 06-11 of January 2015 was everything we expected and service from the staff was exceptional. The reception girls were welcoming and helpful to every enquiry we might have. Morning BUTLER breakfast was prompt but only just warm, as the staff had to walk the long driveway ( 200 Mtr ) to our's, the last villa.
The mossie problem that is common in Bali was addressed with the Bulter spraying the enclosed bedroom @ 6pm and lighting mossie coils in the open-air bathroom and the open pool - lounge area's.
If you want to start a perfect morning ..ie..with paper delivered ..fresh fruit juice and coffee and breakfast served any style, then this is an ideal way to start your holiday morning.
Scooter hire was at the driveway street front and cigars and beer only 50 Mtrs away at CircleK.
Bali Dali is 100 Mtrs walk away for all your western grocery supplies AND FULL bottle shop.
OverAll we will be rebooking to stay at Kanishka Villa's on our next stay in Bali ...... Caroline & Neil .",Kanishka Villas
309,Lovely villa,40,January 2015,This accommodation was lovely to stay at. The staff were very lovely and promptly dealt with any requests we had- from bookings to internet use. We loved the layout of the villa we stayed in. The pool was slightly on the cool side but once you're in the water it didn't take long to warm up. The only small negative was the breakfasts could have been a bit warmer. Kanishka is located close to lots of restaurants and shopping. Once inside the villa we couldn't hear the hustle & bustle of Seminyak.,Kanishka Villas
310,Weekend 2nd to 5th of Jan 2015,30,January 2015,"We arrived expecting good things for our short stay at Kanishka villas, the reception ladies and staff were always pleasant and helpful.
The villa was dated, it looked lovely in the photos but the couches were stained. None of the doors locked apart from the entrance, the 2 of the sliding doors were stuck open about 2 cm.
The air con in the upper bedroom didn't work which left the room warm and stuffy, all of the other rooms were fine. The worst was the Mosquitos which ate us alive. The staff tried their best with anti mossy coils and sprayed the rooms every day but to no avail, there was just too many ways in to the rooms due to the ill fitting doors and the open windows. The breakfast was delivered on time every day and was fine, just needed a bit of a heating in the micro.
The location is good but they need to spend a little time and money upgrading the furniture and the doors etc. there was free wifi and the television channels were decent
I didn't see any other pests apart from the Mosquitos.",Kanishka Villas
311,Don't waste your money,10,December 2014,"I'm not going to waste my time again writing a long review so here is what I wrote to management whilst staying at Kanishka Villa..........

To whom it may concern,

I write in regards to our stay at Kanishka Villa in Seminyak for the period from the 23/12/14 to the 30/12/14.

Whist we have very much enjoyed our stay in Seminyak, we are continuously disappointed by the quality of our accommodation.

We are not ‘fussy’ people but we certainly believe you should get what you pay for. Being in the industry ourselves, we are more than aware that there are certain things that one can not help. However, we found there was ample room for improvement. I am writing this now, on our second last night because I am simply fed up.

Firstly, shortly after booking the villa, we were sent an email from one of your colleges requesting that we stay in your sister premises, Gending Kedids. Unfortunately, I cannot check the exact dates as the WIFI is not working, for the sixth night in a row! Assuming there had been some sort of mistake, we happily obliged and were looking forward to staying there.

Shortly after our arrival at Kanishka, we queried this and were told that we “did not respond to their confirmation email, however, we did. Not only that but we had confirmation from the manager, Made at GK. The manager at K was extremely apologetic and helpful and offered us a few nights at GK then our final night at K, which we declined as it was too much trouble to have to come back just for one night.

On our first night, we were warmly welcomed by the receptionist, who showed us to our room and made us feel genuinely welcome.

The next morning, we woke and decided to try the complimentary breakfast. Unfortunately, we were both disappointed and decided to go out instead. I am a chef back home and just put this down to my food preferences.

Later in the evening, we decided to give room service another go and both ordered a steak each and a few beers. This reiterated my decision not to eat breakfast. I had taken one mouthful and spat it out. The steak tasted and looked old. It was also a far cry from the medium rare steak we had ordered (served well done) Overall a very disappointing meal. The beer supplied was also warm. I rang reception to advise that we had finished our meal and asked if we could have some cold beer, though it wasn’t available. We returned the beer to reception.

The next morning, the lovely manager spoke to us and again, was genuinely concerned by our experience and advised us that he would not charge us for the meal.

It was so bad that we decided to buy some produce to cook our own meals, only to find that the gas had been disconnected. It took over 24 hours for the “engineer” to come and connect it (although we were told that there was no gas and they would get some tomorrow) The engineer left after connecting the gas and checking for leaks with the kitchen sponge and some soap. This was quite concerning as the stove turned out to be downright DANGEROUS to use. It would pop and blow up in your face, on one occasion the explosion was so powerful it pushed the drawers below the cook top open!!!! Once I tried to turn it off there was gas coming out of all of the burners AND the gas knobs! I have a video of this. The final straw for me was when I rang reception (29/12) and told them that I had an emergency and the stove was on fire. She advised that some one was coming. 5 minutes later with the stove still on fire, no one had arrived. I was forced to tip water over that appliance to put the fire out. I then rang to speak to the manager, who was unavailable until 10am.

I was so angry by the 4th night that we had paid for such disappointing accommodation that I wrote a list of the things that were unacceptable for the aprox $350 per night price tag.

· Some locks on sliding doors faulty. Unable to secure premises

· Room was cleaned on the second night, although it appeared they had only cleaned the pool/ deck, tidied the already made bed and put the cushions neatly on the couch. NO TOILET PAPER (we had to ask 3 times. Took just over 24 hours before we were given any) The mini bar was never restocked (One would assume this was a major revenue raiser for the villa) Dishes/ glasses were never replaced, no clean sheets/ dressing gown etc even the rubbish bin was not taken out. We even had to ask for clean towels!

· RATS! This was a problem from day 1, as we noticed faeces on top of the bed and the chair next to the bed (which was still there after the room was “cleaned”. We even watched as the rodent urinated on the floor in front of us. Other screeching/ activity would also occur in the early hours of the morning. This was also a problem before as we noticed similar reviews on trip advisor. The people in question actually left the hotel in disgust.

· Unsafe wiring, PVC pipes with live wires sticking out of the ground covered in duct tape, less than 1 metre from the pool and shower. Luckily we left the kids at home! The supplied power adaptor was faulty and would spark as you put it into the wall

· Premises only spot clean, dirty corners, mouldy bathroom, dirty toilet. Appears to by bird faeces on the wall in the main living area, near the mirror.

· Toilet faulty and would not flush on occasion. We had to take the lid off to get it to work.

· Roof has holes in and would leak during heavy rain (28/12)

· Room has only been cleaned once since our arrival (on two occasions we had the do not disturb sign up) but had given plenty of time on other days. We have been up every morning by 8am and had vacated the room by 10am

· Intermittent TV (fuzzy) Internet has not worked properly since day one (was ok 28/12) still not working now. I have had to send this off my mobile at a costly rate.

· Uneven decking outside, tripping hazard especially at night.



If you’re wondering why we never complained earlier, firstly, we hate complaining. It takes a extremely bad experience for us to write a complaint like this. Secondly, we are relatively easy going people, having worked in the industry for over 10 years. We are not so much bothered by the little things, we didn’t even see it necessary to complain about a rat in our room, however, we are now fed up. Lastly, the customer should not have a chance to complain about something for which they are paying good money.

As a chef and restaurant owner, who charges top dollar for food and service, we come to expect the same when we enjoy others hospitality.

Although our stay was quite unpleasant, we found the property absolutely beautiful and most of the staff, especially the manager were extremely helpful and genuinely nice people.

So.......... originally we were offered a massage, A dinner for two (seriously?) or a trip to the airport. We politely declined their offers.

Upon our return to Perth we received a email from the manager (after a third letter of complaint) offering us a Three nights stay at the villa when we return next.........

This might be nice for some but considering we could have been seriously injured, blown up, electrocuted etc and had a rat defecate on us while we slept, we figured they could have done a little better.

This is just a snippet of our many dealings with Kanishka during our stay. If you have time, its worth checking out their reviews over the last 12 months. Thanks Kanishka!",Kanishka Villas
312,A Great Stay,40,December 2014,We had a really great stay at the kanishka villas a really peaceful villa.....the staff were really good the location of the villa is good as well....really enjoyed the stay...Superb experience a worth place to go value for money,Kanishka Villas
313,Just Ok,30,November 2014,"Staffs were friendly with excellent service.
Location is perfect, walking distance to warung italia, bali deli, cafe moka, warung made etc.

AC not working nicely, still hot during daytime.... Bed was very very hard, breakfast was average.",Kanishka Villas
314,Wouldnt come back. Not very clean.,30,January 2015,"The villa was nice, we stayed in the jacuzzi suite, very private and quiet. Although, the bathroom has absolutely no ventilation and stunk upon check in which made us feel like the people before us literally just used it. Kinda grose. The smell never went away as its really hot in there all the time. The door to the bathroom into the bedroom is more of a glass sliding door so the smell wafts into the bedroom, it just smelt like a public toilet 24/7 which is very unusual.

The best part about this place is there is a free driver to take you to places within the vicinity which came in handy, we never had to wait for a taxi on the way out somewhere.

The service was a little inconsistent. Day 1 we were brought our breakfast to the villa, with the local paper, coffee and the rest of it, was great. The day after, no paper, half of the brekkie missing and glad wrap still on the plates which i had to remove myself.

We had a tea inside the villa on day one with the provided tea/coffee, and having stayed here 3 nights, the dirty cup was never replaced or even taken away. We left it there to see how long it would take for them to realise ( it was left on top of the mini bar with all other cutlery and cups provided)... stayed there until checkout.",Kanishka Villas
315,Disappointed,20,December 2014,"Having read mostly positive reviews and looking at the pictures on the website, we were looking forward to our short star at Kanishka Villas. However were totally disappointed upon arrival .
Furniture beginning to show age, villa was also not cleaned well daily. Towels and napkins very old and not replaced in time.
Breakfast, as mentioned in other reviews, was cold .
AC not working. Was hot and stuffy.
Luckily we didn't see any rats as mentioned in some recent reviews.
The only positive was the staff and the excellent location.
Would not recommend.",Kanishka Villas
316,Room for improvement,30,December 2014,"My partner and I spent 5 nights at Kanishka having purchased a package deal. We were thoroughly impressed with the villa design and yes the pool area does not get much sun but it was invigorating and a great size pool you could exercise in. Sadly we had nightly visits from the rats. We reported it to the staff and they left some sticky paper which the rats just pushed around the room. They were very adept at removing a heavy glass lid of the platter that the nightly cakes were served on, gobbling the contents. We were somewhat concerned with the cleanliness levels as well and not happy that rats ran over everything. We were disappointed in the breakfast. A lovely touch to deliver it to the villa but it was cold with stodgy unappetising pastries and weak coffee. The staff were totally lovely and helpful and the location was great. We also believe money was taken from our safe. It was very early in our trip and we knew how much cash we had brought and had only changed one set amount. After reading about theft from safes from other reviewers, we checked our cash and believe it was $50 short. We know we put belongings in the safe at our risk but we took it all with us from then on.",Kanishka Villas
317,Brilliant!,50,December 2014,"Our Kanishka villa was absolutely gorgeous - so spacious and luxurious! From our arrival we were treated like royalty and all of the staff were lovely and friendly. Loved the outside/inside concept and the anti-mosquito incense and bed curtain were a nice touch for peace of mind. Having breakfast brought to the villa in the morning was great and the food was delicious.
Location-wise the Kanishka villas are really close to fantastic shops, restaurants and within walking distance of the beach. That said, once we were back in our own zone it was peaceful and relaxing and despite the fact that the villas are close together, we felt in total privacy and weren't really aware of other guests.
Our trip was during the rainy season so it wasn't constant sunshine. It was therefore really important that the inside space was of a high standard and the fully opening doors allowed us to experience the lovely outside temperature from the comfort of indoors.",Kanishka Villas
318,Perfect,50,December 2014,"We stayed at the Kanishka Villas for 4 nights . We absolutely loved it and had a great time. We stayed in the Jacuzzi suite which was great however the Jacuzzi was broken so they changed us to a pool villa. This was amazing and next time would definitely pay to stay in the villa. All the rooms were tidy, air conditioning was great, food was great. There was nothing to complain about at all. The staff were fantastic. One day we booked a driver for the day and he was fantastic. Had lots of knowledge to pass on and made the day super enjoyable. Would not hesitate to recommend this place",Kanishka Villas
319,Relaxing holiday,40,December 2014,"My partner and I got a 5 night accommodation deal with multiple inclusions in a one bedroom pool villa. We were warmly greeted on arrival and showed our villa! The villa is quite spacious and well kept.

After reading some trip advisor tips I requested a villa which was fully air conditioned and was kindly obliged. I'm glad I did as this time of the year is very sticky!!

The air conditioning in our room was not super cold, yet made it comfortable enough to sleep in.

For us the staff at Kanishka was what made it special! Nothing was too hard and our butler Dika was exceptional.

The pool was a good temperature as it was refreshing. Certainly not too cold after a day out in the hot humid weather. The pool was skimmed daily by staff however there was a large number of small rocks on the bottom of the pool for the entire duration of the stay.

The shuttle bus provided within the seminyak region was really useful and we used daily!

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kanishka and would definitely return.",Kanishka Villas
320,Rats ! Watch out ! Don't trust photos from websites !,10,December 2014,"I booked this villa via http://theluxenomad.com during the early bird offer 3 months before the trip. I carefully looked up the reviews and the photos of this hotel on the website and everything seems great. I had high expectation and was looking forward to enjoy my days at this hotel. However this is my worst hotel experience I’ve every had. First day after we checked in, the staffs were friendly and helpful, but once we entered the room, we were kinda disappointed. The setting of the villa is quite weird. The pool and the garden were in between the bedroom and sitting room, which means you will have to go through the outdoor pool in order to enter the bedroom from the sitting room. We checked all the doors and none of the locks are working. We found that was not secure therefore we told the front desk and wanted to change to another villa. After almost an hour of wait ( it was almost 9 and we were straving ), we finally got changed to another villa. The second villa looks better than the first one and every doors are finally working. After we dropped our luggages in the second room,we quickly went out for dinner and came back with our exhausted body and fall asleep straight away. We thought finally everything is back to the right track, however now is where the nightmare started. We found that there are rats in the bedroom, we even found the poo of the rats are just on the sofa next to our bed as well as inside my girlfriend’s handbag! We originally booked for 3 nights, but after what happened on the first night, we have to change to different hotel as I can not stand having rats in the bedroom and going through my baggage (as I am sure all of you will feel the same). I don't normally write review but had to do it this time as I do not recommend anyone to stay at this villa. This is also my first time changing accommodation in the middle of my trip like that.",Kanishka Villas
321,Fantastic getaway from work and kids.....,50,November 2014,"Totally loved our time at Kanishka, we originally booked a jacuzzi room, however on arrival, realised we would need a pool......
We asked to be upgraded to a 1 bedroom villa with a pool, and it was no trouble at all, and the difference in price was well worth it.
Meant we could sleep in, breakfast was brought to us at our requested time of 9 am every morning, and wheher you wanted muesli yoghurt and fruit, or a big fry up, they were both very satisfying.
The staff were fantastic,very polite, in room massages were wonderful as well.
Rarely heard or saw other guets, was very private yet close to some very good restaurants and shops.
We loved the mexican on the beach and Bo Bun, and right at the end of the driveway was a bar that played all Australian channels as well.....so while you got a massage , send him off to the bar to have a few drinks and watch the cricket!
Fabulous experience.",Kanishka Villas
322,Couldn't have asked for more,50,November 2014,"Just before I left for Bali, I read some awful reviews of Kanishka and I was worried that it was going to be a let down. However, when we arrived, the staff were friendly and the villa was gorgeous. I was excited!!
I purchased a package deal thru a coupon type site for Kanishka, so we had 5 nights with a bunch of inclusions. I was certainly not disappointed. The comments about the pool being too cold were ridiculous! After the scorching heat it's refreshing and invigorating to jump into a cool pool. It's wasn't cold, just cooler than most you will find in Asian resorts etc. The sun didn't shine all day on our private pool deck, but from about 9am ish thru to 12-1pm. For me, that was enough. The bedroom aircon was not too cold and perfect for the space, which meant we slept comfortably and without waking up sniffly. The outdoor bathroom was lovely, but I would personally prefer indoor, as showering and doing the usual female beauty routine (minus the make up) proves sticky and sweaty... Not ideal but but not impossible to work with.
Comments about ""insects and lizards"" I found was completely absurd...it's Indonesia people! You are going to find foreign little creatures around! Sure the mozzies are a little freaky, but the staff come in and spray the room and light insect coils for ward them off. I didn't have one problem with ANYTHING here at Kanishka. Again, staff are lovely and helpful and ALWAYS say hello when you pass them.
Location wise, I feel this place is ideal, as it's not on a main road, but just around the corner from all that you need. A 20 mins walk to the beach, short taxi ride to Ku De Ta and Potato Head and a wee bit longer to Kuta.
Highly recommend this villa and keep an open mind when reading other negative reviews about it.",Kanishka Villas
323,"Nice property, ALOT of room for improvement",20,September 2014,"Hotel has such potential... We checked in for a night in September in one of their 2 bedroom private pool villa's

We walked in and were absolutely amazed - The room was extremely new and modern but, we started noticing some things about the property that definitely should be addressed.

1. Besides the fact the pool was completely freezing and seemed there was little or no sun light in the outdoor area...

2. We walked into one of the bedrooms upstairs, although modern the outdoor bathroom was absolutely covered in bugs in the sink - We were OK with this as we just washed them down...

3. As we walked out of our villa to go to dinner, we heard meowing coming from our room, We checked what this was all about and there was a stray Bali cat in the upstairs bathroom that was trapped, I called reception to come and get rid of it, and after 30 minutes of waiting I figured I was best to do it my self, so wrapped it up in a towel and let it go outside, Then when we asked for a new towel, it seemed a bit of an inconvenience for reception.

4. We got back and and began watching TV (trying to as it was all Indonesian channels and no international channels), so played some DVD's instead - The pool water feature was that loud we turned it off (as there were no doors to shut over) and found the mosquito's were slowly but gradually multiplying by the dozen - We called reception to see if there was something they could do, apparently they 'fumigate the room twice a week', by this they mean they come and spray the mozzies that are around and light 2 or 3 mosquito coils, Which - we were fine with - just had to wrap ourselves up to avoid being bitten again.

5. I placed a glass on the couch side table whilst we were watching movies and the thing totally collapsed, so I eventually ended up fixing it myself by wedging it back between the couch like it was.

6. We decided enough was enough at about 2am because a massive rat ran across the room, up over the coffee table where our food was and under the couch - Yes - appeared to have lived under there with a few mates...

I called reception back to address the rodent issue 2 people came at about 2.30am to address after we had waited about 20 minutes, and when we explained the issue to them, they laughed with each other said something in Indonesian and asked what they wanted them to do...

I explained I wanted to see a manager to discuss what had happened all night, and of course he wasn't working, It was a good thing we had double booked our accommodation for that night in our 3 STAR! Hotel in the middle of Legian and had somewhere to go back to.

I spoke to the manager 2 days later as he visited our hotel and I explained exactly what had happened, I said we didn't end up enjoying the villa at all due to all the problems that occured and wanted to know what kind of refund he could offer (I wasn't expecting a full refund), but he couldn't offer it to us at all - He offered us a 1 hour massage, that we could have paid $7 down the road for...

I am a travel agent, and addressed the problem with the supplier I booked through and the reply I got (7 weeks later due to the hotels 'delay') was that they were not going to offer any kind of refund, as we had been there until we were supposed to (referring to the 2 in morning checkout)..

Will never recommend this property to friends, family or clients - Will stick to the original plans of the Villa's next time!",Kanishka Villas
324,Perfection!,50,November 2014,"It was with some trepidation that we arrived here after reading some recent reviews.
However we are now at day 3 of 5 and everything has been perfect.
One bedroom villa.
Private pool does get sun morning and afternoon - but in Bali heat hardly a mandatory requirement anyway and indeed at 7 pm water is still warm.
Extremely quiet. Very attentive and responsive staff.
The whole complex is fogged twice a week and every evening bedroom is sprayed and mossie net set up around the bed as well as mosquito coils placed in outside lounge area and bathroom.
Breakfast brought to villa is excellent and daily cleaning team efficient.
Heaps of good restaurants including one Mexican and one Spanish within a few metres!
Read this in the context that my husband is verrrry picky lol!",Kanishka Villas
325,DISASTER DİSASTER!!!!,10,October 2014,"Before you even consider this, FORGET it!!!! We totally hate everything, the pool hardly sees any sun, we asked for a refund and neither the Manager or the reservations team did anything to cooperate. One disaster after the other, the wifi didn't work,they took half day playing with our time as the Manager avoided us.
We we were 4 friends who travelled half the world to make thus trip and lost an entire day. save yourselves and don't book this for your own good.
We finally get upstairs and find 3-4 lizards in the room, the sheets felt discolored and dirty and the second ac in the 2 bedroom villa on top floor did not Work!! so its hot and I'm currently sharing this with you are looking to book it. DONT! THE TV doesn't have any international channels eit her. We still demand a refund and are totally disappointed. This is not how we planned our 1st day at these villas.",Kanishka Villas
326,Family Holiday to Kanishka Villas,20,September 2014,"I would just like to recommend to anyone who stays at the Kanishka villas not to trust putting their money or valuables in the safe as we have just returned having $600 stolen from the safe, which as it was in the hotel safe was not covered on our insurance (thanks for that one Allianz), also it was stated that every time the master key is used to gain access to the safe in an emergency, two people sign it out, which is not the case as when our friends had them use the key to get in their safe no record was in their key log of the key ever being used. Also be careful if your kids are on the top floor as when we opened both doors on the wardrobe to check to see if we had left anything before departing the whole thing came away from the wall and fell on top of us. The pool is also very cold as it is always in the shade. Not a good place if you are prone to mozzy bites as lounge is completely open on one end. I must state that the staff at the villas are very pleasant and will help out anytime, especially the ladies at reception.",Kanishka Villas
327,Private Luxury,40,November 2013,"Offering both 1 and 2 bedroom options the villas at Kanishka have been meticulously planned to present the guest with the highest levels of comfort and luxury. Service and attention to detail is nothing short of first class and we found the staff will go to any lengths to ensure your stay is a memorable one. There is a very high standard of interior design in both the furnishings and facilities available in each villa. Location is first class, just 20 minutes from the international airport the Kanishka Villas are located down a quiet lane within a stones throw of the highly regarded Bali Deli. Be sure to stop in here for a fine selection of world-class goodies and an excellent cup of coffee. The villas are just a few minutes walk from Bali's best boutiques, spa facilities, restaruants and the wonderful beaches of Seminyak and Legian are but a 10-minute stroll away. The Villas are a match for any 5 star destination and the living arrangements are centred on the generous and inviting private swimming pool, large relaxing sofas, wide open dining, fully equipped kitchen, sun-deck with loungers - all designed for undisturbed relaxation. And, with the large 42-inch television, sound system, DVD player, and high-speed internet access, you can remain connected and informed! Thoroughly enjoyable, relaxing and offering top class service and a sensational array of in-house dining options to cap things off.",Kanishka Villas
328,One of the best villas in Seminyak,40,March 2014,"We booked a four nights stay at the villa to celebrate my birthday.The villa was beautiful and spacious. With our own private pool it was an oasis for us. They sent me a birthday cake to my villa, but we went out so they left it in the fridge. The staffs were very helpful as they helped us made dinner reservations at Potato Head and Ku De Ta for dinner. We asked the receptionist if they could help us arrange a personal driver to take us to the attractions we would like to visit. Within an hour everything was planned by the receptionist which was impressive. Breakfast was served in the villa and the receptionist would call us the day before to check with us at what time we would our breakfast to be served. Guests were given a choice of either local or international breakfast.The location of the villa is close to the main roads, restaurants, massage places, art galleries and shops.Overall we enjoyed our stay.",Kanishka Villas
329,Lovely EVERYTHING !,40,September 2014,"So we arrived on Tuesday , about 3 hours early for check in !! This can really suck when you want to just offload your things and relax after running around . However , the staff was soooo lovely , they took all of our things , and put us in a spare one bedroom villa so we could have a rest until our rooms were ready . We swam in the private pool for about an hour , and our room was good to go . The staff made the experience so much more pleasant . I don't need to tell you too many details about the room , as everything written on their website is spot on . Breakfast is served to you whenever you want it , and the food was good . The location is great , nothing is too far , we walked to most places in seminyak including the beach - 15 mins , the bin tang supermarket - 10 mins , and everything in between ... There's a great Mexican joint called TACO CASA , and it's about 5 minute drive from villa. The people in the area were all really sweet and were always willing to help without ever asking for anything ... There's also this super funky hair salon 2 mins down the road and we couldn't resist taking the kids in for bogus haircuts haha oh oh and check out a shop called 'somewhere' , its really cool ... Wow long review ... Really beautiful villa with matching staff ... If I had to complain about anything , I'd probably say that there's too many mosquitoes in Bali haha but the staff spray your rooms and put coils out for you every day",Kanishka Villas
330,Was soooo impressed!!!!,50,September 2014,"I cant even begin to say how impressed and happy with our villa my partner and I were! I am very fussy with accommodation and had become quite obsessed with checking trip advisor for updated reviews prior to my trip. I was getting a bit worried at the recent mixed reviews. Upon arrival i was WOWED when i entered the villa! It was amazing! I cant understand how these villas have gotten any negative reviews. We arrived at the airport 4 hours late and our airport transfer was still patiently waiting with our name board. (thanks Sandy!) My pool had sunlight and heaps of sun to sun bake all day. (villa 16) The pool water was warm. In the villas the ceiling fans were enough to keep us cool and when we had had enough of the hot weather we could escape to the bedroom where all the doors could be kept closed to keep the cold air in from the air conditioner. The breakfasts were on time and delicious and the in room massages were amazing! When we got back every night we found our bed turned down and mosquito coils burning. The best part was the staff. The girls on the front desk were sooo helpful! They seriously could not be any nicer! They helped us book our day trips/excursions and took the stress out of our holiday! The building manager was there with the owner towards the end of our stay and they were both lovely and polite. These villas are in the perfect spot. Right near all the nice shops in Seminyak and plenty of good restaurants. I think had i gotten other accommodation in a different location, i wouldn't have enjoyed my trip as much. Me and my partner want to go back to Kanishka Villas again next year ... would definitely recommend Kanishka! 5 stars from me! Cant wait to get back there. - will add photos in a few days",Kanishka Villas
331,Excellent accomodation,50,September 2014,We stayed at Kanishka for 8 days and loved everything about it. We were initially concerned about not having a central pool area but loved the privacy of our own space in the centre of Seminyak. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The villa and surrounding grounds were spotless . The location was perfect. Breakfasts were delivered on time and always good. It was so nice to be able to enjoy them in the privacy of our own courtyard. We loved the large bathrooms and spaciousness of Kanishka and would like to return when we visit Bali next.,Kanishka Villas
332,"Lovely villa, great location and terrific staff",50,August 2014,"My wife and I spent a 2 night stay in Villa 12 recently. The villa was lovely and well appointed, the staff were very helpful and welcoming and the overall experience was very positive. The in-villa breakfast service was really good and a great way to start the day. The location is very handy for a walk to the beach, restaurants and good shopping.",Kanishka Villas
333,A great ending to our first Bali holiday,40,August 2014,"The gf and I stayed in Villa 9 in mid-August, and this was our last stop for 5 nights. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The villa was impressive, very spacious and comfortable. We ordered breakfast every day which always arrive on-time, warm and was a great way to start the day before a massage across the road. The pool although didn't have sunlight all day, was great for a swim during those 30C days with a couple of Bintang's!

The only real issue that we had was on the first night, we noticed a large amount of mosquito's inside the villa. We called reception and had a couple of people come in with some bug spray, and left the can for us to use as needed. The following four nights we didn't have any issues. It was nice to see they come in each night and set up the mosquito repellents.",Kanishka Villas
334,"A great stay, good value!",40,August 2014,"We started in a jacuzzi suite but after one night decided to upgrade to a one bedroom pool villa. The jacuzzi suite was very disappointing and to fill up it took more than an hour. Definitely not as advertised!

The one bedroom pool villa was lovely, very spacious!! The only negative is that the pool doesn't get much sunlight which is such a shame!! Other than that the villa is amazing.

The staff are lovely and very friendly. The free shuttle service is great as well if you don't feel like walking.. Beach is about a 15 minute walk.

Great stay over all!",Kanishka Villas
335,The Pool is a Huge Waste. There are Real Problems Here!,20,August 2014,"Having paid many thousands of Australian Dollars to spend a week here, we expected much more. Let me say it is not the fault of the staff. They are lovely and willing to help.

The real problems are the design, the poor power supply, the absence of hot water, the inconsistent WiFi, the average food, the Mosquitos and the rodents running around in the roof that leave droppings on your bed.

The pool has no sunlight. As a result the water is always cold. To get sunlight you have to go elsewhere. What a huge waste and disappointment to start a holiday on.

It was a huge shock to find only one of the the bathrooms had hot water. When we complained this was fixed by removing the hot water in one bathroom and connecting it in another.

The power went on and off a few times, but the real issue was the WiFi which was off for two days during our stay.

The Mosquitos are really bad and there was some sort of rodent in the roof that left droppings on the bed upstairs.

Forget the breakfast, it's average. We had to constantly ask for the coffee sachets to be replaced.

The upside of this place was the space you had to occupy and it's location.

All in all you can do better. I feel sorry for the staff who clearly have to put up with hearing lots of complaints. A discount would have gone a long way to reducing our average experience here. None was offered. It was a nice touch to have the shuttle take us to another nearby hotel.

Suggest they market this as a two star resort.",Kanishka Villas
336,You can do much better than Kanishka,30,August 2014,"Kanishka is situated on a nice street in Seminyak. It is a quieter street, which is a nice change to the bustling centre. We really liked the look of Kanishka, but unfortunately were very disappointed. While the room had a lovely big living space, the number of mosquitoes made it impossible to enjoy. I've never seen so many. Thankfully after spraying in the evening, they died. However, this was after calling and asking for bug spray (we were happy to spray ourselves) and being told to wait until they did the rounds of all the villas (about 1.5 hours later).

On the first evening, the power went off. We were not running any additional powered devices than what was always turned on (ie. fridge, air con). Thankfully one of us had a phone in our hands at the time and were able to use the torch function. Otherwise, we were in a very dark and unfamiliar room. We called reception to report it. We were again given no apology, but soon power was restored.

On our first morning, we woke to no hot water. We called reception and they said their engineers would investigate. An hour later after nothing happening, we called again, and they said the same thing - someone would come and fix it. Another half hour later with still no hot water, we (three of us) left the villa unshowered. We were trying to get out before the heat of the day. No apology was offered, and they never followed it up with us.

It was also little things. Where we stayed in Ubud, there was a toaster in our room so that we could toast our own bread. Here at Kanishka, the bread arrived stone cold and soggy. The rest of the food was average. We also had a coffee not arrived (very minor, but at other places we had stayed in Bali for CHEAPER, we had much, much better service).

In addition to the mosquitoes buzzing around your ears even in the mosquito net, you will also hear some kind of animal on the roof all night, rummaging around. Rats?

When asked how our stay was when we checked out, we told them all of this and got 'sorry's' but what we would have liked was something like our breaskfast at no charge, or even 10% off.

Overall, you can definitely do better than Kanishka. The pool sounds like a great idea, but is not worth it. It is full of leaves, and always in the shade. Go somewhere else!",Kanishka Villas
337,Looks amazing but wouldn't return,30,July 2014,"Stayed for a week the place itself is outstanding but design of pool location means the pool is unusable as to cold had $100 aud stolen while they cleaned our room on the 4th of august breakfast is standard not great, for the price you pay here you would think staff would be more trust worthy, nice rooms amazing decor but that's it won't return would rather stay at a resort were you can utilize the facilities and better staffing first time in 6 years I've had money stolen to bad I didn't realize till I got back to Australia look elsewhere would be my recommendation thankyou.",Kanishka Villas
338,Lovely!,40,August 2014,Free upgrade to pool villa from jacuzzi suite. The people were lovely and the food was good. Only downfall was the mossies however the hosts placed insect coils and fly sprayed each night. A pity there is no restaurant on site also but all in all it was a great experience.,Kanishka Villas
339,Clean and Excellent Services,40,August 2014,"Stayed for 2 nights at jacuzzi room no 5A and my first impression saw my room was amazed with the room design. The room was clean and the air condition is cold enough.
I must give a 10 for their staff services and fast respond when ran out of hot water for my room.
Breakfast was brought to our room every morning.
The only disappointed is small water to fill jacuzzi took more than 1 hour and not enough hot water.
Villas location is perfect near Seminyak Road with lots of shops and restaurants.",Kanishka Villas
340,A tropical Balinese oasis.,50,July 2014,"We booked with an after school holiday deal for six days and weren't disappointed. Our pool villa Number 13 (Maybe unlucky for some) was spacious,opened planed and well appointed. The four poster bed was very comfy and not hard like most beds seem to be throughout Asia. Maybe spend a bit of money on some quality towels my only small criticism. Our breakfast which we ordered the day before was delivered on time and was just delightful and a great range to chose from. The staff were always warm and friendly and always willing to help with every query and made a number of phone calls for us, organizing tours and restaurant reservations for us. The shopping was quite upmarket with a lot of little boutiques and great eateries within easy walking distance. Had a great time and would stay again.",Kanishka Villas
341,"Great villa/location, good people, but poor service",40,July 2014,"Location: In between the main thoroughfare Jalan Sunset and parallel Jalan Seminyak (where all the nice boutiques and restaurants are)
Hotel: 24 private villas - some are 1 bedroom with jacuzzi, others are 1/2 bedroom with pvt pool
Room: One good sized bedroom, good sized bathroom, and an open air dining area on patio with jacuzzi
Positives: Location, pleasant demeanour of staff, villa with jacuzzi, room size
Negatives: breakfast service and general speed of service
Ranking at time of writing: Ranked #70 of 292 specialty lodging in Seminyak

Found a great deal on a hotel website for this place and hence opted for their 1 bedroom jacuzzi villa. At the price that I paid, the villa was super value for money. Our villa was on the 2nd floor with a 1 bedroom villa underneath us, we couldn't see below but we could hear them when they talked. The villa had a patio with a jacuzzi and 2 deck chairs + an open air dining area covered by a canopy. Even though the villa was close to the buzz, it was far away from all the noise, we never had any trouble. Though there was some construction going on in the villas opposite the reception, so somebody staying around that area may find it noisy.

The room was big, the bed was a 4 poster with net for mosquitoes. We had a wardrobe, a TV, and a mini-bar. Because the room was big and tall, it did get a bit hot in the afternoons even with the aircon on. The one -ve was the lighting was too dim even at full power, may be one bright light would set that right.

The bathroom was big with separate bathing area. The towels were a bit tired and up for change. They did provide basic toiletries. I did spend 2 whole days trying to locate the switch for the wash basin lights only to realize that they were under the sink!

The jacuzzi was big enough for 2 people and in good condition.

The major -ve was that we were served the wrong breakfast on 2 out of the 3 days and all 3 days the eggs and the coffee were cold by the time they delivered it to our room (which was the farthest from their kitchen). They surely need to invest in better technology to delivery food hot instead of carrying it in a local made straw basket. We opted to eat breakfast out on last 2 days. The service was slow (the people were very nice though, very polite and courteous), we called for help with the locker and the man didn't show up for 30-40 mins.

The villa did have a nice charm, was adequate for us couple who like to roam about rather than staying in a hotel/resort, so worked perfectly. If I can get this place a bit cheaper without the option of breakfast I'll take it again.",Kanishka Villas
342,Amateur and Outdated,10,July 2014,"Let me start in a positive attitude by saying that the reception staff are all extremely kind and charming to the extreme (I recall specifically the villa manager Kariana was incredibly helpful. We stayed in a 2bedroom Kanishka Villa in Bali during mid-July, unfortunately tainting our experience of our first time visit to the beautiful island.

While the setup of the villa is spacious and (for lack of a more appropriate word) tropical - meaning the entire sitting area is open-air with a jungle growing on top of you - the 'acting' general manager of the hotel was appallingly rude. This seems to be a common opinion among those who have crossed her path.

The carpeting, bedding, upholstery, tables chairs, towels are a few years old, and the years have taken their toll on them. The in-villa pool has a charming waterfall (which you can turn off if you don't like sleeping to the sound of Niagra Falls), however due to the jungle growing adjacent and directly on top of the pool, a multitude of stray leaves make their way into the water. Which means that the in-villa pool ends up resembling more of a dirty pond if you don't request its cleaning several times a day.

The bathrooms are spectacular although the water pressure could be a little stronger, and breakfast does get delivered to your villa dining table if you request it, which guests will enjoy if they get to it before the island insects discover there is a free feast laid out for the taking.

Despite all the above the stay was comfortable and we were content, however watch out for the mosquitos as they are on a mission to make you look like you have a case of the hives after about an hour of chilling outdoors.

Most disconcerting was the attitude of the 'acting' general manager, who handled our request for early checkout in the most unpleasant of manners, both insulting us by telephone and unabashedly trashing her training in any school of customer service that could possibly exist. But that story is for a different site.

Next on the list was the unfortunate construction noise coming from 3 feet away from our door, where new villas were being either constructed or renovated and the construction workers were particularly rowdy with both their voices and their machines. So we were witness to a dramatic rendition of an Indonesian radio drama series from 7am in the morning onwards.

Ultimately, the villa is spacious, located on a nice street that goes on and on and on and is host to great cafe/restaurants while being a few minutes away from one of the nicest streets in Seminyak called Oberoi street. And yes the Oberoi hotel is on that street, hence the name.

I'd recommend a stay here if you are on budget and have a big family since the dining room seats 6 and the living room up to 8.",Kanishka Villas
343,A truly wonderful stay,50,June 2014,My friends and I stayed at Kanishka for three nights in June. We were originally staying at Jimbaran Bay but felt that we should also experience the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. Our villa was amazing and it was an oasis of calm and luxury. We really appreciated that the breakfast was delivered to our room daily by the ever so friendly and competent staff. Our villa had its own pool and was wonderful and spacious. I am already looking forward to our next visit at Kanishka Villas.,Kanishka Villas
344,Oasis in the heart if seminyak,50,July 2014,"We booked the private pool villa and were amazed at the quality of accommodation. Central location, modern and clean facilities, amazing breakfast and wonderful afternoon treats. The staff were very helpful and were more than happy to do research and phone calls for you.

The location is so central that on the same road you can eat, shop, do yoga and have a massage (cheap and deluxe) within minutes.

Only negative is replacement of towels and coffee/tea after clean up but a quick phone call to reception and staff were happy to accommodate. And, we also had some neighbours having 3am domestics but this is no fault of the staff.

Well worth your investment!",Kanishka Villas
345,Relaxing and wonderful stay,50,June 2014,"We stayed in the 1 bedroom pool villa. The room was beautiful, a great mix of indoor-outdoor space. Breakfast coming to the room everyday was also wonderful, and the staff were very friendly and willing to help out and suggest things to see and do.",Kanishka Villas
346,Lovely stay,40,June 2014,"We stayed in one of the Jacuzzi rooms and it was lovely. Every morning breakfast was brought to the room and set up on the outdoor eating area. You needed to remember to order the night before, but even the night we arrived at 2am this all happened without a hitch.

The room was as advertised on the website. It was convenient to most things (Bali Deli just up the road) and the staff were lovely. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The room was serviced daily and my only complaint about the stay was that they seemed to be concerned about clearing away old dishes etc. For example, I made a cup of tea the first morning of our stay (and drank half) which was still there the morning we left (three days later).

Overall it was a very nice place to stay... but it lacked 'personality'.",Kanishka Villas
347,Lovely Villas - Excellent Staff!,50,April 2014,"Pros:
- Friendliest staff
- Hotel is well located in Seminyak
- Nice spacious room with Jacuzzi
- Excellent breakfast

Cons:
- Lighting in the room was a little bit dim
- Overall, stay was very comfortable and enjoyable",Kanishka Villas
348,The amazing Kanishka,50,June 2014,"This was my second time at Kanishka, and I loved it as much as the first time. We stayed there for 3 nights. The villa was beautiful and we had our own private pool. Breakfast was brought to our villa and it was delicious. Our living room had a huge flat screen tv, a dvd player and good sound system. The staff was lovely and always available. Kanishka is definitely the best place to stay at Seminyak. I truly recommend it!",Kanishka Villas
349,Holiday Club Luxury,50,February 2014,"We got to use some expiring points from a holiday club to stay here. It is just a short walk from the main road and about 20 minute walk to the beach, where we went nearly every night to eat and watch the sunset.Very luxurious. Our room, more a villa, had to full king rooms with outdoor ensuites, one upstairs one down, we chose the down on the other side of the pool. The private pool was quite big, a bit cool due to the all day shade but very refreshing once u got in. There was a full dining room, kitchenette (strange,no microwave) with full fridge and water dispensor, and large lounge area with plenty of complimentary fruit. The lounge/ dining also opened onto the pool.The large TV had surround sound,DVD etc and plenty of english foxtel. Basically the rooms had everything, Very clean, typical Bali friendly staff. Hard to pick a fault. Only downside was our noisy neighbours which is due to the open plan style. They got back at 3 am and sreamed, yelled and gigled in high pitched voices. The second night my wife shouted for quiet to no avail but when I had a go they soon got the message, and that was that, no need to bother the staff. We didn't hear from the room on the other side and it was definately occupied, More down to one groups ignorance.This could be an issue for some.Our sleep was extremely comfortable but disturbed. As we didn't pay I would say it is quite expensive by Bali standards but you definately get more for your money than most places, The rooms are made for for 2 couples so halving the cost would be very cost effective for a very luxurious holiday and you certainly would have your own space.",Kanishka Villas
350,Would definitely stay again,50,May 2014,What a wonderful place. The villas especially the pool villa was like a dream. Looked forward to getting back to it after each day of exploring and shopping. The location is quiet. Breakfast was very good and the evening cakes a delight. The staff were A class. Thank you Kanishka for a very happy memorable stay.,Kanishka Villas
351,Great villas,40,May 2014,Kanishka villas was a fantastic place to start our honeymoon. A great size with a nice big private pool which was very refreshing from the hot days. In a nice quiet location within walking distance to so many great restaurants and shops. Staff were very friendly and always happy to help. Occasionally the villa was not cleared as well as should be but never too much left for it to be an issue. Very happy with the stay there,Kanishka Villas
352,"Had Issues, Very Disapointing",30,March 2014,"Stayed here for 3 nights in a Private Pool Villa. Negatives were: Booked a trip that was advertised on the web site called ""The Balinese Experience"" including All entrance fees, 1 hour Balinese Massage & Dinner. Very disappointed. Reception staff had no idea where we were going, Driver was 45 mins Late, no massage, and we paid for everything. Refused to pay for the booking at checkout. Villa Toilet Leaked, and Air conditioner in the bedroom broke down on the last day. Reported it in the morning prior to leaving for the day, came back and it appeared to be fixed, but within an hour it was not working again. Reported it and took 3 hours for someone to come and look at it. Was offered another villa at 2230 that night, by that time we were hot and tired, and couldn't be bothered to relocate all our stuff only having to check out the next morning.
We could hear all the going on's in the villa above and next to us.... There are certain things you don't want to hear if you get my drift.
Positives: Was blown away by the size, Breakfast was fit for a king and the bed was to die for.
Overall, very expensive for the issues we had.",Kanishka Villas
353,Thank you for a superb hospitality,50,April 2014,"Our first time to Bali and wonderful memories. Our villa was perfect. The staff was wonderful and friendly. Breakfast each morning was a delight , our little chats and stories. We organised 2 cooking classes, one in the villa and the other in the sister villas in Jimbaran. The chef was exceptional. The whole experience was personal and perfect. The advice and suggestions we were given by Kanishka's staff was very informative such as where to shop and dine and not at all from a business perspective. This was genuine. The location was also great. Everything within reach but slightly away from the real busy everyday etc....Our whole experience has been perfect. Thank you every one at Kanishka Villas.",Kanishka Villas
354,bali holiday,50,May 2014,"the villas were fantastic , the butlers were very professional, the office staff were so helpful and very polite. The only small problem we had was the pool was very cold next time will ask for villa with more sun.",Kanishka Villas
355,Not worth the money,30,May 2014,"We stayed here for 4 nights and although it is nice it is expensive.

Positives: beautiful inside, large for 2 people, walk to the end of the street and there are a lot of shops, bali deli close by and a few good restaurants around, breakfast was really good.

Negatives: Our bed was so hard that we should have just slept on the floor, the Wi-Fi didn't work - we bought this up multiple times and it still wasn't fixed, the shower pressure wasn't very good and our safe was open when we came back one day.",Kanishka Villas
356,Excellent resort in Bali !!!,50,May 2014,"Firstly , I want to praise the staff for an excellent job with all aspects ie- room service...meals always hot. House staff - pleasant, good english spoken.& efficent.. good location for villas..not noisy..our fridge and aircon broke down...fixed within 2 hrs...get a good tour guide.they have reasonable rates & their knowledge invaluable. .they are worth every dollar !!!",Kanishka Villas
357,"lovely villas, great location",40,May 2014,"My husband and I stayed at Kanishka Villas from May 5th until May 10th, 2014. We originally booked the One Bedroom Jacuzzi Suite which we enjoyed for 2 nights and then found there was a vacancy in the private pool villa so we upgraded for an extra US$100 per night. The Jacuzzi villas were lovely and we enjoyed happy hour with our wine and bintang amid the bubbles each afternoon but if you can spare the extra money I would highly recommend the pool villas. They are so spacious and absolutely gorgeous.
While we did not receive our welcome massage, we did receive a delicious drink on arrival, and tropical fresh fruit arrangement in our villa. We also had our beds turned down and mosquito nets untied daily also home-made pieces of cake were delivered each evening along with the most beautiful smiles! We would highly recommend Kanishka villas and would certainly stay again.
If you are after any supplies, the Bintang supermarket is very close and the best value. We would also recommend changing your money there as there is a very safe money changer where you will not have any issues at all. Avoid the money changers close to the villa who offer great rates - they should be magicians! Thanks again to the lovely staff at Kanishka, we had a holiday to remember forever...",Kanishka Villas
358,Great Experience at Kanishka Villas Seminyak,50,April 2014,"The impeccable staff at Kanishka villas made the stay seamless from the start with constant and friendly communication. The stylish villas are everything you could want in Seminyak and the pictures in the gallery are exactly what the villas look like, modern, spacious and very comfortable with plenty of natural light. We had a beautiful breakfast with different choices each morning brought to our villas. It was a fantastic stay and the best experience for guests as there are plenty of local restaurant recommendations, as well as shopping and places of interest close by. I highly recommend and would stay here again, was so impressed and hope to try the Jimbaran villas . Thanks Kanishka for the experience and for the incredibly accommodating and warm staff every day, especially at the front desk!",Kanishka Villas
359,We will be back!,50,May 2014,"We stayed at Kanishka villas for 5 days.
Once off the plane we were met with the lovely driver holding a sign the the gate. He offered us a cool towel and a cold drink, this was a great start to our holiday. We stayed in the 1 bedroom villa with private pool, the villa was very spacious and equipt with everything you need. The staff were TREMENDOUSLY helpful and cheerful, they truly catered to every request! Everything in the villa was beautiful, and breakfast was great. The location was perfect as we were right in the hub of the city however far enough back not to hear and traffic noise. A short stroll to bali deli which stocked fresh fruits, nibble food and the best place to exchange money.
The only problem was the shuttle bus was never available when we wanted to make use of its service, no worries though as most places are only a walk or a short cab drive away and cabs are VERY cheap.
We are already planning our next trip back!",Kanishka Villas
360,Lovely retreat in Seminyak,40,April 2014,"The Kanishka Villas in Seminyak are only a few metres from the main shopping street in the area, so they are well located for the boutiques and quite a few of the very good eating options. The street known as ‘eat street’ is about 20-25 minutes walk away (which is actually only about 10,000 rupiah in a cab – $1AUD), and is also full of high-end boutiques and some excellent food choices.

We thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of these villas. The ground floor section was an open plan kitchen, living and dining area with no wall or doors separating us from the private pool complete with stone wall and blade water feature. Large flat stepping stones led us across the pool to one of the large double bedrooms. The ensuite of this bedroom had an outdoor shower surrounded by plants and a large bath set in black stone tiles, the upstairs bedroom had the bath in the open air with the shower inside. Both rooms were complete with an extremely comfortable canopy bed, fitted with cinnamon coloured silky drapes that doubled as mosquito protection in the evening. The bedrooms were airconditioned to provide a refreshing retreat in the heat of the afternoon when the open-air living area with the fan just didn’t cut it in the battle with the humidity. Although, we found that the only time we really needed to use that retreat during the day was for the taking of naps – otherwise we just spent time in the pool with drinks in hand. The one problem with the facilities was the poor water pressure and unpredictability of the shower. Sometimes it cut out completely, which was more than annoying when you were standing there with a head full of shampoo!

The service of the staff at Kanishka was excellent – they were very friendly, helpful and just plain cheery. I did witness one particularly obnoxious guest being very rude to a staff member because of the trouble he was having with the water in the showers. He was arrogant, condescending and completely unaware of how embarrassing he was…to himself! Unfortunately, this type of unnecessary rudeness is everywhere whether travelling or at home, where some people are endowed with an inflated ego, sense of entitlement and false sense of superiority.

We had a delightful time at Kanishka, and will definitely return.",Kanishka Villas
361,Wonderful,40,April 2014,We stayed as a Family in April. This place is wonderful. Some things could do with some repairs. But overall they were very helpful & accommodating. Pool is amazing. Separate bedrooms with own bathrooms are terrific. Thank you.,Kanishka Villas
362,"Attentive Staff, Good Location, Spacious Villa. Worth for a stay!",40,April 2014,"I travel to Bali on 30th April 2014 for 4 Days 3 Nights with my dear sister and my loved one. The Villa is very spacious and central to everything. Just a few step, you can get a Massage Retreat or even Spa Retreat. Foods are all around. Easy to find your way around. Peaceful and relaxing. The staff are very efficient and deliver our hot breakfast every morning during our stay. Overall it is a Great Stay in Kanishka Villa. =) There are one thing that we are not so satisfied about, that was I step on the small pieces of glass on the timber floor. After that, we found out that pieces of glasses are everywhere on the carpet in the living area. We called up the staff and ask them to vacuum the whole villa again to make sure that we will not stepping on the glasses again. (PS: The feet is extremely pain when I soak my feet on the seawater!) The Staff are very efficient, when we came back from our outdoor activities, the room is clean and free from fractured pieces of glasses. Highly recommended this Villa to you all. =)

For your information: PLEASE BEWARE OF THOSE ""AUTHORISED MONEY CHANGER"" ALONG THE ROAD SIDE. NEVER EVER TRY TO CHANGE YOUR CURRENCY AT THOSE PLACES EVEN WHEN YOU SAW THE EXCHANGE RATE IS HIGH. WE WITNESSED THEIR ""MAGIC"" AND THEY TRY TO CHEAT OUR MONEY. LUCKILY WE MANAGE TO TAKE BACK OUR OWN MONEY. IF YOU ARE STAYING IN KANISHKA VILLA, PLEASE ASK THE RECEPTIONIST FOR THE LOCATION OF BALI DELI, THERE IS A HONEST AND RELIABLE MONEY CHANGER LOCATED INSIDE THE SUPERMARKET. =)",Kanishka Villas
363,Honeymoon in paradise,50,April 2014,"My husband and I stayed here in April 2014 for our honeymoon. The service was second to none. The villa was truly amazing. Central to everything, easy to find your way around. Peaceful and relaxing. I had booked a 1 bedroom pool villa but was upgraded to a bigger one :-)",Kanishka Villas
364,roomy retreat,40,April 2014,"stayed here in april 2014 with another couple had a 2b/rm pool villa. very spacious & clean. central to all seminyak has to offer tucked down a long driveway just of the main drag with off street parking if u need it.no restaurant on site but room service is avail at very reasonable cost. pool was perfect size. great size fridge & kitchen. suitable couples, friends or families with teenage kids as 1 b/room is in a separate pavilion with a lovely outdoor shower & huge deep bath. parents retreat upstairs with sitting room. this accom was excellent & we would definitely stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
365,Overall a Great Stay!!,50,April 2014,"My wife and I were recommended the Kanishka Villas by our Travel Agent. She was spot on. The Kanishka Villas is a very well run establishment with quality furnishings, excellent gardens and a beautiful villa pool. Overall we loved our 9 nights there and appreciated the handy location adjacent to restaurants, Chill Spa and Bali Deli. The big highlight for us were the very friendly and efficient staff who kept the villa in great condition and delivered our daily hot breakfast and paper. The staff are a credit to the place. My wife and I have no hesitation to return for another stay later this year. Highly Recommended!!",Kanishka Villas
366,Luxury in an ideal location.,50,March 2014,"After spending five days in Jimbaran, for the last two days of this Bali trip, we stayed at Kanishka Villas.
And as with Gending Kedis, these villas are also very spacious, comfortable, beautifully appointed with Balinese style furnishings, very good service, but with all the facilities for in-room living...if required.
Though the purpose of moving to Seminyak was for it's convenience to the many wonderful restaurants, as well as shopping in the area.
Highly recommend to any traveller to Bali.",Kanishka Villas
367,"Luxury, great service, private",50,April 2014,"We stayed here on our honeymoon and it was pure luxury. The staff were always friendly and exceptionally helpful. Our villa was spacious, clean, air conditioned, and fitted out with everything. Not quite what it looked like on the website photos, but still very nice. Bath tub was a bit small but shower and bathroom were very cool. Bed was comfy, bathrobes provided, and breakfast was delivered to our room. Location was close to main happenings/shopping and food in seminyak. (Great coffee nearby at Anomali Cafe). Villa felt quite private, though butlers tend to come by any time throughout the day for various cleaning/setting up. Would also be great group accommodation. Overall we had a lovely time, felt like we'd been spoilt, and would definitely return/recommend!",Kanishka Villas
368,Beautiful Villa's with top notch service!,50,March 2014,"We booked 7 nights accommodation with Kanishka Villa's for our honeymoon and it was just the best experience for start to finish.

the Vialla's themselves are beautifully kept and maintained with gorgeous furniture. We had the 1 bedroom private pool villa and it was worth every cent. Being able to wake up in the morning to your own private pool is just amazing and so relaxing.

Located in a great spot, close to Bali Deli and so many beautiful boutique shops and restaurants.

We also had a BBQ in our room one night which was so good! What an experience.

The staff at Kanishka Villa's are an absolutely credit to this company! They are all so friendly and so helpful.

We really felt like we were very well looked after for our 7 night stay. We are already looking at when we can go to Bali next, and we will be staying with Kanishka Villa's! No questions about it.

L&L :)",Kanishka Villas
369,Return visit to Kanishka Villas just as great,50,March 2014,"Returned to this hotel for a short two day stay. I think this is my third stay there. As always,
a great place to stay with restaurants nearby (a great mexican restaurant just a few doors
away) and shopping right around the corner. This is a convenient location for the first time
traveller to Bali with wonderful accomodations. What luxury to have your own private pool
indoors to return to after a full day of activities! You must enjoy!",Kanishka Villas
370,"Nice property, not safe for small kids",20,March 2014,"We stayed here for 4 nights on a short Bali getaway with the family.
On first impression, the rooms are wonderful. Very spacious and gorgeous. The check in service was good and the staff were always attentive and helpful.

We were travelling with a 5 year old, 2 one year olds & a 10 year old. For the little nippers, this property is NOT SAFE. We were told that it was not possible to get a pool fence until we really stamped our feet and demanded one, at which point, one of the 2 villas we were hiring received the fence (the one without any walls or sliding doors). Our villa could not get a fence because they didn't have any more. Apart from worrying every second of the day that our kids would open the sliding doors (which don't lock without a key we weren't provided with) and fall into the pool, we had to contend with the fact that when the kids DID go swimming and then hop out and walk into the house they would slip on the polished marble floors and fall over and hurt themselves (which they did regularly).

The breakfast was mediocre at best, served luke warm and if you don't pre order it the night before you don't get it. I've stayed in other villas where they cook it for you in the villa and I thought they might here but they don't. You're locked into a set style with fixed items. I would much rather had a buffet with an omelette station any day of the week.

All in, I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone with small kids. Maybe for a nice relaxing romantic holiday but definitely 100% not for people with small children. The whole worrying about your kids dying is a pretty good way to ruin a holiday. Next time we will stay in a resort.",Kanishka Villas
371,do not stay!,20,March 2014,"I recently stayed in a one bedroom pool villa for a total of 4 days and 3 nights. The airconditioning was not working on arrival. Chilled towel was not provided on arrival, we were not provided with afternoon snacks, turn down cake, unless requested, all of which was supposedly included upon booking, even then, we did not receive snacks and had to request for it again at reception.
Butler service was not always provided, we needed to request for service at least twice before maintenance/butler came to our service. Staff spoke minimal English, it was very hard for us to communicate with them, even using basic English words. Wifi connection would drop out multiple times or every few minutes, which then also required you to log in again.
Breakfast is very limited, of average quality and small portions. eggs tasted like vinegar.
Villa is very nice, although not worth the price. the room upstairs was able to look down into our pool area which made our stay very uncomfortable.

I would not recommend this villa. There are much nicer villas to stay at, with friendlier and more helpful staff for half the price. :)",Kanishka Villas
372,There are better villas in Bali for less,20,March 2014,"My friend and I recently stayed in a one bedroom pool villa at this place.
The cleanliness was not up to scratch, the bathroom was dirty and the floors were sticky.
The staff at the resort spoke very minimal English and constantly made mistakes with our breakfast order. The free breakfast is very limited and the serving portions were very small. My friend and I were left hungry after the meal. When asked for an iced coffee, we were brought hot drip coffee and was advised that there were ice cubes in the fridge. The breakfasts were not very tasty.

The ""butler"" service appeared to be non existent and we found that we had to repeat requests several times before we were understood (if at all). Some requests go on completely ignored and were not completed at all. And if they were, it was not at all in a timely manner.

We have stayed in a villa in Bali previously elsewhere and had an amazing service and could not fault one aspect of it.

After all this, I do admit the place was very nice. The couch had many mosquitoes flying around. The insect control could be managed better to control all aspects of the villa.

There really are better (and cheaper) places to go to in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
373,A Sixtieth birthday in Bali.,50,March 2014,"Kanishka provided a wonderful beginning to what I think would be our most enjoyable visit to Bali.. .ever ! No-one would be surprised to hear about great service and friendliness in a good Seminyak luxury resort but this was somehow different. The staff seemed to be ahead of all of our needs and were responsive to late night requests for in-room dining and that special bottle of wine that my ""clutz"" husband then proceeded to drop on the very firm Villa floor all cleaned up with a broad Balinese grin. As for the Villa (17) , which comes with a brilliant private pool. Comfortable, romantic and certainly no air conditioning issues for us on this stay. Luxurious without being pretentious.

374,Excellent private pool Villa,50,February 2014,"We could not have been happier with our stay at Kanishka Villa's. Everybody without exception were friendly and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The Villa itself was awesome, we have been to Bali many times and just wanted to stay in the room and relax, this was very easy to do in the huge Villa with large outdoor living area, two TV's, large private pool, good size fridge, drinking water dispenser, large bathroom and very well kept garden.
Everything we needed was very close by which is handy if you just want to relax and not have to search for things.
If possible we will be going back to stay again it was so good.",Kanishka Villas
375,A place to relax and unwind.,50,February 2014,"We stayed for three days and two nights at the one bedroom Jacuzzi suite villa. Positive feedbacks brought us to Kanishka.

The villa was clean and well prepared when we arrived. Loved the bathroom, the sink area was well equipped, beautifully lighted with an opening on the ceiling (we realized on the second night that it was actually covered with glass).

The bed was comfortable, my husband fancy the pillows. We read about some comments saying that the bed was hard or uncomfortable, guess this is more on personal references.

The breakfast were delicious with variety of choices. You can opt for American/Indonesian/Continental breakfast, plenty of juices to choose from, served on your preferred time. It was sent to us hot and on the dot, never too early/late.

For two days we went about our activities and arrived late in the evening, finding the bed ready for us. Complimentary cakes and mineral water was also served daily.
Mosquito coils were lit in the bathroom area and deck (the smell was a bit much later at night, but it was tolerable).

The staff were friendly and helpful with big smiles, making us feel welcomed.

The location is strategic, walking distance to variety of shops and restaurant. The front desk will provide you with a map and recommendations of places to go.

The villa provide us the seclusion and privacy that we needed. Hanging out on the deck at night was both relaxing and romantic.

We really enjoyed our time at the villa, and we definitely plan to come back.",Kanishka Villas
376,maintenance of the room is very poor,10,February 2014,"was staying at kanishka last week. I booked this resort as I read good reviews over TripAdvisor but I am not happy with the room. I was staying at jaccuzi villa and the AC was not working properly. they have not maintained the resort properly. out of 6 days 2 days my room AC was not working. there. maintenance of the room is very poor.and even after complaining about air conditioner not up to the mark they haven't fixed it.I'm not happy with the service.

I would never recommend any honeymoon couple to go there",Kanishka Villas
377,Open plan luxury villa in Seminyak.,40,February 2014,"Recently stayed here for 3 nights with my husband on the first leg of our Bali holiday. We had stayed here about 2 years ago as well.

We stayed in one of the new One Bedroom Pool Villas. We love the open plan of the villas where the kitchen and dining open straight on to the deck and pool area, and having the bedroom and bathroom separate. The air con worked amazingly, and we loved the layout of the bathroom. It is more an open plan, it does have walls but there is an open panel over a garden bed they have in there. The shower and bath were HUGE, which was awesome. The service was always good, we had room service on our first night when we were exhausted and couldn't be bothered venturing out, and it was average, but thats kinda what we were expecting. Pool is a great size and a good temperature.

The rooms and pool are cleaned well, and breakfast was always good!

A few down falls, internet wifi was very hit and miss, and when it did work is was usually very slow. One day I did call reception when it wasn't working and they said they would fix it, but nothing was done about it.

The bed was horribly uncomfortable, it was so hard! Which was sad because when we stayed here a few years ago (we were in a 2 bed villa that time) the bed was awesome, so we were pretty annoyed with that.

But other then those 2 things we loved our stay at Kanishka, love the location and the friendliness of the staff. People have said they have had troubled with mosquitos, but we had no troubles at all.",Kanishka Villas
378,AC not working,20,February 2014,Im right now staying at kanishka. I booked this resort as I read good reviews over TripAdvisor but I am not happy with the room. I am staying at jaccuzi villa and even after complaining about air conditioner not up to the mark they haven't fixed it.I'm not happy with the service. I hope they fix it tomorrow.,Kanishka Villas
379,superb villa,50,February 2014,"Having reading some bad review about kanishka, We came to kanishka without high expectation and we thought we will get average experience.

WE WERE WRONG

We had a fantastic time on our stay here at kanishka villa. we book a one bedroom villa but given a two bedroom villa though they locked access to the second bedroom. The living room is so comfy and relaxing that we spent our whole time there, relaxing at the pool and get lazy at the comfortable large couch. The bedroom is nice, only negative is the sign of wear and tear on some of bedroom and bathroom furnitures but its not a big deal.

They served breakfast at dining area at our preferable time and it tasted good. Every evening when we comeback after exploring seminyak, they put some complimentary cakes on the refrigerator. And after the housekeeping making the bed, they put some little balinese doll on top of it, a small touch but leaving a heartfelt impression that we are treated so special here

And they have a shuttle service, you can go anywhere around seminyak, the driver will drop you there. for free.... at one occasion when we want to have dinner at merah putih restaurant, the hotel staff and the driver even go the extra mile to call the restaurant to ask about the precise location, drive us there and even ask us to call the hotel to be picked up after dinner even though the shuttle service was meant to be a drop only service.

Other plus is the location, bali deli, warung italia, mannekepis and other restaurant is so nearby and just a step away from kaniska, yet inside the villa it feels so calm and quiet when we need it, and the busy bustling road of seminyak is only a few walk away form the villa

Heard a lot about mosquito problem here, but it never be a big problem since every evening they did fogging and afterwards the staff light a mosquito repellant all over the villa. Just always close the glass sliding door of your bedroom and livingroom and your room are practically mosquito free inside the villa, except the bathroom, you will still encounter few mosquito there but still tolerable

definitely will be back again to kanishka",Kanishka Villas
380,Laid back charm,50,January 2014,"Just spent a week at Kanishka Villas and loved it. Had 2 double villas next door to each other so the whole grown up family could stay. Everyone had their own privacy if they wanted, or could meet in the living area/pool. Great accomodation and location. Everything was within walking distance or a short taxi ride.The staff at Kanishka make your stay. Friendly, helpful and always with a smile on their face. I appreciated the little extras they went to, making our stay so memorable.",Kanishka Villas
381,Fantastic Villas,50,January 2014,Thank you Kanishka Villas for our wonderful week long vacation. Having a private pool was absolutely the best. We had a lovely relaxing time in a 2 bedroom pool villa. We chose to cook our own breakfast most mornings and it was fantastic being able to do so in our own kitchen. So many shops and restaurants within walking distance. The staff were lovely and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. We would definitely stay there again. A big thumbs up!!!!,Kanishka Villas
382,Cozy bslinese home away from home,30,December 2013,"We stayed in a two bedrom villa during the post christmas to new year holiday. The villa in itself is great, it is spacious and feels like home. But we missed the amenities of a hotel , such as room service and all day dining. We prefer the quiet laidback feel of its area . Breakfastwas served on time, and the staff were very attentive. The room at the poolside where me and my husband stayed was a bit warm while the 2nd fkr room was really cold because of the 2 air conditioning units. Will we recommend the place or book again if we go back to bali? Absolutely",Kanishka Villas
383,We Loved Kanishka Vills,50,January 2014,"We stayed in a1 bedroom pool villa. We loved the layout of the villa & pool. We have stayed elsewhere in Seminyak, but we really loved the location of Kanishka. So many cafes & restaurants to choose from. So many within walking distance in all directions. All staff very friendly & helpful. It was nice getting in at night & finding your bed turned down, mosquito nets drawn & cake in the fridge for supper. Would highly recommend this property & my husband & l can't wait for our next visit.",Kanishka Villas
384,Very Nice Hotel,50,January 2014,"The villa is located at a quite silent area. There is not much tourists in that area.
You can found nice restaurants around the villas.
We will never forget the night we having chit-chat inside the jacuzzi under the starry starry sky!",Kanishka Villas
385,An excellent place to stay where you will collect lifetime memories!,50,November 2013,We stayed with Kanishka Villas last year in Nov 2013...after checking a lot of hotels in Bali we decided to book this private pool villa for our 10th wedding Anniversary...the villa is spacious and gives you a royal feeling....it didn't take us more than 10 minutes to enter the beautiful swimming pool in our villa....the staff was very sweet and helpful.....since we booked our villa almost 6 months in advance we got a good package deal too. The villa provides you with a welcome massage as well which was very relaxing....There are excellent SPA's just outside the villa.....also the bikes which you get on rent are available in vicinity....there are lovely restaurants at walking distance and also a grocery market from where you can get any and all types of food to cook as the villa provides you with a full fledged kitchen......we stayed there for 7 days and enjoyed the peaceful environment in the villa...we recommend this place 100% to everyone who is planning a visit to Bali!,Kanishka Villas
386,Romance meets Convenience,50,January 2014,"A slice of paradise, The Kanishka Villas are well positioned in the busy Seminyak area. With a plethora of restaurants and the Seminyak Beach just a short walk away they are a perfect choice for those who want to shop, laze, sleep, swim and just generally unwind.
Private courtyards, with a private swimming pool, tasteful decor with a real modern Bali style and very comfortable beds all contribute to the immersive experience of this Bali Holiday destination.
I rate it highly and would definitely recommend it for those looking for a romantic great value escape.",Kanishka Villas
387,Very Pleasant Stay!,40,January 2014,"We read all the reviews before we went so we were a little concerned on certain things including the mozzies, pool to cold, no sunshine and airconditioning in the main living area. But is was ALL fine!!
Hardly any mozzies and they were there each eveninng to spray and leave some coils, and we also bought our own to put around if needed but there werent anywhere near as many mozzies as we expected !! Haveing to ""bathe"" in nature was a refreshing change, loved it!!!
As for the lack of sunshine on our pool to heat it up, ours was perfect and temperature of the water was on the cool side but not cold enough not to go in. The living area had sliding doors to shut it off from out side and then the airconditioner worked a treat!!!
The breakfasts were ok, but I would probably venture out for breaky next time. Staff were very friendly, the place was quiet and peaceful and we had an amazing time. The only downfall was that one of the beds was very hard. Will definitely go back and stay again.!!
Thankyou Kanishka",Kanishka Villas
388,Awesome experience,50,December 2013,"Stayed over the Christmas period. Wonderful ,private and peaceful place to stay Staff friendly and helpful and nothing too much trouble.. Excellent location close to day spas and restaurants. Room service excellent.",Kanishka Villas
389,A holiday to be remembered,50,December 2013,We stayed a Kanishka villas over Christmas. It is ideally situated near a number of shops and eating establishments and within walking distance of the beach. The villa we had (no 9) was very spacious and well equipped. It was lovely to be served breakfast in our villa by very friendly and seasonal staff. The afternoon cakes were very much anticipate every afternoon especially the carrot cake. The pool was a welcome break from the hot weather. Thank you for a lovely stay,Kanishka Villas
390,V v v v v v Good Villas Kanishka Villas,50,December 2013,M v happy with overall hospitality and service by kanishka villas staff v good place to stay.V v v v v v Good Villas Kanishka Villas. We again prefer to go there during our next visit in Bali. Best of Luck keep going good.,Kanishka Villas
391,Fantastic place to stay,50,December 2013,"My husband, child and I stayed in a 2 bedroom pool villa for 5 nights last week. What made the stay particularly great was the attitude of the staff - they were so friendly, helpful and obliging - nothing was too much trouble. I've stayed in Bali loads of times but have never encountered such welcoming staff, they really made us feel special.

The villa is spotless, well located and spacious.

Every afternoon there are freshly made cakes provided for afternoon tea.

Staff turn down your bed / let down the netting around the bed and put a little straw man on your pillow.

The butlers arrive every morning and lay out a fantastic breakfast spread in the dining room (pancakes and fruit/muesli is yummy - coffee is pretty average).

They drove us into Seminyak a few times in the hotel bus - because of the location we tended to walk quite a bit.

The reception staff bent over backwards to make you feel welcome and provide tourist information.

What I didn't like - after reading other reviews, I requested a family room with glass sliding doors (apparently some don't have these so the living area is outside) and I'm glad we did as otherwise the mosquitos and heat would have been unbearable.

I don't like that both bathrooms are outside. In the evening a lovely staff member would come around with coils and spray and the villas themselves were blanket bombed twice a week. Unfortunately mosquitos are part of the tropics but meant that I didn't want to use the outside bathroom at night.

Whilst the villas are lovely, they really do need some maintenance - there are big holes in the kitchen cupboards through to the flooring, cabinet doors are falling off, music wouldn't work, the timber floor upstairs is lifting and uneven.

Can't be changed but didn't like that you had to go outside to get to the second bedroom, which is separate from the other part of the villa. This meant that one of us had to sleep with our child in the 2nd bedroom.

These things wouldn't put me off staying there again but for the price you pay, they do let the premises down.",Kanishka Villas
392,Very Recomended Villa for pleasure or Honeymoon,50,December 2013,"Good Villa in Seminyak, nice place, nice room & Good Breakfast. very recomended for honeymoon with your couple or for holyday with your family or four friends. The room very comfort and quiet. Only 10-15 minutes to seminyak beach",Kanishka Villas
393,"Good service, prefer room with no pool and confined bathroom",40,December 2013,"Before we arrived , we expect this will be a resort style accommodation. After we arrived , the lobby is just a small room, and then we need to walk along an alley to get to our first room. All the rooms are located along the alley with no facilities like restaurant at all, just rooms.

We lived in two type of rooms , one is private bedroom with jacuzzi , the other is two bedroom villa with private pool.

The first room type is comfortable , the bed and pillow is good. The bathroom is confined with no/little insects. They will light up the mosquito smoke and the smell was too strong for sleeping. We put it outside the bedroom afterwards.

For the second room type, nearly all area except the two bedroom is not confined , which means that there will be lots of mosquito or other insects flying around ... For the room on the ground floor , there is no cover when walking between the living room and the bedroom...

There are many ants around the pool, the water is super cold. There is no sunlight at all as the pool area is covered by a lot of plants....

The breakfast was served inside the villa and was generally good. The staffs were very nice. The Indonesian breakfast e.g. Nasi Goreng, Nasi Mie, Asian Congee, etc are all good. American breakfast not that good especially for the meat. I love the bali coffee added with milk and brown sugar.

Conclusion is that they should confine the bathroom since I hate to poo poo and pee pee with the Mosquitos. Saw that they are renovation some rooms and hopefully will be better afterwards.",Kanishka Villas
394,Great Spot in Seminyak-Bali,50,December 2013,"Booked for a short stay and wanted somewhere central. Kanishka Villas are an ideal spot that is close to restaurants and shops, but quiet and peaceful. Service is personal and professional. The villa's are cozy and lots of nice Balanese features. A great spot in Bali...will visit again soon.",Kanishka Villas
395,Beautiful villa,40,November 2013,"We stayed here for the last part of our honeymoon in Bali. The special touches including welcome flowers and bed decorations were very sweet. Our pool villa was just great. The pool was cleaned daily and we made great use of it to escape the heat. We spent much of the night inside our bedroom though due to the number of mosquitoes, but the staff came nightly to light mosquito coils and also spray for them which was very good. The cake each afternoon was yummy too and a nice treat. Some great restaurants and shopping nearby.",Kanishka Villas
396,My Kid love it!,40,December 2013,"I went to Bali for the first time with my 1, 5yo kid, so i really concerned about where do we have to stay, i want a decent comfy place, then i found this kaniskha villa, i read about it in trip advsior and they gave good review, doubtless i booked the villa, unfortunatelly we only had one night because all the villas were fully booked.

I love the architecture and furniture design, it was a decent and comfy place to stay, even my boy love to sit on the edge of the pool that has two stairs, he can play his tiny feet and splash the water.

I'm wishing to book this place again. i love the breakfast, and for the important things, there's kitchen so i can cook for my kid'food since he never ate instant food even when travelling.

I've missed one thing i didn't get the chance to try foot massage because late book, well maybe next time

Nice location and near the supermarket. Overall i love it :)",Kanishka Villas
397,Wonderful wonderful wonderful!!!,50,November 2013,"We had the most amazing stay at Kanishka!! My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 nights in a pool villa and we were not disappointed! The villa was beautifully laid out, the rooms were clean and inviting and the outdoor bathroom was such a cool feature!! So close to the main street in Seminyak and some amazing restaurants and massage parlours! Also the drivers out the front were more than happy to take us wherever we needed to go outside Seminyak for really good prices! Did not find a problem of lack of sun at all - all morning til about 2pm our loungers and pool were drenched in beautiful Bali sunlight, and after that the outside temperature is still warm enough to take a dip! Mosquitoes were also dealt with by the coils and spray - only found I got mosquito bites when was not in the villa!!
All in all, we had a wonderful stay at Kanishka and would definitely recommend it!! The staff were attentive and friendly, the villa was well kept, and the breakfast was delicious! Would love to go back!!!!",Kanishka Villas
398,kanishka villas are amazing!!,50,November 2013,"I took my husband to Bali for his 50th birthday and we were blown away by our villa. The living area was spotless and spacious. Having our own private pool was incredible - the only small disappointment was the lack of sunshine it gets, but if there had been sun I think we would have struggled to see Seminyak at all!!!
Our bedroom and ensuite were wonderful and again, spotless.
The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful - the complimentary shuttle was an added bonus we didn't expect.
Each morning we'd come back from our walk, have a refreshing dip in our pool and enjoy the best breakfast, laid out on our dining table - and everything was fresh and hot!!! Omelettes, scrambled eggs, pancakes, muesli, croissants, danishes, fresh fruit & juice - what more could you ask for??
We never saw a mosquito and the coils did not permeate our clothing!!!
We will most definitely return to Kanishka Villas.",Kanishka Villas
399,Cheap for a reason,30,November 2013,"There is a reason that these villas are cheap. Where do I start? I booked a one bedroom villa - only to find that I had been placed in a 2 bedroom with the upstairs locked. Whilst there was the initial ""wow"" factor when I walked in, it soon became clear that this was not going to be a good stay.
1. There was a mouse running around the bedroom, after a couple of days I named him Harry and we became good friends.
2. The cupboards were hanging off the hinges in the kitchen, the tap looked like it was about to drop off. There was not cold water
3. The pool was in the shade for most of the day
4. They were updating the villa next door so I had builders peering down on me, hammers, saws etc.
5. The breakfast is boring, and mostly cold. The coffee is disgusting
6. The ""24 hour butler"" is non-existent. Never saw him
7. The staff on the front desk have no idea about what is around them, couldn't even tell me where a restaurant was that I later found out was 2 doors down from the villas. Polite but clueless.
8. Yes the mosquitos are a problem, they bring around coils at about 7pm (I already had about 20 bites before then). The coils work but expect ALL of your clothing, hairbrush etc to smell like coils when you get home.
9. The towels in the bathroom are old and grey.
10. The bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete. I am seriously not joking, you have been warned.
11. Only has air con in the bedroom - the bathroom and living area are outside. It's hot. So you spend most of your time in the bedroom. (on the concrete bed)
12. I wonder if Harry is OK?",Kanishka Villas
400,Even better the 2nd time around!,50,November 2013,"Today is our last day at Kanishka and we have really enjoyed our time here.
I was most puzzled by the previous reviewer, we certainly had no issues like they had mentioned.
Our only hiccup was a dripping air conditioning unit, but hey, it's wet season in Bali!
Staff are so kind and friendly and the facilities are in my opinion, first class.
Location is excellent, still quiet and secluded but just a three minute walk to Jalan Raya Seminyak for great shopping and eating.
We are returning to Bali in March and hope to stay for part of our trip at Kanishka again, we love it!
Thank you everyone at Kanishka for your friendliness and wonderful service.",Kanishka Villas
401,What you see is not what you get,10,September 2013,"I did a lot of research prior to booking a villa at Kanishka. I read pretty much all of the trip advisor reviews and had some good communication with Kanishka before we arrived so I felt sure I had booked a quality property with great service. Disappointingly, I was wrong.
Upon first impressions - the villas looked amazing. But look a little closer and there were rips in the curtains, the soft furnishings in the bedrooms were tired and need replacing, the lounge was filthy, the rug was even worse and the cleanliness of the kitchen was below standard. There were exposed wires where power points were supposed to be and the power points that were there were loose and did not support a phone charger.
There was a rat in out room and the flimsy cage with a piece of bacon placed to catch the rodent did not work, surprisingly, so everyday there were droppings scattered all over our bed. It didn't matter how much we complained about this, nothing was done.
The pool was cold and not much sun shine through to warm it up.
The upstairs bedroom where our children slept was actually totally separate to our bedroom which was located as an exterior and separate quarter - much different to how it was described in emails when I expressed concern about kids upstairs and parents downstairs.
The rooms were tidied each day - I'd barely say they were cleaned and the towels replaced but they were grey and threadbare. I'm not sure the sheets were changed often. Breakfast was good the first day but after a while it grew tired. It was a hassle having to book your times lot to have it delivered - they can only do one breakfast in each slot.
The Mosquitos were unbearable and all the spraying and mozzie bombs in the world don't seem to help. The outdoor bathrooms seemed to be a haven for them and the window openings over the stairs were unable to be closed to keep the mozzies out.
We requested a babysitter which was supposedly booked and endorsed by the hotel - is consisted of the receptionist ringing around her friends then friends of friends until she found someone, who as it turned out hadn't babysat for Kanishka before. I liked her and felt I could trust her and she was fine but this is hardly reassuring if the establishment does not know these babysitters. The reception staff are obliging but the staff here lack the finesse of other establishments in the area. This is our 3rd trip and we won't book anything 'boutique' again. The language barrier was still an issue for many of the staff and management here would do well to work on polishing their hospitality skills.
Kanishka is in a great location, within walking distance to the beach and shopping strips but unfortunately for us - it was really disappointing.",Kanishka Villas
402,A touch of Bali!,40,November 2013,"Booked a cheap holiday here through an online shopping site for five nights in a two bedroom villa with a pool.
I was surprised how quiet it was.
The facilities are nice, if a little dated and in need of some TLC, however; this is Bali! And by looking around here (and comparing similar South east Asian countries, this is pretty much what you could expect).
The staff are excellent, always saying hello and always eager to help.
Mosquitos were not an issue as they sprayed and coiled each night.
Wi-Fi internet was slow and during a down pour, dropped out but overall was adequate, there are heaps of nearby options at the many restaurants anyway.
The pool in the villa was pretty cold (not heated), but achieved the purpose of cooling us down when needed.
Beds are king size, firm, but comfy and we bought our own pillows, which was good as the ones here were far too big and hard for us anyway.
If your in need of the tick items of:
Quiet, cheap, private, private pool, service, comfortable, clean, and in Seminyak, then this hits the spot.",Kanishka Villas
403,Outstanding,50,November 2013,"I'm actually still at kanishka and not due to leave until Monday but could not wait until we left to say how magical this place is.

I have never encountered such wonderful staff. The villa itself is amazing, the pictures do not do it justice, the location could not be better.

We are just in the door from a magical night at Ku De Ta but my heart absolutely stopped when we walked into our bedroom at Kanishka just now. The rest of the night pales in comparison!

Our beautiful and humble room attendants left a beautiful little handwoven finger paper doll on our bed (as I can only imagine is a gift for the very small tip we gave them earlier today) when they were here earlier to turn down our bed and set our mosquito coils.

We have encountered such wonderful service here and to come home to small gestures like this brings a year to my eye.

Bali I heart you, but kanishka staff I heart you more x x",Kanishka Villas
404,Kanishka One Bedroom Pool Villa,50,October 2013,"This is the most amazing place I have stayed at.
My partner and I purchased this deal off scoopon. Judging by the photos the place looked pretty nice but we didn't expect too much. When arriving at our Villa we were given welcome drinks and the staff were lovely however we still didn't expect much, we definitely expected to be disappointed judging by the small reception and the photos featured on the internet. When our villa door was opened we were both shocked, it was AMAZING. The photos do this place no justice. It was like a dream we spent the next two days saying ""I cant believe this place, it is so much better than what we expected"". This is by far the best place I have stayed at. If these villas were located in Melbourne the price would be unaffordable. The staff are lovely and always helpful. Whenever we called they would arrive in such a pleasant manner. The furniture is so modern! There are two flat screen televisions in the villa one on the decking near the pool and the other in the bedroom. The pool was great, we did not need to visit the beach at all. The shops are near by and everything in Semiyak is walking distance, We even walked to Legian and Kuta one day. There were lots of mosquitos during the night especially in the toilet and bathroom area as there is a sun flap opening in the roof which isn't closed. I freaked out! However the staff come at around 8:00 every night and leave coils as well as spray the room. We are happy to say we did not get one mosquito bite!

Overall it was an amazing experience. Even our tour guide was shocked with how amazing it was inside and brought his kids over one day!
We will definitely be back!!!",Kanishka Villas
405,beautiful private jacuzzi villa...Great location...,50,October 2013,this was my partner and I first time in Bali and ALL the staff were lovely telling us where to go and where not to so helpful anything we needed they assisted any way possible they organised our Bali Adventure trip for us without expecting anything in return such a nice surprise. The room itself was beautiful CLEAN and cosy. We were close to all that we needed within walking distant and if you need to travel the lovely staff know all the right drivers.,Kanishka Villas
406,A great escape,40,October 2013,"We recently had a week at Kanishka - myself, and my parents. We've visited Bali many times, as we love everything about it and this trip was more about a relaxing time away than doing too many things. We stayed 7 nights. Were greeted at the airport by the very friendly Artur (even after our delay of nearly 2 hours in immigration!) He patiently had waited for us to drive us to the villa.

Overall the experience was great. We were welcomed at almost midnight with a local mocktail (delicious!) and taken to our villa. The villas were clean, relatively modern and quiet. We encountered a bush rat on our second evening in the bedroom, however, the staff at Kanishka were straight onto it, very apologetic, offered to move us, which we did + caught the rat.

The housekeeping staff were very attentive, cleaning up quickly each day after meals.
The location was perfect for us. Jalan Seminyak has become rather a busy spot, so we wanted to be out of the hussle a little - we could still easily walk to the main 'Eat Street' if we needed.",Kanishka Villas
407,It was just ok...,30,September 2013,"First off the Jacuzzi villa that we stayed in was gorgeous. I loved the set up of the villa and the furniture was elegant. Quality I am rating a 4 because though the villa was modern, we met a couple while dicing and visited their villa which was enormous with a pool and very spacious bedrooms and wonderful bath room for only $20 more a night then what we pay for no bath tub and no pool and 1/4 the size. In addition the house keeping kept turning off the AC when we left in the morning and we would come back after a long day in the heat wither diving or roaming around to sit in a hot room for an hour while it cools off. Condition and maintenance of the villas I rate a 3, due to the sliding doors to the bath room were not installed properly and kept rubbing up on each other causing the door to stop inches from being closed. We had to pull back on one door to close the doors completely. We notified staff but they seem to not have cared much. Cleanliness of our room up keep was mediocre at best. Seemed as if they came to make the bed and just tidy up at the most. Also our mini bar was emptied of the beer on our first night stay and we continued to stay an additional 7 nights and they only came to refill the mini bar once. I know I could have rang them but I feel with this nightly rate we should not have to. Comfort of the room was a 3 because that bed was a rock. I do not mind semi firm mattresses but that bed was like sleeping on a piece of plywood. I feel they could have added a memory foam topper to make them seem some what comfortable. Also the room was circled all the way around the entrance/exit sliding doors and huge window with large dark curtains. Unfortunately not everything was thought of when designing the villas. There were no curtains covering the sliding doors to the naturally lit bathroom that would shine much light in by 5am. Not something that we enjoy when we would 6 days a week and 12 hour days and go on vacation dreaming of sleeping in. We were woken unpleasantly every morning by 5am from the light shining through straight into our faces. Convenience of location was absolutely perfect for us because it was close to a delicious Taco Beach and Italian restaurant across the way. Also down the street is a Bali Deli and Pharmacy along with many atm's close by. And just a few minutes down the way is lots of shopping. Overall I would give Kanishka average at most.",Kanishka Villas
408,Gorgeous villa,50,October 2013,"Kanishka Villa's are just beautiful, very comfortable, lovely and friendly staff. Always greet you with a smile! My friend and I stayed 6 nights and would definitely go back! Great shopping, heaps of great food close by. Thanks for a fantastic experience.",Kanishka Villas
409,"Great Villa, nice service, strategic location",50,October 2013,"It was a great place to stay, we stayed for 2N and already missed the place. The service was great, the hotel picked us up on time at the airport, the driver was very polite as he always smile while answering every question that I asked. At the arrival at the villa, we offered a welcome drink, well some kind traditional drink (forgot to ask what it was), kinda sour but it was very refreshing. After that we were delivered to our room and we were surprised by it, it looked exactly like in the internet, not even less from my expectation (kinda rare to have what-you-see-is-what-you-get from internet these day)
The pool was so beautiful though you need the room service clean it everyday otherwise the pool get a little dirty due to the falling leaves and debris.
The bed was so comfy, the bathroom is great with concept of open bathroom.
The living room was extraordinary spacious and nice, combined with kitchen set (complete with the utensils).
The second day, we got our welcome massage. It was great, well kinda embarrassing if you are not used to be massaged naked.
The villa also offered free shuttle around seminyak area, it was very convenient. It was a great villa. The last day, we were offered late check out which was very good but due to the flight schedule, we have to declined it.
Thank's Kanishka, looking forward to stay again.",Kanishka Villas
410,Nice but noisy,30,October 2013,"Ok well let's be honest here....the villas are nice but dated. Needs a little tlc to be luxury. We stayed in villa 10.. Two rooms...1 up and one down across the pool.
We arrived really late..after 11pm as it took us over an hour to clear through visa payment, Immigration and bag X-rays. They picked us up from the airport and check in was fine.
However..be aware.. On the same driveway as the villas but the other side are some different villas owned by the same people..and on the night we arrived they had a loud party directly opposite us till 4am. The villas are not sound proof at all because both bathrooms are open air, which is fine in the daytime but you can hear everything other people do and say. They are built next to each other with no space between so noise is a major issue.
It's not convenient to the beach..it's at least a 15 minute walk or they will drop you from the hotel but not pick you up.. It's only close to restaurants and up market shops. The Bali deli was good for food though and we loved jeramis restaurant across the road.
We did have other minor issues like power blackouts, water blackouts, the internet was free but pretty poor..these were all only small things. The breakfasts were pretty average...mostly cold and the toast was like they made it hours ago..don't know where the others get delicious from!!!
But the major issue we had was with the rats. We had two sleepless nights with a rat running around our bedroom...I saw it. They set a trap but it was too smart for that. Then we had a small mouse or rat living in the surround sound. We did get that in a trap but then when we came in the room it just bolted out and then it was too smart for a trap! The staff were pretty unfazed so I guess it's a usual thing...but ( and I love animals...had mice as pets) it was not good!
Look, we moved hotel and went to risata in tuban,,,,sooo much better. Lovely pool, rooms very basic but great location and there is sun on the pool. Another thing about kanishka is that there is only a bit of sun on the villa pool from 9 till 11 so you can't really sun bake, plus the pool is freezing!!
However the people who work here are exceptional and so keen to assist in any way possible. And they do have 24 hour reception so when they started playing music at 4am at the villa across the driveway, the security did get them to turn it off.
Would I stay again?? No and mainly cause of the location and noise..but it is nice just not for us.",Kanishka Villas
411,Great villa,40,September 2013,"We stayed for 3 nights in a one bedroom pool villa with a hotel voucher. The pool villa is quite spacious with nice architecture/interior design. The small pool is great but the water temperature is quite cold. The staffs are friendly and helpful. We have cakes delivered every evening. The location is great, close/within walking distance to shops & restaurants. However, there are some that need improvements, such as: quite a lot of mosquitoes, and install more lighting along the pathway between bedroom and living/kitchen area (quite dark when night time). Overall we are happy with the villa and services...",Kanishka Villas
412,Amazing,50,September 2013,"Nice room architecture, homey interior design, cozy, love the swimming pool especially on a hot day, large bathroom, great service, classic bed, only a few minutes walk to Warung Made and you can eat a lot of balinese delicacies.. worth the money",Kanishka Villas
413,Nice villa with spacious room,40,September 2013,"We booked the Kanishka for 1N2D with a hotel voucher, when we checked-in we got a room upgrade for the pool villa. The villa is very spacious, with a private pool, kitchen, dining area and living room. There is a second bedroom on the 2nd floor.

The location is very strategic in the middle of Seminyak, within walkable distance to the cafes/restaurants in Seminyak. Kanishka also has free shuttle service around Seminyak.

We are happy with the overall service and villa. However, there are some areas in the villa that need refurbishment and there are mosquitoes around the villa, since it is surrounded by natural greenery.",Kanishka Villas
414,Charming Villa,40,September 2013,"We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa for 5 nights, Villa 18.
This villa was everything it boasted to be. Great little pool, lovely ambience in living area. Great Bedroom and Bathroom. Delicious cooked breakfasts. Well located in Jalan Kunti, so you are close to the shops and restaurants ( but beach is a good 15 min walk, we rented a motorbike so easy access to everything).Had a fabulous massage in the room.
For my birthday my husband organised a surprise, 2 hour horse-ride at a place in Perenenan...a highlight of my trip! The lady at front desk organised everything for him as a big surprise to me. Our butler was wonderful and had a cake delivered to my room.

I felt safe in the Villa and it was nice to have somewhere quiet to relax.
I stayed in a 1 bedroom Jecuzzi and would go back in a heart beat.

Thank you, hope to see you soon.",Kanishka Villas
418,"Good location, but that's all",30,September 2013,"This hotel is well located - that's good. The villas themselves are attractive - that's good too. BUT the cleanliness was much below our expectation - that is very bad. The towels were extremely old and dirty every time they change them. The smell in the bathroom was like sewage. Add to this smell the heat (the bathroom was outside) and you are not able to spend any time there. And finally we asked the receptionist to mail our 10 postcards one evening, but the next morning they delivered them back to us. After the 2nd attempt they apologized and said they would mail them immediately. A month later nobody received our postcards. Did the hotel thrown them away? Who knows, but we would not recommend to stay there.",Kanishka Villas
419,WOW!!! Awesome Villa,50,September 2013,"We're first time stayed in Kanishka Villas, but 3 words can define :
1. Great Location (because very close to shops and famous restaurants)
Many shops and restaurants surroundings villas like warung italia, made's warung, Roxy, etc.
All can reached by walking.
2. Huge Villa (we stayed at 2 bedroom pool villa during our trip at Bali for 3 nights)
First we come they are put us on the jacuzzi bedroom villa whereas we booked for 1 bedroom pool villa. Due to my husband wants to swim, so I stickler for get our pool's villa. But finally allowed by staff to move to the our pool's villa. And you know what???? YEAH !!! JACKPOT!!! We're stayed in 2 bedroom pool villa which has a sliding door glass and very huge villa. We down with excitement and hearty laugh (very very happy). The room was nicely and cozy. But the only one thing we don't like is the mozzies are everywhere.
3. Friendly and Deftly Staff (They are very nice person always smile and greet all guests)
The staffs very helpful during we stayed at kasishka villas. They are always on time of the breakfast that we ordered last night, but the bfast was ""OK"" coz there was not many variation for the food. In the afternoon always coming and leaving little homemade cake for afternoon tea even though we were not in the villa. And at 7 PM the staffs coming for put mosquito coils in the living room, pool, and toilet in the bedroom.

Overall this villas is highly recommend to stayed and we will be back soon!!! Hopefully

Tips : you must prepare mosquito spray aerosols for your body such as ""OFF"" maybe u can get it in drugstore.",Kanishka Villas
420,Loved the suite and the service,50,September 2013,"We stayed in the 1 Bedroom Jacuzzi Suite Villa for 3 nights. The room itself was nicely built with a sturdy bed and beautiful bathroom. It has an outdoor feel to the bathroom but it's kind of enclosed so we weren't too worried about the mosquitoes.

The staff here are so friendly! Always welcoming us with a smile, coming in and leaving little treats (homemade cake) and leaving mosquito coils outside. They were so accommodating, even providing breakfast at 6:30am as we had a scuba tour at 7:00am when breakfast usually starts at 7:00am. The shuttle service was great, taking us to nice places (must try Sardine Restaurant).

Location was great, walking distance to shops and nice restaurants (Made's Warung is closeby and Wahaha Ribs was walking distance).

I stupidly got ripped off by a money exchange across the road (beware), and lost about $100 AUD. I went to reception and asked if there was anything we can do, and she spoke to the driver who went back to the dodgy money exchange place with my partner to tell them we know we were short changed 1000 000 RP. When he first went there, the man wasn't there.. So we tried again 15 minutes later and they got my money back for me after speaking to the dodgy money exchange!! Was so happy after!!

Loved the room and personalised service here! We will be back!",Kanishka Villas
421,Lovely,40,September 2013,"We stayed at Kanishka for 5 nights - it was lovely - great location - very close to shops and most restaurants. The free shuttle they have for guests was fabulous - the only thing is you must book it early or you will miss out.

The only thing we did not like was the mozzies - they were everywhere - you need a very big can of Aeroguard - the pool in the middle of the apartment was amazing - the private breakfast was 'ok' there was not really a lot of variation to the food you could get - the staff were lovely and helpful - the cleanliness of the room was average and we didn't really think they were cleaning the villa thoroughly every day - overall would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again.",Kanishka Villas
422,Awesome villas,50,September 2013,"We staying at the 2bedroom villas during our trip at bali
The hotel is nice but i think it need to refurnish again
The staffs is friendly and helpful
Thanks for the birthday cake for my mum
Dun really enjoy the 10mins massage prefer to pay for 1hrs if the price is good",Kanishka Villas
423,Good and Location,40,December 2012,"We stayed here in Dec 2010?. Good location and surrounded by nearby restaurants within walking distance.

Units are generous size with private pool. Open air living room but this means that if your next door guests are the noisy bit then it can ruin your evening, as what happened during our stay next door unit played very loud heavy metal rock music going past 10pm till the management I think turns the power off the main to shut them up.

Other than that, the ceiling fan was wobbly and the management sent housekeeping to check and can't find any way to make it less wobbly. They said shouldn't fall down but if we're worried they gave us a pedestal fan to use. The open pool may not be very suitable when small kids are around as constant supervision is a must. Best for families with older kids not toddlers.

Overall good villa units if you like open air but just mindful during high season (eg schoolies) it can be a bit of a lucky draw with whom you're neighbouring with.",Kanishka Villas
424,Villa Bliss in Seminyak,40,August 2013,"We stayed at Kanishka Villas in August 2013 and booked it via Expedia. We booked a one bedroom villa with private pool and it was absolutely beautiful to step into (ended up staying in a 2 bedroom villa, but they just locked up the top floor). The walk in the front door goes into the kitchen adjoined onto the dining room and loungeroom- all very spacious and beautifully furnished. Then a step out of the lounge onto the deck with your own private pool and lounges- just gorgeous. Across from the pool was the bedroom with it's own outside bathroom. Both bedroom and bathroom beautiful as well.
The staff were excellent at Kanishka- always ready to help and very courteous. The breakfast cooked and brought to your villa every morning was always good, tasty and brought with a smile.
The location of Kanishka is great, just a short walk to the main street Jalan Raya Seminyak for all the boutique shopping. The beach isn't too close, but easy to walk to (15-20 mins) or rent a scooter.
The only thing to report would be staying in Villa 10 there wasn't much sun near the pool, it was pretty limited.
But we loved Kanishka villas so much we booked again for a second time and stayed in Villa 13-- and this villa had LOTS of sun next to the pool. And was just as beautiful.
Would highly recommend Kanishka- there are many villas to choose from in Seminyak, all with their own positives- but we were happy with this choice!",Kanishka Villas
425,Perfect place for my Family Holiday :),50,September 2013,"This is our first time at Kanishka Villas Bali and I recommended Kanishka is wonderful place for take a rest. The staff is so friendly and nice. You can expect a good service at Kanishka as compared to other hotel at Bali. It's so near with Kuta & Legian, you can walk to there or rent some motorcycle. We will come here again maybe for a longer time :)
Thank you so much Kanishka. and thank you too for your offer to Gending Kedis Villa at Jimbaran :) this is a amazing villa at Jimbaran. At last this is really perfect holiday for my family :)",Kanishka Villas
426,Beautiful villas in a convenient location,40,August 2013,"Just checked out of Kanishka after spending a week there with my husband.
The villas are beautiful and spacious and although many people have commented the pools do not get enough sun, this was not the case for us.
Breakfast was delivered at our requested time every morning and staff were very friendly as you expect from all hotel/ villa staff in Bali.
The bonus here is it is only a short walk to great shopping, Bali Deli and Chill Reflexology is right next door.
We would certainly come here again if we found a good deal.",Kanishka Villas
427,A litte piece of Heaven,40,August 2013,The villa was extremely comfortable and well presented. It would be nice to be able to block off lounge area from mosquitoes though. The staff were all lovely and the food was reasonable. There was an issue with the Wi-Fi when we were there which was frustrating when trying to look up tours and restaurants. Hopefully the get that fixed. Other than that is was a very pleasant stay at Kanishka in a great location in Seminyak. I recommend it to people.,Kanishka Villas
428,Great Location,50,August 2013,"We stayed with friends for 7 nights at Kanishka to celebrate a ""significant"" birthday, and can thoroughly recommend it.
Beautiful setting, wonderful staff, comfortable beds. Serviced every day, with a traditional sweet ""treat"" each evening hand-delivered by two delightful staff members. The pool is a bit cool as not a lot of sun on it, but after a day walking around in the heat it was a welcome cool-down.
Really close to everything in Seminyak - shopping, restaurants, and a pleasant walk to the
beach. The amazing Bali Deli is just down the road if you want some goodies.
When one of our friends became very ill and had to be hospitalised, the caring and
kindness displayed by Nyoman and his staff was wonderful and so much appreciated.
We'd return again in an instant. Thank you!",Kanishka Villas
429,Great Holiday,40,August 2013,"My family and I when to celebrate my 60th birthday and we had a ball we had 2 villas next to each other we had such a great time in the serenity and privacy of our villas.
having the pool in our own villa the great my husband and the grandchildren enjoyed their daily swim and play,
the villas where cleaned daily and the staff at Kanshka where very friendly and helpful no matter what we asked they delivered
the photos do not do the villas justice",Kanishka Villas
430,Good villa for relaxing,40,August 2013,"Villa was comfortable, enjoyed the pool so much. Nice setting of villa and so comforting to sit back in the living room. Anyway, I didnt like the smell of the mosquito repellent. Seems that mosquitos have been serious problem around the area, I found the smelly repellent almost in every room of the entire villa.",Kanishka Villas
431,Great Place,50,August 2013,"Great and excellent place with very nice and warm staff. Swimming pool is very clean but not too big. Only 30 minutes walk to Seminyak beach.
Highly recommended for you that want to get privacy with your couple :) One thing that my wife and I regret that we only stayed for 1 night. I hope my wife and I can stay here again next time.",Kanishka Villas
432,Unforgettable moment on Seminyak.,50,July 2013,"This villa is adorable. Large living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Location is also strategic, near to center of seminyak. Only 10 minutes take motorcycle to seminyak beach. Me and my wife regret that we only stayed 1 night. Swimming pool is good, wifi connection also good. Please put your promo on social discount we like livingsocial or groupon disdus again. We would like to receive your information about this villa. Hopefully we could stay at this villa again with more night.",Kanishka Villas
433,Beautiful villa and great location!,50,August 2013,"We stayed here 5 nights before spending our last week in Nusa Dua (tip: staying in seminyak - or any other place actually - is best to do first if you want to see Nusa Dua as well). The villa was beautiful and very private. The staff was unbelievable as well. Very attentive, kind, and sweet. We had breakfast included with our stay - it did get a bit boring as the menu was small but it was good. You can't beat the location!! Perfect place - very close to all the shops and restaurants. They also will drive you to seminyak beach if you ask them and will pick you up if you give them a time or call. The area is very upbeat - good restaurants, coffee shops, spas and boutiques. And the front desk also recommended to us a driver named ""Made Yoga"" who spoke very good English and showed us all around Bali - and telling us about Bali traditions and people. He's so good we've used him 4 times - very honest, knowledgable, on time, and very affordable.",Kanishka Villas
434,Suzie D,40,August 2013,"My husband & I stayed at the Kanishka Villas for 4 nights, what a lovely place, very helpful & friendly staff, the villas were amazing, bed was a little hard but that was the only downer. We would definitely stay again. Great position with some good shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Thank you for such a great few days.",Kanishka Villas
435,Great Location..Cold Pool..,30,August 2013,"Stayed at Kanishka for 6 nights. This villa is in a good location, not too far from Jalan Raya Seminyak where all the wonderful boutiques are.. Loved this villa.. staff were nice and there is a lot of privacy. Really doesnt matter which villa you get, it's all private.. The only thing about it is the cold pool.. I had read a few reviews about the pool being cold and didnt really pay much attention to this detail BUT it would have been good to have swam in the pool.. there is hardly any sun that gets through.. We didnt actually spend much time in the room so it was OK.. but if you were after a place to chill by the pool and have a dip.. maybe this is not the villa for you.. You definitely will not get a tan....We had asked the staff for another room with sun coming through but they advised us that all the villas have the same issue... BUT that's the ONLY negative thing.. Breakfast was yummy.. The night before you just have to put your order through.. we always left it to the last minute and rang reception about 12am.. oopsie.. but they always delivered it on time.. Every evening they came and lit mosquito coils and small evening snacks..
Lots of wonderful food around, ATMs conveniently located just around the corner.. food wise try the Babi Guling on Sunset Rd - Pak Malen 15mins walk .. and Warung Murah on Double Six Rd (Jalan Arjuna) - 20/30 mins walk.. Also try Biku bit fancier than the 2 mentioned serves indonesian and western.. on Jalan Raya Petitenget.. cant walk here.. unless you really like walking.. My next trip to Bali, I will be looking for a villa that we can actually utilise the pool.. All in all we had a good time here.. lots of space.. great bathroom.. good staff... If you cant decide on a villa as there are so many.. my advice would be for you to try and around the Jalan Raya Seminyak area....",Kanishka Villas
436,Amazing Honeymoon!!!,50,August 2013,"We spent 5 nights at Kanishka for our Honeymoon last week!! We had the time of our lives and would really love to do a huge shout out to Kanishka Villas!! It was everything the pictures portrayed it to be and more!!

The staff were so friendly and helpful, the villa was so clean and comfortable. We would love to return each year for our Anniversary😃

We would definitely recommend Kanishka Villas 😃😃",Kanishka Villas
437,Our home for 3 weeks at Kanishka villas,50,August 2013,"Amazing. Absolutely amazing, beautiful villas, fantastic service, and very friendly staff, they include a driver to take you anywhere you need to go in Seminyak compliments of the Hotel, Breakfast is included and reception helps you at any time of the day for anything you need
I have travelled around the world and this has to be one of the absolute best places iv ever stayed 10 stars and I highly recommend Kanishka villas. Oh and to top it off its located right in the middle of the best shopping district in bali, literally right out the driveway.",Kanishka Villas
438,A nice stop,50,July 2013,"Perfect location, close to shops and restaurants (in walking distance). The room is very Bali traditional decoration. Staff are very friendly and they even prepared a birthday cake for me! Breakfast yummy too.",Kanishka Villas
439,Pleasant Stay,40,July 2013,"Nicely designed and well-sized villas, which could, nevertheless, could do with some maintenance.

The staff were generally very pleasant, friendly and helpful.

Breakfast was yummy!

If you like shopping, the hotel location is excellent, as it is just a few steps away from the main shopping street in Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
440,beautiful villa,40,July 2013,"My husband and I only stayed 1 night at Kanishka Villa just to be close to the airport on our last night of the trip so I didn't experience just a lot of time there, but I'm happy to review on the time we spent.
First, we walked into the one bedroom villa and were blown away at how beautiful and unique it is! The staff was very nice with our check in and with helping us carry our bags, but they are not as friendly as the other 4 hotels we have stayed in Bali.
We called in our breakfast and were told the butler would deliver in 30 minutes. After an hour of no breakfast, I called to check on it, and they said one butler was sick so it's taking longer. It would have been nice to know that in the first place as trips and excursions are always planned, and we need to be on time. Once breakfast came, the butler was very nice and did seem a bit overwhelmed since he was the only one working.
At night the staff came to light mosquito coils in the living room and bathroom which really took a toll on my allergies. However, they were helpful.
The pool was too deep for me to touch the bottom.. I would assume it was at least 7ft or more.
Overall, it really was a nice experience because of the beauty of the place, but the 1 night was plenty for us.",Kanishka Villas
441,THE STAFF ARE FANTASTIC,50,July 2013,"I have just enjoyed 5 nights @ Villa 16 and was delighted with my Villa. Villa 16 is located at the very end of the lane and is one of around 8 - 4 lower level with a pool & 4 above. As the Villas appeared to be full, it was quite noisy on a few occasions, but overall a very pleasant experience. The pool in this Villa did not get the sun, so I missed out on sun-rays - however, a cool dip was most enjoyable after a day out & about. The open plan lounge & dining was fantastic and kept in immaculately clean condition by the daily cleaning staff, of which there were many!! The room-delivered breakfast was perfect and exactly as ordered'. There was no Spa, so massages & facials were done in the Villa, being relaxing and excellent.
The absolute best thing about Kanishka is the staff. The Receptionist spoke exceptional English and she had the best customer service attitude, as did each and every member of the staff. As I left I walked past about a dozen staff and each & everyone thanked me for staying @ Kanishka. Typically, a solo traveller always pays the same as 2 people and as usual, this was the case. However, these Villa's are well situated and very safe, so well recommended for a Bali get-away for the solo traveller.",Kanishka Villas
442,"Wonderful haven, loved the Pool",50,June 2013,"We stayed for a week at Kanishka Villas in June. The lounge/ dining area was spacious and well appointed. The internal pool adjoined the lounge/ dining area with an open roof which was really nice. It was great to come home to this haven and relax by the pool after being out sight seeing or shopping in the nearby area. Service of the room,pool and daily mosquito spraying was good. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful in organising a tour for us,airport transfer and advising local places to shop. Seminyak beach is a 15 min walk or inexpensive taxi ride from the villa. Would stay again!",Kanishka Villas
443,Till we met again,40,July 2013,"We spent 4 nights at Kanishka villas last June 2013 in private jacuzzi for our honeymoon. We had a great time in there. The room was marvelous,and the jacuzzi was awesome. Kanishka's crew were helpful, and friendly. The location also really great, near with cafe and fashion store. Thank you Kanishka, hope we can stay and enjoy your place.. Til we met again...",Kanishka Villas
444,kanishka villa,30,June 2013,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at Kanishka villas this month. The layout of the villas is great, but the pool area hardly received any sun and the water was very cold. We had lots of issues with wifi access and the staff were very helpful, but the problem kept reoccurring. Room servicing was very erratic, one day our room was serviced at 9pm and on another day servicing and the turn down and mosquito spraying was not done at all. I would not stay here again, there are so many other villas in seminyak to choose from.",Kanishka Villas
445,Kanishka villa,50,May 2013,"Thankyou so much for making my stay in Bali a comfortable and enjoyable one. I have stayed in a couple of villas before but the layout and services supplied topped the lot. The location to the main street was far enough for privacy but close enough for a quick stroll. The staff were always friendly and welcoming, nothing too much trouble. I had an issue with the Ipad at one point and the staff went out of their way and drove me round to numerous stores to help rectify the problem, something that a hotel would never do. The villa pool was great with ease of access to the lounge and kitchen area. The breakfast and meals provided were always delicious and hot, again served with a smile. The complimentary massage was great, much needed. I will certainly be bringing the family back to stay, hopefully sooner than later. Thankyou Douglas and please pass my appreciation to your staff.",Kanishka Villas
446,Excellent rooms and pool,40,March 2013,"The two bedroom pool villas at Kanishka Villas in Seminyak are fabulous. The design gives lots of privacy in both bedrooms. The ensuite bathrooms are large and well appointed and the pool is excellent! We loved the open plan living area that has everything you can think of including a drinking water dispenser with boiling, cold and room temperature settings. The villas are serviced twice daily and the pool is also cleaned daily.
The staff are fantastic! Nothing is too much trouble and they are Happy to help with any requests.
Each evening the staff put mosquito coils around the villa and spray the bedrooms which is great.
Kanishka villa is located very conveniently in Seminyak with the Bali Deli just up the road and many restaurants within walking distance.
We have stayed at Kanishka several times and are looking forward to going back in August.",Kanishka Villas
447,IF ITS PEACE & QUIET YOU WANT....DO NOT GO TO KANISHKA!,30,May 2013,"We have stayed at many many villas in Bali, I have to say...I was disappointed with Kanishka. Firstly, the only time the manager spoke to me was when I requested to see him, because of 3 nights continuous noise in the villas next door. Thats unsual, as they normally are first to greet you. Everyday , we had to request 4 pool towels (there were 4 of us in the villa ??), Everyday, we had to request the ""butler"" to clean the kitchen!! Villa not bad..but very little sun gets in..as the only place for sun is above the pool. We stayed there for 2 weeks and normally the staff would know our names..(not that important ,but its the Bali way)..I knew their names , they had no clue who we were. Be warned that if a group of Chinese youngster move in, be ready for a night from hell until 4am...we had 3 of these and the security guard was SLEEPING when I , at 2am went to look for him as I had , had enough by this stage...So if its peace and quiet you want...DO NOT GO TO KANISHKA......location is good...and Bamboo Spa across the road is excellent for a really good price..(the green one) Jenny being the owner...",Kanishka Villas
448,Kanishka Villas,50,April 2013,"During a recent business trip to attend a Trade Show in Bali I had the pleasure to stay at Kanishka Villas.
My Villa was spacious and very well appointed with an open plan kitchen, dining room and lounge area equipped with a top of the range sound system and a large flat screen television.
The Villa also has the luxury of it's own private pool which after a long day of meetings was just the tonic I needed.
I only used one of the two bedrooms available and again they are very comfortable with a large bathroom partially open to the sky above which is a nice feature.
I must also compliment the staff, not one but two butlers who served a full breakfast to my Villa and were always most courteous, attentive and friendly.
Kanishka Villas are extremely well located in the heart of seminyak and just a few minutes walk away from a large selection of restaurants, bars and the nightlife of Seminyak.
I can highly recommend Kanishka Villas and look forward to my next visit when I will most certainly there stay again,
Fraser Bell",Kanishka Villas
449,Great room and private swimming pool,40,May 2013,"The villas are awesome, large living room, complete kitchen facilities, beautiful bedroom and bathroom. The location are great, next to Warung Italia and plenty of spas and salons. Shopping are is also nearby. The massage service in the villa is also superb, even better than other popular spa place. Too bad when we stayed there, the next door villa was under construction so it was rather noisy in daytime. But overall, Kanishka Villas is recommended and I definitely going to stay there again.",Kanishka Villas
450,Kanishka Villas,40,May 2013,"Kanishka Villas were really nice. The pool right in the living room was a spectacular feature. It was nicely located within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Not only was breakfast served in our room, but we had a great massage right in the room as well.

It's not on the beach, but it's only a 20 minute walk or 5 minute drive away.

All in all, it's a super romantic villa to stay in.",Kanishka Villas
451,Awesome,50,April 2013,"This is our second stay at Kanishka Vills. The Villas are in a fantastic location in Seminyak close to Jari Menari (awesome massages), Queens Indian Restaurant. The villas are very well designed, well furnished and kept very clean. We had air port transfers and daily breakfast included which was great.
We would stay there again",Kanishka Villas
452,Fabulous Kanishka Villas,50,March 2013,"We stayed in Villa 14 for 3 nights and we absolutely loved it. It was our first time in Bali and from the moment we arrived the staff could not have done more to make our stay more enjoyable.
From organising our dinner bookings, spa treatments, shuttle service around Seminyak and answering any other questions we had - Kanishka Villa staff were fantastic.
Our villa was gorgeous, the pool was always cold and we were only a short walk to Bali Deli if we needed supplies.
We will definitely be going back to Kanishka Villas. Highly recommend it.",Kanishka Villas
453,What a great place to stay have just booked again.,50,November 2012,"Stayed here the first time we went to Bali after a friend recommended it - WOW & WOW. Friendly staff, great location, retaurants shopping just around the corner & then there is Bali Deli. Have stayed at another villa in Seminyak but doesn't compare. We have just booked our fourth trip for later in the year at Kanishka - we wouldn't stay anywhere else",Kanishka Villas
454,A Rare Escape from Reality,50,March 2013,We stayed at Villa 18 and could not have asked for a more private romantic place to getaway. There was not a thing the staff couldn't do for us even provide a docking system for our Ipod. The rainforest setting with the private pool enabled you to drift off to any place in the world without a care. The breakfast and evening treats brought to a villa were delightful. The location of the villas sets you in a heaven of fine dining in walking distance or the villa would arrange your transport to and from the restaurant. We were fortunate enough to meet the owner and I can say he has managed to tick all the boxes with the villas and his wonderful staff.,Kanishka Villas
455,Breathtaking interior coupled with amazing staff,50,April 2013,"Could not have picked a better location to stay in for my first trip to Bali. Kanishka is conveniently located within walking distance (<20 minutes) to shops, supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacies and even the beach.

The villas are absolutely incredible. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa for 6 nights, and were amazed at the level of service we received from the beautiful staff as well as the quality of the villa. Incredibly spacious inside, our villa had a self contained kitchen as well as a 6 person dining table, lounge room and swimming pool. The pool was cleaned daily as were the rooms. Staff came around each evening to set out citronella candles and spray for mosquitoes.

The bathrooms and lounge room were designed in a way which left them semi-outdoors which was a lovely, romantic touch. Just don't be surprised to see some geckos running around on the walls/ceilings in the lounge room - they're just doing their job (eating mosquitoes) and won't bother you!

Room service prices were cheap for what us Aussies are used to (AU$4 for a Heineken, AU$6-15 for breakfast and mains) and the food quality was quite good. The American Breakfast is an absolute feast, and the Nasi Goreng/Mie Goreng is delicious.

The staff will stop at nothing to see your every beck and call looked after, they are absolutely lovely people. I will not hesitate to recommend Kanishka to my family and friends, both first timers and seasoned veterans alike.",Kanishka Villas
456,Perfect gateway for your honeymoon,50,April 2013,"I went there for my honeymoon, and they make it two words, ""just perfect"". I stayed in Kanishka Villas for 2 nights with my Hubby on Room 10B. While I booked they very helpful, by that time they didn't even knew that I booked for our honeymoon. On day two after they knew it was honeymoon, after long tiring day from many places, when we arrived back to the villa, we got flowers everywhere.. They make it so perfect. And even for the breakfast that they prepared, I love it. All employee are very helpful, friendly, nice, they even pleasantly would like to help us to book the table/RSVP'd for places that we plan to go. And you should try the Spa in Kanishka too, Nice.. The villa is clean, I don't have any words to complain. I do love it. Thank you for the Manager, Mr. Sabana, who very kind to us.. :)",Kanishka Villas

461,"Beautiful and clean, amazing location",50,March 2013,"Stayed at the kanishka in a 2bedroom villa for 2 nights with my husband and another couple they made a flower arrangement for each room as it was our honeymoon and filled the baths with rosé petals every afternoon we would come back to the villa with cut up pieces of cake and our quilt pulled back ready to hop into bed, Nina the lady at the front reception was so helpful and went out of her way help us.
Thank you kanishka villas we would love to come back soon and bring our children to stay at your beautiful villas",Kanishka Villas
462,My Bali escape!,50,March 2013,"Kanishka was a very pleasant surprise. I have been to Bali numerous times and am a bit wary of the increasing congestion and noise of Denpasar. What a relief to arrive at Kanishka! Easy access and travel time from the airport. The villas are situated off the main road, so very quiet. The main shopping streets are only a 3 minute walk, and lots of taxis available. Rented a motorbike from a little shop beside the villa office and with the motorbike, reached the beach and all nearby attractions in Seminyak within 5 minutes cruise!
The villa itself was pure luxury; canopy bed, flatscreen TV, garden style bathroom, with big soaking tub, huge shower, your own pool of course, comfy furnishings and the daily included breakfast brought to your villa and prepared on the table, is something I truly miss, now that I am back to reality... Kanishka is apparently the name of some king, and I felt like a king when I stayed there!",Kanishka Villas
463,Wonderful place !!!,50,February 2013,"If you want a great villa for 2 Kanishka Villas -Bali is the place. Great location in Seminyak, wonderful staff, beautifully appointed villa with private plunge pool, 24hr security & service - yes!! Peaceful, relaxing, private, minute walk to Bali Deli, courteousy transfers around Seminyak - will be back!!",Kanishka Villas
464,"Great service, location and decor",40,February 2013,"No real complaints about this place - the rooms were beatiful, semi-outdoor bathrooms clean and modern along with all appliances and ammeneties. Couldnt get the spa bath to work but that was probably my own fault! Stayed in a new 1 bedroom villa - size is small (one room plus bathroom) but outdoor deck is very large and fit with a spa bath and dining table/chairs for romantic candle lit dinners for two! Staff were very attentive and i would recommend staying here for sure.",Kanishka Villas
465,Overrated and unhelpful,20,January 2013,"We stayed here over the new years period and had what one can only describe a the faulty towers experience. We had read the reviews and it looked great, we had been booked in by our holiday club and were promised by the hotel all the luxuries; Butler, room service, guidance around town, suggestions of what to do.. Sadly none of this lived up to expectations.
When we arrived at Kanishka, we were let in to our room and we realised that the villa only had 3 walls! there was no wall on the bath room or the living room. WHile it looked great, when it rained we were living in a flood zone, it made it incredibly dangerour to walk the gangplank over the pool to the master bed room. The kitchen and living room were to too hot and humid to sit in during the evening and the mozzies were unbelievable.
1. we had a problem with the gas cooker, in which it didn't work and every morning the handyman had to come and spend 20minutes trying to fix it.
2. We ordered room service, it arrived after 5 phone calls to reception 1.5 hours later and most unbelievably not only was it cold but also over cooked.
3. The bathroom flooded, you would sit on the loo with your feet inches deep in water.
4. We asked for the reception to book us for dinner at somewhere nice.. she rang 30minutes before we were about to go to 'said place' to tell us she hadn't booked us anywhere.
5. at 11am on new years day we asked her to book us a taxi for 1230 to go to Kuta approx 5 km away. 1pm we were still waiting she told us there were no taxis... Anyway we left the complex and within 2 mins caught a taxi.
6. Because there were no walls it meant you could hear everyone all the time. On new years it was what i would imagine a war zone sounded liked fireworks and screaming until 5am.
The main reason we found kanishka so dissapointing was that the staff were just generally unhelpfull and they lied about almost everything we ever asked. I don't mind staff bluffing because they don't know the answer but this was different.
Even things like it's a 5 minute walk to the beach.. not at all try 20minutes, through open gutters and back allies.
Over all I would never return with my family. If it wasn't for the fabulous 10 days previous to this it could almost have ruined our holiday.",Kanishka Villas
466,Bliss!,50,January 2013,"Now if you want a villa in Bali look no further... Kanishka is the one! Amazing villas with all modern amenities, private pool and the works. Great location, walking distance to the Seminyak market/bar area (they also have a shuttle service to drop you there). The staff is very friendly and courteous and make sure all your demands are met. Would definitely recommended if traveling with family or friends.",Kanishka Villas
467,Like staying in a Townhouse with a plunge pool,30,December 2012,"Have stayed in quite a few Villas in Seminyak and this was definitely was not one of my favourites.The Villas are built like townhouse's. You can hear what is going on in the Villa's beside you Loud Music, TV's blaring and kids screaming not my ideal 14 night stay. We stayed in a 2 Bedroom, upstairs downstairs, the interior is nicely furnished, the staff are friendly and helpful, location is good. Overall I think it is way overpriced.Especially with The Villas and Jerami across the road at basically the same cost and with large gardens and pavilions in the grounds - The real BalinVilla experience . I would not recommend staying at Kaniska for long stays.",Kanishka Villas
468,Ideal location in Seminyak,40,January 2012,"This review is long overdue. 

Stayed in a 2-storey, 2-bedroom villa. We had a local Indonesian friend who picked us up from the airport hence locating this villa was not a problem at all. Furthermore, my best friend arrived earlier in the afternoon and left the keys at reception, which saved us the hassle of a check in process.

Our villa is only a couple of steps from reception yet it is still private and quiet.      My favourite part of the villa is the open living area - big, comfortable couch, ipod dock, flat screen tv, dining area, fully equipped kitchen, water dispenser for both hot and cold water, fridge, the usual mod cons - you won't want for anything. The couch is most conducive to group gatherings, we spent most of the time in the living area, watching tv, having chats, munching on delicious treats from Bali Deli, which I was happy to discover is within 5 minutes walking distance from our villa. Wifi however is limited to 2 devices which was frustrating as there were four of us. 

Free shuttle within Seminyak is offered by Kanishka but we have never used it as our local friend ferried us around in his car. Parking at Kanishka was no problem at all, there's plenty of space. 

To my pleasant surprise, I could actually walk to my favourite spa - Espace, which is on Jl Raya Basangkasa, a main strip of shops and restaurants. It took only 10 minutes each way and I was never late for appointments every single day (traffic can be terrible along this road). 

Breakfast is served every morning at the villa. You do need to inform the staff of your breakfast preference the night before.  A menu is given in the room. I'd usually opt for Indonesian as they are more tasty. The breakfast is not cooked in the villa but arrived stacked up on plates in a covered food basket. Very interesting to watch as they are served. Every evening there's also interesting kueh or cake for us to find on the dining table. We had banana fritters on our last night but nothing fantastic though.

The villa's private pool is a disappointment as it is in the shade most of the time. I'm not sure if it's due to the villa design or the foliage. We didn't get much sun until the day we were due to leave Bali.

My bedroom, on the ground floor overlooking the pool, is beautiful. The bed has mosquito netting over it and the dim lighting makes the bedroom more romantic, most suitable for couples. My best friend was off for a diving trip very early the next day so she opted to stay the night at another friend's villa in order to share the transport to the diving site. The other 2 friends went for a drive to Ubud and will be back after dinner. So that left me home alone. As night descended, the quiet villa had an eerie feel to it and I started feeling alone and a little uneasy. The dim lighting in the bedroom coupled with the picture on the wall of a Balinese barong with big piercing eyes and long fangs weren't helping. The bathroom lighting is also a little dim, the sink area is partially open air and overlooks the pool which looks dark especially where foliage surrounds it. There is actually a small waterfall where the pool is and we would turn off the switch at night as it can get noisy. To get rid of my feelings of uneasiness, I turned the waterfall on, switched on the tv in the living room and stayed glued on the couch until my friends were home. Little did I know that the friend staying in the room upstairs shared my sentiments of eerieness while showering in the outdoor shower. I know all this may sound silly but we can't help it - we Asians are a superstitious lot ! 

One issue I wish to bring up is the cleaning staff who don't knock before entering. I was going for a shower when I saw a group of 4-5 staff entering the main door. This door faces the pool and the pool is located between the door and the outdoor bathroom (above the sink is partially open) which means they could see me - in my birthday suit ! I was horrified and ducked my head down and sat on the toilet bowl to avoid being noticed. The bamboo trees planted next to the pool provided little modesty. Later on as they were leaving the villa, they saw me brush my teeth at the sink in the bathroom, shouted their thanks and waved goodbye before closing the door. After a few minutes, there was a knock at the door and I opened it to see the same staff standing there. One of them left behind some keys upstairs and wanted to pick them up. What puzzled me was the whole lot of them went inside the villa which made me nervous all over again as I was all alone. Why can't they all wait outside the villa and get one fellow to go upstairs to get the keys? Never have I felt so insecure in my hotel room before. To be fair, the staff are lovely and very friendly but that was just plain scary.

I'm not sure if I'll return to Kanishka Villas as there are so many villas out there and I do like to stay at a variety of hotels for comparison. The location is hard to beat though and is most ideal for spa, shopping and dining.",Kanishka Villas
469,Beautiful Kanishka,50,October 2012,"The moment we walked in we were in heaven. The staff were very friendly and professional and couldnt do enough for us. The villas were absolutely beautiful and loved the outside shower. The location was brilliant and so much to pick from whether it be restuarants or shopping etc. All we wanted on this trip was to relax and have no plans and that is what we got. Loved having the private pool and coming home of an evening to find the staff have set up mosquito nets and mossie coils, felt spoilt! (If anything they need to light more mossie coils), I have been recommending to other friends to try KanishkaThe as I am sure they will love their stay as much as we did.",Kanishka Villas
470,Peaceful Haven,40,November 2012,"Kanishka Villas: Our 1st visit to Bali, and Kanishka Villas provided personalized service and a ever smiling hospitality.
START: I have to admit that booking this property online, made me very skeptical, as it stated that there in no in-house restaurant and no lobby or huge reception area. But since the time we arrived at the airport, they took Great care.. with car transfers to everything being ready for us during checkin.. I was impressed..

ROOM: Only to later know that it was just a start to a great 4 day holiday.. Great rooms.. I mean great is an understatement. Room was nice with all basic amenities one can ask for.. the living area was also great.. with full kitchen equipments. and they also provide filtered Water cans in each villa, so you have unlimited drinking water.. great touch..
Also there are Villas with Closed Living Area and some with Open.. We were big group so we got a taste of both.. i personally prefer Closed Living area with Air Con..
Also Note that the pictures shown on the website is real.. the rooms in fact are better than the pictures online.. (which is a rare thing in Bali).

POOL: Clean pool with a running fountain.. It was great fun using this pool.. they clean it every morning.. and it was nice and cosy for even a late night dip.. Pool was bigger that i imagined.. We were 6 friends enjoying the pool together.. Size is good. also the wooden deck and loungers are clean and comfy.

FOOD: Though the property doesn't have a restaurant, still they provide Great Breakfast. We were vegetarians and we still had a handsome meal every morning.. You fix a time and they will come a layout your BF. Great service.. you feel like at home..

STAFF: Ever smiling an helping staff.. they helped us not only with food, but also with other small demands by us and also helped us to travel and gave a know-how of surroundings.

LOCATION: The location of this Villa is in center, but at the same time its in a narrow lane, so you can have your quite time as well. Just 2-5 mins walk out of the Villa area and you have restaurants and shops all around. Deli Bali - Supermart/grocery/bakery is 5 mins walking and once can buy anything one wants. Location is just perfect.. 10 mins Bike ride to Seminyak Square.. and 15mins Bike ride to Kuta area.. Beach is also 10 mins away.. we even walked to the beach.. took us 20 mins.. strolling by the restaurants and shops..
there is also Prana Spa at walking distance..
Great Location..

OVERALL: I think it was a great first visit to Bali.. @ Kanishka Villas we had a Great stay..",Kanishka Villas
471,"Nice and quite, but bad for mosquito's",40,November 2012,"Stayed in this villa for 6 days. Hotel staff are very friendly and will accommodation your every need. As for the villa... what you see in the pictures is what you get.. I was a little disappointed there was no rice cooker in the kitchen area. Being a chef i did most of my own cooking and found the utensils a little limited. Night time you need to be in you bed room as the mosquito's come out in full force.. Even after the hotel staff do there nightly spray and light up the insect repellent sticks, they are still very bad. Same goes for the bath room area.
I would stay at this establishment again.. no problem. I would just come a little more prepared.",Kanishka Villas
472,Fantastic oasis in the middle of the action,50,October 2012,"My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in Oct. The villa is centrally located close to restaurants and the Bali Deli grocery store. The beach is about a 20 min walk or a 5min shuttle away. The staff a Kanishka are really friendly and helpful. They offer a free shuttle service any time any where. The villa itself is very modern fully self contained (but you can order room service) and has plenty of space. We were concerned about the enclosed style of the villa when booking but it is huge and loved every minute of it. All villas are 2 bedroom, when you book a 1 bedroom villa they just close off one bedroom. The only minor downside are the mozzies. The hotel staff spray daily but pack the repellant.",Kanishka Villas
473,Beautiful place and great service,50,July 2012,When the door opened and we walked in to see a pool and waterfall almost in the living room our jaws dropped. The villa was great. There was plenty of room and fully equipped. The partially outdoor shower and bathrooms were great and the two king size poster beds very comfortable. The staff came in each night and set up mozzie coils and undid all the bed curtains so we had a cosy mozzie free 'tent'. They also left a plate of cake each night. All facilities and instant hot and ice water for hot and cold drinks. Booking in was easy and although arriving early we were settled in no time. The location was great with Bali deli and plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. Once in the villa area it was like being in another world. We will definitely stay there again.,Kanishka Villas
474,most luxurious villa,50,May 2012,"the website photos don't lie! it really is that beautiful, modern, and sleek. the layout, service, location, and decor really made me want to move in permanently. I absolutely love the private pool. it's big enough for lap swimming but so stylish in the middle of the unit. each villa has a kitchen with fridge and stove. I wish they had a washer/dryer too. other than that, there's nothing I would change. walk to the fun stores of Seminyak. lots of nearby restaurants and shops. staff was exceptional. they pick up the phone before the first ring ends and show up at the door almost immediately when needed. they sprayed the room for mosquitoes every evening before we return. you select your breakfast and they deliver it to your room and set up the full spread on the villa dining table. very private and romantic.",Kanishka Villas
475,"Very friendly place,",50,July 2012,"Just got back after a 6 night stay at Kanishka Villa #12. Excellent location with extremely friendly and helpful staff .Walking distance to Bali Deli, good restaurants , SPAs and massage places including Jari Menari. Mosquitoes were problem but the mozzie coils did the job well to keep them away. The rooms were very comfortable and everything was in working order including WiFi internet services (but seemed to be slow throughout Bali).Great place to stay in Seminyak with family.",Kanishka Villas
476,Quiet location with every convenience in the 'Toorak' end of Seminyak.,50,June 2012,"Peaceful easy feelings after a week here. It's a bit of a hike to the beach if you are into that but the streets of Bali are always interesting. Easy taxi ride to shopping in Kuta but negotiate the fee before you get in. No more than 100kIRP. Lots of excellent restaurants for breakfast, lunch, & dinner with a range of cuisines within a few minutes of the villas. Super market just 5 mins walk. But the best thing about Bali is always the people.",Kanishka Villas
477,A memorable stay at Kanishka Villas Seminyak,50,May 2012,"We had a 6 day 5 night stay at Kanishka Villas, Villa 11. Upon arrival we were greeted by extremely friendly staff. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that there's wifi within the villa itself (we initially read it was only available at the reception area). Although there were some wifi connectivity problems, the onsite technician rectified the problem immediately, surpassing our expectations! The honeymoon suite was well decorated. Dine-in breakfast was excellent in terms of quality and service (we chose the Halal American Breakfast). More sausages would be better. Nice ensuite bathroom. The shower head at the bathtub made showering really convenient if you decide not to use the outdoor shower. Mosquitos were aplenty but no problem for us as staff diligently lit up the mosquito coils. Noise level was ok, neither too noisy nor too quiet. Overall it was a wonderful and pleasant experience. Will definitely return!",Kanishka Villas
478,Amazing stay at Kanishka.,50,May 2012,"Just got home from spending 6 nights at Kanishka.
The Villa was just gorgeous. So comfortable and relaxing.
The rooms are done every day and to perfection.
Beds are turned down every night and coils lit throughout the villa.
We had not 1 complaint with this place and will definitely return again. Have a son already booked and my daughter booking for November. Just wish we were still there.
The staff were amazing. All of them and will go out of their way to help .
They are very polite and happy. Security is good too.
Thankyou Kanishka for our most wonderful stay.

479,luxurious villa great value,50,May 2012,Stayed at Kanishka for three nights and it was a slice of heaven. Clean and very comfortable in a great location.,Kanishka Villas
480,"Great location, but needs property maintenance and freshened up.",30,May 2012,"We hired 3 villas. No microwaves (needed this as had 2 kids in group), stove not working, no gas even if stove was working in one of the villas, mildew everywhere, toilet leaking even after being fixed (all 3 villas). Amazing staff! Very hard working, courteous and cant do enough. The best location if you want to be in the heart of the action.",Kanishka Villas
481,Luxurious stay with lots close by,40,April 2012,"Four of us shared a Villa for the last few days of our stay in Bali. We were greatly relieved to see that not only were the bedrooms aircnditioned, but so was the main lounge/living/kitchen area. (Often in Bali, these areas are not airconditioned and are also open to mossies etc). We had our own private pool which was refreshingly cool after the lukewarm pools in other hotels. Spring Water is supplied free of charge so you don't need to wander to the shops to pick it up.

We had the master bedroom upstairs which was enormous with it's own sitting area and TV. The 2nd bedroom is also a decent size and has TV too. Both bathrooms are 'open air' which gives a lovely tropical feel but make sure you close the door to the bedroom at dusk otherwise the mossies will invade! (Mossie coils are provided)

Staff, housekeeping etc were lovely and very accomodating. There is a shuttle available that can take you anywhere in the area so make sure you pre-book and get in ahead of others. We booked it to take us to 'W' in Seminyak one night and to the airport on another evening. Villas are close by to shops, restuarants etc and only a very cheap taxi ride to 'Eat St' in central Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
482,A luxurious villa in Seminyak,40,March 2012,We had wonderful service from the staff when it rained and the bathrooms were flooded. No hassle in giving us another villa They supplied free suttle service around Seminyak. It was a wonderful holiday.,Kanishka Villas
483,Very good service but the mosquitoes,40,April 2012,"The staff at Kanishka Villas are wonderful. They offered wonderful service and always with a smile. The staff at Kaniska even help us get our money back when we were cheated by some money changers close by and even sent security to check our roof when we called in about a noise that we heard in the middle of the night. The stay was great and they have beautiful villas especially with the private pool. My only pet peeve was the mosquitoes and other bugs, since villa is pretty open to the elements we were having breakfast with the ants and gekkos and sleeping with the mosquitoes. They gave us complementary bug sprays and incense but it gave us only temporary relief. They should really consider installing mosquito netting to block off the living areas from the outside world. But if you don't mind the bugs the place is a must stay if you visit Bali.",Kanishka Villas
484,Very nice Villa at Seminyak to stay in,40,April 2012,"This Villa is very close to the main street in Seminyak (from Kuta). Very easy walk from the Villa. Also close in the other direction to the airport (less traffic).
The only problem is the mosquitoes (however, they do fog twice a week) This may cause issues if you have asthma but otherwise not a problem. Mosquitoes still in plentiful supply but the dining/lounge is air conditioned.
Very nice Villa for a couple as the rooms are quite separate.",Kanishka Villas
485,Amazing Experience in Seminyak,50,April 2012,"We LOVED Kanishka Villas.. From the beauty of the villa to the extremely kind service, we had such a pleasant experience. Free shuttle service around Seminyak was quite convienent for a quick ride to the beach or restuarants / pool bars - W / Potato Head. The front desk was extremely helpful when making local reservations or if we needed to query things around town, they took it upon themselves to sort it out for us (cabs/ reservations/ random questions).

The villas are exceptionally luxurious, open air living room with a private pool in the middle of our lounge!! Minor detail - the pool gets minimal light between 11-2 and only in certain spots. That was the most of our problem.. Exactly MINOR detail! Both bathrooms were open air, my favourite was the upstairs open air shower - you could take a bath at night and look at the stars! The attendants would come clean everyday, plus came back around dusk to light mosquito coils (which smelled like incense).

The location was brilliant - 2 min walk to great restaurants (tacos/ Japanese/ Italian) 5 min walk to the famous Made Warung (highly reco'ed to eat Balinese cuisinse and see Bali style dancers. Dancers only at dinner on certain days though). Villas are just off the main street in Seminyak, so very close to the shopping, restaurants, and beach (10 min walk - but again can take shuttle).

Breakast was great and delivered on time every day. Food was good - great selection of American and Indonesian style breakfast.. Favourite was pancakes, croissants and watermelon juice! We ordered room service for lunch - BBQ prawn pizza was delicious!

Thanks so much for the amazing experience - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Kanishka Villas
486,Time share week,50,April 2012,"still in the middle of our week @ the Kanishka villas, but so far everything is awesome..
the rooms, the full size fridge is a nice bonus, then pool in the middle is just lovely & the supermarket 5 mins away makes drinks & nibbles easy ... No complaints from us ...",Kanishka Villas
487,One of the best Villas we have stayed at,50,March 2012,"My wife and I just returned from my first vacation after retirement. Kanishka Villas was
recommended to us by a friend from Australia. What a property! We thoroughly enjoyed
ourselves at the 4 bdrm villa with a pool right outside our bdrm door. Everyone at the villa
made us feel so welcome and the service was excellent from the time we arrived until we
departed. Looking forward to another visit in the near future.",Kanishka Villas
488,Good location but too many mozzies for me,30,February 2012,"A great location for restaurants and shopping, not so great if you want to be by the beach. However these villas weren’t right for us.

I had booked this villa over the phone while in Bali as we were finding it hard to find the right type of villa for my partner and three boys under 3. We needed have all our bedrooms in the same building which I asked for over the phone. Unfortunately the request to have this was lost in translation. When we arrived I realised straight away that the villa was not suitable as one room was upstairs in the main building and the other room was across the pool on its own. We stayed here two nights with my partner sleeping with two boys and me in the other room with the baby.

The majority of the villa's are all opened, that is open living area so no air-con and no doors to keep the mozies out, my poor boys were eaten alive. This did not work for us but if you don't mind the open areas the set up is nice. Another thing to note is twice a week they bomb the whole area to kill all the mozzies. They did say it wasn't harmful but when you have kids stuff like this matters.

The pool in the villa we stayed in wasn't that nice compared to other villas we had been too. It was really small and in the shade so the water was freezing!!

Breakfast was not made in the room like other villas but was still very nice. We had a private BBQ included one night and the food was EXCELLENT! The meat was so tender, salads fresh and there was heaps of food.

I did complain about the villa to management as I had asked prior about the rooms all being in the same building so they relocated us to their sister property, Gending Kedis, which was excellent, see this review.

Overall the villa is in a good location, the rooms were mostly clean, I did move the beds and the dust underneath was horrible, but I don't expect anything else really....The staff were nice and tried to help us. I guess depending on your needs will determine if this property is for you.",Kanishka Villas
489,"One of the best, if not the best in Seminyak",50,March 2012,"This is the only prioperty we have ever been back to, and this was our fourth time, and we have never been disappointed. They are all 2 bedroom private pool villas which can be sold as a 1 bedroom. They just lock off the unwanted bedroom. each villa has a semi open lounge/dining/kitchen (2 of the villas can now enclose this). Then there is the decking and private pool, and the other side is the downstairs king bedroom with en suite and outsoor shower. Upstairs is the second bedroom. 2 villas have twin beds and the others have king upstairs. 24/7 butler service. Huge LCD tv with surround sound plus TV's in each bedroom.
dvd player in lounge. Breakfast is ordered the night before and the butler prepares it in the room. You can also have a BBQ by the pool or a romantic dinner by the pool. Tours can be arranged and there is a shuttle within the Seminyak area. Pampering of the highest quality. The villas are quiet, yet you can go out and within 2 minutes you are in the shopping and night life of Seminyak. If you do have a child, they have a portable fence they can secure the pool with.",Kanishka Villas
490,Kanishka a big disappointment,20,March 2012,"My husband and I have just returned from our 4th trip to Bali and Kanishka is the 6th villa we have stayed in. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment! At all other villas we have stayed in, the staff have made an effort to remember our names and greet us. After 6 nights at Kanishka, we were still strangers to the staff (although the butlers and drivers were always pleasant and courteous)

The villa itself, was at best poorly maintained. The deck which joined the living area to the bedroom area had sections which had collapsed and were frankly dangerous to walk on. The bathroom had a bare wire (although wrapped in duct tape) coming from the tiles surrounding the bath where presumably a spotlight had once been. To their credit, once mentioned to housekeeping a maintenance person replaced the light. Call me paranoid, but the thought of soaking in the bath next to a bare electrical wire didn't appeal.

The standard of housekeeping also left a lot to be desired. While Kanishka had the usual indoor/outdoor shower, which we love! this one neeed a good prune as we had to literally fight our way through the palm fronds to get to the shower. The shower glass was far from clean and the garden bed still had some rubbish in it which was there for our entire stay! While reaching behind the lounge to plug in our international adaptor, I realised it had been some time since a staff member had been anywhere near the back of the lounge. Gross would be a suitable descriptor. A small louvered window in the wall of the lounge area had not been cleaned in some considerable time, if ever. There were other weird splotches on the floor (possibly gecko crap) which were also there for our entire stay.

At check-out time, no-one bothered to ask if we had enjoyed our stay, was everything ok etc as had been the case with all our other stays in Bali. The complimentary bowl of fruit on our arrival slowly decayed over the week with no sign of it being replaced or freshened up.

If you are a sun-worshipper, this is definately NOT the place to stay. The 2 bedroom villa for 4 has 2 sunlounges and a small window of opportunity to lay in the sun as it passes overhead in the middle of the day due to the architecture of the building.

All in all, this was a huge disappointment for us and not value for money compared to the many other villas in the Seminyak area.",Kanishka Villas
491,Bliss,50,February 2012,"Myself and a friend stayed at Kanishka for one week in Feb 2012. The villa was absolutely beautiful and the staff provided excellent service. There was a wide range of food for breakfast and the reception was very helpful in arranging day trips etc. The private pool was a great treat and very well maintained. It was within close enough walking distance to some great shops and restaurants, as well as the beach (or a short/cheap taxi ride, or free shuttle). Highly recommended.",Kanishka Villas
492,Just OK,30,February 2012,"Pros:
1. Great Location in the middle of Seminyak
2. Good service, butler to our disposal and brought us breakfast each morning
3. Very clean

Cons:
1. Bathrooms, living and dining rooms are in the open. So if you go to the bathroom at night, you need to step into the heat out of your air-conditioned room. The living room did not have an AC so it was uncomfortable to sit there for too long.
2. Internet only worked if we sat right by the router in the living room, bad reception in the bed room.
3. Due to the natural habitat, the place was filled with geckos and other bugs
4. Pool was small and in the shade, so didn't feel like getting in.
5. They provided free airport transfer with our stay. They organized it with a private tour company but when we wanted to change the time of pick up, they asked for us to call the tour company instead of them doing it.
6. Because of the openness, we could hear everything said and done in the next villa over.
7. It was very difficult to communicate with the staff on the phone before arrival. They did not understand me and vice versa.",Kanishka Villas
493,Home in bali,50,August 2011,Kanishka villa is a beautiful centrally located villa in the heart of seminyak with just super staff and amazing rooms with all amenities and beautiful private pool and super Balinese style villas making you feel at home with priavte butler service,Kanishka Villas
494,Paradise in paradise!,50,October 2011,"The Kanishka did not disappoint that so many other when the pictures inevitably looked much better than the real deal. All the villas are two-bedroom, so, if you are staying only in one, they will lock up the upstairs bedroom. That wasn't an issue though, since the bedroom is upstairs, you don't feel like there is anything missing or strange (having a locked door in the middle of the villa for example). The villa is well appointed and luxurious. The lush bed and the gorgeous outdoor bathroom are also major pluses.

The service is attentive and obliging, without being overbearing. And they offer a free ride into town at anytime between 11 - 1 (I think), which is very convenient, but may be less practical when the villas are very full.

The best part about the villa is the location. Right smack in the middle of Jalan Kunti and a short walk away from all the eateries and shopping. It is also directly opposite Bali Deli where we can stock up on snacks and drinks, and Word of Mouth, a cosy tapas place. It is also a 5 min walk away from Sip Girll on Sunset Road.

The only minor issues are:

1. there isn't that much sun - probably because the upstairs bedroom blocked out most of the sun;
2. the breakfast wasn't great, although the selection is good;
3. there are ALOT of mozzies, but being Bali, this is expected and no different from any other resorts we have been to;
4. there is a weird smell in the kitchen near to the bin (even though there is no trash in there). Not sure if this is like with all other villas or just the one we were in.

All in all, a fantastic 5 star experience. In fact, me and my girlfriend will be going back again and taking the 2 bedroom villa this time! Can't wait.",Kanishka Villas
495,"Fabulous Villas, fabulous location",50,December 2011,"The Kanishka Villas were everything we were hoping for. The pictures on the website are exactly what you can expect in real life. We were VERY happy with the level of accomodation and service. The staff were obliging and polite, and nothing was too much trouble. We were a family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers, and the 2 bed pool villa gave us enough space for us each to have our own privacy. The bedrooms were huge and well aircondtioned. Both rooms had luxurious en suite bathrooms with baths big enough for two! There is a flatscreen TV with DVD in the lounge, and both bedrooms have flatscreen TVs too. We were able to use the WIFI within the Villa at no cost. The location of Kanishka is great - it is only a short walk to the famous Bali Deli, and lots of shops, spa's and restaurants.
We thoroughly enjoyed staying there and will definitely recommend it to friends and family.",Kanishka Villas
496,great city villa,50,November 2011,"This place is amazing. Perfect location. Just <5 mins strolls to Seminyak main shopping and eating belt. Few houses away from the Warung Italia and Warung Made.

The villa its self was breath taking. We took 2 bedroom villa and share it with another couple.
one of the bedroom is downstairs, a bit smaller but have direct access to the pool. The other was upstairs. Have bigger bedroom area and bath room was outdoor.

Pool was smaller than expected but its enough.
Huge TV in each room and common area. Bfast was fantastic!!

the only thing thats bothering us was the shower upstairs.
For some reason the shower was spraying super hot water and in super strong stream.
in both the shower area and in the bathtub.

we have quite a tight schedule, because we were in Bali for a wedding so we really dont have time to complain and so...
Were in villa number 1 at that time.

That was the only downside. Other than that we have a more a pleasant stay at the villa.
Staff was helpful and friendly. And we dont really experience high street noise that some of the other reviewers was saying. Probably they improve the wall... Or we are just 2 very heavy sleepers.

Anyway this is highly recommended if you want a villa but still in the city area.

Oh another thing, they have sun chairs next to the pool, but since the wall was quite high you have only a very small chances of catching the sun itself.",Kanishka Villas
497,Beautiful Villa and Interior at an excellent Seminyak location,50,November 2011,"Loved the interior plan of Villa 4. When you open the door, you are are your own private sanctuary with full kitchen, dining room, living room and direct into the pool. The bedroom is so comfortable and the open bathroom with bath and shower was exotic! Went and stocked up on yummy imported food just up the street at Bali Deli, Bali's best supermarket. Then took a short walk up the street to my favorite Bali restaurant - Made's Warung for dinner. In villa WIFI made it easy for me to keep in touch with my business back home. Free shuttle was great when I had to go to a meeting, and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Kanishka for me was such a treat and first class in every way. Having your own private villa and pool is much better way to enjoy Bali, then staying in a 5 star hotel. Highly recommended.",Kanishka Villas
498,So hard to leave!,50,November 2011,"I stayed in Kanishka Villas in November 2011. It was a truly amazing experience! This is by far the nicest place I have stayed in. The villa was beautiful, the staff so friendly and helpful and a really great location! I think I would find it impossible to stay anywhere else in Bali on my next trip. Really top notch effort Kanishka, I can't fault you at all!",Kanishka Villas
499,Nice villas in great location in Seminyak,40,October 2011,"We booked a one-bedroom villa and we had a lovely stay. the villas are located in one if not the best areas in Bali, in Seminyak, near the Bali Deli and close to all the boutiques and shops, and a extense variety of restaurants, although beach is around 20-25 mins walk but Kanishka offers a free shuttle to the beach. Accommodation is nice although in our opinion the bedroom downstairs is a bit small compared to the size of the villa. Living room is very big with an equipped kitchen and open air, next to the pool. The only problem is the amount of mosquitos in the evenings and when you get up in the morning for breakfast, you need to spray around if you do not want to be bitten. Pool is convenient but not that sunny for sunbathing but super nice to have a pool for yourself. I think the villas need some renovation mainly due to the fact that furniture, etc.. are open air with no windows,, but some small touches would make it nicer. The bathroom is vey big with a bathtub and an outdoor shower that with the mosquitos sometimes not that nice, but in general good. they serve you the breakfast in the room in the mornings and this is average quality. the best part is the privacy and the location and shame they did not have a spa at the facilities, only at their sister property",Kanishka Villas
500,Beuatiful villas,50,October 2011,"We had a two bedroom villa and it was simply bautiful. It was on two floors so having the upstairs bedroom I also had my own additional living room area there. Each room was like a suite on its own. It hard to find fault in this place, perhaps the pool was on the small size and not really getting sun for sunbathing. Service was impeccable, breakfast amazing. Its not the best location in Seminyak in my opinion (I prefer more central Oberoi area) but there is a free transport to anywhere in Seminyak from the villa and you never had to wait more than 2 minutes for it. This would be good for two friends or two couples as there is enought space that you do not feel crowded.",Kanishka Villas
501,"Kanishka Villas, Seminyak, Bali",50,October 2011,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at Kanishka Villas in Seminyak, Bali. The spacious, open-plan living area off a lovely pool framed by frangipani trees, created the ideal environment for that special occasion. The mood was set when we were greeted with an anniversary cake, complete with candles by the attentive staff. A very thoughtful touch!
The main bedroom overlooks the pool and is made for comfort and relaxation. A large on-suit bathroom is fitted out with both bath and shower and fragrant soaps and lotions provide those small touches that make a difference.
Kanishka Villas are in a superb location. Just walk to the end of the street and you leave the private sanctuary of the villa to find yourself in the midst of the classy shops and diverse restaurants of Seminyak.
Kanishka is the ideal place for a clebration, a relaxing holiday and also an opportunity to enjoy the lively atmosphere of Seminyak, just a short stroll away. Strongly recommended!",Kanishka Villas
502,Fantastic Holiday at the amazing Kanishka Villas!,50,October 2011,"We booked a one bedroom villa (all villas have 2 bedrooms/2 bathrooms, 1 by the pool & 1 upstairs - both are very private & would be a great set up for 2 couples) for a week in October 2011 & were given Villa 14 which is at the end of the lane that the villas occupy. I had read numerous reports that started that noise was a concern due to their open air nature but we heard nothing at all (all 15 villas were fully booked & occupied when we stayed) & we came to think of our villa as an oasis, close to everything but so relaxing & private. I am sure that if you did hear people or any noise you could flick the switch that turns on the waterfall over the pool & problem would be solved, as the waterfall drowns out all other noises and adds to the relaxing feel or lazing by the pool. There were mosquitoes but they were nowhere near as bad as I had read & really were no problem at all, neither of us were bitten, the staff sprayed the villas (all rooms) each night & set out coils to burn in the living and bathroom areas.
The villas are a short stroll to loads of fantastic restaurants, spas & shopping, we walked to the beach one morning and in took about 15 minutes at a leisurely stopping to browse kind of pace. On numerous occasions we used the villas transport and driver to drop us off at restaurants or to go shopping, which is included in the price. The villas also organised free transport to Jimbaran for a sunset seafood dinner and we booked a driver for a day trip to Ubud though our butler and the price was very reasonable.
The villa was private, well equipped and had everything we could have possibly needed. The open air living/dining and kitchen area is very large and well laid out. There is a fan in this areas that kept it amazingly cool & we spent a lot of time lazing around on the sofa which is huge, as was the flat screen TV with surround sound. We didn't do any cooking in the kitchen, but certainly could have done as everything is right there ready, with a full-size fridge & a hot/cold filtered water fountain. The bedroom and bathroom were fantastic - a large 4 poster bed sits in the middle of a large, high wooden ceiling room that is air-conditioned & has another flat screen TV. The bath and shower were perfect, great pressure and we loved the indoor outdoor feel plus the garden that surrounded it. The pool and deck were lovely - shaded for most of the afternoon due to the frangipani trees that surrounded the pool, but there was enough sun to lay in for a few hours in the morning & a terrace upstairs if you wanted afternoon sun, but due to heat of the afternoon we found the sun/shade ratio to be great. The food was incredible and we enjoyed the cooked breakfast plus pancakes and cereal every morning, it had everything we could have wanted and more. Nothing disappointed! Our butler, Sudi, was fantastic as were all the staff, Nothing was too much trouble and everything happened within minutes. I would definitely stay at the Kanishka Villa again & would definitely recommend the villas to any couple that wants to get away from the hustle and bustle and relax whilst in Bali, but still be close to the action.",Kanishka Villas
503,Nice villa at good location with hearty breakfast,50,October 2011,"Though a bit run down but well maintained. Service was excellent throughout my stay. The strategic location is a plus point, with good restaurants and shopping street within walking distance. My favorite spot is the open space pavillion which was fully equipped with LCD TV, DVD player, iPod player and Home Theatre system with large comfortable sofa. The bathroom is spacious and the bed itself is very comfortable. Pool was cleaned daily and the cold/hot drinking water dispenser is a nice touch. The only issue is the presence of mosquitoes, though they did their best to tackle this by supplying mosquito coils and spray. Highly recommended.",Kanishka Villas
504,Amazing honeymoon in a luxury Villa,50,October 2011,"Well what an incredible set-up at Kanishka Villas!
We booked a one bedroom villa for the last 5d/4n of our honeymoon and wished we'd spent the entire time there!
The villa was private, well equipped and had everything we could have possibly needed.
The open air living/dining and kitchen area is very large and well laid out.
We didn't do any cooking in the kitchen, but certainly could have done as everything is right there ready. The full size fridge/freezer easily fit all our snacks and drinks in and the black granite bench-tops and stainless steel appliances add to that high-end feeling.

The sofa in the lounge area is HUGE and spent many an hour lazing on it while reading books or watching the flat screen TV with surround sound.
As people have mentioned, yes - the villas are all open-air so you can hear the people from the other villas occasionally. But by flicking the switch that turns on the waterfall over the pool = problem fixed! Drowns out all other noise and adds to the relaxing feel.

The bedroom and bathroom is fantastic - large king sized 4 poster bed sits in the middle of a large, high ceiling room. The bed was covered in rose petals and had a lovely arrangement of roses on the bedside table also - was certainly a nice touch for our honeymoon :)
The bath and shower are perfect - hot water, pressure and plenty of it!

The pool and deck are lovely - shady for most of the morning and afternoon due to the overhead courtyard effect, but there is enough sun to lay in for a few hours, which we found was plenty.

The FOOD is incredible and we ate MANY meals in the villa instead of going out. The prices are reasonable (comparable if not less than many restaurants!) and the quality was superb.
We had the full cooked and continental breakfast every morning which had everything we could have wanted and more. The rest of the day we had everything from goats cheese tortellini on salad through to pizzas and mie goreng. Nothing disappointed!

Many thanks to our butler, Sudi, he was there whenever we needed him. Our wi-fi went down and he had someone there within 2 minutes to fix it!
Nothing was too much trouble and everything happened within minutes.

Will would definitely recommend Kanishka villas to any couple (or family) that wants to get away from the hustle and bustle and relax whilst in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
505,Highly Recommended,40,August 2011,"We stayed here for 8 nights and didn't want to leave! Highly recommended. the villa was kept spotlessly clean at all times and the staff were super friendly. super relaxing and near to everything you could possibly need! Only negative thing was that the pool was freeeeezing, however, I would definitely stay here again. great value. mozzies not a problem as staff sprayed each day and lit coils for us - but hey, its Bali so we expect a few bitey insects!",Kanishka Villas
506,Average villa,30,September 2011,"I too booked Kanishka after seeing the positive reviews on TripAdvisor, but agree that I was a little disappointed with it in particular in comparing it to other villas Ive stayed in.

The location is fantastic with the villa being within easy walking distance to central Seminyak and in particular ""eat street"" and the Bintang supermarket. The villa had a nice tropical feel to it, however, when that includes lots of mozzies that the staff are too slow to provide coils for (sometimes after 7pm) it lessened the enjoyment - I appreciate it is Bali and mozzies are a expected but usually coils are lit around 5 or 6pm.

It was quiet from street noise, but our neighbours often woke us up or disturbed our enjoyment of the villa.

My biggest gripe would be the shower, and I too had to shower by sitting in the bathtub and using the handheld shower - which isnt reflective of 4 or 5 star accommodation.

If you can get this accommodation on a reduced rate then it is fine - I paid AUS$200 a night and would not pay that again and would much prefer several other villas around the same area.",Kanishka Villas
507,Romantic!!,50,September 2011,"When the 1st day arrived, the villa was so beautiful as i expected.i love the service and ambience inside thr villa.it is suitable for honeymooners and thr location is great as many boutique and supermarket nearby.. I would love to come again..!",Kanishka Villas
508,Beautiful Kanishka,50,June 2011,We had a 2 bedroom villa. Wonderful. 2nd room upstairs had a lovely small patio. Villa private BBQ in room was great. Helpful staff. Water fountain in room. Pool beautiful. All breakfasts lovely - served in our room at a time we selected.,Kanishka Villas
509,WOW! AMAZING!,50,November 2010,"I cannot express in words the beauty and serenity of this hotel. My husband and i stayed here for our honeymoon for a week in November 2010. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like royalty! The staff were so professional and extra helpful. The villa had it's own private pool and everything was open, apart from the bedroom which could be locked up to keep your luggage safe. Although there is not a need in the world to worry about protecting your belongings in this hotel, the staff are just so respectful and bow at you to greet you. The room service is great and our free daily breakfast was delicious!

The villas are in close proximity to some of the most amazing shops and boutique clothing stores i have ever been to. You can walk to some of the most wonderful restaurants that Bali has to offer and if you like the night life it's also just a 2 minute taxi ride to the centre of Kuta.

I seriously cannot fault this hotel, it has such an authentic spiritual feeling to it. I was a little worried about mosquitoes because of the open plan living but the staff come and spray and put up mosquito coils every day for you and turn down the bed. It's just incredible service and my huband and i cannot wait to stay here again!

Good work guys!",Kanishka Villas
510,Average villa lacking attention to detail,30,September 2011,"Booked Kanishka after reading all the great reviews, but was a little disappointed.

The good points are a great location within easy walking distance to restaurants and Bintang supermarket etc. The staff are very friendly and helpful and even rang us to let us know we were going to miss out on breakfast! Overall a nice looking villa and a comfy bed that was chaged daily.

The negatives were all the water was turned off for several hours due to pipe maintenance, poor internet connection, the rain shower couldnt rinse your hair so I had to shower by sitting in the bathtub using the handheld shower, no dvd player in the bedroom, and very little sun in the courtyard/pool area (but the flowering frangapani tree was worth it!), no place to hang your pool entered you had to let them out and snib your door otherwise they would just leave it to bang in the breeze - which our neighbours doors did on several occassions which woke us up ...

Overall I have found better value for money in a Seminyak villa.",Kanishka Villas
511,Sleepless amongst bugs and noise,10,September 2011,"Gasp. Lovely place and villa ruined by really terrible bugs! bed bugs have eaten my baby boy alive so much so that he doesn't want to sleep in the cot provided by the villa. have asked to change the cot but full occupancy means no such luck. sleeping in bed is a bit tricky still for my 18mth old. mossies are regular bed friends. if you can't sleep with them buzzing around your ear, don't think of coming here. and of course, there's the noise. neighbours blast TV and music all night; planes fly over (i think on their way to Denpasar airport) so close i can see the undercarriage.",Kanishka Villas
512,It feels so relaxing,50,September 2011,The staffs are very friendly and can speak good english. Can bring you around Seminyak area such as beach and nearby Spa/Massage of your choice. The villa is quite well maintained. Personal small pool. The kitchen has basic stuff so that you can bring your own food to cook. But why cook when there's some many restaurant nearby as well as supermarket. Overall very nice experience.,Kanishka Villas
513,"Covenient, clean, classy",50,April 2011,Excellent location right near Bali Deli. Walking distance to shops in Seminyak. Very clean villas with a nice living area and pool. Food was good and service fast and friendly. Ideal for a couple or two individuals or even two couples. I was very happy with the price compared to other villas that can't claim to be as well maintained.,Kanishka Villas
514,Unfortunate Choice,30,July 2011,"Recently travelled to Bali to get away from the stress of a construction project near our home and were hoping for some much needed rest. Unfortunately the villa that we had rented for a week was right opposite a construction site, staff were apologetic for the noise but had I have known prior to booking I would not have stayed here. The reason we chose this location is because we have stayed in Villas nearby before and had a relaxing peaceful holiday. Due to the noise of nearby villas as well as the construction site we do not recommend staying here which is a shame as the Villa was nice although there was no sun around the pool.",Kanishka Villas
515,very helpful and friendly staff,40,July 2011,"very nice people willing to help and very good to my little one.
on a down note the pool did not get any sun and the villa could have been a little bit cleaner, but we had a good stay anyway.",Kanishka Villas
516,"Great Location, and Excellent Staff",50,July 2011,"Loved this place, location - location - location in Seminyak near to everything. A short walk to Bali Deli. In Villa breakfast and newspaper were an excellent start to the day and a large spacious living, area with all those peronal touches. Staff coudl not have been more helpful. I will be back.",Kanishka Villas
517,Friendly service but a little rough around the edges,30,July 2011,"My husband and I stayed at the Kanishka Villas with a few friends. The space is really nice as is the location just off the main Seminyak drag. Tons of shopping and food options in the area. Some of the better stores such as Toko and Allegra are just by the villa.

Bad points- the pool doesn't get any direct sun so we had to leave for the beach to get some colour. The bedroom upstairs needs a mosquito net as it was impossible to sleep as my face was deformed from mosquito bites (and I even lined my pillow with those mozzie stickers and sprayed repellant). I would say the mosquito situation here was pretty major even though the staff did leave lots of coils and a whole bottle of spray. Downstairs sofa was very musty smelling and a bit gross to sit on. No iPod adaptor for music (it's a villa guys we need tunes!) Towel replacement service needs to be improved, we had to keep calling for towels to be replaced and for some reason the staff would never clean up the older pool or bath towels left behind on the floor. You can hear your neighbours very very clearly- I was awoken each morning to screaming children. Villa for 4 only comes with 2 deck chairs.

Good points - lots of space and very quiet (except for the neighbours bit- maybe you'll be luckier than us). Very friendly staff and accommodating. Excellent location and breakfast is yummy and fresh! Overall very clean (except for the musty sofa). Super comfy beds and lovely large bathrooms with outdoor shower.",Kanishka Villas
518,One of the Regans,50,July 2011,"Hi following the other ""three regans"" review I thought I would add a few comments.

Apart from having a fabulous holiday as per the other review, I thought to mention the outstanding staff who after my daughter left her iphone in a taxi and without even knowing the taxi company or number, the butler service was able to contact the taxi companies and within two hours we had the phone back - Unbelievably good service.

Also much appreciated the late checkout as we had a midnight flight which made the last day of our trip so much more relaxing.

Until our next trip to Kanishka ;-)",Kanishka Villas
519,"Small, elite villa complex in Bali's action area",50,June 2011,"After experiencing such an enjoyable, relaxed stay at Gending Kedis, we decided to spend two nights at their other Bali villa property, Kanishka Villas in Seminyak.

This area was recommended to us as being the most desirable for shopping, dining and night life.

Although only 15 units, all were two bedrooms, (one upstairs, one ground level) and with private pools.

Though there was no feature restaurant at the resort, all the amenities necessary for in room dining were provided. However, the location is close to a wide variety of very good restaurants, that we ate out at every opportunity.

The rooms were well designed, spacious and the local decor, nicely presented.

Would definitely recommend. . .",Kanishka Villas
520,An amazing experience,50,July 2011,"Staying at Kanishka Villas we experienced the most helpful, friendly and proficient customer service at any hour of the day or night. The rooms were spectacular, spacious, clean, modern and still included the Balinese feel and decoration. The location was very convenient being close to shops, restaurants, beaches and activities. Best feature of the villas was the modern balinese feel and customer service. What we liked least was having to leave!",Kanishka Villas
521,"we loved it! spacious , private and exactly like the photos!!",50,June 2011,"we really enjoyed it here.. the villas were huge and modern and we felt very comfortable and spoiled.. the kids loved the space and private pool and as its off the main drag its very peaceful and quiet but only a few seconds walk to all the bedlam of the main shopping area of jalan legian..
looking forward to returning soon",Kanishka Villas
522,"Beautiful villas, excellent service",40,June 2011,"Had a fantastic 8 nights here recently with my boyfriend, lovely villas, great set up, excellent service, staff were fantastic. The villas are in a great location in Seminyak, easy to walk to Kuta or Legian. Great restaurants and shops nearby. A couple of annoyances were, the mossies and the noise of other guests! In regards to the mosquities, the villa staff sprayed the Villa every evening and set mosquito coils for us, and secondly, we had a couple of families staying next door to us and due to the layout it was pretty noisy at times. I guess with the open air lay out it is an issue that is difficult to control.

Would definitely recommend Kanishka Villas in Seminyak!",Kanishka Villas
523,"Simply Amazing - luxury, peace & good location",50,June 2011,"Both my wife and I gasped when we first walked into the villa - it was amazing. very spacious living room with a dining table and kitchenette with the pool right in front! The bedroom was on the other side of the pool, with french windows, so we cold literally roll out of bed into the pool if we wanted!

The staff was super friendly and helpful - there were some very minor language issues, but they always went out of the way to help in recommending sites, restaurants, and other tips. One of the nicest things was to get breakfast in the villa. In fact, one day, we had overslept, and got a call from the reception telling us that the time for breakfast was over, and would we still like to order. Superb! Most hotels would not care if you miss breakfast. The bathroom was also very spacious with the shower open to the sky, so it was very nice and peaceful to shower literally under the moon and sun!

The location is in Seminyak, and its a short walk to some of the best shopping and bar areas.

There are really very small things that can be improved on - frankly I would go back here whether they are fixed or not. These are - the pool water is very cold, so we couldn't stay in the pool for too long - maybe there is a way they could warm it up a little. Second is mosquitoes, though it's not such a big problem since they light mosquito coils in the evenings. Anyway there are no mosquitoes in the bedroom so you sleep peacefully. The last thing was that the spa was always booked, so we couldn't get the timings we wanted even one day before - we ended up getting a massage on the morning that we were leaving. The massage itself was great, and was done right by our private pool in the villa.

I would highly recommend kanishka villas to anyone. Next time we would like to also check out their other property in Jimbaran.",Kanishka Villas
524,So much space,40,May 2011,"Loved the setup and design, so much space to relax in. Staff were brilliant, so helpful and let us stay later for late flight without extra charge. Only complaint was nozzles and shower water pressure, but these went major issues.",Kanishka Villas
525,STUNNING!,50,March 2011,Had a wonderful stay here. The private pool was amazing – cool and clean! The service was also amazing. We were blown away when we walked in - so roomy and stylish. The breakfast was lovely – the come deliver it to you in your villas. Free Wireless. Not near the beach in Seminyak but there is a free shuttle so make sure you utilize it. Only hiccup was there was some slight plumbing issues in the bathroom as there was a leaking water pipe but no big deal at all. Great place. Mosquitoes and noise didn’t seem to be an issue for us but perhaps we were lucky..,Kanishka Villas
526,Business trip become a holiday,50,February 2011,"In February 2011 I was visiting Bali on a business trip from my company. We stayed one night at Kaniskha Villas and one night at Gending Kedis. After arrival I thought that both these resorts are unique and quite different from anywhere I had visited before. My impression was that there was a natural beauty in the design and the details. The interiors have lovely colours and are very comfortable. For me as an Indonesian person the villas are very luxurious and the service from the resort staff felt friendly and efficient.

Both have different styles. Kaniskha more simple and modern. It makes me want to have my own house/apartment like that in Bali. Simple and effective and spacious. And Gending Kedis is more natural with lots of gardens and trees. And it makes me feel very comfortable until I forget that I came for my business trip!

Hopefully I can come back with a different purpose, maybe honeymoon or holidays!!!",Kanishka Villas
527,"Fabulous location, great service, but full of mossies!",30,February 2011,"My husband and I rented a 2-bedroom villa and shared it with another couple. The villa was spacious and luxurious, it had a great living area where you could relax and chat/watch tv. It was also nice to have breakfast served to you every morning, and the service staff were incredibly polite and helpful to a fault!

The location was superb, just a short 5-min walk away from Jalan Raya Seminyak, the main shopping drag full of lovely boutiques and little shops selling crafts and home furnishings. And a short walk away from the popular Warung Italia and Warung Made.

Our only complaint was that the villa was full of mosquitoes. We got bitten quite badly, my friend's husband probably has more than a hundred bites around his ankles. It made it really uncomfortable for us to try and hang out in the open-air living room, during the day or in the evening. We put a few mosquito coils around but those critters were persistent, vicious and plentiful! The hotel said that they carried out fogging twice a week but that didn't seem to help.

Only other comment was, if you're looking at trying to get a lovely tan by the pool in the villa, you only have a small window during the day from 10-ish am to 2pm. The way the villa is designed (2nd storey where the 2nd bedroom was) and the shady frangipani trees around the pool block off the sun quite a bit. Nice and shady though for those of you who just want to lie by the pool, read a book and not get too burned!",Kanishka Villas
528,Great Villa! Even Better Location & Experience!,50,December 2010,"Where can I start about my stay. It was so amazing I was sad to leave. The villa is breathtaking, the pool is a generous size, the staff are so friendly and everything was just perfect.

The villa is spacious and very private, which is essential and sometimes hard to find in a villa. However, with this privacy came a slight lack of sun. When we spoke to the front desk and asked if there was another villa with more sun, they are so happy to assist us, and we moved to Villa 14 which was unbelievable, complete with sunlight.

The staff are like a friendly family. One of the best aspects about the villa was how personal it was. All staff members knew us, knew what villa we were staying in, and some even knew our names.

The villa was situated in a perfect location. Shops are walking distance, to both Legian and Seminyak. Just up the road away from the main strip is a supermarket called Bali Deli, which is great to top up your fridge. If you choose to go further towards Seminyak Square or to restaurants further away, there is an on demand driver who is more than happy to take you. To make it better, when you finish your meal, you have the restaurant ring the hotel again, and they will come and pick you up when suits. The service was a great help and such a convenience.

The only negative is the number of mosquitos. This is everywhere in Bali though. The hotel lights mosquito coils every afternoon which is great. You can request more coils for your own use. My only suggestion would be for the hotel to light coils twice a day. However, this negative is easily overcome by keeping your doors closed straight after you leave your bedroom and use insect repellent.

All in all, it was one of the best stays of my life. This is the ONLY place I will stay at in Seminyak every time I re-visit Bali.
Thank you again all at the Kanishka Villas.",Kanishka Villas
529,Simply Amazing!,50,December 2010,"Just got back from bali and let me tell you, the villa was simply amazing! If you decide to choose the room closer to the pool, then it would be smaller to the one that is upstairs. Nonethelss, it is much more cosier and easier excess to the pool. 2 thumbs up for the ambiance and the whole look and feel of the villa. Seriously, it makes you feel that you don't want to leave and spend your vacation at Kanishka :) Great customer service as well and they come by twice a day to clean your room. Sorry, but sometimes we do become idiots when we are on vacation, leaving some of our clothes lying around. But we were shocked when we got back to the villa after our long day out to find our clothes, foldered and placed nicely beside our beds.

Some slight drawbacks to the villa:

1) Need a better breakfast menu. The breakfast wasn't really outstanding and if that is fixed, it would have been perfect! Nevertheless, breakfast was always right on time. Let them know what time you need them and they will be there right on the dot

2) Pool room excess - If you do decide to choose the room by the pool, be ready to get a little wet when getting to your room when it rains. As the villa is an open concept, the walkway to your room doesn't really have a full covered awning to that room. Nonethelss, its only a 3 to 4 steps walk to your room, so you really don't get that wet. Oh, there is also umbrellas available at your villas.

Great things to do near the villa:

1) Massage - Great massage just near the villa. It was just opposite our villa and Its really cheap (RP 80,000) and they were very, very good. Word of advice, book them early because they are always fully booked. We were turned away twice because we tried a walk-in. Also, there are not many places for massages around the villa and other than the one I've just stated, the 2 or 3 massage places are a little expensive for us (Rp 150,000) and we had to go to Kuta for our massages

2) Food - Great Italian Restaurant just opposite our place. The Lasagne was superb and so was some of the rest of the food we ordered.

Grocery - There is a great grocery store just around the corner of Seminyak if do decide to buy some snacks or cook in your self. The food are all foreign based and if you are missing home and need something from your home country, you might be able to find it there :) - at the entrance of the villa, turn right and its about 500m on your left

3) Shopping - The whole stretch of seminyak is a great place to shop. A little high end tho but the shops were neat, clean and the whole stretch has a great ambiance to it as well.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Kanishka. Its a great place to stay and If I'm ever in Bali again, I would not even hessitate to stay here again.",Kanishka Villas
530,UNDER PROMISED / OVER DELIVERED,50,November 2010,"UNDER PROMISED / OVER DELIVERED

We have just had a delightful stay at Kanishka Villas (Seminyak) and Gending Kedis ( Jimbaran Bay) package - 2 nights at each.

The Villas are owned and operated by one of Indonesia’s most respected designers and an Internationally experienced resort and Hotels team, and it shows :-)
- Hide quoted text -

Both properties combine a clever balance of Balinese tranquility in modern contemporary environs. The service level at both properties is seamless including the amazing Butler Service - Dial 0. They even provide a laptop service to the room if you have to combine work and pleasure.

The food was great also - Asian Fusion - Enak Sekali / Delicious and oh so affordable! Oh, and did I mention that all Villas have pools.

From Melbourne, we work and travel extensively thru the Asian region for both work and pleasure and these properties are a standout if you are looking for a special visit at a value price - ENJOY!",Kanishka Villas
531,Trully Awesome,50,September 2010,"My hubby & myself spend 3 nights in the villa. We both love the privacy of the villa and in the morning you feel like you are close to nature with birds chirping!

We didn't had the time to experiance their spa or villa dining as we were out on tours/beach. Service was good, staff were all very friendly & helpful. There were mosquitoes around the villas but the staff came daily around 6.30pm to place repellants around the villas so we were not bitten from those insects at all.

Location was great too as we could walk around the shops and few good dining areas to. We tried Warong Made & also Mannekepis restaurant.

The room was a bit pricy for Malaysians but we didnt mind as the service & villa quality was up to its standard.",Kanishka Villas
532,We were blown away with the impeccable service and standards of this well appointed clutch of villas.,50,July 2010,"We stayed at the Kanishka Villas in Bali's fashionable Seminyak in late July for a few nights and wished we had stayed longer. We were blown away with the impeccable service and standards of this small and well appointed clutch of villas. Here' a property that was cooked up by some out of control hedonist; exceptional attention to detail, fantastic and truly friendly service, all in a magical little enclave we had a hard time tearing ourselves away from. There is a welter of great boutique shopping, spas, bars, and the Bali Deli for wine and cheese, and other stuff you can slip in your in-room refrigerator. Despite all the action around the area, our villa was very peaceful and secluded and for some of the time we enjoyed doing nothing except reading and dipping. I would not hesitate to recommend Kanishka Villas in a second, and in fact we are already planning with a group of friends to stay there in December. So much for this little secret!",Kanishka Villas
533,"Fantastic villa, great ground floor apartment with pool, outside shower",50,August 2010,"We spent 9 nights here this month. It was a fantastic place. The configuration is a large one bedroom on the ground floor along with the living area and pool.

There is an upstairs (2nd bedroom) space that is not as nice but would be good for kids or teenagers as it has its own small living area.

The staff were friendly and the in room massage service was great too.",Kanishka Villas
534,Amazing in all areas!!!!!!!!,50,June 2010,"Our stay at these villas was a fantastic one indeed. My husband and I chose Kanishka Villas for our honeymoon based on what other travellers had written and were by no means disappointed. We stayed for 7 nights and from the beginning of the stay the staff proved themselves to be friendly and courteous and went out of their way to ensure that we were enjoying our time. They offered ideas and suggestions and assisted us with bookings for day trips and dinners with no hassle. The courtesy car service within the Seminyak area was a godsend on those days that it was too hot to walk!!! The villas themselves were amazing!!!!! From the pictures on the internet it looked amazing, but what surprised me was how true to form the actual villas were! They were comfortably furnished and had a great living/dining area that looked out over the private pool. Most of our days were spent by the pool! I can't really comment on the room service or spa as we did not use these facilities but the breakfasts were fantastic and always arrived on time as requested and when we had fogotten to order one day we even had a call from reception to see if we wanted to order at last minute. I loved these small attention to details. I would definently recommend these villas to anyone who wants to just get away from it all and relax in private. My husband has already recommended Kanishka villas to one of his work colleagues as a place to stay!!! We both can't wait to come back to Bali and to stay at Kanishka Villas. Thankyou so much for making our holiday one of the best!",Kanishka Villas
535,What a perfect gift !,50,April 2010,"The main and essential purpose of my stay is relaxation and tranquility after long weeks of work in Jakarta. I came a day before my birthday, it was just a perfect choice for a birthday present, a fabulous place to unwind, very quiet and private which I craved desperately yet has cool atmosphere and great facilities for some friends to come over and had some early cocktail just after sunset - What a collection of cocktail glasses we could use !
Nice place before heading off for dinner at a nearby restaurant. This area has a lot of great restaurants offering Italian, French, Indian, Indonesian cuisines with great range of wine and cocktail at reasonable price.

I can still remember how quiet it was, exactly what I needed on my birthday, a quiet moment for reflection .. which I was satisfied about. Enjoyable days!

A sweet surprise I had in the morning of my b'day, when I opened the door of my villa.. some friendly staff singing 'Happy Birthday' with a delicious chocolate cake…
Thank you guys for what you had organised.

From time to time between breakfast, lunch, long naps and swims.. great things that I am grateful for are that I could still have fast, uninterrupted access to internet, I could still receive calls on Skype from my fam overseas, ‘happy birthday’ calls :) and showed them where I was, how fab the bedroom was, showed my nephew where the private swimming pool with the water fall was as it was just next to my bedroom...

Right after it was opened, I spent some nights at Kanishka, and this year it's still maintained as brand new villas, an elegant and tranquil getaway more than I had expected that a villa can offer with details expressing how the management would care for their guests...
Thank you for making my birthday memorable. Great time !
Thank you again, Management and team",Kanishka Villas
536,KANISHKA - A SUPERB VILLA,50,May 2010,"In staying at Kanishka Villas for 2 nights we were extremely impressed with the lay-out of the villa and its contemporary and extremely comfortable furnishings. Many villas todays are too minimalistic but at Kaniskha it felt like being at home.
The lay-out of the villas is such that if you’re a couple, you use only one of two bedrooms. Although the upper level bedroom is slightly larger, we chose the ground floor as my husband is in a wheelchair and we had absolutely no problem in moving around the living, outdoor, bedroom and bathroom areas of the villa. The bedroom lay-out is ideal for 2 couples with complete privacy from each other.
My husband was absolutely thrilled to be able to get Fox News channel (among so many others) as we had stayed at a number of villas and hotels previously on this trip where it wasn’t available.
We couldn’t help but use the inviting pool the moment we arrived, and also enjoyed some after-dinner swims.
Although tempted to use the inhouse menu when our friends visited, we decided to get some “nibblies” from the Bali Deli just a few mins. away. We were going to Made’s Warung for dinner (just close by) but then decided to eat in so our butler arranged to get the menu, assisted with our order and then delivered the food to us when ready. Fantastic service!
Although we have stayed in other villas along Jalan Kunti, we found the location of Kanishka to be much more central, with easy access.
The staff were among the most helpful we’ve ever come across in Bali. Kanishka – you’re doing a great job and we’ll be back!",Kanishka Villas
537,"Great architectural designs, yet allows the outside in",40,April 2010,"The rooms at Kaniska are well thought and deisgned for privacy and are striving for difference in a ever competitive market. Privacy is appreciated, yet the cost of these modern villas is the noise. Open air living rooms and spaces unfortunately let this establishment down. We were put next to a family and heard everything they said, coughing and children speaking over a television wth more speakers than you need in a home theatre! We do not normally complain, yet we were suffering a fever and trying to complete some writing. So we were moved the next day to another villa, therre was building going on but that was not to be fault of the villas. Our pool fountain drowned that noise out so we could live with that, but then after from returning a day our we were put next to some a group of young ones that had just arrived and excited about thier holiday so of course thier music is on, loud and we could not rest with this. So again we mentioned this hoping not to be comlaining again, but when you spend more than what is available aound you, the expectations increase also!. The staff did some more shuffling and we were left with some quiet again. We too heard the dog bark, but it stops every time after a few short barks, no different to what we wish our dogs to do if someone was near our premises! It was not a problem. You dont go here to have a tranquil holiday, yet you do go for a little quiet from the fast paced and busy trendy Seminyak area. The food as commented was a little bland, I cook day in and out and I would like to see an improvement to the menu as there are many people who wish to stay in and relax by the pool or watch a movie. As said by management there is a new chef, so hopefully a new varied menu, no more items yet different will be a worthwhile project. Our breakfast was always hot, so looks like they have started to make some changes. We also stayed at Gending Kedis, as my partner was sick and as a foodie it gave me an opportunity to try out a bit of thier food also. Perhaps some shared dishes could be implimented from GK to Kaniska! if the facilities are available.
All in all, a good concept, a team that are well selected and with some more attention to detail for the room detail and noise minimisation these villas are a winning formula. One of the staff even lent me her laptop because the loan one was unavaiable! service was certainly fantastic. A great place to stay for two sets of couples or a small group of friends because of the layout of the rooms, but this is not a party place! great location, fantastic shopping and staff worth employing in our own business!",Kanishka Villas
538,Hiden Gem,50,March 2010,"We spent three days in thriving Seminyak at Kanishka Villas,

The villas are beautifully finished and the customer service was second to none!

We found the location of the Kanishka Villas perfect for getting around the eateries and souvenir shops in Seminyak.

For Nyepi day, when the Balinese celebrate their New Year in total silence, we decided to move to Gending Kedis, managed by the same group for a little peace and serenity.

The property is incredibly beautiful and strategically located on the Jimberan Bay, close to the internationally acclaimed New kuta/Pecatu Championship Golf Course.

From the time we arrived until our departure, the guest recognition, service , food & beverage

and experience was something we will never forget.

We cant wait to return and live it all over again!

Thank you for making our holiday so special and memorable!

539,high class looks & service- great value.,40,January 2010,"stayed in double villa with another australian couple. Definately had the wow factor in walking into the villa. Very impressed with staff and the location.. walking distance to some great restaurants and shopping. The villa was finished off well with a very modern feel and decor. the pool was excellent size and the whole space of the villa was fine for 4 adults only. well appointed. The outdoor bathroom was clean and fitted out well. we would have no hesitations in recommending this villa to anyone. It had everything we could have imagined and we had no complaints.
lovely turndown service, efficient housekeeping. The laundry service was very expensive for info. Highly recommended to anyone. Really good. enjoy.",Kanishka Villas
540,Disappointing,20,November 2009,"With the previous reviews I had read I was expecting something really nice but both my husband and I were very disappointed. The fact that we had stayed at the most beautiful resort, at much the same price,(Viceroy in Ubud) for 2 days before didn't really help our impression. Kanishka looked much more than 1 year old.
It was also quite noisy with each villa's living area being open and abutting one another. The breakfasts were very mediocre. There was also a cigarette but at the side of the pool.",Kanishka Villas
541,Kanishka Weekend Getaway,40,November 2009,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kanishka Villa, it has a good location yet still provides the kind of privacy I need. I paticularly liked the layout and design of the villa, eventhough you won't get decent sunlight to get tan by the pool, but you get it a little bit too much in the bedroom. The living room was cozy enough for me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend was a bit dissapointed by the internet connection, it was down most of the time and the mosquitos can be a pain at times. And for a villa with adequate home entertainment system installed, it's still missing an ipod connector.",Kanishka Villas
542,"Beautiful villas, great staff but it lacks finish",40,October 2009,"There's good and bad with this place. I'll start with the good. Firstly the villas are extremely spacious, especially villa no 1. My wife and I travelled with our daughter but could easily see the villas being able to accommodate a family of 4. Although both of the huge upstairs and downstairs bedrooms had double beds in all of the villas we looked at so its probably best to check with management on the availabilty of single beds. 
The staff here are very friendly and are quick to try and rectify any problems that may occur from time time. We had a noise issue at villa number 8 and were offered a choice of another 7 villas to move to in an instant - no questions asked. More on that later. 
Most of the villas are quite beautiful even if poorly finished. A previous blogger made the comment that the kanishka villas are not for the discerning traveller and he's quite right on many fronts. The buildings are constructed to Balinese standards which are never good. For us, this was nothing because being regular travellers to Bali means we've given up on going over everything with a fine tooth comb. With kanishka it's best to just sit back, relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Our original villa was number 8 and from what I saw it was the pick of the bunch but unfortunately was affected by noisy neighbours across the laneway.  
The location is quite covenient being close to Bali deli, jalan sunset and Jalan Seminyak. It's about 5 mins to the beach by Taxi  and restaurants, shops and spas are all in the general vicinity.
Now the bad.
The food here is not great to be honest and rarely served at the right temperature. In an 8 night stay our American breakfasts were all served cold so in the end we resorted to pancakes. The meal portions were all small and simple things like coffee was served up cold. This is something you'd expect at a budget hotel or Bali in the 1990's not at a $400 a night villa in this day and age where travellers are more discerning. Management needs to rectify this urgently otherwise my friends at kanishka won't get repeat business.
The noise here can be an issue particularly for light sleepers like me. The open plan of the villas does nothing to eliminate noise. I had 2 sleepless nights and on the 3rd found myself wearing ear plugs and sleeping on the downstairs lounge - completely unacceptable when you're in this price bracket!  Thankfully the manager Pande was kind enough to relocate us to villa 1 and even sourced some earplugs for me! 
The wi-fi is complimentary and is on 24/7 which for me was great however upon moving to villa number 1 I found that the wi-fi didn't work so had to communicate by standing outside the front of my villa to get a shared signal. If you haven't travelled to bali before you might find it infuriating but these things do happen frequently over here.
All in all I think the kanishka lacks finesse and ignores the finer details which is a real shame because the staff here deserve more - they're just so damn nice! I think if this place just polished up it's act and paid attention to the finer details they'd be onto a winning formula. I'll definitely drop in again to say hi and maybe even book a night or two but hopefully next time they've rectified some of the issues mentioned above.",Kanishka Villas
543,It was just great...,50,July 2009,"stayed a Kanishka July 2009, the staff, the accomodation all was great, very private. The in house menu was a little shy of perfect, but the breakfast made up for that, (an espresso machine would be a good addition)but there are plenty of eating places just around the corner, very convenient to Bali Deli if you want to shop out and cook for yourself.
To the beach or any other good restaurant, shop etc. just ask and they'll drive you and pick you up when you indicate.

545,Get your relaxation on!,50,June 2009,"This was probably the least known hotel that we stayed at in Bali. We stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. While the location wasn't perfect (it's not on a beach) it didn't even matter. The rooms were completely private with a personal pool, outdoor living room/kitchen and bathroom. It was really wonderful showering in the open air (obviously with walls around you). It really felt like paradise.

Our room booking also included a massage. It was completely amazing, lasting about 1 hour, and finishing off with our tub being filled with flower petals reading ""Bali"". Just writing this review makes me wish we were back there.

If the primary purpose of your trip is relaxation, this would be the hotel I recommend in Bali. If you want recreation (beaches, hiking, etc.) there may be better options.",Kanishka Villas
546,Great place to stay at Seminyak,50,August 2009,"I stayed in Kanishka Villas from 12-14 August and had good overall experience. It was our honeymoon and first trip to Bali and we felt Kanishka Villas had offered us some of the best value-for-money for spacious and good-service stay in Seminyak.

The Villas was located at Jalan Kunti and was within walking and taxi distance to some of the popular restaurants. We tried Balinese lunch at Made's, had french breakfast at Cafe Moka and enjoyed some of the best fusion of Balinese and pan-Asian dinner at Chandi (which the Villas offered to shuttle us there free). There is also a premium Bali Deli supermarket nearby.

Nordini (if I spelt it correctly) assisted us to check-in and was our Butler for next 2 days. She was polite, friendly and took efforts to make sure we settled down happily. The Villa has two bedrooms - one on second floor directly above the living and dining room, and the other on ground floor across the private pool. Both bedrooms come with open shower and large bathtube. Nordini showed us both patiently to allow us to decide which one we would like to stay as we had booked for only one bedroom. There was fruits basket and mocktails to welcome us upon check-in, and Nordini even bother to explain that the drinks were pineapple and mango juices mixed with sugared-soda. We really appreciated these gestures.

Our booking came with breakfast, which Nordini would cheerfully come into our villa to take our order (default is continental breakfast but you can top-up for American breakfast or others) and later come back to set up the table and laid out the breakfast. I remembered I had first asked for toast as choice of bread but Nordini counter-suggested to take mixed of breads instead which we later found out that the croissant bread was one of the nicest.

The interior decor of the villa was nice overall. My wife loved the lush part, in particular, the hanging vines which simply makes the whole atmosphere more serene. We would just sit by the pool for hours. The 'splashing' sound of water streaming into the pool makes the experience beyond description.

The bedroom was nice. The feeling of waking up in the morning overlooking into the living room and pool was great. We had a little problem with the safe box but the technicians were quick to response. It would be helpful if the management include instructions to operate the safe box.

The bathroom was spacious. I love the open-air standing shower amidst the plants and pebbled floors. We bought mineral salts and soaked ourselves in the bathtub at night, chatting and listening to the night cries of insects under the moon and cozy lighting. And yes, the staffs had also placed a mosquitoes' coil in the bathroom too. Do note that standard bathroom amenities were not provided, or comprehensive at least. We were given only soap and shower cap.

Daily turn-down service was great. We were not in the Villa but the staffs would just set up everything - turn on the lights, set up the mosquitoes shield (not that there were a lot of mosquitoes, but the additional efforts to make sure we would not suffer even a single bite), leaving the turn-down cakes (we seriously think the Villas should improve on this - we knew it was meant to be small bites but the visual presentation could be done better) on the dinner table etc.

To sum it up, Kanishka Villas is a great place to stay to experience Seminyak region and enjoy downtown life. It is not a resort by the beach so if you want to experience beachfront living then this is not the place. There were sounds of airplanes occasionally but it did not bother us anyway. And Internet Wi-Fi was free by-the-way.",Kanishka Villas
547,"An Oasis of Luxury, Calm and Tranquility in the Heart of Semniyak.",50,July 2009,"After a week at Gending Kedis, our party (two adults & two girls) stayed at the Kanishka villas in Seminyak. These villas are situated in town which allowed us easy access to the local shops, markets and restaurants. After a relaxing week at Gending Kedis we were ready to experience the 'buzz'of the town.

The villa was very spacious, tastefully furnished and fully equipped to meet the needs of the discerning traveller.

Whilst you are right in the heart of the town, returning to the villa after day of shopping provided you with a sense of relaxtion and tranquility. This is due to the pool being the focal point of the villa around which everything else is planned.

Another beautiful experience in Bali.",Kanishka Villas
548,Lovely villa and staff.,40,August 2009,"I actually stayed at the same time the 'other' reviewer did who was not happy.
It's true that there was a dog barking at times, but that was when people were passing, it soon stopped. There was a night that one of the villas in the alley had a very loud party, but after contacting reception they sent security there, twice, to quieten them down. I understand though that they are not owned by Kanishka but they did all they could to solve the problem.

I thought the villas were lovely and most comfortable. The staff were incredibly helpful even racing downtown to change money for me.
The breakfasts were delicious and wonderfully set out each morning in our villa.
The picked me up to show me the property before I moved there from my previous villa and were nothing but polite and most accommodating.
The area was fantastic, though i had no interest in the beach so couldnt say how far away it was, I was there to wander around the shops and there are certainly many of them. There are plenty of restaurants and with beautiful food too at such a ridiculously cheap price.
I needed medical attention whilst there and they organised a doctor to attend to me almost immediately.
I have stayed at some beautiful five star places in different countries and would have no hesitation in recommending this villa.
Their place Gending Kedis in Jimbaran though is exceptional and sooo peaceful as mentioned in the reply.",Kanishka Villas
549,Villa at Seminyak,40,August 2009,"Kanishka Villa is located very conveniently just steps away from shops and restaurants. It’s only approximately 30 minute away from the airport, and is about a 10-15 minutes ride away from the beach. The hotel provides a shuttle to and from the beach, but you’ll have to charter a car to send you to the airport.

The villa is very spacious and decorated beautifully – there is a kitchenette, dining area, living room, a pool, two large bedrooms and spacious bathrooms. The biggest drawback is the large number of mosquitoes around the villa. Although the hotel provided bug spray and mosquito coils during turn down service, there were still too many mosquitoes around.",Kanishka Villas
550,Not for the discerning traveller,20,August 2009,"I travel to Bali several times a year, usually to take a 'working-break' out of the distractions of the office ... to just get down to working for a few days. I tried Kanishka as it seemed new, and even though the reviews on here were remarkably focussed on the Villa's glassware (??) I thought I would give it a go.

This proved to my (and my work's) detriment. On the second day there my laptop was broken somehow whilst I was out and the Villa was being cleaned. I assume it was accidentally dropped from the wardrobe, where it was. So - no more work. I can accept these things happen, however the immediate response from staff was that I signed that they were not responsible for my personal items, and that they would 'look into it'. I got the same line from three staff. Yet never an apology - which would have been enough, but they couldnt seem to offer even that, or any type of solution.

The whole place reeked of 'Amature-Hour'

The layout of the Villas is different to a lot of similar proprties in Seminyak, in the way that they are all in a straight line next to each other (better complexes have them splayed out so as to reduce contact with the next Villa). This meant anything happening over the brick wall on either side could be heard, not very private. The Kanishka Villas face residential houses on the other side of the alley .... this alley should be re-named 'Barking-Dog Alley' as all you hear every night is dogs barking and fighting constantly.
The Kanishka Villas are also directly underneath the flight path, again not making the place particularly quiet.

It is a long walk to the nearest beach, and not an easy one with the state of the footpaths in that area of Seminyak.

In all, I would recommend this place for those just moving from 2 star hotels to something a little bit more 'up-market'. But for the discerning traveller who values service standards, and genuine peace and quiet --- there are many better Villas in Seminyak.",Kanishka Villas
551,Great Place to Stay,50,July 2009,"Just returned from a week in Bali. Kanishka Villas are, as the other reviews say, beautiful. The layout is very good and the overall look of the villa is 'WOW'. Sounds cliche'd, but they do look like a spread from a Vogue catalogue. Villa living area leads on to the gorgeous open-air pool. Really lovely. Everything muted, lots of wood and planting - highly relaxing. Bedrooms are really nice, very well done - big four poster beds and beautiful linen. We slept really well. The open-air bathrooms are terrific and look fabulous.

The staff are extremely attentive - the butler service for breakfast every day, was very indulgent. Lovely food. Great sound system and TV to relax to, sitting by the pool. Great location, just down a side street, but positioned in a prime spot for restaurants and shopping (shopping and more shopping). There are about 3 very good restaurants within 1 minute walk of the Villas (on Jalan Kunti) - Italian, Chinese/Indonesian and Indonesian. All serve REALLY good food and very cheap. No problems with ice in drinks, etc. All use bottled water for ice cubes and for mixing in drinks.

Now for the very minor negatives. We travelled as a family - 2 children 10/13. The configuaration of the villas is such that there is a bedroom downstairs by the pool and one upstairs. For those with young children this is not ideal - you are not able to hear them. I found this a little unnerving the first night (neuroses were working overtime) but they were fine. Bedrooms all have locks on and I think the kids probably enjoyed having the 'house to themselves'. Only other thing is to make sure the mozzie coils are in place early. They are hungry little blighters.

One word about Seminyak itself, with regards to moneychangers - stick to places that do not charge a commission. Slightly lower exchange rate, but you get what you paid for. We were short-changed by a backstreet agent (trust me, they were good - better than any Vegas card-sharp) and we heard the same thing happens all the time. If a money-changer gives you all 20,000 rps notes, it is a scam - lots of notes to confuse you and then the 'palming' happens after you have counted (and recounted) the money. Enjoy!",Kanishka Villas
552,This was a 'Proper' holiday - we felt fully rested when we got home.,50,June 2009,"This was our first visit to Gending Kedis and the Kanishka Villas. We stayed for 5 nights in each location.

We were picked up after midnight by a smart resort mini-bus. Our plane had been delayed for 3 hours. What a relief to climb into the back of the cool mini-bus and be welcomed with a cold drink and a smile.

Our Gending Kedis (Bird Song in Balinese) villa was very private, clean, cool and welcoming – not overlooked at all. In fact, I didn't want to leave it for the first two days except for a couple of trips to the Spa for a massage – we had our sumptious meals delivered to the villa – pure luxury.

I loved my time there. I loved living at the top of the green forest canopy at Gending Kedis – breakfasting on Eggs Benedict in the treetop restaurant with the Balinese birdlife, vibrant and colourful. I loved doing my 'beached whale' impressions in the villa pool, private as pie. I loved how quiet it all was.

After our five days of deep-tissue relaxing at Gending Kedis we moved to a Kanishka Villa.

The Kanishka Villas are more 'in town' and are close to nightlife, restaurants etc. These generous 2-bedders are very Chic. Each with a large plunge-pool and lounging and dining area. An on-site kitchen can provide every meal or no meals delivered to the villa; each villa also has a fully kitted out kitchen. They do Eggs Benedict there as well :)

These villas are all very new and top-quality with soft furnishings and all the mod-cons to match. The service at the villas is what you might expect in a 5 star hotel – I can't recommend them highly enough. A real holiday break. We will definitely be coming back.

In summary, just one sentence. When I got home I realised that my house needed a full make-over.",Kanishka Villas
553,Tropical Garden Villas,50,May 2009,"My partner & I stayed for 5 nights. We have stayed in Seminyak a few times in the last 16 months and Kanishka Villa's is one of the best situated villas. Close to restaurants (great & cheap Italian/Pizza just a couple of door away), Bali Deli for your snacks, walking distance to Jalan Oberoi (main eat street) or Jalan Raya Seminyak for more restaurants and lots of shopping. The villas are beautifully presented with comfortable and stylist furnishings. We loved that all throughtout the villa there were plenty of plants even in the outdoor showers area (stunning). The private pool was a good size and the sun lounges were comortable. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful, I mentioned one morning to our butler that is was my partners birthday and that night they presented him with a chocolate cake & sang happy birthday - so cute. There was nothing to fault with either the villa, amenities (they even have the best select of glasses for any type of drink you could imagine - upper class restaurant quality), or the staff. When we continued our holiday to Lombok & Gili Tranwangan and then once we got home (Jakarta) we have been recommending Kanishka Villas to everyone we talk to about staying in Bali. Whenever we go back to Bali we will be staying there.",Kanishka Villas
554,Perfect Bali Luxury Getaway,50,June 2009,"Thank-you Kanishka for a truly unforgettable holiday in Bali! We have travelled to Bali on numerous occasions, however our time spent at Kanishka surpassed all our other hotel experiences.

We thoroughly enjoyed living in the lap of luxury! Having the private pool was ideal for the children. It really enabled us to enjoy much needed lie in’s.

The attention to detail and service was impeccable. Having the private butler and baby sitting facilities really enabled us to unwind.

We really felt Kanishka was an oasis right in the heart of Seminyak. The location is fantastic having all the shops and restaurants at your door step, yet when we were in the villas we felt a world away from anywhere.

Thanks again for such an enjoyable stay. It is without hesitation we would recommend Kanishka for a perfect Bali holiday. Look forward to coming back soon!",Kanishka Villas
555,a relaxing week in seminyak,40,June 2009,"our flight arrive well before checkin time and we went straight to the villas and after a very short wait we checked in about 2 hours early! the service was extremely good and the finish on our villa excellent with everything working , opening ang closing (not always the case in bali) the breakfast was adequate but the best meal we had all week(including restaurants}. was from the cooking class they run at the villas. we had the leftovers for dinner.they even suprised my wife with a birthday cake. would not hesitate to recommend kanishka villas to my friends",Kanishka Villas
556,The Kanishka was the perfect place to relax and unwind in a gorgeous setting with top service.,50,May 2009,"The Kanishka villas provided a serene and luxurious setting for me and my partner to unwind from our busy lifestyles. Although we were tempted to stay in the comfort of the villa our entire weekend, we took advantage of the central location to do some shopping in Bali's best shopping precent and also to take the short walk to the beach for sunset drinks. But by far the loveliest times were spent in the open plan living area where the tropical outdoors seems to melt into the lounge and dining areas. The service too was excellent. The staff were friendly and unobtrusive yet catered for our every need, going out of their way to help us at times.
I thought the value was exceptional and couldn't believe how gorgeous the villas were and how lucky we were to find such a place. I would highly recommend the Kanishka to people looking for high quality accommodation and service in a great location.",Kanishka Villas
557,I can really relax here and I am close to everything I like in Bali,40,February 2009,"For both of us Seminyak is a great area with so many boutique shops for clothes, accessories, and interiors, as well as being in the zone of the best restaurants and most active bars in Bali (up market that is). I had meetings at Nirwana Bali and Bali Golf and Country Club at Nusa Dua so the location directly between the two and very close to the main road (called the by-pass) was ideal
We can say that our stay there was very pleasant indeed. One aspect I really liked was to openness from the lounge room into the pool area.
I was the one working and when I got on the internet to do my messages, it was wonderfully relaxing to be looking directly to the pool to the sculptured stonework and greenery. The other impression I had was that of warm natural light, while at the same time I felt totally protected from the weather, which was fine every day except one where there was a few hours of downpour.
It is down a drive off the main road so noise was never a problem.
I am at present planning to build a house in the mountains, so I was looking carefully at all the design features and finishings.
There were some very interesting touches, such as that openness (which we love, especially as warm Bali weather permits it). Another small touch was the open to air greenery behind glass to the bedroom on the ground floor, instead of building the bedroom wall right up to the boundary. The bedrooms of course are closed off and air conditioned.
My overall impression was that of artistic quality with a functionality that made it very livable.
When I turned my computer off I felt obliged to be indulgent and lazy - by the pool on the deck chair with my drink.
Every time I leave the bustle of Jakarta or Bangkok (where I am now) for Bali, something about it touches me with a sense of homeliness and inner peace.
That’s how we felt at Kanishka.",Kanishka Villas
558,KANISKH-A-MAZING,40,April 2009,"Kaniskha is just 5 minutes walk from Seminyak shopping areas and the facilities (kitchen, pool, DVD) are great. Very suitable for a party of four.. you can also reach Cafe warisan by taxi for about only Rp.10.000 ++ ... Great Location..",Kanishka Villas
