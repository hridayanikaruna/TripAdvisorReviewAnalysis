0,Great experience at U Paasha Bali,50,April 2023,"Lovely stay , very convenient location for shopping and eating , 10 mins walking to the beach . Breakfast was superb , stuffs are very attentive .
Rooms are very big with big washroom. Our room view wasn’t that great but I didn’t mind that.
Rooftop swimming pool is big and relaxing . There is a rooftop bar as well where you can order . I mean this is one of the best hotels in that area hands down.",U Paasha Seminyak
1,"Friendly staff, buffet breakfast had a good variety of options. Rooms are big but decor is outdated, like the pool.",30,April 2023,"Good location, value is reasonable. Selling point is the late check out. Staff are friendly and polite. Buffet breakfast has a decent selection of offerings. Rooms are big, however the decor is old and the rooftop pool is showing signs of age.",U Paasha Seminyak
2,Excellent place,50,April 2023,"The hotel is generally excellent. The room size is very good and the breakfast is varied. The swimming pool is distinct and the view is wonderful... The hotel staff is cooperative and distinguished, especially at the times of entry and final exit (check up). Only attention is lacking in a place for massage and halal food for Muslims ay breakfast",U Paasha Seminyak
3,Recommend,40,April 2023,"Spacious room and bathroom, good breakfast, big rooftop pool, lovely staff. Close to everything. Check in was easy. Scooter higher was easy and affordable through the hotel. Recommend staying here for convenience.",U Paasha Seminyak

5,Top hotel for price,50,April 2023,For us everything at this hotel was spot on. The bed especially was better then my home and room was super quiet. Great sleep. Breakfast suited our needs and the staff were all very helpful. Location is great as well,U Paasha Seminyak
6,"Safe, Clean, Friendly",50,April 2023,"A perfect place to land after arriving in Bali. The room we stayed in had a huge, comfortable king size bed that was perfectly cozy after a long flight. The bathroom sink had nice counter space and we liked that the toilet was separated from the shower. If you want them to service the room daily you get two free water bottles each time which was much appreciated. The rooftop pool was very relaxing and the service team was there to bring you drinks.
The staff is incredible, Welfry and Alin in particular were so helpful and courteous during our stay. Thanks to them and the team we felt completely safe and at ease during our four nights here.
Also, the breakfast is out of this world. I’ve never seen so many options for a hotel breakfast buffet. I’d stay again just for that alone.
Thank you to all the staff at U Paasha. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
7,A comfortable stay.,50,April 2023,My wife and I stayed at U Paasha Seminyak for 3 nights. The room was spacious and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful.

Attentive front desk crew and able to speak english fluently. Overall nice big hotel for singles and small families. It's near to Seminyak Square Mall which is the heart of town and KUTETA.

23,Wonderful stay,50,March 2023,"Me and my wife stayed a total of 4 nights with breakfast included. Breakfast selection of indo food was amazing. Loved how they had order sheets for different types of eggs on each table, so there was no need to queue at all at usual egg stations. Our room was spacious and clean with a huge double bed. The balcony and drying rack allowed us to hang our swimwear out to dry which was great! Pool was warm which was amazing. Staff was polite and friendly. Shoutout to Alin who was present at the front desk most of our stay. We were able to communicate comfortably in English with her. Best of all, the hotel was located along the Main Street of seminyak, which was so convenient. We took a 15 min stroll to Petitenget beach as well :)",U Paasha Seminyak
24,A home away from home and relaxing retreat.,50,March 2023,"Check-in time is your check out time, so if you arrive later at night and your return flight is also at night, your room is available all that departure day. No need to worry about checking out at 10am and wondering what to do all day and stowing luggage.

If you don't make the breakfast buffet, you can still have breakfast sent to your room all day! This is a great feature.

The staff are always smiling and there to help with whatever you need. And I highly recommend the hotel massage service, it's very competitively priced! Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seminyak, it's central to everything!

The room was huge and had everything I needed. And there is a convenient store right across the road, and some amazing restaurants right across the road (Chandi and Ginger Moon are standouts).

The food in the hotel was also worth it if you're feeling lazy by the pool!

Thanks to Alin at the front desk and Ari at the rooftop pool and bar.",U Paasha Seminyak

29,Second visit - Even better than the first,50,March 2023,"I love this hotel. The pool is stained, the rooms are incredible, bed so comfortable, the breakfast is just so good, hardly any kids... but mostly it's the staff.
The staff are either really good actors or they are well looked after and love their job because they just could not be more attentive and caring. From the front desk staff all the way to the room attendants. They try to put their own stamp on their service.
We had a small but annoying issue with our room. They made sure we were listened to and then pulled out all the stops to fix it.
We were acknowledged as repeat customers and given an extra special amazing treat which was so well appreciated.
We will be back.
Did I mention the breakfast? So many vegan options and in the days when it was a little light on the chef would prepare us something just for us.",U Paasha Seminyak
30,Great Hotel right in the heart of Seminyak,50,March 2023,"I stayed here in March 2023 for 7 nights with my partner and the hotel exceeded expectations, It is located in the heart of eat street, so there is no shortage of quality restaurants and watering holes on your doorstep. The rooms are spacious and clean and the rooftop pool and bar are amazing and give full panoramic views of the south of Bali and a great spot for an evening drink to watch the sunset over the ocean. Most rooms are set far enough back from the street so that you have a peaceful time when in your room and it is about a 10 minute walk down to either Ku de tah or Mano's beach bars which are both great spots to visit.
The staff are both friendly and attentive and a special thankyou to Ewa who helped with every request we had. The buffet breakfast is amazing with a lot of choices both decedent and healthy. Would 100% stay here again on my next visit.",U Paasha Seminyak

Large clean well air conditioned rooms. Breakfast so many options to enjoy. The staff cannot do enough for you. It was great to see Tya’s smiling face again, a shout out to all the men on security helping to ensure I was safe as I was travelling solo. They spend long hours standing in the heat so I always took them a cold drink and some Aussie chocolate. Thank you to Detha, look forward to seeing you again. I also had an amazing massage and body scrub in my room it was heaven.",U Paasha Seminyak

Hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of Seminyak shops, bars and restaurants and a short walk to the beach. Our room was spacious, well appointed, comfortable and very clean and the bed was ever so comfortable. Breakfast was great - plenty of variety.

We stayed in Suite with a King size bed with a view on the 5th Floor and found the room very spacious along with great size bathroom which included a very spacious shower. Rooftop pool was lovely and quite large. Staff were warm, welcoming and happy to assist. Walking distance to shops, flea markets and Kudeta (highly recommend).

65,Disappointment!,10,December 2022,"Due to unfortunate circumstances, I was no longer able to travel. I contacted the hotel ahead of time to ask if I could receive a refund, they said No as the reservation was non-refundable.
As I requested to cancel ahead of travel, I felt this policy was very inflexible as they probably rented out the room anyway, therefore getting paid twice!
Extremely disappointed with their reservation policy, DO NOT BOOK!",U Paasha Seminyak
66,"Great value, location and staff",50,December 2022,Affordable accommodation centrally located in Seminyak. The rooms are spotless and facilities great. The staff are a huge asset to this hotel. They consistently go above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your stay.,U Paasha Seminyak
67,A great place to stay with family,50,December 2022,"Clean, spacious, money value, strategic, nice breakfast and also friendly staff. More than i expect. Really appreciate the clean bed linen and really cold AC. The bathroom is too open for family somehow but still ok",U Paasha Seminyak
68,"Location is great, but the room needs some improvements!",30,December 2022,"Let m me start by saying that the staff of u paasha have done their best. They’re really friendly and helpful.

However, all of their hard works were not really supported with the hotel facilities that are getting older and outdated.

The room (321) was spacious, but since the hotel design is quite open, if your room close to the entrance, you will hear everything. Please ask for quiet rooms which are located far way back if you need a good night sleep.
The bed is from King Koil and that says enough of the best quality of the bed.

In the room, there were lots of stains here and there (check the headboard of the bed)
The air conditioner was old and making really loud sounds when operating.
The bathroom looks clean, but if you look closer, you will see black molds on the walls and on the corners.

The swimming pool at the rooftop was big and spacious, but lots of broken tiles in the pool which are dangerous if you accidentally step on it

The most disappointing point is that i was here to celebrate new year. There suppose to be a dinner event at the rooftop with bbq, party, door prizes etc

Well, i have to say, that event was not done profesionally. There were lots of foods. But that’s it. It could have been done so much better considering it was new year “party”

Having said all of these, I appreciate that the manager had a chance to talk to me in person about some of my concerns I mentioned above. The staff at the restaurant also recognized my birthday and made me a special birthday pancake.

I believe that this hotel can improve a lot by doing a deep cleaning in the rooms, maybe some renovations.",U Paasha Seminyak
69,"Great stay with large room, delicious break fast and helpful staff",50,December 2022,"Room is spacious, breakfast is delicious with a lot of options, staff is helpful (special mention to Eva that help me to book grab when i could not get one on my own) and always there to help you when you need it! Great stay and will definitely choose this hotel again if i were to visit seminyak again!",U Paasha Seminyak
70,Will be back,50,December 2022,"Massive room in the heart of Seminyak, the pool and the gym made it perfect.
Breakfast spot on too.
Staff very friendly room always clean.
Had zero issues staying the hotel.
Not a party hotel.
☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️",U Paasha Seminyak
71,We will be back!,50,December 2022,"We will stay again (for the following reasons)
- huge rooms/bathrooms
- newly renovated rooms (we stayed in 205 & 207)
- super friendly/helpful staff (in all areas)
- lovely roof top pool and we’ll equiped gym in the basement
- a great range of breakfast options. Many changed daily
- well managed. We had some issues with noisey guests disturbing our sleep. The issue was well managed.
- location, location, location…. In the heart of east street.

Possible improvements
- roof top bar cocktails were very inconsistent. The same cocktails tasted different each day. Sometimes not good at all.
- ensure enough working treadmills. We tried to use one several times but there were either being used or not working.

Thanks for a wonderful stay U Paasha team",U Paasha Seminyak
72,Great value and location,40,December 2022,"U Paasha was a great experience. The rooms are very spacious and with a modern interior. The toilet and shower have a frosted glass door but essentially open to the room. Some might enjoy this style but a bit intimate when performing natural body functions. The room has no clock, which is strange but not a huge deal. The room has no view. I'm not sure if all rooms are the same but being only 5 floors, I don't think anyone had a view. The staff were top notch. The pool was nice and shallow for the kids.

The location was perfect as it had all major and minor conveniences right outside the door. The road is busy but I didn't hear the traffic. The beach was a 10 to 15 minute walk. Definitely not an issue considering the difference in price for a beach property.

We had small snacks from the rooftop restaurant and it was quite good. The breakfast was good and provided a good selection.

Overall, I'm going to be recommending this hotel to my friends and family. We thought that it provided really good value and convenience.",U Paasha Seminyak
73,Holiday Stay,50,December 2022,"Amazing experience here! The staff was top notch and location was spot on with an amazing gym.

74,Good location and spacious room,40,December 2022,"Friendly and accommodating hotel staff.
Good location- 5 mins walk to seminyak square
Plenty of restaurants nearby.
Breakfast selection is not bad. Changes to the dishes and juices daily.
Rooftop view is sensational, u can catch a good sunset view from the roof top.
Housekeeping is fantastic. Did a great job in keeping the place clean.
Floor of the room are not sticky like some other hotels .
Comfy bed. Nice that they have a 2 sink option for their room toilet.
Room is very spacious despite extra bed. Can practically do somersault in the room.
Plenty of sitting area in the room with sofa and bench and deck chair.
Toilet is open concept with frosty glass, not much privacy on this.
Overall a pleasant and wonderful hotel stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
75,Bali 2022,50,December 2022,"Great location and friendly staff that’s what makes a holiday enjoyable, all the staff at U Paasha were very helpful I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family walking distance to restaurants near by",U Paasha Seminyak
76,Our Stay,50,November 2022,"Can not fault this place, the room was clean, large and had great air conditioning. The staff were amazing, so polite and accomodating and really made us feel at home. We loved the roof top pool with amazing views and the included breakfast Buffett was delicious.",U Paasha Seminyak
77,U Paasha Seminyak,50,November 2022,"U Paasha :). Simply gorgeous! Not only the place, but its people as well. We are treated very warmly and kindly, which we appreciate so much. Everyone from the restaurant, to the service crew, and the front desk have accommodated our simple requests and ensured our comfort, first and foremost. I'd like to comment Eva, Ardhi, and Andy most especially, for their kind consideration. There's no other place to go back to but to U Paasha <3",U Paasha Seminyak
78,Hidden Gem,50,December 2022,"My friend and I loved U Paasha. The rooms were very big and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable with good linen. Whilst there are elements of the hotel that are a bit dated, this is well and truly made up for by the incredible customer service and friendliness of the staff. Nothing was ever too much trouble and the buffet breakfast was exceptional. Andy, who I think was a trainee, checked us out and he was very professional and ensured that our last interactions were very positive. Location is excellent as well and the sunset and view from the rooftop pool and bar is great. Gym is also very good. Will recommend and stay here again. Thank you UPaasha",U Paasha Seminyak
79,Excellent stay!,50,December 2022,"My 2nd time staying here and no complaints at all. Location are very strategic, lots of places around for food and drinks, room was HUGE and very clean, services are top notch. Hotel facilities are quite decent: rooftop bar, pool, gym, and also in dine menu.

One of the unique things I liked about U Paasha: 24 hours check out time. Very helpful for people who have afternoon/evening flight. Will definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
80,I didn't want to leave !!,50,December 2022,"Where do I start !!
The location , cleanliness , room size and facilities , friendly attentive staff , great food , pool and sunsets , gym so well equipped, breakfast anytime , anywhere and 24hr use of room ...
I can't wait to come back",U Paasha Seminyak
81,This hotel beats so many luxury hotel standards!,50,October 2022,"Stayed in Bali for 2 weeks and paid exorbitant prices for luxury hotels. But we have concluded our most pleasant stay was at U Paasha! Everything about your hotel won hands down! Upon arrival, bell boy was on stand by to collect our luggages. Breakfast selections were very good for such a small space that you have. Staff were very prompt to help us resolve enquiry and they were attentive. In room massage was the best idea ever because we could keep an eye on our child and still enjoy an excellent massage from your masseuses. They were very professional, skills were so much better that other bigger hotels.

Located at the heart of Seminyak, we could walk to the shopping district, very conveniently surrounded with restaurants, bars and convenience shops. Room was spacious. If you are travelling with a child like us, request for a room further away from Main Street, so that the noise level would be minimised.

We will come back again! Thank you for your hospitality!",U Paasha Seminyak
82,U paacha,30,November 2022,"Internet does not connect to Nintendo Switch. Does connect to phone and laptop, but connection was weak/slow. Room TV HDMI ports are out of date, only works with older devices (Not HDMI 2.0 or 2.1; Probably HDMI 1.4 or earlier). Location is great if you want to stay in Seminyak. Service was great, rooms were clean. Airconditioning was nice and cold and the water pressure was great. Great choice if you do not need Wifi or HDMI connectivity.",U Paasha Seminyak
83,Overall good but room condition and environment is not good,40,November 2022,"great location, nice breakfast, and huge room. But when you have a room facing another building, your room will be humid and your bed will be wet, and noisy. Because of the builing sun liging is not coming to your room, and AC dosen't work properly",U Paasha Seminyak
84,"Great location, great staff",50,November 2022,"U Paasha is in an excellent position in Seminyak. Nice big rooms. Helpful staff (especially Eva and Andy). Huge breakfast, and mercifully a well equipped gym to work it off. The rooftop pool and bar have stunning views. We had a family vacation using 5 rooms and everyone was happy.",U Paasha Seminyak
85,U Paasha,40,November 2022,Very nice hotel great staff unfortunately they allowed other guests to smoke in lobby next to breakfast restaurant and even vape in the breakfast restaurant which was intrusive and resulted in conflict with the smoking guests who said they could do whatever they liked there. If you don't smoke be warned this property currently does nothing to stop people ruining your experience in that regard,U Paasha Seminyak
86,Perfectly located with everything you would expect and more.,50,November 2022,"U Paasha is great for couples-massive suites and perfectly located to walk to all the trendy restaurants. Rooftop pool is a great size and the area feels luxurious without being pretentious. Staff are very friendly, Andy was super helpful, he went out of his way to provide exceptional service and was so personable. I would recommend U Paasha to anyone who wants be well located and comfortable in Seminyak without breaking the bank.",U Paasha Seminyak
87,My Fave Hotel in Seminyak,50,November 2022,"I have been staying at U Paasha everytime I visit Bali. Room is beautiful and large with comfortable bed and pillows. Breakfast is amazing, from egg station, pastries, fresh fruits etc and friendly and attentive staff. Big bonus for the 24 hour use of room system. Genius!

New addition to the hotel is the great little gym in the basement. For those of you who are gym junkies, it has good equipments.

The pool is great with amazing view.

This is the first time I came to Bali since the pandemic, and to my surprise they recognised me as a regular and I found a card with a lovely note to welcome me back to the hotel.

From late check in to check out it's been another lovely experience. Thank you for having us and I look forward to returning again :-)",U Paasha Seminyak
88,Disappointing,20,November 2022,"I was excited to stay at this hotel because I had read so many reviews but it was terrible.
The room had this horrible mossy/wet smell that wouldn’t go away. The hotel looks and feels run down. Lots of mould in the bathroom. The bamboo rug was falling apart.
There was a large selection of food at breakfast but nothing was spectacular except the bread pudding. They also did not have many Balinese breakfast dishes. Their egg station was good.",U Paasha Seminyak
89,"Beautiful Hotel, UNACCEPTABLE Bathroom Situation",20,November 2022,"I just spent four nights at U Paasha. The location in Seminyak is wonderful, right in the middle of shops and restaurants, yet the hotel feels peaceful and quiet. From the entrance, the property is breathtaking. Common areas are impressive and immaculately maintained.

The breakfast was incredible, with many excellent veg and non veg options, sweet and savory. The fruit was the freshest I’ve had in Bali. The egg station was good and well organized. Items on the buffet were replenished regularly.

The pool area was another bright spot, well maintained with 360 degree views. You can see the ocean as well as the volcanoes. I did yoga next to the pool each morning, and it was so nice and peaceful. The pool was cleaned regularly. The bar on the pool level was equally wonderful, with a great happy hour deal. Friends staying at other hotels even loved joining for happy hour.

The room was beautiful. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, I slept like a baby, probably my best sleep in weeks.

Service was also great. Every employee we encountered was helpful and kind.

So why only two stars? The bathroom setup is entirely unacceptable if more than one person is staying in the room. It’s as though the room was designed for instagram stories and nobody ever tried actually staying in it for more than an hour before deciding to build it this way. The sink/wash basin area is completely open to the rest of the room. The shower and toilet have the flimsiest of frosted glass doors, leaving little to the imagination visually and nothing to the imagination audibly. This is fine if you’re staying alone, but it is a logistical nightmare for any two people staying together. In my case, I was with a friend. You can’t use any part of the bathroom if one person is asleep, because there is nothing to muffle any sound. No toilet, no sink, no shower. If both people are awake in the room, one could shower or pee if they turn on some music, but forget about pooping. In practical terms, since I’m an early riser, this meant I had to pack a small bag the night before with a bra, toothbrush, toothpaste, water, some reading material, etc. and leave it next to the door so I could quietly exit without totally disrupting my roommate. I’d wake up around 5:30 and go use the toilet next to the pool, which was thankfully very clean. I did not poop in the room one single time, as it would have been hugely disrespectful with the room setup.

I would have given the hotel one star because of this situation, but in the end I thought it would have been fine if staying alone, so that’s why I added a star. If anyone with influence is reading this, please add real doors to your bathrooms!",U Paasha Seminyak
90,Great stay in Seminyak,40,November 2022,U Passha is a great centrally located hotel with a 24 hour check-in/out (great for late night arrivals and departures).

94,Best staff around!,50,November 2022,"My Fiancée and I have stayed at Upashaa twice in the last two months which says something in itself. The rooms are immaculate with the grandest beds possible with a buffet breakfast from western to Indonesian food on offer so the choices are endless.
However it’s the staff here that have made our stays an absolute delight! Indra, Bayu and Andy are the friendliest sweetest staff I have encountered, from remembering our names from our first visit right down to my drink orders and the what I like to eat (club sandwiches to die for). Their English is fantastic, their warmth and service impeccable and they allow me to practice my Indonesian with them without making me fill silly. I would highly recommend Upashaa to anyone I know and to make friends with these 3 staff as for me I think they were the best I have encountered so much so we have booked to come back again next year.",U Paasha Seminyak

The rooms are clean and spacious. The location is very central in Seminyak!

There is breakfast included and j highly recommend the fresh egg dishes they make for you!

The rooftop pool is great and the bar serves both food and drinks throughout the day.

The staff at U Paasha are what make the hotel amazing overall! In particular Indra, Bayu and Andy. Their service ….their customer focus…their ability to help guests with anything and ensure they have top class service is what stands out. If I myself had a hotel…I would hire the 3 of them immediately as they are the best I have seen in hospitality.

Please stay at U Paasha! You would also love it!",U Paasha Seminyak

103,U paasha amazing - Honeymoon 2022,50,October 2022,"Our time at U paasha was amazing. The staff were so amazing and it got to a point where we just had regular conversations with them (it was really a friendly bunch of team). The breakfast was really our highlight especially the local dishes, my favourite over the western dishes which was equally as nice. The room is massive which I really loved - so much space. No issue was ever too much for the team (when tv was fuzzy), they were always ready to support and help. The security team always made us feel safe as there was always someone at the entrance. There are so many shops and amenities around which are all within walking distance. It is around a busy road but it never affected us in any way. So many amazing restaurants nearby and a shopping mall. So a big shoutout to the team for making our honeymoon so amazing ❤️",U Paasha Seminyak
104,Great place to stay in Seminyak!,50,October 2022,"5/5 - great location & staff. I had a pleasant stay for 3 nights. Check in was smooth and they have a flexible 24hr check in system.

I had a problem with my room, it had a sewage smell however the staff swapped my room immediately without hesitation.

Breakfast selection was great and taste good as well.
Upon check out, front desk Sintya was very attentive and friendly.

Overall I like this hotel although it is located at the busy street but walking distance to cafes and shops.

I will come back again next time.",U Paasha Seminyak

109,Our first honeymoon stay in U Paasha,50,October 2022,U Paasha is located in a buzzy area so there are plenty of good eateries and shops nearby.

110,"Great value for money, spacious and central location in Seminyak.",50,October 2022,"Great central location for shops, bars and restaurants in Seminyak. A bit of a walk to the beach, but a great rooftop bar and pool on the 6th floor more than compensates. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with something for everyone. Bedrooms were very spacious and staff were fantastic - very helpful whenever asked - nothing was too much. The only possible criticism was that the air conditioning unit outside our room was noisy.",U Paasha Seminyak

113,10/10 would stay again!!,50,October 2022,"The hotel really nails down what a traveller needs: 24-hour checkin-checkout policy, and “breakfast whenever wherever” which means we can have breakfast at 2pm on our beds right before leaving for the airport after a long night of partying. The location is excellent with plenty of good restaurants, shops, and clubs within walking distance. We were amazed by the very well-equipped gym and the rooftop swimming pool with 360 degree view of Semiyak. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and went over and above with their services.

Bed was large and so comfortable Breakfast was fantastic best one out of the three hotels we stayed in in Bali. The staff are extremely friendly and helped us get a return boat from Gili T Island when there was a Hindu ceremony on and the main port had closed. Staff could not do enough for guests.

118,October Stay 2022,40,October 2022,Room and staff where good and the breakfast was excellent. Lack of pool towels and deck chairs and also the lack of room towels. They also never supplied hand towels or face washing towels. Had to always phone and request them on several occasions.,U Paasha Seminyak
119,Disappointed,30,October 2022,"Has aged poorly and felt the rooms were not as clean and comfortable as previous stay.

Especially the employees were so kind to us. I really appreciate them.
I want to visit again if I come to Seminyak next time.
Thank you all !!",U Paasha Seminyak
122,Disappointing,30,October 2022,"We have stayed at U Paasha many times over the last 5 years. This is our 1st visit back after covid and it has been very disappointing. While the breakfast is still amazing and the staff friendly that’s where the good stuff ends. The bathrooms are showing a lot of wear and tear and the struggle to find a deck chair was a daily issue. There were not enough, if any pool towels available and guests were left laying on the deck it’s self as there were so few chairs available. The rate you pay is the same as pre covid but you are certainly not getting what you pay for. While I once highly recommended this hotel I would probably highly recommend you avoid it until they can fix a few fundamental problems.",U Paasha Seminyak
123,"Great staff, remember your names always with a smile. Nothing is too much for them.",50,September 2022,"We were on a holiday break after being stuck at home due to covid. The rooms were large and have all the amenities you require. the breakfast is great, with a great variety of food which caters for everybody. U Paasha is in a great location right in the heart of Seminyak. Sympathetic staff, as i had a pinched nerve in my lower back, helped me cross the road to the spa across the road where i ha m massages. Coming back into the hotel from outings there was always a glass of iced water waiting for me.",U Paasha Seminyak

Great staff - from the security staff outside to the receptionist in the main lobby to the maids, restaurant staff, rooftop bar staff. They all made sure we'd have a lovely stay at the hotel.
Great room size and bathroom however the bathroom would need some works to be made as looks a bit tired/outdated.",U Paasha Seminyak
126,Fantastic customer service,50,August 2022,"Nice central location, great spot
Rooms are huge!
Pool area was really lovely
Rooms were so quiet too

We won’t forget the kindness they showed us and we will certainly be back for our next trips to Bali
Special mention goes to the lovely front desk staff and manager Geta",U Paasha Seminyak
127,"High quality standard hotel, AMAZING SERVICE!",50,October 2022,"A great hotel near the center of seminyak, we used it as a jetlag recovery hotel on our honeymoon ald first discovery of the island. Close by the sea, with a very nice rooftop pool. High quality standards, spacious rooms, amazing breakfast (both Indonesian and Western options).
Highlight here is the friendly staff, they would do anything for you! Great service by everybody, special mentions to Bayu, Andy & Aprilia! Extra towels, drink service, tourist info when asked about, always with a smile! I would highly recommend!

Seminyak is a busy place, with lots of tourists, markets & traffic but U Paasha is a center of rest in the middle of the chaos.",U Paasha Seminyak
128,Trendy spacious clean and great location.,50,September 2022,"Very modern hotel with large trendy rooms which were very quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Pool on the roof is great, very clean and with sufficient number of loungers. Only stayed for three nights before heading to Nusa Dua for my daughters wedding. Will definitely stay here again. Had to share a bed with my daughter but the bed was so big you would never know there was someone else in it. Awesome stay. Thanks.",U Paasha Seminyak
129,This is a hard one,30,September 2022,"Stayed here from 21st-27th Sept. With all the reviews with have read about U Paasha, we were truly excited to stay here.
The location of the hotel is excellent. Lots of shops, spa, cafes, restaurants, bike rentals, convenience store, supermarket etc. Staff are great and friendly, special mention to Aprilia who was always friendly and attentive to our needs even though she is new on the job. Good decent gym for a fitness fanatic couple like us, but cardio machines could use an upgrade. Nice rooftop pool but a little shallow in my opinion. For the breakfast spread, it was good. You got your eggs and pancakes station. Fruits, Asian, salad, coffee and tea, and also a daily special. The room are spacious with a big size bathroom. So, that's the good part.
Now comes the negatives, which I really dislike doing. You can take it as a series of unfortunate events. We had 5 days of not having towels in our room after housekeeping was done with it. We had to call each time to get our towels. Reason given was that the laundry service that the hotel uses is down. We had one of the days that housekeeping was late cleaning up the room (close to noon) after our swim, which the pool also did not have any towels available for guests (we got it after about an hour and a half). We had a night when the toilet bowl was choked (thank god no big business was done). One of the basin's stopper was faulty (small issue but I think it still needs to be highlighted). They have a movie night on Fridays at the rooftop pool. So we paid corkage for bringing our own bottle of wine and was looking forward to the show under the stars, but alas, with luck having it, the projector had a fault and so movie night was cancelled. So all in all, not a very good experience for us. However, like I said, it may just be a series of bad luck. I sincerely hope you guys have a better stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
130,Wonderful Stay in the Heart of Seminyak.,40,September 2022,"If you are the type that always want to be out and about, this hotel is perfect for you!

The room was beautiful and clean and large! I honestly love this hotel so much and would welcome a chance to visit and stay again!

The food was amazing and so tasty but if you are truly hungry you might need to order two dishes as the serving size is for someone on a diet!

141,Absolutely amazing!,50,September 2022,"My extended family and I through out a 4 week timeframe, all 11 of us, All stayed within this hotel, and I can not give a high enough review. All of the staff were amazing and memorable. The rooms and facilities were very nice and very spacious! Reception were very accomodating and amazing to deal with, even helped me make a special night of proposing to my now fiancé by romantically setting up our room, I personally dealt with Andy who was outstanding and I regularly stopped to talk with him throughout the trip. The cleaning staff were always friendly and up for a chat, and their speed and precision was excellent while doing so. And even the roof top pool was always clean and surrounding area very well maintained despite Covid. The servers at the bar, both upstairs and down at street level at “ Aero “ the late night caravan also owned by the hotel, were absolutely amazing! And again, everyone was very easy to talk to, very well prepared and happy to help with anything and everything! Asta, deny and all of the ladies and gentlemen who worked the bars were very nice and amazing to talk to! And even down to the security! Who I always spoke to as I walked past and regularly stopped for quite some time or spoke to whilst having a smoke, were absolutely beautiful! Often entertaining my questions and queries, and trying to teach me bits and pieces of Indonesian! Even the morning buffet and workers including were so accomodating, given the 11 of us every morning, would be more than happy to arrange tables and cutlery accordingly, with the food available being tasty, fresh and a huge variety, there was always something for everyone including our Gluten Free member. And the room service being the same!

This hotel absolutely MADE my holiday and made the experience of our family trip, I would highly recommend and I will defiantly be visiting again! Thankyou to the hotel, the staff and all the workers I didn’t see or get time to talk to!

Thankyou Upaasha",U Paasha Seminyak

Customer service is amazing, specifically Indra who was so friendly and kind to us, we feel as though we made an actual friend rather than someone just helping us.

We will definitely stay at U Paasha again.",U Paasha Seminyak

151,Seminyak at its Best,50,August 2022,"Another magnificent stay U Paasha Seminyak!
You will not regret a stay at this centrally located hotel where all of Seminyaks best restaurants, spas and bars are within easy walking distance.
The rooms are huge, very generous and well appointed bathrooms and facilities at the hotel are top class. Breakfast option are particularly good - being able to have your breakfast in the Alcove Restaurant or make use of their Anywhere Anytime breakfast option is a feature Ive not seen before.
My favourite feature and one of the reason I keep returning, is the rooftop pool. Awesome view out to the water and thanks to being a rooftop pool - there is always a refreshing breeze to keep you cool.
Staff, as ever, are the kindest and most accommodating. Thanks again for a wonderful stay - planning my next trip already x",U Paasha Seminyak

153,Staff are polite and helpful,30,August 2022,"SERVICE STAFF
The Front Desk and F&B staff were great. They were helpful and polite. However, the Manager from the respective departments only introduce themselves on our last day when we are going home. We stayed from 21 to 26 August 2022.

DRIVER
Mr Made Sukadana was very polite, accommodating and helpful. He drove us around Bali for 3 days. We were very happy with his service.

TOWELS & BEDSHEETS IN THE ROOM
The towels, floor mats, bedsheets & pillow cases, pillows and mattress looked very dirty as they are worn out. The towels, floor mats are torn. Very disappointing.

NO GRAB BARS OR HANDRAILS
There are grab bars or no handrails at the bathroom and shower room. Very dangerous for family with children and elderly.

STEEP STAIRCASE TO THE HOTEL LOBBY
Very inconvenient for elderly guests as to climb up the staircase.

DARK CARPARK
The lift surrounding at the carpark area is very dark.",U Paasha Seminyak
154,5 times a charm,50,August 2022,"We love U Paasha, there, we've said it. We think it is our 5th stay here, sadly covid interrupted. These guys just give and keep giving. we always feel at home here. We have been here for 3 weeks, our longest stay here and a pretty good way to judge a hotel's performance. Apart from a couple of minor incidents ( like our aforementioned safe) always rectified immediately with a smile we have had a carefree joyful stay as with all other stays here. To have Cafe Bali directly opposite, 7/11 store similarly placed, a reliable and fair money changer and the best eateries to the left and right....well could you ask for more? From the forecourt boss who always had a smile and used to try and teach me to say a couple of sentences in Indonesian. The breakfast was always amazing. I mean an endless variety of food types catering to all tastes. And that new coffee machine....if I could just get that into my case.....kidding.... There was NEVER any risk of running out of food right up until the end of service at 11 am, all the staff were polite and efficient, tables bussed quickly and consistently and Agus had a great attitude as dining manager. As we are no longer a part of the beautiful young people we didn't spend much time in the pool but did have a beer from time to time and enjoyed the amazing viewing. I believe they boast a 270 degree of viewing. Front desk were always helpful as were the techs who had to help us unlock our safe !!. The rooms are huge, The finish is great, really nicely appointed with patterned limestone blocks, a very comfortable huge king bed, fantastic waterfall shower, writing desk, sofa and mini couch. TV....good size but as with other stays the reception on the HBO channels was pretty spotty,....but hey you don't go on holiday to watch TV do you? As I said, we really like this place and the people make that real easy to, so it's a no brainer for us to stay here. Will be a sad day tomorrow when we leave beautiful Bali and the U Ninque U Paasha after 21 days.",U Paasha Seminyak
155,Perfect location,50,August 2022,"Great service and a great location in Seminyak. Staff are all very well trained and nothing is too much hassle for them. Right in the heart of Seminyak restaurant area and a ten minute walk to the

156,Outstanding service,50,August 2022,"The staff were so welcoming, pleasant and helpful. I came solo for my birthday and they even decorated my room on my special day as a surprise.

159,Great location,40,August 2022,"Great location. Walking distance to many restaurants and 10 min walk to the beach. Decent gym. Large rooms. Bit of discolouration in bathroom, not sure if mould/Mildue and mirror on wardrobe isn’t very clear, looks dirty but it’s not. Great rooftop pool but didn’t enjoy the menu. Wifi didn’t work well and continuously dropped out when in my room. Great breakfast. Would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak

161,Excellent spot in Seminyak,50,August 2022,"Great location in Seminyak, in the heart of everything but a little bit quieter. Our room (526) was huge and really lovely. It was near the lift but was well sound-proofed so we weren’t disturbed. Breakfast was decent, the egg station and Asian offerings were great. Staff were absolutely lovely. Very friendly and accommodating with any requests. Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
162,A place I will come back again to stay,50,August 2022,The location is good but the traffic around there is bad. The room is spacious and clean. The staff are helpful and friendly. Certainly I will recommend this place to my friends if they are going to Bali.,U Paasha Seminyak
163,Great stay. Heart of Seminyak,40,August 2022,"Lovely simple hotel and rooms, step out straight on to Eat Street. Easy walk to most places in Seminyak. The rooftop pool gives great views and perfect for watching the sunset with happy hour 5-7pm. Staff are extremely hospitable, especially Tya in the restaurant for the included breakfast which offers an expanse selection. One of the best things apart from Tya is the 24hr check in/check out. If you check in at 10pm you check out will be at the same time on your departure day. Breakfast is also available 24hrs.
Thanks Tya for making our stay so enjoyable.",U Paasha Seminyak
164,"Location, location!",40,August 2022,"The delights of Seminyak Eat Street on your door step, we picked this hotel because of the location. Clean and tidy and good breakfast.

166,Excellent and Worth every Penny,50,August 2022,"Overall the experience in Bali was incredible. We finished our trip in Seminyak and we loved the location of this hotel as it was right next to many shops, restaurants and also the ocean was about a 10 min walk. The overall last few days we spent in Bali were incredible and the hotel was one of the main reasons",U Paasha Seminyak

Overall, I had a great stay at U paasha and I would definitely return there.",U Paasha Seminyak
168,Nice minimalist modern clean hotel in the middle of Seminyak!,50,July 2022,"The hotel is located in the middle of busy Seminyak and you can easily find a lot of restaurants and other places around.

The hotel staff were very friendly and nice.

The rooms were very big! It was great for people like us that travel with tons of luggage 😆 it was very clean, the bed was very comfortable and HUGE! The AC worked out well.

The bathroom is simple but spacious.

The only downside was we got a room with beach / sea view but the sea was sooooo far away.

Breakfast buffet was great and delicious!
They have a lot of options to choose from!
My family and I think this is as far the best breakfast throughout our stay in Bali.

They have western breakfast with a lot types of cheese! Indonesian food that they changed everyday!

Fresh fruits on the side and fresh fruit juice!

Definitely check this place out if you’re planning to stay in Seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak

Great central location.

We even were silly enough to leave a diamond pendant in our safe after check out, the staff located it and reception had it waiting for us when we called",U Paasha Seminyak
178,Great Location and Choice,50,July 2022,"U Paasha's flexibility in its check-in/out timings was the prime reason for us to choose this hotel. Of course, with its excellent location (smack in the middle of Seminyak city centre), coupled with its spacious room and great team of staff, you won't go wrong in choosing this hotel! Forgot to add that the breakfast buffet spread was great - with fresh fruit juices to boot!",U Paasha Seminyak
179,"Fabulous stay, great amenities, welcoming & friendly staff, highly recommend",50,August 2022,"From warm greetings upon arrival, to friendly, attentive staff throughout our stay, this hotel is welcoming from the moment you arrive. It is very spacious, with large rooms and wide hallways.

The buffet style breakfast caters for everyone with traditional foods, fruits, breads, juices, eggs however you like, pancakes, waffles, coffee and tea, to name a sampling of what’s on offer.

It is well located for spa treatments, drinks. dining, shopping and with taxis passing by constantly you can hop in for a day at the beach, or walk the 700m or so to the closest beach.

The rooftop pool and bar area is spectacular with views across the city and to the sea - a great vantage point to watch the sun set over the ocean.

Would highly recommend for the service, staff and amenities, as well as proximity to everything.",U Paasha Seminyak
180,"All staff are just so helpful, great location",50,August 2022,"The is very centrally located on the Main Street of Seminyak, watching the sunset from the roof to bar and pool area is the best view in Seminyak the room sizes and all facilities are very clean and very well equipt. But most importantly from the management team, to the security at the front driveway, to the receptionists, to breakfast staff, to the pool bar staff, to staff operating the front entrance drinks caravan even to the room cleaners they are all so helpful, courteous, friendly and nothing is too much trouble, all the staff genuinely wanted to assist just to make our 15 day stay very special - a big thank you to all Sergio and Kerri",U Paasha Seminyak
181,Bad check in experience,20,July 2022,We were asked to wait for 2 hours to get our room even when we arrived at almost 4pm. When we tried to get the room again at 7pm the room is not that ready the staff needed to bring towels to us later,U Paasha Seminyak

Upon receiving the remarkable service we decided to change hotels to U Paasha. Additionally, the facilities, room and pool area were great. Location was convenient. Thank you to the great team.",U Paasha Seminyak
184,It doesn't meet at all our expectation,20,July 2022,"Be careful, they are not honest. We booked by booking.com for the payment at check in and with all the credit card details. One week before of the arrival, we received an email to ask pay in advance at least one night within 48 hours before the arrival. We called booking.com to complain, they offered to intervene, however we were concerned Paasha would cancel the reservation and we did not have time to find other hotel. As we arrived earlier in Bali and stayed in Kuta, we went to pay the total amount in advance. It is the first time an hotel does not honor a booking and blackmailed a guest !!",U Paasha Seminyak
185,1st visit after Cov,30,July 2022,"We have stayed at the U Paasha many times since it opened. This was our first visit since Covid. We had a great 2 weeks, but did notice some differences. The main problem was that there is now half the amount of sun lounges as before - & many of these are cheap plastic ones. Many guests got up at the crack of dawn & put their stuff all over the lounges & then didn’t come back for hours - many people were reduced to lying on the wood around the pool. There was also a lack of service around the pool, but they were probably short staffed. We have enjoyed our time in Seminyak, but have found the area a lot more downmarket than before",U Paasha Seminyak
186,Perfect holiday location,50,July 2022,"Great central location in the heart of Seminyak. The rooms, facilities & staff all amazing. Loved the late check out of 9pm to catch our return flight home -. The rooftop pool was great & happy hour perfect for that holiday treat.
I would absolutely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
187,My hotel of choice when in Seminyak,50,July 2022,"Great location (on the main drag without being noisy), spacious rooms, good air conditioning, all-day breakfast and flexible checkout times. This is a terrific property as evidenced by me staying here on three occasions.",U Paasha Seminyak
188,Lovely rooftop pool and perfect central location,50,July 2022,"This was my second stay at U Paasha and I wasn't disappointed. Though it is now an older hotel and like many hotels recovering after the Covid shutdowns, it still offers spacious modern rooms, a very comfy king-size bed and a wonderful breakfast buffet. We love the central location being able to just step out the front entrance to all the popular restaurants, bars and shops of Seminyak. A few minutes stroll to places like Ku de ta which is lovely right on the beach for cocktails at sunset or a quick taxi to Chez Gado Gado in Legian for sunset cocktails. Also, if inclined it's around 15 minutes drive away from the popular area of Canggu, beach clubs and cafes. We loved being able to have a body scrub and a massage in our room, such a treat on our first day. The staff are very friendly and helpful and no request is too much. Our room was cleaned each day and bed made. So nice to pop back after a morning by the rooftop pool to a clean room. (Pool tip: leave a towel early on a chair as it gets busy) One day we went to Uluwatu with a private driver to see the beautiful sandy beaches and popular surf breaks with a sunset swim. This holiday was ten days of magic and just what the Doctor ordered. A holiday like this is better than any medicine you can take! I think for the budget-friendly rate charged, the stay is a very affordable holiday and one Hotel you won't regret staying in.",U Paasha Seminyak
189,"Great location, comfortable beds and amazing rooftop pool",50,July 2022,"Best room to return to after a hot day out in the sun! The suites are spacious and clean, and the bed was comfortable, I had trouble waking up in the mornings.

The hotel is located on a busy street with great food and shopping just steps away, and the beach is about a 10 minute stroll away.

Hotel staff were very friendly and the rooftop pool was just perfect.

One small complaint would be awkward placement of power outlets but it wasn’t a huge problem for me",U Paasha Seminyak

194,OK but not great,30,July 2022,"Great location and large room.

Ok rooftop pool, but we didn’t use it much as there are better beach clubs in close proximity.

Rooms were a bit dirty and we had problems with the lights also way older than the pictures show.

There are better options at this price point",U Paasha Seminyak
195,A great hotel,50,July 2022,"U paasha was an amazing hotel for many reasons. It’s central location meant that most things were a short walk, the facilities and also the staff were great. Special mention to Andy who was extremely helpful and kind throughout my stay in many ways - he always went above and beyond.

I will definitely be staying at U Paasha again when I come back to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
196,Lovely Spacious Hotel situated in the hustle and bustle of seminyak,50,July 2022,"stayed at hotel for 3 nights , loved the breakfast , cleanliness , and most important location to get to places , only improvement is that maybe hotel can provide slippers and better quality soup/shampoo :)

Not a big issue though",U Paasha Seminyak
197,Well designed Hotel,50,June 2022,"I stay at this hotel with my wife and son for 3 days. The hotel is great and well designed, the room are extremely spacious and love the open layout.

The hotel grounds are nice and well kept, the rooms are clean and well appointed, and the beds are very cozy. Pool was quite nice, spent a few afternoons lazing around there. The hotel staff was prompt with requests and welcoming. A big shout out to the staff member Andy who was very friendly and helpful, always there to greet us, have a chat, and to make sure our stay was going well. Highly recommend this hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak

202,Lovely quiet hotel in the middle of everything!,50,July 2022,"Booked for a friends Birthday and was not disappointed. From check in to check out, the staff were welcoming and lovely. The room was big and the beds super comfortable. We had breakfast at alcove most mornings and were extremely satisfied with the yummy selections. The roof top pool and bar are wonderful, quiet and relaxing and the location is perfect to the beach, shopping and restaurants",U Paasha Seminyak
203,"Central location, quiet and big rooms",50,June 2022,"Stayed two weeks in U Paasha - my second time there.

The good points:
- Excellent service, with special appreciation to the very helpful Eva at the front desk and the room cleaners.
- Big, quiet rooms with comfortable bed
- Nice, clean rooftop pool
- Great location only a few minutes in the centre of a street with lots of good shops, cafes etc
The not so good:
- The hotel could do with some modernisation

Overall a great place to stay at very reasonable rates.

Highly recommended",U Paasha Seminyak
204,Fantastic Hotel and great location !,50,July 2022,"Everything was great with our stay. Hotel rooms are massive and staff were very helpful when needed. The location was right in the middle of everything too. Close to restaurants, beach and no trouble getting a ride to anywhere you need to go. We can't fault UPaasha Hotel. I will definitely stay there again and recommend it to all my family, & friends",U Paasha Seminyak
205,A much needed break after nearly 3 years away,50,June 2022,"I recently had my second stay at U-Paasha, after the long break due to Covid. This was my 7th trip to Bali since 2014. I stayed on Level 5 for 11 nights.

Firstly, the staff. They make all the difference for this boutique hotel. Never a problem making sure the visit is memorable and happy to discuss future bookings with a view to keeping customers. I should specifically mention that, unlike most other hotels, U-Paasha works a 24 hour Check-In to Check-Out system. So, if I get in at 10pm at night, my booking goes until 10pm on my Check-Out day, saving all the hassles of negotiating late Check-Outs, especially as most flights home are 'red eyes'. I have no idea why more hotels don't offer this customer focused service...

Secondly, the location, on the main ""Eat Street"" strip, a short walk 8 minute to the beach and convenient to most central Seminyak restaurants and shops.

Thirdly, the rooms, especially the Suites with a View on Level 5. Room is kept spotless and if you need anything, they are always there within 20 minutes. Sunset from the balcony, if I want to stay in and relax, is a big plus for me.

I could go on and on, including about the roof top and pool area, but am just very glad to have found a new 'base' in Seminyak - already booked for 2023, and can't wait to be back.

Thanks again team at U-Paasha. See you in March.",U Paasha Seminyak
206,A value deal for Seminyak and very friendly Staff,50,July 2022,"We stayed two nights in U-Paasha Seminyak and it was a very beautiful our stay there. The breakfast was quite delicious and there was a lot of choice. Welcome drink was good with different choices. The staff was very friendly. Especially we had a conflict with a local in Seminyak and our hero Detha saved us and he solved the problem. I really appreciate his support. Thank you again Detha plenty of time. If I come back again to Seminyak, I will definitely stay there.",U Paasha Seminyak
207,Disappointed,30,July 2022,"Average hotel but in a good position.
Pool furniture needs replacing.
Aircon leaks and wasn’t very cold.
Rooms are large but need a paint and deep clean. The towels are old and not white anymore.
Breakfast was quite good but main staff member was not very friendly at all.",U Paasha Seminyak

The area is close to everything you need!",U Paasha Seminyak
209,Wonderful!,50,July 2022,"Exceeded expectations! I loved everything about this hotel and was genuinely wowed on entering my city view room. A genuine boutique hotel - beautiful design elements, architectural features and polished concrete floors.
I chose a city view room and one side of my room had glass panels and glass sliding doors leading to the balcony with amazing views over Seminyak towards the ocean. Open plan design and so much space! As a solo traveller I appreciated the selection of vibrant restaurants across the road and the central position to everything - including taxis, shopping, cafes. Wonderful buffet breakfasts and beautiful helpful staff. Thoroughly enjoyed my week here and will definitely stay here next time in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
210,"Excellent service, location and hotel",50,July 2022,"It was so lovely being back in Bali after covid. Stayed here for our honeymoon and my 30th birthday. Staff were extremely welcoming and helpful.

The pool was lovely and so was the breakfast daily.

Highly recommended",U Paasha Seminyak
211,"Funky rooms, great location",50,July 2022,"This is a well presented hotel in a great area. The rooms are huge and have big beds and funky furniture. The buffet Brekky is really good with a lot of choice.

215,Definitely recommending this to my friends who visit Bali,50,June 2022,"Lovely staff who are super helpful.

Room service were also great, left valuables in the room and nothing went missing. 10/10 would recommend this place.

216,Fantastic Stay,50,June 2022,"Wonderful location, right in the heart of Seminyak, great for shopping, about ten - fifteen minutes walk from beach. Lovely big rooms, no view from hotel room if that is important to you, but you can stay in a 5th floor room and you get a view. Wonderful staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
217,Great location,40,May 2022,"My sister & I stayed at U Paasha & choose it for its location & value for money.
We loved being so close to the fantastic restaurants in eat street.
Breakfast is adequate for a hotel but if you want something special try one of the nearby cafes.
The rooms are a very generous size. Staff are all very friendly.
For the price it is great value.
24 hour check in is also a great bonus.
The only letdown is the noise in the rooms. We were in 2 rooms at the back of the property & had terrible sleeps due to the loud hallway noises that echo due to all concrete floors/hallway. Although it wasn’t the hotels fault that I had very noisy neighbours, the design of the hotel meant no sound proofing. The first night it was partygoers at 3am slamming doors. Then the next few night kids going in & out of rooms loudly for hours during the night. Placing towels at my door helped slightly. I’m not a light sleeper at all- but it was just really loud.",U Paasha Seminyak
218,Unpashaa,50,June 2022,"The absolute best hotel in Semyniak ! Everything from the client service to the breakfast was pretty much impecable. This is by far the best hotel we tried in all of Bali . I strongly suggest anyone visiting Semyniak to consider residing at this hotel . Quality price wise, there is no better deal . The staff is also very accomodating and treats every client with the utmost respect.",U Paasha Seminyak

221,Always Happy stays,50,June 2022,"Always good to go back to Upaasha before leaving Bali with their 24hrs check in/out for those late flights, reasonable hourly extended hours, spacious room with bedroom lounge and day bed, spacious bathroom ( shower only )
Amazing service, extensive breakfast options and delicious indonesian options.
Rooftop pool is nice for sunset and early morning for me. The cocktail for happy hours need to be improved.",U Paasha Seminyak
222,Great hotel in Seminyak,50,June 2022,"We have just returned from 6 nights at the U Pasha.

The buffet breakfast was delicious with such a wide range of options to suit whatever you might fancy! Pool was so relaxing and peaceful despite being in such a central location. My room was beautiful! Massive king size bed, TV, huge shower, coffee and water free daily.

As for the location of the hotel, I found it was 10 minute walk to anywhere I wanted to get to and there were plenty of drivers/scooters of walking is not your thing.
It was honestly one of the nicest experiences of a hotel I have had.",U Paasha Seminyak
228,We can't wait to come back.,50,June 2022,"What an amazing stay we had here.

232,A Happy return to a delightful hotel,50,June 2022,"My previous visit was in October 2019 with a close friend, we had intended to return in March 2020, but sadly this wasnt possible.
This trip has been planned since last October & we were both made very welcome upon our return.
As two independent travellers, we felt recognised & made to feel like we were simply @ a home away from our homes.
The rooms are delightful, beds very comfortable & the ability to have 24hr checkin worked will with a late night arrival & an early evening departure.
The staff are a credit to the hotel, with everything being made possible if needed.
I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be treated exceptionally well & be able to walk out the front only needing to decide left or right for a massive variety of places to dine all within walking distance.
I am looking to return in March 2023 for another 12 day stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
233,"Great location, walking distance to food, beach, shopping etc",40,June 2022,"Loved our stay, we chose this hotel because of its location in Eat Street, Seminyak, a street full of great cafes and restaurants. Rooftop pool has 360 degrees views, breakfast was good (except some things were served cold - sausages n bacon). Staff were excellent, every thing we asked about they sorted out and got back to us quickly. Laundry is cheap, rooms are really big, and there is parking for our Van (we hire a van every time we go to Bali, so this was a win win, under cover).
For the gym junkies, there is a great air conditioned gym on site, with help from onsite staff if need be.
Lots o Bali is still closed from Covid, but Seminyak is alive n open for business.
Would definitely recommend U Paasha to couples, families and friends.

234,"U Paasha, Seminyak, Bali",50,June 2022,"Memorable!!!

My first time in Bali - im so glad i chose U Paasha.
I found it a very relaxing stylish upmarket hotel with a delightful bali vibe enhanced by the very kind and hospitable staff.

My large deluxe room with balcony, had good aircon, a comfortable bed, separate seating area, and good ensuite - quite a retreat.

The restaurant was an enjoyable place to start my day providing a delicious buffet and à la carte breakfast with good coffee.

Spectacular sunsets and surrounding village views from the landscaped rooftop pool deck was the perfect place to unwind.

In an excellent location amongst assorted shops, restarants, bars, including Seminyak square, Medical clinic and mini marts, Revolver cafe, and a short walk to seminyak surf beach and clubs Ku De Ta - everything was nearby.

The hotel bicycle ride into Kuta Legian area was fantastic.

I have no hesitation in recommending U Paasha.

235,"Great hotel for price, quality and location",50,June 2022,"First time staying at U Paasha. Friends have stayed before and recommended it to us. Staff, facilities, location all amazing. Rooftop pool was perfect to enjoy drinks while the sun was setting. Value for money exceeded our expectations",U Paasha Seminyak
236,Seminyak holiday,50,June 2022,"Brilliant hotel. Central location. Stunning lobby area and the rooms are of an equal standard, spacious and modern
Comfy beds, powerful showers. Roof top pool is great but hard to find shade other than in the pool bar. Love the concept of anytime breakfast, means you do an early start day trip and get your breakfast delivered to your room for tea! Genius idea. The thing that sets this place apart is the exceptional client service, they genuinely care that everything is how it should be. Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I'm lucky enough to return to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
237,Excellent,50,June 2022,"It is my favorite place to go to SEMINYAK since 12 years. Very central, great architecture, nice pool on the roof top. And the rooms are very big.

No hesitation !",U Paasha Seminyak

243,"Best location, need to pay attention to the cleanliness",30,June 2022,"The hotel location is fantastic. Very close to the shops, beach and food facilities. However, we really think the water inside the room need to be changed. When I need to brush my teeth, the water taste horrible and smells. Very uncomfortable. The house keeping staff also need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of the hotel and need to take the action when they saw the toiletries are finished (in this case the toothpaste)",U Paasha Seminyak
244,Excellent Hotel for your buck,50,May 2022,"Excellent Hotel and customer service. Clean, and very friendly staff on this hotel. Price is very reasonable.

246,5/5 best hotel in the area,50,June 2022,From the quick and easy check in to the spacious and modern rooms there isn’t really much to fault with this hotel. The rooftop pool is incredible and the buffet breakfast is second to none. Will definitely stay again.,U Paasha Seminyak
247,Great to be back in Bali staying at a fantastic hotel,50,June 2022,Rooms are massive and bed is a Super King with lovely shower and good water pressure . Things are picking up post covid in Bali but room rates still very cheap for the excellent quality of this hotel in Seminyak. just glad to be back having a big breakfast Bali style every morning !,U Paasha Seminyak
248,Travelling Solo to Bali,50,May 2022,"The U Paasha has a great location in the heart of Seminyak. Great for walking around to the shops and restaurants. If breakfast is important to you, they do serve up a decent breakfast buffet. The pool area is vast and sunny and they have a pretty decent gym in the basement.
My first room had a stench and some items were not working/ equipped. I also had some trouble with a delivery on my first night (on Grab and it wasn't the hotel's fault). The U Paasha is not a five star hotel and I hadn't expected the great service that I received for my entire stay there (7 days, six nights). To their best efforts, they quickly righted all that was frustrating for me.
A very special mention to Detha from the front office. He had the initiative and thoughtfulness to make things right and as we got to know each other better over the next few days, he anticipated my needs before me asking and took very good care of me. I've seen him interact with other guests and he's equally personal and polite. Never overbearing.
Sincerity and professionalism counts above five and six star furnishings. After travelling to Bali twice a year for so many years now, I would say my stay at U Paasha was very memorable and comfortable. Very appreciative of the care I received - thank you Detha and team. Keep it up!",U Paasha Seminyak
249,Good location,50,May 2022,"nice a quiet, with only waling distance to bars and nice quiet roof top pool and bar. easy location for transport. bed big and comfortable in-room massage was also well worth it. breakfast was good both continental and indonesian",U Paasha Seminyak
250,Great value Seminyak accommodation,40,May 2022,U Paasha has the biggest hotels rooms I have found at this price range. The wide corridor also adds to the sense of space and privacy. The breakfast had plenty to offer of a good standard adding to the value of the stay.,U Paasha Seminyak
251,The only hotel I have stayed at more than once.,40,May 2022,"Upaasha is the ONLY hotel in Bali I have ever stayed at more than once, and I go to Bali a lot (outside the pandemic) There is a vibe that no other hotel has. And the heart and spirit of the hotel just has to be the staff, they take your breath away with their genuineness and sincerity. Right from being met at the airport we felt a confidence that things were going to be good. Check in was seamless, and handled by Detha (I’ll get back to him a bit later) the room was cool welcoming from the heat and humidity. The facilities in the room are good, however you no longer get to choose from a range of soaps and toiletries as I did in the past I’m thinking it might be a pandemic cost saving measure, but hopefully it will return when they are back in full swing. On the second day the aircon struggled to keep up to speed so Detha had me moved without the slightest hesitation. Back to the room, the rooms are larger than most other hotels and are kitted out with everything you could possibly want, bed, pillows and linen were fresh and spotless, the rooms cleaned to a gleaming finish each day by the friendliest team on the planet. At breakfast on the first day were met by staff who remembered me from my last stay which blew me away, the food offer is somewhat scaled back from pre pandemic time but still darn good, all prepared and served by the nicest bunch of ppl you could ever meet, the offer of “more coffee Mr Tony, more eggs Mr Tony, more anything Mr Tony”…and the same for my sister …all by name…what a way to start the day!!!
Detha was telling me that the gym has now relocated to the street level and the spa is going to roof level which will be fantastic. At the moment the pool area is pretty hit n miss, the loungers and covers are worse for wear, I had to go pull covers myself every day from a pile of damaged ones in a shed. There’s only a few umbrellas on offer as well. I reckon it’s only reasonable to expect that these would all be in place before guests arrive in the morning. I’m sure it also needs to be considered that many of these things are the aftermath of the pandemic and in time they will return. Having said that, the food offer is very limited, I have been told that the rooftop bbq will return soon and I reckon that will breathe new life back into the rooftop which is an awesome area and one of the things that I love about the hotel. So having said all that Upaasha is my favourite hotel in Bali it’s location is unbeatable, the facilities are great and will even better, the rates make for great value (I booked seven days direct with the hotel) when we decided to extend our stay another week, Detha looked after that for us as well, whenever we needed or wanted anything he was our go to man, he would come from out of nowhere to see if everything was going ok and if we wanted anything or if there was anything he could do for us…his sincerity, generosity of spirit and friendship are what I love about the Balinese people and Detha optimises that notion….will I go back to Upaasha?…absolutely!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
252,Nice,50,May 2022,"The hotel has big room, big bathroom, and small terrace.
Clean, and has everything you need.
The staff are very helpful and friendly. When we came and check in in the front desk, Yuni was so helpful, even when you already in your room, she called and asked if everything ok with the room and wheter we need something else.

259,Highly recommended,50,May 2022,"Excellent hotel.
The service is next level amazing.
Toni looked after us, he went over and beyond. On the second day here I got sick with a chest infection. He sent tea with lemon and honey to our room. The staff checked on me daily. They really showed care and I certainly appreciated it.
The breakfast was lovely. Everything you need. Great variety. Although I would like real bacon but there was so much to choose from.
The rooms are huge and I mean huge. The bed and pillows are probably the most comfortable I’ve had in Bali (over 20+ trips now) It is such a comfortable lovely space.
Lovely pool on the roof!
Amazing location in eat street Seminyak.
I can not fault this place. Perfecto!",U Paasha Seminyak

Surrounding area very complete, mini market, restaurant, spa, shopping centre. Great place.

Next time back to Bali, I will book again this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
261,Solo traveller,40,May 2022,"I enjoyed my stay at U Paasha. My room was massive, very clean, AC worked well and it was quiet. And added benefit was the 24 hour check in/out…as I didn’t check in till 3pm I was able to check out a 3pm which most hotels don’t offer. And also you could choose to have your breakfast in your room instead of the restaurant if you preferred.",U Paasha Seminyak
262,Great,50,May 2022,"The room is very spacious, the location is superb, and the staff is professional as well, price wise is ok (a bit high during high season) but worth every penny. Although they should improve the selection on the breakfast, plus side, you can ask the breakfast to be served in room all day long (selected items)",U Paasha Seminyak
263,Great place on the main street for a few days,50,May 2022,I stayed here before a local retreat and it was amazing to get my barring and overcome jet lag. The room was beautiful and spacious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again if I was in Seminyak.,U Paasha Seminyak
264,"Shhhhhhhh, don’t let this secret out!!!!",40,May 2022,"UPasha Hotel is a welcome find located right in the middle of ‘Eat Street’ in Seminyak and in walking distance to the beach. Rooms are spacious, exceptionally clean and well appointed with a modern aesthetic. The roof top pool attracts a welcome breeze to help keep you cool, and sun lounges are very comfortable. Breakfast was included and of an excellent standard…, if you’re looking to be cared for rather booking a self contained Villa in Seminyak, you will find UPasha an excellent and well priced option…, well done UPasha team, I’ll be back!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
265,Excellent,50,May 2022,"Best hotel in seminak, the rooms are fantastic. Breakfast is delicious and the hotel staff are amazing.

Location is great and easy to get around. My third time staying at upasha and I will be going back soon.",U Paasha Seminyak

The staff are wonderful and so is the breakfast

The room is very spacious and well appointed and the pool has a great veiw

We have rebooked for later in the year.",U Paasha Seminyak
267,Very Pleasant Hotel with a Great Breakfast,50,May 2022,"U Paasha is located in a lively part of Seminyak, with many shops and restaurants nearby. Though the hotel is on a busy street, our room, which faced away from the street, was perfectly quiet. The room was a good size, with all the customary amenities, including dependable WiFi. The staff is as charming and helpful as you would expect of a hotel in Bali. And there is a great rooftop pool.
For me, the most memorable part of the stay was the buffet breakfast. I've seen larger buffets, but this one had plenty to satisfy every taste. There are ""western"" options, including pancakes, waffles and omelets--even eggs benedict--but the Indonesian dishes are the stars of the show. Every day there were different rice and noodle dishes, as well as local chicken or fish dishes. Also bubur ayam (Indonesian porridge with chicken) and bakso (chicken meatballs in broth). I became a great fan of the bakso, with enough added chili peppers to make my nose run and my lips burn.",U Paasha Seminyak
268,It Used to be Great,40,May 2022,"U Paasha has all the facilities to be great again but it's greatest feature has slipped.
Pool water wasn't great by midday .... bar and rooftop facilities were unattended and empty.... it generally looked messy .... but as always, staff were lovely . The newly introduced Daily Public Pool Pass will mot ne good for hotel guests.Apast staff member, Gede, made a huge difference we realised ...",U Paasha Seminyak
269,24 hours room policy in the heart of seminyak,50,May 2022,"The room is wide and spacey! Suite king 50m2
it was strategically located in the heart of seminyak.
Quite affordable for me
staffs were great, very helpful and supportive.
Breakfast also great, with great coffee and menu selection",U Paasha Seminyak
270,Great place to stay and great value,50,May 2022,Stayed here twice. Great pool on roof. Rooms very spacious and comfortable. Staff all lovely. Nothing is too much trouble. Highly recommended. We’d go back there for sure. Have nothing negative to say and we’re very picky!,U Paasha Seminyak
271,Honeymoon in Bali,50,May 2022,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at U Paasha and wish that we had had more time in Seminyak! We were upgraded to a beautiful, large suite that was perfect for the last few days of our honeymoon and the service and food were incredible, particularly the free breakfast buffet! It goes without saying that the facilities are beautiful and we spent a lot of time on the rooftop pool deck, which is also spectacular for sunset. We are excited to return again in the near future!",U Paasha Seminyak
272,"Amazing location, staff and hotel!",40,May 2022,"A great experience from check-in to check out. Accommodating staff, great and speedy service. Nice in-house massages and overall a great stay for the price and location. The rooftop pool was nice. Breakfast was good and all you needed to start your day. Walking distance to Seminyak Square, Village, restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
273,Great stay!,50,May 2022,"We got a promo deal right when Bali was re-opening which included airport transfer and daily breakfast! The service staff were excellent, always friendly and extremely helpful! We really enjoyed the food during breakfast as well. The rooms were extremely spacious and the rooftop pool does have one of the best sunsets in Bali! Highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
274,3 nights of staying at U Paasha Seminyak,50,May 2022,"During my 3 nights of staying here, I gathered a really nice experience in this hotel. The room is spacious and neat, the hospitality is great, the access is easy, breakfast is yummy, overall 9,8/10. Very recommended",U Paasha Seminyak
275,Comfy hotel with big rooms,40,May 2022,"The room was big considering the amount I paid for. The bathrooms were the biggest I have seen and overall they were all very clean. The bed was very comfortable and I had good, restful sleep. The breakfast spread was not bad and has everything you would require. The staff was helpful and the location was good as you could walk to most eateries of every kind. The only drawback was the TV signal which kept dropping so if you're a TV addict, this would not be good for you,",U Paasha Seminyak
276,Second time staying at U Paasha,30,May 2022,"Our first time was great and smooth when we had stayed for 1 night in 2018 so we decided to stay at U Paasha again. This time we organized an airport transfer pick up but they failed to pick us up at the airport. After we waited 30mins for the hotel to call the driver with updates about the miscommunication (we had to push back our dinner reservations and everything), luckily the driver company found someone who could take us to the hotel. Minimal apologies and explanation about what happened after we showed them our confirmation correspondence for the airport transfer.

When we checked in they advised our booking was only for 1 night but we had confirmed 3 nights (again with our booking confirmations shown), but it was a misunderstanding since we had prepaid for 1 night in advance (we booked via booking.com and that was the arrangement) and we understood that the remainder could be paid upon check-out but apparently you need to prepay upon check-in. This was just a failure to properly explain everything to us, that we just had to prepay for the rest of the nights rather than just telling us we only had a booking for 1 night. Not the most pleasant arrival experience but after everything was sorted the rest of our stay was fine.

Rooms are big and comfortable and the roof top pool is one of the best features of the hotel. The 24 hour check out is incredibly convenient as well if you have a later flight. Excellent location.",U Paasha Seminyak
277,Great hotel and value for money,50,May 2022,"Great service and roof top pool! Room was spacious enough and considering the price point, it is very worth it. The hotel is close to most good coffee spots and bar so location is not an issue. Will recommend!",U Paasha Seminyak
278,Big clean room and pleasant stay!,50,April 2022,"Stay here for 2 nights. Big room, clean, and helpfull staff. Ms Puji really helpful for everything that I asked. Highly recomended hotel in Seminyak Area. If you guys coming with elderly family, I suggest to use the elevator from the basement instead of using the stairs from the front.",U Paasha Seminyak
279,spacious room,50,April 2022,"I am the returning guest of this hotel since the hotel newly opened, I always like the large corridor and large room, everything runs well, nothing to complain. This hotel is in good location for food, shops and nightlife.",U Paasha Seminyak
280,Delightful 2 night stay at U Paasha,50,April 2022,"Had a short but very pleasant stay. Staff very efficient & friendly at check-in even though I arrived early. Everything worked which was lovely. Room was clean, huge suite with a very comfortable bed. Anytime I called, staff responded immediately and professionally which was nice.

Always a safe option to return to U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
281,Conveniently Situated Great Accomodation,50,April 2022,"The Hotel room was very spacious at an extremely affordable price. We stayed here for 5 days and found it to be extremely convenient to go around Seminyak area.

Breakfast variery was great too as they change the dishes daily. Rooftop pool was nice and quiet especially in the evening before sunset.

Would strongly recommend!",U Paasha Seminyak
282,Pleasent stay,50,April 2022,"I came here before long weekend (ied fitri) so the place still quite. Nice hospitality, friendly staff, its near restaurant, bar and seminyak village, also monsieyr spoon. Will come back for sure 👍🏼👌🏼",U Paasha Seminyak
283,"Nice hotel, big clean rooms!",50,April 2022,"Quick check in, very friendly staff! Room is very big and clean! Good food and real coffee for breakfast, I had Indonesian food most mornings but they have egg station etc..
great rooftop pool, good for sunset drinks!
Bali has obviously been hurt by the pandemic but U paasha has kept their standards up! Thank you!",U Paasha Seminyak
284,Wonderful hotel in great area,50,April 2022,"Had a 2 week stay at this hotel and everything was great. The rooms are big and spacious. All of the staff was very kind and helpful. Really enjoyed the rooftop pool that had great views over seminyak. The hotel is in the perfect area, with a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance. About a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest beach. They have a parking garage that you can use which is perfect if you plan to rent a scooter to explore Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
285,Holidays,50,April 2022,"Fabulous! The hospitality was excellent, the pool was beautiful. Just what I needed… the people were so friendly and the breakfast was delicious. They even had sour dough bread. Amazing!! The only thing they should do differently is get some different types of milk!",U Paasha Seminyak
286,"Amazing, as always.",50,April 2022,"My partner is Balinese and we love staying in Seminyak for the food, shopping and night life when we aren’t with family. We stay at U Paasha at least twice a year and will always continue to. The service, rooms and location are the best we’ve ever found. The rooftop pool is always showered with sun and the beautiful staff are so helpful and fun. You won’t regret choosing U Paasha, they can organise anything you need.",U Paasha Seminyak
287,Birthday Celebration,50,April 2022,"My partner and I and plus two friends stayed at the U Paasha hotel in Seminyak. The hotel is centrally located enabling access to stores, bars and restaurants.

The hotel is a stylish 4 star with staff offering a professional and friendly service. As a same sex couple we were made to feel welcome and safe. This was our third time staying at the U Paasha, our friends first time.

The staff made our stay very special and dressed our bedroom in celebration of my birthday and nothing was too much for them.

Rooms are spacious, excellent bed linen and a firm bed, always a winner in my eyes. The hotel doesn’t have a pillow option to if you like your pillows firm, bring your own. Hopefully the hotel will introduce pillow options for guests.

Breakfast is plentiful, with western and Asian options and chef to cook eggs how you like. The best poached eggs, with sourdough bread, I’m still dreaming about my breaks.

Room service offers a limited but tasty range of Indonesian food. The mini bar was empty but I assume this was due to Covid 19 rules, previously when we’ve stayed the mini bar had the usual fair.

The roof top pool is an ideal retreat after shopping and staff are there to provide towels and drinks etc.,,

I highly recommend a stay at the U Paasha, Seminyak. We rate it 5/5.",U Paasha Seminyak
288,Very satisfying!,50,April 2022,"An excellent stay. The 24h policy is so helpful.
The staffs are very friendly and helpful, as I was a bit late to check out because my baby was asleep, and they are so nice and didn’t rush me.
The room is very big and clean, clean fresh towels, good bathroom floor non slippery, and the bathroom is big.
Nice coffee maker and Dilmah tea.
Clean electric kettle for boiling water for my baby’s milk.
Floor is clean, no stickiness or oiliness.
Location wise is very good, accross mini mart 24h and a nice vibe cafe in front of the hotel.
Thank you U Paasha! Will definitely come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
289,Great hotel- recommend to anyone staying in Seminyak,50,April 2022,Had a lovely stay at U Paasha hotel. Pool is lovely and overlooks seminyak. You also get a great view of the sunset from the rooftop pool. They also do a great breakfast and definitely worth trying the Nasi Goreng from the rooftop bar- delicious. Recommend to anyone staying in Seminyak. Staff were also very accommodating and we arrived Early so they allowed us to check in as soon as we got there. Super clean too. Thanks for a great hotel experience :),U Paasha Seminyak
290,A lovely stay,50,April 2022,"I had a pleasant 2-night stay at Upaasha. I love the spacious room, the modern design of the hotel, the small library and the yummy breakfast. Staffs are really friendly and helpful. The hotel is strategically located in Seminyak, only a few minutes away from seminyak village and the famous Motel mexicola. The beach is about 10-min away on a motorbike. Despite of its strategic location, the hotel is relatively quiet so it's a perfect place to stay in when it gets too hot outside. It is a perfect hotel for me and I'd love to stay here again when I return to Bali next time. It's a great value for money.",U Paasha Seminyak
291,Impressive hospitality,50,April 2022,"My 3rd time staying in U Paasha Seminyak and never get disappointed with the hospitality! Love the idea of getting breakfast ‘wherever whenever’ so we can have our selected breakfast in the room since the room is so big, and they also have Ice Coffee! The gym equipment is clean and pretty varied. After exercise you can chill at their rooftop swimming pool and enjoy the sunset. The architecture is impressive, especially the library. No need to worry about the outdoor activity since this hotel surrounded with the famous beach and restaurants. Won’t think twice to stay here again on my next staycation.

Oh it also provide 24 hours room usage, so you can arrange the check in - check out hour by yourself.",U Paasha Seminyak

293,Customer oriented staff,50,March 2022,"The staff are friendly and accommodating. However, certain amenities were not available in the room and were only made available upon request. The check-out process was not as efficient and advanced, but I have no problem with it. The location is fantastic, as it is situated near boutiques and a decent mall. It is also convenient for me to get to other touristy places in the South of Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
294,Amazing hotel,50,April 2022,"I loved it! Breakfast was amazing (try their Burbur Ayam) and staff were so friendly. Location was great as well, convenience store right opposite the hotel + a stretch of food/massage places. Really nothing to fault the place for, except maybe they should provide hair conditioner too",U Paasha Seminyak
295,Heart of Seminyak,50,April 2022,Spacious room! Really well designed and loved the rooftop pool and gym with views. Friendly helpful staff. Quiet times right now in Bali so we appreciated spending our first night here after a long flight. Super comfy bed and black out curtains. Thank you,U Paasha Seminyak

302,Nice Hotel in Eat Street (Jalan Kayu Aya),40,March 2022,"In short, I will return to this hotel again.
What's good?

Room is spacious with a sunset view.
Very convenient to amenities (food, barber, cafes, beach) and friends.
The only hotel that I have been with 24-hr checkout.
Staff are very helpful, friendly and pleasant.
Responsive hotel hotline for ice buckets and fresh towels.
Nice breakfast spread.
Unbelievable rooftop sunset view, with bar and swimming pool, daily breakfast and value for money!
Located in the heart of Jalan Kayu Aya with plenty of shops and restaurants near by. Transport is easy to get too, e.g. Gojek or taxi hails.
Spacious corridor with good ventilation leading to the rooms. Not those dark or air con musky types.
Room has a safe with big cupboards. The safe can fit small laptops but big laptops, you have to be creative.

Suggested improvements.

The round dining table and the TV console + study should be wiped clean daily due to fine ants.
Slippers and laundry bags should be provided, regardless whether the laundry services are taken up. had to ask for laundry bags a few times.
The TV picture and sound quality is poor for some channels such as HBO, due to bad internet connection I guess.
The Wifi quality is patchy sometimes, especially in my last few days. So I had to reconnect some online meetings. Music streaming is always interrupted.
Indicate meat types (e.g. fish, mutton, pork, etc) for the breakfast meals served.",U Paasha Seminyak
303,Great hotel with an amazing rooftop,50,March 2022,"Great hotel with an amazing service! After staying two days I decided to extend my stay because I felt at home.

Thank you at all the U Paasha Staff!",U Paasha Seminyak

306,The air con killed it,30,April 2021,"We stayed here October 2019 for 4 nights. The location is super central on ‘Eat Street’ in Seminyak. Pretty much smack in the middle, you can’t get more immersed in Seminyak, everything is on your door step.

We didn’t mind the hotel at all. Despite being in the main road you do feel separated from the hustle and bustle once you’re inside. The restaurant for breakfast is in the arrival level and it’s a nice offering.

The rooms are super roomy and modern, huge open walk in wardrobes. We were on the top floor although the views are limited being right amongst the shops. What really let everything down though was the air con. It just doesn’t work - well at least it didn’t when we were there and it was just impossible to cool down let alone sleep. We actually got moved to a different room at one point but there was barely a difference.

The roof top pool isn’t great either. It’s fully exposed with nowhere to hide from the sun. Just needs more plants in pots and umbrellas because it’s just a burn fest.

Not a lot of ‘vibe’ in general either/ just a nice clean hotel. More of a stopover hotel if you want to checkout Seminyak for a day or two and do some shopping etc, but I wouldn’t do a long stretch here.",U Paasha Seminyak
307,Ms. Elvania,50,March 2022,"was very satisfy stay here, the room is so comfy and feels like home. The stafs is very helpfull and responsive. Extend my room for 2 times, during my stay. High recomended for long stay period, both family or business purposes",U Paasha Seminyak

325,Delightful Experience,50,December 2021,"I looked for a hotel in the center of seminyak during my honeymoon trip and this was definitely worth it! It was value for money, the service are excellent. The breakfast was really delicious, they have a bike facility, they have a huge spacious room and the only hotel who have 24 hours stay ( you can check out at the same hour you check in the day before). This was a huge plus. We went around biking to other seminyak area for sightseeing and shopping at the noon without rushing to check out. Would definitely come back for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak

446,Christmas 2020,40,December 2020,"Enjoyed my stay at Upaasha. It’s not my first time to stay in this hotel and would stay again.

Things are a little different because of these unusual times we live in at the moment.

I guess like many hotels they are having to adapt to the situation. Seemed like they were operating on reduced staff and things were a little disorganised at times. But hey no big deal.

It’s a great location and the rooms are really big. Also seems it’s just been refurbed (at least our room was). good value for money as well.",U Paasha Seminyak
447,Highly recommended hotel. Excellect stay.,50,December 2020,"I stayed during Xmas holiday. Large guest room is tastefully decorated and very clean. I get very clean towels every day. Each staff (house keeping, front desk, restaurant) is very quick to serve and very friendly. I really enjoyed my stay and for sure want to come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
448,24 HOUR CHECK OUT SYSTEM,50,December 2020,"- I stayed for 2 nights there, and it was such an amazing stay! the room was amaizingly big and clean, also they give you a hygine kit (2 masks, 2 alcohol wipes, 1 tube hand sanitizer, and a latex gloves), their shower gel fragrant was sooo good!

- All the staffs was so helpful and greet you with their warmest smile, also you can directly rent a car/motorcycle through them, and the hotel staff will take it from there until the key is on your hands (so no need to contact with other people) that was nice during this pandemic to not meet to many people

- when u check in at 5 PM, you can check out at 5 PM on the next day you checked out! it was nice, bcs you can go shower once more before you go to the airport (this is amazing, and the reasons I will go back and tell my family or friends to stay here)

- the room provides you with 1 coffee maker and 1 machine to cook a water. (this is also nice)

- nice swimming pool, with updated music, so you can feel the Bali vibes to the fullest.

CONS:
- one of the sofa inside the room, you can see with visible eyes, that it has a big stained with dark color o it and its a little bit nasty to sit on it.

- during my stay on first day, under my blanket, there was couples moths on my bed, so i need to clean it up.

- my refrigerator was not cold, so this one probably need to get fixed:)

To staffs: some of them not wearing mask properly, which I take that seriously for healthy protocol (i met one of guy who carried a towel or similar to that, his mask only cover his mouth, not his nose, which is not how you properly wear a mask. especially you handle a towel for your guests)

OVERALL: 9.8/10",U Paasha Seminyak

450,Great price due to pandemic yet limited services and facilities,40,November 2020,"This is a nice looking hotel with a fantastic rooftop swimming pool and very comfortable and spacious guest rooms . Guests benefit from a very good location near Seminyak Village. Unfortunately, due to saving measures, the hotel does not offer much in terms of food and beverage......breakfast is rather boring and never changes....small basic a la carte breakfast, no lunch or dinner service, most lights are turned down in the evenings making the ambiance rather poor. Staff members are nice but need a bit of service training. Overall, you get what you pay for.......difficult times for the owner and management keeping the hotel running. Luckily there is a fantastic restaurant right across the street from the hotel which makes it possible to enjoy great dining.",U Paasha Seminyak

The breakfast and lunches around the pool were lovely. The rooftop pool area was very clean, with very attentive staff. The rooms are great and amenities re-stocked daily.

460,A hotel with heart!,50,March 2020,"This was my second stay at U Paasha and again it was as good as the first. On arrival you are greeted with a big smile by the U Paasha team which makes you feel really welcomed. Check in was smooth as always. We were also informed thoroughly around the guidelines surrounding covid-19 and the extra sanitary precautions in measure. Our room was big and super clean with modern features. Even though you’re right in the heart of Seminyak, when you’re in your room or on the rooftop pool you feel at ease and peaceful. We decided during this stay that we wouldn’t venture out too far and that was no problem at all. The service in our room and at the pool (the place we spent most of our time) was superb! We were constantly asked during our stay if everything met our needs or if there was anything else we needed. I also loved meeting Brendan, the general manager. It was nice to see the kind person he was and it definitely showed the kindness was passed through each and everyone of his team members. We will definitely be back in the future and I will always happily recommend this place to others staying in Seminyak. Thank you, Hannah",U Paasha Seminyak

467,"excellent, clean and 5-star service",50,March 2020,"I stayed for one night and had a late checkout. Yuddah and Deo were excellent in making sure what I needed was perfect. The internet wouldn't work in my room for my phone (but it did for my laptop), and Deo helped me connect to wifi on my phone etc. The food, drinks and in-room massage was perfect for my down time. Made came to do the signature Upaasha massage, highly recommend to those looking for airplane relief and general all over wellness. It's so worth the extra cost than the massages down the road. It was just like receiving a professional massage in Australia, she was so knowledgeable.
The breakfast is 10/10 and caters for everyone - free espresso machine made coffee for your breakfast...
The Covid19 stuff wasn't an issue because there was plenty of handsanitiser, and extra clean procedures they were doing to make all the guests feel safe. The room was extremely clean and I'm definitely going back.",U Paasha Seminyak

472,Service is impeccable!,50,February 2020,"We stayed at the U Paasha for 10 days and I have never had such warm, inviting and friendly service in a hotel ever before as I had here.

From remembering my coffee order every morning at the buffet breakfast, to allowing a free late check out (an extra 8 hours!!) because our flight was delayed, the service was so kind and personalised.

Extra mention to Cindy (who went outside Seminyak to personally find packaging material for me to fly home my holiday purchases!!) and Gede in the restaurant who treated us like VIPs.

Really highly recommend a stay at the U Paasha Seminyak.

Location is perfect,the rooms modern and very clean,the staff are amazing and so helpful and friendly.With the rooftop pool and sunset cocktails with the best views in town.The food is amazing and the breakfast omg! This hotel is a must stay and the best value for money a real find,thanks to the staff we look forward to returning later this year.",U Paasha Seminyak
481,Anniversary trip,50,February 2020,"Excellent - location great - large clean rooms / service warm and friendly , diner was great and pool on roof was a great place for chilling and meeting other travellers , buffet breakfast has better choices and quality than other high end Bali resorts , deserves all its good reviews .",U Paasha Seminyak
482,U Paasha? Perfect!,50,February 2020,"This hotel is very centrally located in Seminyak, however, being on a long narrow lot it offers a quiet respite from the noise and bustle of the Main Street. Reception is calm, helpful and a comfortable area to wait for a driver or friends.

Breakfast is quality, fresh and varied with a well-being focus. The rooftop bar is happening at sunset and beyond, and remains open until the small hours for a nightcap.

The pool area is large with lounges aplenty, and a nice backdrop of reserved beats to set the tone of the day. The gym is well equiped, and daily yoga classes are on offer.

The rooms are large, tastefully furnished and quiet. Bathrooms are also generous with a good range of accessories. Beds are also super comfortable with quality linen.

U Paasha is a quietly understated, great value and a really pleasant surprise packet.... Highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
483,Great Location,50,February 2020,"Stayed 2 nights and was perfect location for “eat Street”
Hotel was everything you could hope for
Huge big rooms
24 hour check in and out was a nice bonus
Awesome buffet breakfast one of the best we have had
Lovely staff
Great for a short stay",U Paasha Seminyak
484,Great Experience,50,February 2020,"Staying here was amazing, the staff and location were great. Located right in the heart of great restaurants and bars. The hotel is clean and well looked after. The pool and rooftop are a great place to relax and unwind. Will definitely stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
485,ANOTHER AWESOME STAY,50,January 2020,"This was our second stay at U Paasha and we were not disappointed. We were warmly welcomed by Mantra and the friendly front office team. Our room was large and spotlessly clean, with quality toiletries and bedding. The roof top pool is warm with a fantastic view out to the ocean. Can't beat the experience of enjoying a cocktail while taking in the beautiful sea view. The bbq seafood at the bbq night, on the rooftop while watching the sunset has to be the best meal and experience in Bali in our 25 visits. Breakfast is just delicious with a large range of choices, and many items being cooked to order. Brendan the GM ensures everything is running smoothly and guests are given the best experience while staying. Thank you Team U Paasha for another amazing and enjoyable stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
486,Great Stay!,50,February 2020,"Love this place! Brilliant position, great rooms & top level pool/bar. Will always be my first choice when staying in Seminyak. Staff always welcome you with a smile, and offer great airport pick-up/drop off.",U Paasha Seminyak
487,Excellent,50,February 2020,"Excellent Stay. The staff is extremely attentive and helpful. The hotel has the best location in Seminyak, close to beach clubs and tons of great restaurants in the area. Easy walk to shops and markets. The rooms are spacious and clean. Breakfast is excellent, the omelets , pancakes and coffee are prepared to order and where always perfect.",U Paasha Seminyak
488,Fantastic,50,February 2020,"I don’t write reviews very often but felt compelled to after spending a week at U Paasha. The staff are the friendliest I have come across and I’ve travelled extensively around the world and stayed in a number of 5* hotels. Nothing was ever too much and you were always acknowledged whether it be at the pool, the breakfast area or any other part of the hotel. A special mention to Brendan the GM who continually checked if everything was ok and to Gede who always had a smile on his face. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if I returned to Bali",U Paasha Seminyak
489,U Paasha review,40,January 2020,"Perfect for reasonably priced hotel and provided a great place to holiday in the heart of Bali, amazing location around the best restaurants great bed really comfy. All of the staff were especially nice!",U Paasha Seminyak
490,"Amazingggggg stay, would highly recommend",50,February 2020,"Amazing property, very very beautiful room with super beautiful ocean view. Loved my stay here with very nice hospitality. The staff is polite and helpful.. Would highly recommend this property to others and you should stay atlst once here. Also the location (Nusa Dua) is really nice.",U Paasha Seminyak
491,Small errors are completely compensated by big advantages,50,February 2020,"The hotel is located in the central street of Seminyak and everything is within walking distance. If you have chosen Seminyak, it is a really good choice to stay here.

The most important pros and cons:

+ And this is an enormous plus: The check-in time determines the check-out time. So you book the room for 24 hours.
+ And this is a further enormous plus: there is indeed a breakfast buffet until 11 a.m., but if one - like me - misses it constantly, one can order breakfast until 11 p.m. No matter where. This I enjoyed alot.
+ The rooms are big and everything is there.
+ The pool on the roof is the centrepiece and there are probably not many hotels in Seminyak with a better view. You can spend a lot of time there.
+ It's not that expensive.

- Cleanliness can be improved in some places.
- Sometimes the large corridors made of exposed concrete feel like a parking garage
- The quality of food can be improved.",U Paasha Seminyak
492,susiek,50,January 2020,"Excellent position, all staff were very accommodating and I felt very welcome there.
Great value for money and you're in the middle of Seminyak. close to restaurants, shops and an easy walk to the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
493,Faultless,50,February 2020,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. All the staff were outstanding. The breakfast buffet was delicious and plentiful. Great central location in Seminyak. Busy outside but once in our room couldn't hear a thing.,U Paasha Seminyak
494,Amazing hotel that made the trip perfect!,50,February 2020,"After looking around for different hotels, we took a chance and thought we would try U Paasha. Let me tell you, we were not disappointed. Coming home at the end of the day to a nice cold air conditioned room was nothing short of a miracle. The daily breakfast allowed us to start at the day right. I couldn’t be happier with our choice and am so excited to come back to U Paasha for our next Bali adventure!",U Paasha Seminyak
495,Great location.,30,February 2020,"This is my second time staying at u paasha, possibly not my last due to the great location it’s in. Walking distance to most nice restaurants and not too far of a ride away from canguu. Only bone I have to pick is the lack of vegan options for breakfast, no soy milk for cereal, no alternate for normal yoghurt, no dairy free butter and half the time the one Bain mare I could eat from had cheese or cream in it. As well with the lunch there’s only a few things on the snack menu, along with a panini you can make up yourself. I asked for extra veggies as I didn’t select any meat options for the fillings and I got told I was only allowed 3 options, and my sandwich came out with two little slithers of avocado, two rings of onion, 2 slices of tomato and 2 slices of capsicum with a tiny slather of hummus. Can say we didn’t eat upstairs again after that and went out for breakfast a few times. Very disappointing stuff as a lot of the restaurants in Bali are being inclusive and even labelling their vegan products with (ve) or even (vegan). Would definitely stay here again if this hotel had a revamp of their f&b and included some vegan options or even labelled any of their vegan options. Could have been a great stay apart from that.",U Paasha Seminyak
496,Best Seminyak Hotel away from beach,50,January 2020,"My favorite hotel in all of Seminyak that is away from the beach. Close to everything!! best shopping, restaurants and bars. Kind and courteous staff, large clean rooms and great rooftop pool! Good breakfast with lots of options.",U Paasha Seminyak
497,Great in many ways!,50,February 2020,"Upon my arrival at U Passha, loved the ambience and vibes at the lobby. Did the check-in with very friendly and welcoming staffs, definitely the best way to start the stay.

The room was spacious and clean. They sure did paid attention to maintaining the property as well. Nicely done!

What was really a plus is its location! Walking distance to many good f&b options. Situated along the busy main road, you will be able to grab a taxi easily.

Breakfast and swimming pool were ok. Sound proofing can be improved.

Overall, a great hotel choice for Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
498,A stay to remember,40,February 2020,Great location. Spring spa nearby. Hospitality was above expectations so that was one to remember. Nice gestures for my birthday. We stayed on the 3rd floor so the street side noise wasn’t heard. Breakfast was good.,U Paasha Seminyak
499,Fantastic stay.,50,January 2020,"So close to Seminyak square, the facilities were beautiful and clean, staff were exceptional! Having the rooftop pool was fantastic and our room was perfect, quite spacious, very clean and quiet. The food was ok but not worth a 21% service fee plus 10% tax (plus wanting to leave a tip directly for the staff on top) but it’s easy to enjoy food/beverages elsewhere. Overall we loved our stay and would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
500,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2020,"Great location, wonderful Staff and delicious food! the rooftop pool is lovely. Buffet breakfast is great for what you pay, Staff always helpful, Security at the front of hotel very helpful with crossing the roads and directions.",U Paasha Seminyak
501,My stay at U Paasha,40,January 2020,"Great hotel, great location and lovely friendly staff
I have stayed here before and chose to come back.

There is a nice rooftop pool that gets a lovely breeze so it makes for a relaxing time when you want to have a swim and sit in the shade when a nice breeze is blowing.

Only negative is the foyer / reception and restaurant is rather warm as there is no air-conditioning",U Paasha Seminyak
502,Outstanding! Everything you need. Central. Will return!,50,January 2020,"Lovely staff, nice spacious and clean rooms and an outstanding pool on the roof top (with bar). Just a great vibe. Loads of 20-somethings, with the odd older couple and young family thrown in. All managed to share the large pool and relax without getting in each others way. We got chatting to a few of the guests and there were quite a few who have stayed at U Paasha repeatedly because they like it so much! I'd happily stay here again too! Good breakfast included, although I didn't trust the ice situation as each staff member I asked gave me a different answer as to whether the ice was safe or not! Good barista coffees offered and eggs cooked to order. Lovely balance of western and traditional Asian options for breakfast.

Their 24 room policy is actually fabulous. We arrived at around midday, but our room wasn't ready until about 2.30 which allowed us to stay until 2.30 on the day of checkout which was soooooo handy! I'd be pretty annoyed though if my room wasn't ready until super late - I'm sure they've lots plenty of return customers due to that. We were offered an upgrade upon check in so we could go straight to a room and I'm not entirely convinced that wasn't a sales strategy to get more money out of people? Thankfully we weren't in a rush though which meant they held our luggage while we went up to the pool bar for a nice long, well deserved swim after our long flight!

Frustrating check out process - although I feel bad writing this because I think the person was new to it, but we were in a rush and rather than having our IRP1,000,000 returned to us, it was recharged. Accidents happen though so I'm not holding that against them!

FYI we were a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 6 and 8).",U Paasha Seminyak
503,Excellent service,50,January 2020,"Room was spacious and clean. Staff was attentive and efficient. The air condition in the room was not working well but once this was reported, the staff was sent to service the air con and it was rectified within a short time frame. Bathroom and shower area is huge with good water pressure. Soaps provided smells lovely. Located in a convenient area where lots of good food are within walking distance.

lovely pool area where the sun hits you nicely if you are looking for a nice peaceful tan/swim with no touting.

It is our 2nd time stating with U paasha, and it never fails to disappoint. Thank you so much for the excellent service. We enjoyed our stay tremendously",U Paasha Seminyak
504,Nice place,40,January 2020,"Really nice hotel rooms.The rooms were well set out two lounges and spacious beds were very comfy. Shower was huge which is really nice. Hotel location was very central to everything we needed including bars restaurants and the beach.
Breakfast was good and changed each day pastries, fresh fruit, western style hot food and Asian selection available.
Room service dinner was quick and also good as was the food in pool area which w as up on the roof.
Pool itself was nice and a lot bigger than I expected. Heaps of sun beds and umbrellas.",U Paasha Seminyak
505,Awesome,50,January 2020,"Spacious, clean, nice bfast, the best is they have fresh juice ,jamu some kind of herb juice , the waitress and waiter in the restaurant very nice , strategic location in seminyak, .... will be back again..............",U Paasha Seminyak
506,U Pashha Seminyak hotel,50,January 2020,"This was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in while travelling! The service staff were incredible and the breakfast was superb quality !!! Awesome location too.
Love the free bicycles to use.
We would absolutely stay there again in the future. Thanks so much for the excellent stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
507,Best of Bali,50,January 2020,"This was definitely our best trip to Bali and in future we will only stay at UPaascha.

Things we loved the most would have to be the pool and rooftop bar! The food and drinks are fantastic as is the views. There was always plenty of sun beds and never crowded. Our connecting rooms were lovely and spacious and the contemporary style is lovely and unique.

I have to mention the location as UPaascha is central to everything in Seminyak. I can happily say we didn’t get into a single taxi which makes moving around so much more pleasant! We were surrounded by great restaurants and shops. Seminyak Square, Seminyak Village etc all within a very short walk.

The icing for us was the extraordinary 24 hour room guarantee. We checked in around 10pm on arrival so our checkout time was 10pm. We had a late flight home so this really made the last day enjoyable.

Thanks for a lovely holiday!",U Paasha Seminyak
508,No Surprises,50,January 2020,U Paash in Seminyak was amazing. The room was exactly the same as shown on Expedia website. Amazing pool and area surrounding. Rooftop cafe provided good menu for light dishes at reasonable price. I didn't need my room serviced Every day but when done staff were very thorough. I couldn't fault this hotel. Good location with great restaurants nearby. Will definitely come again.,U Paasha Seminyak
509,Great place,50,January 2020,"Great location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. The staff were super friendly and courteous , the breakfast buffet was excellent and the sunset views from the rooftop were amazing.
Will definitely go back!",U Paasha Seminyak
510,Wonderful Hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2020,"We have stayed at U Paasha in Seminyak many times and we are always guaranteed a great experience. Brendan and his wonderful team really care and pay great attention to detail. Rooms are great, the pool and rooftop bar are a treat with amazing sunsets. Breakfast is included in your stay and the food and service is very high standard. We would highly recommend a stay here if holidaying in the wonderful island of Bali. Big thanks Brendan and team, Chris and Cleo",U Paasha Seminyak
511,Excellent choice!,50,January 2020,"The U Paasha was an excellent choice because the rooms are peaceful, even if the hotel is located in the middle of a busy area. Roof top pool is wonderful, the breakfast excellent, and all the staff, extraordinary!!",U Paasha Seminyak
512,"Wonderful staff, great location but needs improvement",40,January 2020,"It’s the second time that my husband and I stayed at Upaasha and as expected it was great!
The pool view is beautiful, staff is lovely, polite and always friendly.
We had a little issue with our room but I guess because of the season. The AC wasn’t making the room as cold as we would like and maintenance came to fix it twice and at the end they gave us a portable AC to make the room cooler which was amazing.

Do think the shower needs a deeper cleaning as tiles were really dark specially getting closer to the floor, the menu is really small with no options of even side of chips or chicken burger so it would be great to see a improvement on that and also a 24h kitchen.",U Paasha Seminyak
513,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2020,"This was our second time staying at U Paasha as we loved our first stay here so much. We love this hotel for so many reasons. Firstly, the staff are always very helpful, friendly and kind. We absolutely the rooftop pool and receiving a complimentary drink voucher for each guest. The room is very spacious which allowed us to spread out. It was always cleaned at a convenient time and left very tidy. Lastly, the location of this hotel is fantastic. Being in a very central spot made it easy for us to walk everywhere without having to get a cab.

Overall, another fantastic stay at U Paasha and we will definitely be back soon. Thank you U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
514,Great location,50,December 2019,"Our family had a great stay at Upasha. Super location in Seminyak, massive and modern rooms, quality breakfast & great coffee. Love the checkout time based on when you check in - perfect for Australian flights that arrive and depart at night. Highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
515,Short stay but great experience!,50,January 2020,"This is a lovely modern hotel right in the heart of Seminyak with very spacious rooms and great service from the staff.

Let me start with the negative, and I must stress this isn't really the hotels fault! The trip to the hotel was a bit of a nightmare! Around the Kuta / Seminyak / Canggu area is now so busy that getting in to these places is nothing short of disastrous! The roads are so bad you are literally crawling in traffic through the tiny roads lined with cabs and mopeds trying to get to your destination. In fact we had to get out of our taxi and walk nearly a kilometer with cases to the hotel because he just couldn't get near. We did visit during a busy period but it's way busier in general in Bali that when we last visited only a few years before.

Ok now the positives. Firstly the hotel is very centrally located, which means if you want to head to the beach bars / clubs / restaurants for a bit more chill, it's easy to walk to. Alternatively if you want to venture in to the party streets of Seminyak, again, a stones throw away!

The hotel itself is really stylishly designed with a very spacious lobby and breakfast area with attentive staff. The rooms are huge!! and again nicely designed with everything you need in there and seem pretty soundproofed from the mayhem out on the streets of Seminyak.

The one BIG positive for this hotel is the check-in / out policy. Basically they have a 24 hour room policy, so if you check in at 8pm, the room is yours until 8pm the following day. In fact we were able to check-out at midnight based on our very late arrival. This is a huge benefit if you flying home the next day!

The rooftop pool area was really nice with great views of Seminyak and the sea! The staff up there were really friendly and very happy to serve you drinks all day. The rooftop bar was also nice if a little quiet.

The hotel also offer a driver service to and from the airport etc in their own private car (you pay a bit of a premium). The driver was easily the safest driver we had during our stay in Bali, the rest of them thought they were Lewis Hamilton but without the driving ability!",U Paasha Seminyak
516,Fun and relaxing roof top pool,50,January 2020,"Breakfast is fairly good selection.

Highlight is the roof top pool with excellent views of sunset. Cocktails are well made and service is good.

Happy hour from 5 till 7 at roof top is excellent.

Rooms are large and reasonably equipped.",U Paasha Seminyak
517,Great location great facilities,50,January 2020,Sensational great service lovely swimming pool good customer service great location very comfortable bed good laundry facilities excellent breakfast buff a great chic fit out Internet connection was excellent.,U Paasha Seminyak
518,U Paasha Stay,40,January 2020,"This hotel was great! The location was fantastic- so convenient to walk to restaurants, bars, shops, and a 10-15 minute walk to the beach area. The room was spacious, great amenities, and I would definitely stay here again when I come back to visit!",U Paasha Seminyak
519,"Great Service, Great Location",50,October 2019,"Found the staff to be very knowledgeable and friendly, they even personalise the bathroom amenities for you. The Hotel was extremely clean and well laid out. Breakfast was nice and plentiful. The rooftop pool was an excellent amenity and the service of drinks and food in and around the pool space was first class. The little pop-up bar at the front of the hotel on the street side was a great space to meet and pass the time at. Overall a great stay and highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
520,Great location,50,January 2020,"I highly recommend this hotel, the room was spacious and fit all 4 of us. The location was perfect and is in the heart of restaurants and shopping. The money exchange is directly across the road and the hotel staff were great. We will be coming back at the end of the year!",U Paasha Seminyak
521,"Good location, spacious room",50,January 2020,"What I like the most from U Paasha is the spacious room. I love the decor and the amenities. I love the bathroom, the pool. Located in front of Cafe Bali, this hotel is surrounded by spa and salon, shop, and restaurants. You will easily find something to buy and to eat. Yoshinoya is precisely next to hotel.
After check in, the staff will give you voucher for welcome drink where you can get in the rooftop pool bar. WILL DEFINITELY STAY HERE AGAIN YEASSHH!",U Paasha Seminyak
522,Amazing,50,January 2020,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, beautiful staff. Highly recommend. The hotel rooms are beautiful, walking distance to all cafes and restaurants. Great views from the rooftop pool. Perfect for couples, families or solo travellers",U Paasha Seminyak
523,Recommended hotel at seminyak area,50,December 2019,Very big room..big corridor...wonderful breakfast..very nice place at seminyak..pool at high floor with seminyak view. A lot of famous restaurant around hotel..very helpful manager his name is Brendan..,U Paasha Seminyak
524,Excellent,50,December 2019,"The room on level 5 was large & clean with a nice view.
The rooftop pool is quite nice to relax and watch the sunset.
Location is great but maybe not so much for walking to the beach. Minimart with FX is just cross the road with plenty of shops & restaurants nearby.
Excellent customer service.
Check-out is at the same time as check-In which worked very well for me.",U Paasha Seminyak
525,Post New Year Short Break in Seminyak,50,January 2020,"Know Bali and love SEminyak but first time we had stayed in this area as normally stay in the hotels on the beach. This proved really handy for a short stay, close to the shops and restaurants. Hotel facilities are very good for price paid - big rooms, decent pool area and nice breakfast. Staff are all excellent as well.",U Paasha Seminyak
526,Room. Location. Rooftop Pool. It’s got it all!,50,January 2020,"We love everything about U Paasha! The Spacious room, delicious food, amazing location (can walk to all the best Seminyak spots) best rooftop pool & views and above all - great friendly customer service. We’ll be back for the 3rd time soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
527,Amazing Hotel & Prime Location,50,December 2019,"Had the most amazing stay at U Paasha over New Years Eve! The rooms are huge & beds are so comfortable. Staff are incredibly helpful & always around to ask questions or order your next cocktail.
The New Years Eve dinner was a great night out & the view of the fireworks from the rooftop pool is unbeatable. Full 360 degree view of the fireworks going off all over Bali, stunning!

Only slight downfalls were the size of the balconies, with no seating (had to drag a heavy bench from inside) and the bathrooms are so large it’s a bit disappointing there’s no bath.

Overall though, an incredible hotel within walking distance or short scooter ride from everything you want from your Bali trip.

Already planning to go back for the 20/21 New Year!",U Paasha Seminyak
528,Honeymoon,50,January 2020,"Great location! Great staff! Great food!
Was a recommendation to us from a friend and so glad we took it up.
Thank you to a superb hotel for making first trip to Bali memorable and treating us like royalty.",U Paasha Seminyak
529,Good Value,40,December 2019,"We stayed briefly at U Paasha during our trip and found it to be good value for money and very clean. If you're looking for hotel style accommodation then U Paasha would suit. It has a great rooftop pool which is a nice spot to watch the sunset. Only downside for us was that we found the street it was on (eat st) to be too busy for our liking but alot of people would probably find the location preferable, it just wasn't for us.",U Paasha Seminyak
530,"Great hotel, pool, staff, food and rooftop bar!",50,December 2019,"This was a great last minute find. The hotel had a car service they provide who met me at the baggage claim and took me direct via air conditioned car with wifi and a cold towel to the check in desk. I love the 24 hour room as I checked in at 4 p.m. and was able to stay at the pool until 3ish on checkout day, showering before heading to the next island. Two of my five nights there was a BBQ on the rooftop pool that had a big food selection and awesome price. Breakfast was plentiful each morning and you can even have delivered to your room.",U Paasha Seminyak
531,Already looking at coming back,50,December 2019,"I travelled with 3 friends. None of us had been to Bali before so was not sure what to expect.
The hotel is on the main street in Seminyak Great if you want to go to the shops or mini mart directly opposite. (When we arrived (around 10.30pm) it was very busy outside but once you are in the hotel you feel like you are on a quiet street. We were greeted to friendly staff who helped with our luggage and took us to reception.We had 2 king size rooms between 4 of us that were to a very high standard. We were located on the ground level. I don't normally eat breakfast but I could not resist the buffet style offering, they even make pancakes to order and eggs any way you would like them.
The pool which is located on the roof top is stunning, complete relaxation and the pool service was fantastic!
We were celebrating a friends birthday - all the staff went out of their way - decorated the bed, presented a cake and everyone sang happy birthday. The staff really make this hotel and cannot do enough for you.
We will be back, thank you for making a memorable trip.",U Paasha Seminyak
532,A wonderful place to stay!,50,December 2019,What can I say? I want to come back! U Paasha is wonderful. You are greeted as soon as you walk up the stairs into their huge open spaced lobby. Everyone is friendly and always has a smiles on their faces. The rooms are spacious and clean and they just like the photos in the ads. The free breakfast buffet is so delicious with tons of variety along with made to order items. The rooftop BBQ is great too! Made to order grilled fresh seafood and a noodle bar with your choice of ingredients. So yummy! Fresh views and a gorgeous swimming pool with food and drinks served to you! You will not regret staying at U Paasha!,U Paasha Seminyak
533,Loved it,50,December 2019,U Paasha is a fantastic hotel. Located in the heart of Seminyak but quiet enough a location to not disturb your sleep. Rooms were very well maintained. Hotel staff were very accommodating. Rooftop pool offers a great spot to watch the sun set.,U Paasha Seminyak
534,"When I come back to seminyak, I will stay here Absolutly.",50,December 2019,"First of all, the location is very good. The hotel is located near by seminyak village, beach, and hottest street.

535,Enjoyed our stay at U Paasha,50,December 2019,"Loved the 24 hour check in concept and breakfast at any time.
Would definitely come back to U Paasha the next time I’m back in Bali!

536,"Good value, beautiful interior design.",40,December 2019,"Location is good at the heart of semiyak. The design of hotel is temporary. Cool lobby witj cool lighting. Excellent service by reception Daisy, very sweet and friendly. Other staff are nice and helpful, actively pick up luggage for us.
Breakfast is so good with many of choice. Egg Benedict and omelet is by order. Good coffee provided.
Swimming pool at roof and look nice but i dont hv time to try.
Room is spacious. Design is good. Bed is large. The smell of soap and shampoo and body wash is really good.
But, cleanliness is one issue. The tile wall of toilet is not clean enough. Part of the metal parts in bathroom is rusted. Also for the room service is slow. I didn’t expect toothbrushes is not provide upon request. It also take 10 minute to get the toothbrush to us. On the other morning, i requested another shampoo for morning bath and it didnt delivrrery at last.

The hotel is really worth to stay, part of the service is out of expectly good(we got free ticket to get a drink for rooftop bar!). But some general service need to reinforced.",U Paasha Seminyak

The rooms are absolutely massive with comfortable beds! The hotel staff are very accommodating and helpful, we rented a scooter for 3 days and the receptionist helped hook this up.

The breakfast is delicious, eggs are great! Loved the breakfast here, the security at this hotel is great. Hotel is opposite a 24/7 mini mart, very convenient.

Only downside was they had some construction work going off in the room next door and we had to hear some drilling etc. not convenient. But apart from that, great hotel, great pool, great staff, would defo recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
540,"Best hotel in Bali, great value for money!",50,December 2019,"The hotel is located in a very convenient location, smack right in the middle of everything. It was just a 5 min walk to Revolver where you can get great coffee, and about 10 - 15 min to Kudeta.
The staff were wonderful; very friendly and efficient, and they made our staff so comfortable. They took the time to introduce themselves, and to make sure that everything was okay. At the same time, they gave us our personal space and privacy.
The room was amazing. Huge, and very clean. The check in and check out process was quick and simple, and they even recognised that I was a returning customer, and issued me a card which entitled me to discounts in the hotel for that. Awesome!
The rooftop pool is absolutely gorgeous in the sun, and at sunset, and the BBQ dinner at the rooftop restaurant was sumptuous! Their gym was great too, and allowed me to get some exercise while on holiday. Only regret I have is that I wish I had woken up on time for their free 6am yoga class on Saturday; will be sure to do so the next time!
I'll definitely stay here again when I return to Bali, and I highly recommend this place to anyone, whether you're travelling alone, as a couple or in families.",U Paasha Seminyak
541,Simply The Best,50,December 2019,"My 7th stay at U Paasha Hotel - there is just no other to compare. The beds are sublime - so comfortable it's like sleeping on a cloud, the pillows are perfect, the linen is top quality. The rooms have just undergone an upgrade and they are again fresh and just stunning. The main features I love about this hotel is location, location, location. The rooms are huge (all suites), the staff can't do enough for you. It's not a hotel for young families, more for mature aged couples. The hotel is walking distance to all the great restaurants on eats street such as Chandi, Ultimo, Mama San, Rumours, Ginger Moon etc and few minutes taxi ride to the likes of W Hotel, Potato Head. Nice walk to La Lucciola, walking distance to The Red Carpet Champagne Bar, Ku De Ta. U Paasha Seminyak has a fantastic breakfast, great pool side snacks and cold, cold drinks and well made cocktails. Roof top pool is great which gives you a fantastic sunset at the Cocktail Bar. Fantastic happy hour from 5pm to 7pm then downstairs from 7pm to 9pm. Brilliant BBQ 3 nights a week which is delicious. Biggest, best rooms, polished concrete, lots of power points. Mega king size beds, great bathroom, huge, huge roomes (Suites) new modern everything, whisper quiet airconditioner, fantastic TV reception with great selection of channels, good water pressure (with very hot water if you want it), huge walk in shower, huge double vanity, espresso coffee making machine as well as a kettle and a selection of boxed English teas, chaise lounge, huge dressing table and/or work station, plenty of storage, electronic safe, day bed, coffee table and the grandest comfortable beds (did I mention that) - I would rate these beds equal for comfort as the Bellagio in Vegas and superior manchester. Good supply of amenities, competitive laundry rates, 24 hour room service, mini bar fridge, complimentary water. There are a plethora of shops as well as market stalls, 5 minute walk to Seminyak Square and Seminyak Village. Trusted money changed at Circle K across the street from U Paasha and also another very safe money changer about a 2 minutes walk from the hotel (turn left when you exit the hotel). Some great late night bars with live music. TIP: I should write a really bad review so it can stay a secret :) This hotel will not disappoint. ENJOY!",U Paasha Seminyak
542,Best from the best,50,December 2019,The best hotel in Bali. We stayed in Bali for 20 days and changed about 7 hotels. There delicious breakfast. I like it. It’s truly very good place to stay. The pool on the roof and a lot restaurant near by,U Paasha Seminyak
543,Great Time!,50,December 2019,"Awesome Resort! Great value for money. The rooms are a great size for the price. Smack bang in the middle of Seminyak, it can’t be beat for location. The pool on the roof if fantastic, especially at sun set. Would recommend and will be coming back!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
544,3rd stay at upaasha and still wonderful,50,December 2019,"As the title suggests, I’ve stayed here three times over the past few years. The location is great if you want the bustling part of Seminyak as the hotel is nestled within the main strip of restaurants and bars (LaFavela is less than 100m from the hotel). The rooms are extremely generous for the price and the staff are attentive and always prepared to help with your needs. The roof top pool with chilled music offers a nice break from the busy streets. Breakfast buffet offers a large variety and on this visit, little stickers provide dietary advice. This was great as I’m vegan and was able to choose accordingly.. the only down side is the vegan options were very few ( even the bread contains eggs/dairy). This is my choice though so it is not a fault of the hotel and pushed me into making healthier breakfast choices (lots of fruit to choose from). Thanks again for another Brilliant stay :)",U Paasha Seminyak
545,Great location,50,December 2019,"Our stay at U Paasha was perfect for a couples holiday. Great location in Seminyak - was able to walk to Sarong, Motel Mexicola, Potato Head, La Lucciola and so many other great places. Rooftop pool and bar perfect place to relax in between adventures and a nice place to watch the sun go down. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Would stay again",U Paasha Seminyak
546,One Of The Best Hotels Ive Stayed In,50,November 2019,"I stayed here for 8 nights at the end of November with my partner and we absolutely loved it. They decorated the room upon arrival which was great. The hotel is amazing from the minute you get there to the minute you walk in the room. The staff are really friendly, they greet you with a smile always and overall the hospitality is great. A day before we checked out, they called the room to see if we needed assistance for a taxi, or any help whatsoever and it was much appreciated. Check in and check out were 24hrs and it was as smooth as anything. If you do stay here, make sure to visit the rooftop pool, it was outstanding and I didn’t want to leave😍

Breakfast was amazing, so many choices and different drink options. Not to mention, the buffet BBQ was amazing!

We had an issue with the A/C in the room and we called reception who sent out engineers at about 10pm to fix it. It still wasn’t perfect but it wasnt too much of an issue afterwards.

Thank you so much UPaasha for your hospitality. Will defo stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
547,Excellent in all Aspects,50,December 2019,"Excellent Location. Close to everything.

550,2nd visit in a year !!!,50,November 2019,"We were lucky enough to be able to come back again in November for 7 nights and the place still has the cool, relaxed and warm vibe to it. The staff always greet you with a warm natural smile. We love the rooftop pool and the cool breeze as your downing a cold one, even better during the happy hour. The location is great and there are so many great restaurants, family friendly beach clubs in the area or a short taxi ride away. Seriously looking forward to our next visit. A great hotel for all age groups",U Paasha Seminyak
551,"Best location, cleanliness and awesome facilities",50,November 2019,"Not my first stay and I would stay again!

It was our first time to Bali and it certainly won't be our last. The hotel staff made our stay and my daughter's birthday very special. The staff are friendly and helpful the breakfast is delicious with great variety to suit all tastes. The swimming pool on the roof is beautiful with a bar area and poolside service. The bedrooms are large and clean. The hotel is situated in a fantastic location central to restaurants bars and shops. I would like to thank all the staff of this hotel for your part in making our stay so special. We are definitely coming back same time next year x",U Paasha Seminyak
553,Great place to stay,50,November 2019,From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and nothing was a problem. The rooms were clean and comfortable.

Spacious room size, Guaranteed 24H staying, I love it, if your flight is late night, it will be usefull. Rooftop pool and BBQ buffet nice. Only cons is shower room, run down and not clean.",U Paasha Seminyak
556,Great stay in the hustle and bustle!,50,November 2019,"My partner and I stayed in a regular room on the 5th floor. The room itself was very spacious with a king bed and the usual amenities one would expect. Not so usual, but a great concept, was the ability to choose soaps, pillows etc. before arriving. Buffet breakfast was a breeze with plenty of variety each day. The staff were all amazing and accommodated any request without hesitation. The location of this hotel is also a bonus; right in the heart of bustling Seminyak. Restaurants, cafes, convenience stores and shops all within walking distance. Overall, a great stay that I can't fault. Well done U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
557,Amazing room and staff are very accomodating.,50,November 2019,"I have stayed at U paasha a few times now, love their 24 hours room use system and the amazing room and friendly and helpful staff.

This time the manager even came up to say hi at breakfast and knows my name. That is very personalised service to make you feel very welcomed.

Always enjoy my stay at U paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
558,"U Paasha - Best Price, Best Service and Best Location!",50,November 2019,"My wife and I stayed at the U Paasha Seminyak from 25-29 Nov 2019. We had a fabulous stay. The price was very good as they threw in 2 way free airport transfers and gave us a free Buffet BBQ for 2 pax as part of the stay package. Services provided by the staff was excellent - from housekeeping to front desk. The rooms were extremely spacious, very clean and had two sofas for lounging around. Internet service was free and stable. The location of U Paasha is excellent, within comfortable walking distance to Seminyak village, Seminyak Square and the flea market, not to mention a string of cafes, restaurants, shops and spas all along the way. We will definitely be heading back to U Paasha Seminyak real soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
559,Great Hotel and Staff,50,November 2019,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and will again if I'm visiting Seminyak. The facilities are great from the spacious, comfortable rooms to the amazing rooftop pool and bar. The hotel is always in pristine condition and the staff are wonderful without exception.
They do an excellent breakfast buffet and the 24 hour check in/out policy is super convenient. The hotel is located in a very bustling part of Seminyak, yet offers peace and quiet if one so desires. Highly recommend this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
560,Highly Recommend,50,November 2019,"This is the second time we have stayed at the U Paasha we loved it so much the first time we returned with friends to celebrate a special birthday. Rooftop Bar was absolutely perfect for the party with an awesome band delicious cocktails, a perfect view of the sunset and to top it off the staff are so friendly happy efficient especially Reka who remembered us from one year earlier !!!
Rooms are very clean spacious and comfortable.
Location is perfect if you want everything on your doorstep.
Love the pool area lots of sun loungers huge pool and service is friendly, Cede is a very funny character who is always happy.
Lastly an excellent breakfast which is served until 11 am and if you miss the breakfast you can eat it in your room until to 11 pm.
I hope this review has been helpful enjoy your stay at Upaasha 👍",U Paasha Seminyak
561,Serenity in the bustle,50,November 2019,We felt the serenity of this hotel as we drove in off the busy street and it did not disappoint us. We explored around but loved coming back to this serene hotel. Service was great food lovely and nothing was too difficult for the staff. Thank you,U Paasha Seminyak
562,My 50th Birthday Celebration,50,November 2019,"Wow Wow Wow
We couldn't of come to a better place. It's our first time in Bali but definitely won't be our last and we will be coming back to this hotel next year. Nothing is too much trouble the staff are amazing the breakfast delicious and what a fantastic location right in the middle of shops restaurants bars night clubs. I'm so sad to leave this hotel and Bali but will be back very soon",U Paasha Seminyak
563,Perfect in every way,50,October 2019,"We visit Bali two to three times a year and we have found U Paasha to be our favourite place. Its a winner in every way- great location, spacious spotless rooms, full sun rooftop pool with stunning sunset views, delicious breakfast and cocktails and the most amazing staff you could every experience. Kudos to Brendan for driving such excellence. Cannot wait to return.",U Paasha Seminyak
564,Lovely,40,November 2019,"We stayed at UPaasha for the second time in November. Last year we were on the 1st floor down the back of the corridor where the level of noise was at a minimum. This year we were on the second floor towards the front of the Hotel and it was certainly much noisier, with people talking loudly in the corridors and cars on the street.
We do love UPaasha but found this time the front desk to be less informed about the local area when we asked questions and the service overall was less personalized than last year on our visit. Perhaps they were just too busy this time and have new staff. 😊
Last year my overall rating was 5 stars.",U Paasha Seminyak
565,Awesome stay! Love this place,40,November 2019,"First time staying in Seminyak, and I never regretted staying with U Paasha. The service is awesome, facilities are top notch and the price is reasonable too!

The rooftop bar and swimming pool is great to hangout at, with even supplies of sunblock and towels all day. Love how the music choice is pretty spot on, and having happy hour deals in a heated pool is just, perfect.

The breakfast spread at the hotel is also pretty decent, love how they cooked their porridge and having freshly blended juice every morning.

The only downside is that there ain’t that many accessible charging ports in the room. There’s one beside the lamp by the TV, another beside just 1 bed and the other is used for the telephone. Other than that, the next nearest port is at the water boiler/fridge area.

It’ll be great to have more ports, so I’d consider coming here for business trips too if there’s like USB ports etc on the desk where I can use my laptop for work while watching tv.",U Paasha Seminyak
566,Great stay at U Paasha,50,November 2019,"My husband and I had a great stay at U Paasha which is in right in the middle of the busy but fabulous “Eat Street”. The rooms are big and very comfortable and represent terrific value for money. Breakfast was delicious, with a wide variety of options to cater for all tastes. We loved having drinks on the rooftop while watching the sunset. Happy hour is awesome! The rooftop pool is stunning although perhaps a little more shade would be helpful. Overall a great experience!",U Paasha Seminyak
567,Great view from the rooftop,50,November 2019,"The food and drinks were great, the rooftop provided a great view across Seminyak. Especially good was the regular bbq buffet cook ups they did on the rooftop three times a week in the evening. The rooms are spacious and the beds were really comfy.",U Paasha Seminyak
568,Nice hotel,40,November 2019,"Great location. Rooms huge and bed comfortable but pillows not comfortable at all. Look lovely and fluffy but they sink and you’re left with no support.
Everything very clean and staff very helpful and friendly.
Pool area is awesome but water very warm, really cool tunes playing as well! No crappy bogan music.
A good mix of sun and shade for day long relaxing.
Good selection of breakfast items.
Quiet from street noise as well.
Absolutely everything you need within walking distance but I used the GRAB app for transport if I needed to go to Kuta or Legian. Much cheaper than any of the taxis and you don’t need cash.
Would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
569,"Great Hotel, Great Location shame about the BBQ Buffet",40,November 2019,Hotel was fine but we were talked into going to the BBQ Buffet it was terrible everything was burnt. There was 10 of us & we all could not eat the BBQ. We complained but no one was interested. Would not recommend eating there.,U Paasha Seminyak
570,Awesome stay in a fantastic location,50,October 2019,"We loved our stay at U Paasha and can't wait to get back.

The room was huge and had plenty of space to stretch out. It was perfectly clean and stocked full of anything we needed. Plenty of towels, soaps and shower items. We could have used the hotel products and not taken our own and we would have been satisfied.

The rooftop pool area was a great way to escape the chaos of the Seminyak streets. We were always able to find an umbrella to escape the sun and the staff at the pool were always checking if we needed anything. Their service was impeccable.

Breakfast was included and a great way to start our day. We loved being able to order our eggs cooked as we liked and after a day the staff knew our coffee order and would write up our orders as they saw us coming in to the breakfast area. U Paasha has a great location only steps away from fantastic restaurants in Seminyak. We would go for a walk most morning before the crowds and the heat started and everything that we wanted to see was within a walk from the hotel.

Thanks for a wonderful and safe stay U Paasha. We can't wait to get back and experience all your wonderful hospitality again. Thanks",U Paasha Seminyak
571,Amazing as always !,50,November 2019,"This was our third stay at this hotel, fantastic, wonderful staff, everything is so good. Location, rooms, breakfast, pool area, Brendan, general manager, he’s awesome, he came had a chat with us at breakfast one morning, great guy, made us feel really welcome and knew who we were, the whole hotel is a real credit to him and his team, the staff are the nicest friendliest people and nothing is too much trouble for them, it’s like being at a home away from home! We will always go back and never look anywhere else. The location is perfect, everything is perfect at this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
572,Pleasant Stay!,40,November 2019,"We stayed at the U Paasha for 2 nights in Nov 2019. To begin, I was a bit sceptical staying on the main drag of Seminyak but the rooms are pleasantly set back and you barely hear the noise of the hustle and bustle of the town.
The rooms are huge, nicely appointed, large bathroom mirrors and very comfortable bed. The roof top pool now thats something special a little warm for my liking however stunning especially the 2 for 1 cocktails every day from 5-9pm (i think) we're delicious, breakfast was good (not spectacular) however had a good variety.
I would highly recommend this hotel for couples or even a small group of friends (we were a group of 3 girls).
Would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
573,Top spot with friendly service,50,November 2019,"From informative pre-arrival correspondence, cheerful hotel driver greeting us from our delayed midnight flight arrival to efficient housekeeping and warm smiles with my coffee at an extensive yummy buffet breakfast...wish I could stay longer this trip! most certainly will be coming back next year! Thank you U Paasha Seminyak",U Paasha Seminyak
574,"Nicely design & huge room, but noisy",40,November 2019,"(+)
They upgraded our room and gave us the bigger suite. The suite that we booked was already huge by average hotel standard, but this upgraded room is nearly double the size. We're very pleased. They even decorated the bed with rose petals. The bathroom area is so big and there's a walk-in wardrobe too.

The location of the hotel is in the middle of Eat Street so there's plenty of good upscale restaurants around us. There's a convenience store opposite the hotel.

The staffs are lovely, always smiling and eager to assist us. Because we have very early flight, they gave us breakfast boxes to eat on the way to the airport.

(-)
The upgraded room is unfortunately facing the street which gets very noisy around 4pm onwards until midnight because of the taxis horn throughout the night. There's also very loud music from the lobby and restaurants nearby. The hotel room walls are not soundproof. You can hear everything.

Not much of a complaint on the hotel because this is expected staying on this busy street. Just to take note that it's not going to be quiet. Luckily we slept soundly on all nights because we're too tired from the day trips.",U Paasha Seminyak
575,Fantastic stay,50,November 2019,"Exceeded expectations. Clean, friendly staff, beautiful pool. Pool towels provided. Great location - central to everything in Seminyak. Great cafes close by. Only thing I would suggest is to add Gluten Free bread as option for breakfast, and for the staff to be able to recommend restaurants for traditional Indonesian food as we asked, but they did not really have any good recommendations. Other than that, would absolutely return to this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
576,Relaxing and in the heart of Seminyak,50,November 2019,"Great location in the heart of Seminyak. Facilities, pool deck view, breakfast and more importantly staff all friendly and wonderful. Highly recommend for future stays and also children friendly. Pool towels provided and you do not have to bring.",U Paasha Seminyak
577,Excellent in every way,50,November 2019,"Photos are accurrate - exceeded our expectations, breakfast amazing! Super comfy beds.. everything was excellent. Staff very helpful and friendly, one security guard stood out with his welcoming and friendliness, special thanks to him. Pool beautiful, cannot fault this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
578,I have been scammed by this Hotel,10,November 2019,"For Mr. Brendan Lane-Mullins General Manager
I have been scammed by this Hotel,
With the darkness they have to make the exit, it is very difficult to see the numbers, but they must see the next morning that they charge you more but they say nothing
As of today, 10 days have passed and I'm still waiting for an answer,
that there has been an error in the charge of the credit card, they do not apologize.
I thought you just had to be careful in Bali in the currency exchange houses, but I was wrong, you also have to keep an eye on the Hotels",U Paasha Seminyak
579,Best location!,50,November 2019,"Fantastic hotel! super clean, spacious rooms, great location. Walking distance to all the best spots in Seminyak. Staff are super polite and very helpful. They provide towels for the pool (don’t have to cart beach towels) which is also a plus. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a hotel stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
580,Delighted by the Service and Friendliness of Staff.,50,November 2019,"We spent 7 nights at the U Paasha Seminyak and it was delightful. From our arrival until our departure we were treated like treasured guests by the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and the service was professional, prompt and passionate. each staff member asked about our stay so far and how they could make it better.

Not having travelled to Bali before I hoped that I had chosen a well located Hotel close to all Seminyak has to offer and the U Paasha ended up being perfectly located along the main shopping strip in Seminyak. although we were close to everything, as soon as you stepped into the hotel the noise and hustle of the busy street faded away and we the atmosphere relaxed and tranquil.

We would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.",U Paasha Seminyak
581,Highly Recommend!!!,50,November 2019,This place is definitely value for money. Location and service is fantastic. Recommend to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of Seminyak. Walking distance to everything. Everyone friendly and accommodating.,U Paasha Seminyak
582,Great location,30,November 2019,"Great location right in the centre of the city & close to all great clubs, great bed & pool faculties but was pretty expensive for the actual room you got. We ordered room service one day and the food was really bad!",U Paasha Seminyak
583,UPaasha,40,November 2019,"Perfectly located for Lots of great restaurants and bars.
Hotel staff are very friendly
The facilities are good and rooftop bar is great
Food is great too
Been there twice now and will be going back again. Top choice",U Paasha Seminyak
584,Great stay at UPaasha,50,November 2019,"Great place, so relaxed with a great pool. Staff really happy and pleased to help. Nice location really close to bars, restaurants and shops. Seminyak is a little busy but UPaasha is a a little haven in the middle.",U Paasha Seminyak
585,Great location for foodies,50,October 2019,"We picked this hotel because of its location- it’s smack bang in the middle of the Main Street in Seminyak called “eat street”, tonnes of restaurants and massage places just at the front door. There are also plenty of pubs and clubs on the street if you want a drink.

The hotel rooms were spacious and clean. Can’t fault them, there were plenty of good channels on the TV too. Beds and pillows were comfy too.

We checked in at 6pm so we got to check out at 6pm. I have never had this at any other hotel and was a bit skeptical at first when we had to wait an hour at 5 for our room to be ready but the 6pm check out is amazing when you’re on a night flight (which most aussies are). Really great idea! And because we had to wait an hour for our room to be ready we got a free meal at the rooftop bar- which was perfect.

Buffett breakfast wasn’t extensive and it was hot as there is no air con in the lobby but that was a minor issue. They made eggs and pancakes fresh which good.

The pool is a sun bakers dream. It gets great morning and arvo sun! And the poo list keep at a temperature where it is nice and cool and refreshing.

We were in 2 rooms and we didn’t have connecting rooms. The front desk staff tried really hard and got us connecting rooms after a couple days which was much appreciated.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
586,Awesome place,50,November 2019,"Excellent location, spacious rooms , everything you could find for breakfast .. super star staff! Helped me with phone calls to locate a lost phone - the security guard on the mornings of 04/05 November was so smiley and helpful! He is an asset to your hotel, the first person you see is always an indication ! Happy hour was happy! Pool superb! Will stay again! From Janie Johnstone",U Paasha Seminyak
587,Location Location !,50,October 2019,"This hotel was fantastic, beautiful rooms and facilities and the most friendly staff.

588,Lovely,40,November 2019,"Great location, nice big rooms and comfortable. Lots of variety for breakfast. Great bbq on the roof at night.
Nice pool area though not much shade even with umbrella. Room was not very dark in the morning though. Really enjoyed my stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
589,In the Heart of Seminyak,50,October 2019,"Great Stay. Awesome location. You can walk right out of reception and into the into the heart of Seminyak energy, but when you get back to your suite or roof top pool, you are in a tranquil and peaceful environment. Great Value to. Highly recommend",U Paasha Seminyak
590,What a find!,50,October 2019,"Our first time in Bali and we feel so lucky to have found U Paasha. I specifically asked for a quiet room and we've been more than happy with 118 on the ground floor near the end of the long and wide corridor. All the staff are delightful. The rooms are really big, well designed and nicely furnished. Bathroom is also large. Breakfast choices were excellent. Sunset cocktails were generous and the pool is brilliant. This hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of eating, drinking, shopping area, which can be a bit overwhelming to newcomers... But the U Paasha is a great haven to return to and relax in. A lovely warm welcome emanates from everyone.",U Paasha Seminyak
591,Great place to stay in Seminyak,50,October 2019,"We loved our stay at U Paasha in Seminyak. Great location close to nice restaurants, coffee, nightlife, and shopping.

I travel a lot for work, and this place really is a rare gem - spacious, clean, functional and very comfortable room & bed, all details clearly well thought.

596,Excellent Hotel,50,October 2019,"Excellent location, in a heart of Seminyak. Great room with HUGE bed and separate bathroom, air conditioned (which was a bit noisy at night), modern decor with hints of Balinese culture, great open reception area, excellent buffet breakfast, lovely, friendly welcoming staff. No kids club unfortunately.
Great pool :-) Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak

598,Perfect location & excellent accomodation,50,October 2019,"I was a guest for 7 nights & found the staff & facilities were extremely good.
Very relaxed & well thought out rooms.
The ability to view both sunrise & sunset from the rooftop pool area was a bonus as the views are fantastic.",U Paasha Seminyak
599,"Great staff, facility and location!",50,October 2019,"This is my first time staying in this hotel and I really love the location. Everything was close and the parking lot was very spacious so it was very easy to park my scooter. The breakfast was awesome! and the room was clean and modern. I stayed in fifth floor and the swimming pool was right upper floor so I can easily access it. Also, the staff name ""Sastrawan"" helped to check quick with great kindness. When I come back to Seminyak, I'd love to stay in this hotel again.:)",U Paasha Seminyak
600,"Attentive, extremely helpful and very kind and hospitable",50,October 2019,"Every staff member we encountered were attentive to our needs and extremely kind.
We are forever grateful to the staff of U Paasha! My friend forgot her phone in the lobby of the hotel and when I rang it a staff member picked up and delivered it all the way to the airport! We are so thankful!
The rooms and facilities and big and well maintained!
The rooftop pool bar is the icing on the cake with amazing views all day and night!",U Paasha Seminyak
601,Great hotel,50,October 2019,"Great hotel, in the perfect location for exploring both Seminyak centre and the beach. Huge bed in a large room with views out to see. Friendly and professional staff and a fantastic pool area, all for a very reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
602,Fantastic,50,October 2019,Amazing staff fantastic location and very clean and well priced would highly recommend. This was our second time staying here and will definitely be returning I have stayed a few different places in Bali but this hands down is the best so far!,U Paasha Seminyak
603,Upaasha the Gem in the heart of seminyak,50,October 2019,"An absolute amazing hotel with the best breaki in seminyak. Beautiful huge clean rooms, amazing staff that will go beyond expectations for you and a rooftop pool with the best sunsets to go with great cocktail happy hours",U Paasha Seminyak
604,Balli addict,50,October 2019,Upasha is in a great location. Staff are friendly and very attentive.the room size is amazing we stayed in two hotels in Seminyak and Upasha was triple the size the other hotel was more modern being less then one year old but we will be going back to Upasha,U Paasha Seminyak
605,Great hotel in a great location!,50,October 2019,"Really lovely hotel. Bigger than we expected but this wasn’t an issue at all. Especially as it meant it had an excellent breakfast spread! The bed was extremely comfortable (one of the comfiest we’ve ever stayed in!!) and the room was lovely and spacious. The rooftop pool was great - especially during the 5-7 happy hour when the sun was setting. The location is ideal (on the main strip). It was close enough to the beach and lots of great restaurants but not noisy at all. Would definitely recommend.

We stayed 4 nights but could have easily stayed for a week or longer!

If we did it again we probably wouldn’t choose the BBQ they offer but we’ll definitely return if we’re back in Seminyak in the future!",U Paasha Seminyak
606,Our happy place!,50,October 2019,"After many visits over the years, and various stays in other hotels in Seminyak (usually when Upaasha is booked out), we are always happy to be back. The sheer size of the rooms, comfort of the beds and awesome rooftop pool is the main reason, with the anywhere, anytime brekkie and 24 hour room (check in the same time you check out) a huge added bonus.

Bang in the middle of Eat Street, with easy access to all the bars/restaurants, this has been our go-to hotel for 6 years and will continue to be for many more to come!",U Paasha Seminyak
607,"Great hotel, nice and clean rooms",50,October 2019,"Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel because of the luxurious and spacious room that I stayed in. The bed, in particular, was extremely comfortable. I also enjoyed the morning breakfasts in the hotel, which was tasty and had a good variety available. Would definitely recommend to others to stay here in future - only problem would be you'd be so tempted to stay in the hotel, you might not want to go out and enjoy Bali!",U Paasha Seminyak
608,Amazing hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,October 2019,"We absolutely loved our stay at U Paasha. The entire experience from beginning to end was seamless and thoroughly enjoyable. Highlights include:

AIRPORT COLLECTION - our friendly driver was ready and waiting at the airport with cold towels, water and a wifi enabled van

HOTEL - the hotel is in a prime location and although it is positioned on the main street, it's nice and quiet - we couldn't hear any street noise. It's very modern, the rooms are MASSIVE, the staff are extremely friendly and are more than happy to help with any ad-hoc requests or share local knowledge.

POOL - Fab rooftop pool! Huge, with views to the ocean. The free welcome drink was also a nice surprise

BREAKFAST - Great variety inc. hot/cold dishes and western/local dishes. They change the menu daily too. As a vegetarian, I certainly didn't struggle

24 CHECK OUT - This is amazing! They let you check out at the same time you arrive, meaning no long waits at the airport or by the pool.

We would definitaley stay here again.

Thank you U Paasha for such a great experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
609,"Great location, excellent service, incredibly spacious, but .......",40,October 2019,"We were recommended this hotel by more son and daughter in law. As a couple in our sixties, we were looking forward to a little more luxury in Seminyak than our previous six visits to Bali.

First the good points - and there were many.

The location was great - directly opposite one of our favourite restaurants, Cafe Bali. The check in experience was great with a choice of our own soaps and a room ready in minutes even though we were checking in early.

We were blown away with the wide expanses of the hallway and the incredibly large size of the rooms. It sure made it easy to get around.

The bed and pillows were great and the airconditioning was excellent.

Service was of the highest standard. Anything we requested was granted and delivered with a smile. In particular, thanks to Johannes for being so efficient.

The rooftop pool and bar with a great view was great.

The breakfasts were of a very high standard with plenty of variety.

Now for the few negatives -

Room design was could be classed as funky but unfortunately not very practical. In particular the lack of power points, incredibly low lounge and coffee table, shower that failed to drain quickly enough and flowed out past the shower door and toilet that was larger than most bathrooms but could not be sealed separately from the rest of the hotel room.

hand towels and face washers were not provided in the room but on request were quickly provided so this was not a major problem.

All in all though, a great stay and thanks to the excellent staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
610,Great Rooftop Bar,50,March 2019,We were not stay here but visiting their rooftop pool. One of the best rooftop bar in Bali. Great food & ambience. Totally recommend! We might be try to stay there in the future. The concept looks cool.,U Paasha Seminyak
611,Great hotel in central location,50,October 2019,"Hotel was great, rooms are massive and beds comfortable. Surprisingly quiet in the rooms considering the location on the Main Street. Staff are so friendly with Giddy being the happiest person I met and making everyone laugh around the pool whilst providing great service.

Only downsides are coffee service at breakfast is sooo slow and pool can get quite busy so if you don’t time it right no loungers, still people come and go so that only lasts about an hour then loungers become available.",U Paasha Seminyak
612,"Friendly service, big rooms and great location",40,October 2019,"This was our fourth year staying at UPaasha. As usual, the staff were super friendly, rooms big and always clean and breakfast very yummy (one of the best!)
Only downside was one working treadmill in the gym, hopefully the other will be upgraded by next year.",U Paasha Seminyak
613,Holiday with family & friends - August 2019,40,August 2019,"Had a great stay yet again. We've stayed at Upaasha numerous times & have also recommended this property to our family & friends & thankfully never disappoints. Location is perfect & staff are super polite, so friendly & always helpful.The new manager Brendan is lovely & staff by the pool Rika & Gedde we now consider friends. I.definietly recommend this property & love the rooftop pool.The sunsets up at the roof top are incredible. Great place for couples, families & singles. TL",U Paasha Seminyak
614,Close to shops and restaurants in Seminyak,40,October 2019,"This hotel is very convenient if you want to be close to shops and restaurants. The room was spacious, well equipped and you are given a free bottle of water everyday. Breakfast is full buffet and included in your stay, which was excellent! There was a vast array of food available! The staff were really helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, we were placed in a smoker's room (neither of us smoke) and this meant we were on the ground level - right near the open foyer and street. This resulted in a lot of noise and disturbances every night, as guests had to walk past our rooms to get the elevators.

After 3 nights with little sleep, we asked if there would be another room available to change, as we had another couple of nights and were really tired from a lack of sleep. We were contacted late that evening (when already in bed) that a room had become available - it was great the hotel was accommodating, but as it was late, we didn't want to get out of bed, pack up all our gear and move. It was kind of the staff to try to accommodate us, but the excessive noise until 3-4am every morning did put a dampener on our stay. Advice to all - ASK for at least level 2 and down the back of the hotel, away from the road!

Also, the toilet situation is a little interesting. The bathroom is entirely open from the bedroom. There are doors on both the shower and toilet - they are both frosted glass. However, when you close the toilet door, there is a large gap of space at the top near the ceiling - this means that everything you do in the toilet, can be heard by everyone in the room, as there is no way to completely shut off the toilet. There really is no privacy ... I was so glad that neither my best friend or I got 'Bali Belly', as it would have been extremely uncomfortable and awkward when the bathroom is open to the bedroom and everything can be heard. We both agreed that if either of us got sick, the other would leave the room, so as not to make anyone uncomfortable. I looked at the website for the hotel to see what the other rooms looked like, and it appears all the rooms are laid out the same ... so be conscious of this when you book.

This is a decent place to stay though if you want to do Bali on a budget. It's quite a walk to the beach, but only 5 minute walk to Seminyak Square. A mini-mart (convenience store) is literally right across the road from the hotel, so we went and purchased water for each day and then placed it in our bar fridge in the hotel room.",U Paasha Seminyak
615,Lovely hotel in middle of Seminak,50,October 2019,"Had 3 days at U Paasha with friends recently. Lovely stay, location great, in middle of Seminak. Rooms are a generous size. Staff very friendly & attentive. Breakfasts substantial.
Would definitely recommend this hotel
Very nice pool area on rooftop. Great place for sundowners, views look out to ocean.",U Paasha Seminyak
616,Couple Holiday,50,September 2019,"Our stay in the hotel was fantastic. The room was spacious and very clean, the breakfast was very good and the pool was quiet and relaxing. I’d also recommend the BBQ buffet as it’s good value for money with amazing variety and choice",U Paasha Seminyak
617,Great Location. 24 hours check out at no extra cost,40,August 2019,"Booked through booking.com

Location is amazing and close to everything in Seminyak
Toilets were a bit smelly when I was there but the staff said the issue has since been resolved

The way checkout works is whatever time you check in you can check out at the same time. Worked well for me because I didn't check in till 11:30pm meaning I could check out at that time

Breakfast included was good only thing not much variety
Gym facilities need some work
Pool was amazing",U Paasha Seminyak
618,"Beautiful hotel, great location, friendly staff",50,October 2019,"We stayed here for 6 nights and were very happy. The staff were friendly and helpful.

622,U Paasha Hotel Experience,50,October 2019,"Extremely friendly, clean and intimate hotel. They make a point of knowing your name and talking to you. Whatever you ask as a guest is accommodated for. Fantastic breakfast buffet. Pool area is relaxing and a gorgeous setting coupled with excellent pool side bar service for food and drinks. Rooms are very generous in sizing and the bed and pillows make for a comfortable and restful sleep. No hesitations in staying. Right in the heart of Seminyak. See you again next year!",U Paasha Seminyak
623,Relaxing,50,September 2019,"Great location. Very spacious rooms, great breakfast selection with made to order pancakes, waffles, eggs and drinks and great cocktails during happy hour. More shade is needed around pool area though and pool need a good clean.",U Paasha Seminyak
624,Another great stay,50,October 2019,"Have just finished another great 6 nights at the U Paasha in Seminyak. Hotel has such a good location, rooms are big, service is excellent. The breakfast would be one of the best we have ever had. All staff are so welcoming and happy to assist with everything.

Some small tips for improvement. The sport commentary was on during the BBQ dinner on the rooftop with no one watching the game. Really killed any atmosphere for anyone dining.
Also suggest putting an egg item on the buffet that isn’t cooked to order.",U Paasha Seminyak
625,Holiday,50,October 2019,"Great place, central and excellent service. Room we stayed in was really quiet. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Definitely stay here again. Traffic is out of control but UPassha is a good central place",U Paasha Seminyak
626,Amazing Stay,50,September 2019,"We stayed for three nights at U Paasha & couldn't fault this hotel. The rooms are huge an beautifully decorated. The beds are so comfortable & pillow selection perfect. The buffet breakfast was the best we had while in Bali. We spent most afternoons at The Roof Top Pool which had views to the water & the pool area & bar is as it looks in the photos on website, stunning!!! We would highly recommend staying at this hotel as the service & amenities are five star & we will only book at U Paasha while in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
627,Just perfect,50,September 2019,"So we booked this hotel as our final destination in Bali and boy were we impressed.

From the moment we checked in with Detha I knew we had picked the perfect hotel. Detha was so attentive throughout our stay until the moment we checked out 6 days later, he couldn’t do enough for us and was a credit to the hotel as was Prima Dana up by the pool area. Both gentlemen deserve a pat on the back as they really did go above and beyond to make our stay a pleasant one. Prima sings he dances and he definitely puts a smile on your face.

All staff were polite and friendly which is nice to see as manners cost nothing.

The hotel is spacious as are the rooms. The food was very good especially the breakfast selection where I did over indulge but that is because it was too good.

The pool on the top floor meant it was peaceful to sunbathe and relax away from the busy streets of Seminyak.

There is also an underground car par if you decide to hire a bike (great peace of mind). I would suggest a bike as it’s a great way to get about.

A perfect hotel in a perfect location from all amenities including the airport.",U Paasha Seminyak
628,The best hotel in Seminyak!,50,September 2019,"Having stayed at U Paasha previously, there is no way any pool, the service and amenity anywhere else could meet this standard. Its an extremely well located Hotel. Amongst everything you need in Seminyak - the best of Bali is at your front door.",U Paasha Seminyak
629,Pick this hotel for a family reunion,50,September 2019,"Our overall experience at U Paasha hotel was most pleasant. Although it is located in a very busy street, our room was soo quiet and also in the roof top pool and restaurant we didn’t hear any outside noise. The pool is soo beautiful we felt we were in a small resort.",U Paasha Seminyak
630,The Staff are a credit to this hotel.,50,September 2019,"We Stayed in room 505 which was bright airy, & like the entire hotel immaculately clean. Pool area is nice, & the food served there is very good. Breakfast is superb with plenty of choice. The thing that impressed us the most was the wonderful staff they are the best We have ever had on any of our many travels. Nothing is too much trouble, & you are always served with a smile. Definitely recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
631,Great hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,September 2019,"This is a great hotel, right in the heart of eat street Seminyak. The rooms are large and very quiet, the roof top pool gets full sun all day. The staff were always friendly, smiling and wanting to make your stay a good experience. Stand out staff who went the extra mile for us were Novi at breakfast, Rika around the pool and Mulya. The GM Brendan, has a very hands on approach, always walking around speaking to guests and also happy to get you a coffee at breakfast or organise a drink for you by the pool.
Would definitively come back next time we are in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
632,Poor house keeping,20,September 2019,"Great location and breakfast and size of room.

Poor house keeping pillows had not pillow protectors and fully stained with yellow brown stains.
Mattress protector with a blood stain and yellow marks
I called room Servise and they did come and changed the pillows but seems that they take not care as my friends in a different room had same problem.

I would definitely stay again if the house keeping lift their game and ensure the pillows have appropriate pillow protector with not stains and under sheets are all clean and hygienic .

Stayed in room 123 and 307 (same problem)

Thank u",U Paasha Seminyak
633,Best Rooftop Pool at U Paasher,50,August 2019,"Excellent location in Seminkak, great amenities. Best Rooftop pool. I swam most days in the rooftop pool which was significantly long and wide enough for me to get a good aerobic workout. U Paasher staff were great. Attentive but unobtrusive. Had a great time.",U Paasha Seminyak
634,Great location and service,40,September 2019,We started our trip at UPasha and we are so glad we did close to lots of great restaurants and a short walk to the beach. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great. Good value for money,U Paasha Seminyak
635,Great Location - Best Breakfast,50,September 2019,"The was our second visit to U Paasha and we were not at all disappointed, even with our very high expectations. Best breakfast you'd get anywhere in the world and was included in our Room rate. Love the Rooftop Bar and particularly like the 2 for 1 Happy Hour from 5pm to 7pm each day. We also enjoyed the BBQ on the Rooftop and was good value. Rooms are excellent and the location is just so easy if you want to be in the middle of all the activity. We will definitely be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
636,Outstanding.,50,September 2019,"The airport collection as professional, friendly and clean. The moist towels and water in the car were most welcome.

The 24h check in/out is game changing. Hope that we can find this on the rest of the trip.

The sunsets by pool were unreal!",U Paasha Seminyak
637,Amazing,50,September 2019,"One word and that is amazing.

We came early in the morning from Canggu, and our room was not ready yet, so they gave us a temporarily room.

The staff are so sweet. They remember your name, are so helpful and always gives a smile.

The breakfast buffet was amazing, the rooms was amazing and the roof top was even more amazing. There are both single sunbeds, double sunbeds. And the best part is that U Paasha is right in the middle of Seminyak on a streets with lots of shopping, bars and restaurants.

We will come back - hopefully next year. U Paasha will be our Bali hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
638,Best boutique hotel in Seminyak,50,September 2019,"My 2nd time staying in U Paasha with my husband. It's always delightful to stay here becos the rooms are modern & clean, service and the staff are phenomenal, breakfast is the best I have had in Bali, great location and wonderful rooftop pool. Complimentary yoga as well on most nights and happy hour on offer. Highly recommended if you want a comfortable stay right in the middle of Seminyak. The only thing they can improve on is having better amenities, I.e. conditioner and better body lotion.",U Paasha Seminyak
639,Superb visit,50,September 2019,"U Paasha is a top hotel in a very convenient location. All staff are very helpful and try their best to ensure your stay is looked after. I greatly appreciated the way all team members followed up any issues. We had a minor issue with our kettle and all staff were quick to provide feedback after testing and replacement. All restaurants are great. We ordered food on the rooftop, via room service and had breakfast daily and we were impressed with both quality and variety. As for location- it's not right on the beach but is around a 10 minute walk from the best beaches and beach clubs in the area. It's on a busy street, but once in the hotel you feel like you're miles away form the hustle and bustle.

Great boutique hotel. Keep up the great work guys!",U Paasha Seminyak
640,Great spot,50,September 2019,Great spot right in eats st all restaurants and bars in walking distance nice and quiet when inside the hotel and around the pool have good barbaque nights in rooftop bar very good value if you want all the nightlife of Seminyak really good spot to stay in,U Paasha Seminyak
641,Late check in,20,September 2019,After 24 hrs of traveling we were so exhausted and really needed our room. We arrived at 4pm and picked this hotel for the 24hr stay thinking we could sleep in but on arrival they said our room wouldn’t be ready until 5 and there were a bunch on people waiting saying they had been waiting well over an hr. They eventually gave us a room that wasn’t cleaned and had no sheets or towels. Arranging transport was way more difficult then it should be. Though the rooftop pool and breakfast was amazing. So if you don’t mind a really late check in it might be a good choice.,U Paasha Seminyak
642,Great Hotel for Midnight travelers,40,September 2019,"I booked this hotel out of curiosity because I always pass by it every time I came to Seminyak for brunch or dinner, since it surrounded by a lot of delicious restaurants and interesting shops makes this place such a high demand for those who just want to do cafe hopping or do some shoppings. What surprises me was the 24 hours check in and check out facility where the time we check in is the same as our check out time, which was awesome if we have a late flight. Their basic room is spacious, clean and has a good taste of interior design. Overall, this hotel is super recommended for those who doesn’t need a car when they travel because the only bad thing was it located at Jalan Kayu Aya where traffic wasn’t so friendly.",U Paasha Seminyak
643,Second time visiting!,40,September 2019,"This was our second visit to U Paasha, and we were not disappointed. Lovely stay, staff are so friendly and welcoming, pool is lovely, drinks are reasonably priced. The make your own salad by the pool is divine! This hotel is right on the main street but as soon as you get in it feels very quiet and secluded. Rooms are huge and well equipped - my only comment would be that we only had two towels, so more towels would be nice. Toiletries are nice too. Would come back!",U Paasha Seminyak
644,Excellent experience,50,September 2019,The staff were incredible. I could not fault them. We’re willing to help always and made my boyfriend feel like a valued customer. I would definitely recommend and will be back! Thank you to the staff for making my holiday so enjoyable.,U Paasha Seminyak
645,Gorgeous modern hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,September 2019,"My daughter and I spent a glorious week at U Paasha Seminyak this month.
The staff is extremely friendly, polite and helpful. The hotel is very modern and beautifully kept. The room is very large and full of natural light equipped with everything you might need during our stay. The GM Brendan makes every guest feel welcome by greeting us every morning at breakfast and he’s always available to his guests. The breakfast is also great with many healthy choices and beautifully presented. You also have the option to have your breakfast anytime you like in the comfort of your room at anytime of the day at no extra charge. The roof top pool is very spacious equipped with numerous sunlounges and umbrellas and there is staff always around to look after you. The gym is well equipped with quality machines and very well kept. The hotel is suited in the heart of Seminyak surrounded by restaurants and great shops. Perfect location!
We had a wonderful time and we look forward to our return.",U Paasha Seminyak
646,"Exceptional staff, unique service policies, help make this a memorable place to stay!",50,September 2019,"The helpful and happy service team at U Paasha are the key to our having enjoyed a 7 night stay. They are supported by an accessible and very visible General Manager, Brendon. The unique services include ""24 hour check in-check out"" and a ""anywhere-any time"" Breakfast.
The 24 hour deal is great! Check-in at 6pm (as we did) and we can stay until 6pm on our final day without a late checkout surcharge. Really helpful!
The amazing breakfast buffet is available until 11am, but at any time this hotel can arrange to deliver the guest's choice of Breakfast to their room, the Pool, or wherever.
The buffet offers a great range of food and features daily ""specials"" so it there is always something new to try. Espresso coffee available as well as good tea.
Some other nice features are: very large rooms with rainfall shower or standard head option, `nice thick towels, ""endless"" free bottled water, Coffee maker with filter coffee in room, and a pleasant view from a room that was advertised as ""no view"".
The rooftop pool is a good place to relax, with lots of sun loungers and umbrellas. It never gets shaded by other buildings, and usually has a cooling breeze.
The adjacent Fitness Centre is equipped with good quality workout gear and has a padded floor.
We will be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
647,Excellent service and friendly staff,40,September 2019,"The room is very spacious and clean, and the rooftop pool is awesome! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful - I specifically requested something special for my fiancee for his birthday and they pulled through. The buffet breakfast is also really good.",U Paasha Seminyak
648,Perfect Seminyak Location,50,September 2019,"Seminyak and it’s busy traffic was a bit of a shock to us after leaving Gili T, however U Paasha provides the perfect retreat from the busy street.
Rooms are big and spacious, comfortable bed & large bathroom area. Breakfast is good, catered very well for Gluten Free.
Rooftop pool is a little oasis on the days you are not going out - perfect spot to sunbathe with good drinks & lunch service to the sunbed.
Location is excellent, right next to lots of popular restaurants & bars - walking distance to beach at Kudeta and close enough for taxis to Potato Head & Finns.
We used the airport transfer service when leaving the hotel and this was also good value.
Thank you for a great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
649,Beautiful hotel but make sure you use your own credit card,30,September 2019,"My husband and baby and I recently stayed at this hotel. It’s very lovely, the breakfast is amazing and location is great for shopping or eating out. Unfortunately, my card had a stop on it because of overseas transactions so I had to transfer money to my mum to pay for our booking, however when we checked in they would not accept this, even with a signed letter from my mum so we needed to pay twice. I am still waiting for the refund one week later?
Other than that, I met the manager one day who was very helpful with the wifi and the pool area is stunning with lovely friendly staff there. Hopefully we will receive the refund soon, minus that little hiccup it was wonderful.",U Paasha Seminyak
650,Great position,50,September 2019,"We were really impressed with U Paasha. Its location was fantastic with all the best shops, bars, restaurants and a short walk to the beach.

They had a great gym and free yoga classes. The rooms were large and very clean. Great stay.",U Paasha Seminyak

They ask
Negatives
Even though I had especially asked for an early check in. The room wasn’t ready and we had a two and half hour wait.
Room wasn’t cleaned after the first night and I had to request for the room to be made up at 3:00pm.
Oberoi street is a busy street
A large sometimes impersonal hotel
Room had no view
Lots of smokers in the lobby",U Paasha Seminyak
652,Great Hotel,40,September 2019,"Great hotel and staff were excellent, food was great w/ 24hr breakfast.
A/C overheated one day and we were put in another room, unfortunately it wasn't as nice our room.
Rooftop views were great, plenty of nearby places for food and drink as well.",U Paasha Seminyak
653,FANTASTIC LOCATION-STUNNING ROOF TOP POOL-GREAT STAFF,50,September 2019,"This hotel is in a very convenient location in the centre of Seminyak surrounded by great cafes & shops and 15 minute walk to beach. Once inside, this hotel offers a lovely sanctuary, from the incredibly spacious rooms & hallways to the stunning roof top pool & bar. The breakfast buffet offered a sumptuous selection for all palates & the roof top bar offered delicious pool side food and some evenings barbecue nights which we enjoyed. The staff are very helpful & attentive but I must mention 2 in particular (forgive me if their names are spelled incorrectly), Guda an effervescent team member who always had a smile on his face, he was a pleasure to deal with also Rika a lovely young lady who after meeting us for 2 minutes remembered all our names every time we saw her & always helpful. We were also impressed by the General Manager, Brendan who even though running a very busy hotel, found the time to pass by & converse with guests during breakfast. Kudos to this gentleman who is obviously a brilliant leader of his staff. We do a lot of travelling and this is the first time we can remember where a General Manager actually took the time to briefly speak to their guests rather than a nod of the head in a hallway.
We highly recommend U Paasha and will be back!!",U Paasha Seminyak
654,Brilliant Hotel with great rooms.,50,September 2019,"The staff are excellent at this Hotel, took a serious interest in our stay and were easy to engage with.

Also impressed with the General Manager who was often seen around the Hotel talking to guests and setting a good example to his team.",U Paasha Seminyak
655,Very Impressed,50,September 2019,Perfect location and the staff made you feel at home. The breakfast bar is such a nice way to start your day in paradise and the view from the roof top pool is stunning. I would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to come back.,U Paasha Seminyak
656,Conveniently located but noisy!,30,September 2019,I stayed here for 1 night after staying for the last 3 nights in a resort in Legian. The hotel is located right in the middle of the action but we had a room facing the busy street and it was predictably noisy late into the night and again in the morning. I had no problem sleeping after a few drinks but I wouldn't choose this hotel if I wanted a good sleep!,U Paasha Seminyak
657,"Wonderful, warm hotel experience",50,September 2019,"We stayed here after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed, it lived up to every expectation we had. The staff are amazing, they have no problem going the extra mile for what ever need such as arranging motorbike hire or urgent laundry! The breakfast buffet is outstanding with so many options, be sure to try the Indonesian dishes.

The room we were in was everything we expected. It was spacious with a large bathroom and a nice garden. The room was dark at night, no outside light creeping in and the bed was very comfortable resulting in a great, restful sleep.

It was my wife’s birthday and the staff arranged some great little surprises for her at no extra charge to us.

Give this place a go, you won’t be disappointed.",U Paasha Seminyak
658,We will come back again and again!,50,June 2019,"Return guests - a wonderful stay once again!
This was our second stay at the U Paasha and once again we had the most wonderful stay. The rooms are so spacious and luxurious, the staff are friendly and accommodating and the roof top pool is the perfect place to relax and unwind. Best of all is the location - walking distance to the beach and all of the best restaurants and cafes in Seminyak. We look forward to staying again next time we are in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
659,Average hotel,30,September 2019,"Good customer service and check in. However the following does not live up to expectations:

1) Airconditioning not cool.
2) weak rain shower, worn towels
3) electrical wall sockets built at inaccessible areas close to the ground. Difficult for us to charge our gadgets and phones.

Booked this hotel thinking it would be convenient for us to get around on foot. But we took go-jek all the time because the roads are not pedestrian friendly. We were stuck in traffic jam every time.
I would recommend hotels in other locations, unless you like clubbing at La Favela which is a short distance away on foot.",U Paasha Seminyak
660,Derrick,40,September 2019,We booked on recommend from mates. The hotel is located right in the middle of the funky part of Seminyak with quality restaurants close by and short distance to Seminyak square and flea markets. The room was a suite and was very spacious for price. Clean and modern with balcony. Air con was a little loud. But loud air con is better than none. The rooftop bar has views to the ocean and a pool breakfast was good I would stay there again for sure.,U Paasha Seminyak
661,Brilliant hotel experience,50,September 2019,"Our second stay here: staff are so friendly, pool/bar/restaurant excellent and reasonably priced with amazing sunset view, great location for the town, late check out for free, what more can you ask for?

We didn’t take a taxi at all in the six days we were there. We walked to all the amazing Seminyak restaurants and to the beach. And the roof top pool is also great. We loved it and I’m already looking to make another booking! Thank you!",U Paasha Seminyak
663,Great Location!,40,August 2019,"Rooms are spacious. But would be even better if there was a private dry changing area in the room. Otherwise, the service is good, staff are polite and quick to respond, and the location is excellent!",U Paasha Seminyak
664,U Paasha - Seminyak,50,September 2019,"A central location with spacious rooms and lovely staff. The greatest offering is their check-in and check-out policy, giving you a 24 hour stay from the time you check-in. As a parent travelling with a child and Bali's night time flights to Australia it was incredible to be able to check out in the late afternoon and head to the airport fresh.",U Paasha Seminyak
665,Amazing hotel!,50,September 2019,"I can't recommend this hotel enough!

The staff are incredible - always going out of their way and nothing was ever too much trouble to them. They did everything with a smile on their face and just made our stay that much more enjoyable.

The breakfast is amazing, it was great to have a good cup of coffee or two as well as made to order eggs, pancakes and waffles!

The location couldn't be better, only a short walk to the beach and right in the heart of some great restaurants and shops.

The rooms are enormous and the pool area is great, specially during happy hour to watch the sunset.

The manager Brendan genuinely cares about this hotel and takes the time to say hello to hotel guests and make sure they have the best stay possible.

If you are looking for a great place to stay while you are in Bali I highly recommend U Paasha, I will definitely be back again",U Paasha Seminyak

The location is great, right in the heart of seminyak. Some noisy guests were staying next to us which was a shame but the staff tried to deal with this as best as possible.

Our room was on the ground floor close to reception (street side) and we had no issues with noise. Loved the roof-top swimming pool and bar. We chose U Paasha, as it has a 24-hr room policy. We arrived in Bali around 11pm (late flight) and didn't have to leave until 11pm the following night - such a brilliant idea. Would definitely recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak

683,Great Value for Money,50,August 2019,"Great Hotel for the price and great location, rooms are big, clean and well maintained (many Bali Hotels can fall into disrepair very quickly). The only negative I would have would be my room location, I was woken every morning at 6am by constant loans thumping and it took me 4 days to realize that my room was located directly below the gym. The thumping was dumbbells being dropped constantly from when the gym opened at 6am. Apart from this, I will definitely stay again just not in room 524 or 522",U Paasha Seminyak

685,Absolutely Amazing,50,August 2019,"My partner and I stayed at U Paasha last week. The staff and Management were extremely helpful, even helped organise a proposal on the grassed rooftop area. They went a step above the rest to assure this was a brilliant experience.
Not to mention the check in / out situation in which if you check in at 10pm you get to check out at 10pm getting the maximum value of your room and your money.
Don’t worry if your not an early riser because if you miss breakfast you can order off the breakfast menu either in your room or by the pool at no extra cost.
Excellent location in the heart of Seminyak only a few minutes walk to Seminyak Square.
Rooms are fantastic and very spacious.

You won't find a better 'all-round' great deal than this hotel right on Eat St, Seminyak. Great Location, room size, pool with plenty of day beds, good breakfast menu, some nice extra touches and excellent customer service. The staff are warm, accommodating and not 'in your face'. I think it's bang on for the price point and would highly recommend as a great hotel to springbord from to surrounding areas on day trips etc. Plenty outside your door to keep you entertained and the restaurant, shopping options in the area are excellent. Has a cool, laid back feel. Happy holidays all.",U Paasha Seminyak

The location is excellent, breakfast was really tasty with lots of choice and the pool area was so relaxing!",U Paasha Seminyak
690,Fantastic stay,50,August 2019,"Have just returned after a week at the U Paasha I agree with everything that other reviewers have written . The first thing that you notice about the hotel when you arrive is the Aero bar at the front an air steam caravan converted to a bar and the height of the roof of the foyer . The architectural style of this place is all about texture and has a very industrial feel with an Asian twist . The staff are wonderfully helpfully and friendly and I seriously think they enjoy working there .
The room we had was large with king size bed with a day bed and small lounge with a coffee table was very comfortable, the wardrobe was very large with heaps of hanging space .
The bathroom was large with 2 sinks and a huge shower .
Breakfast was fantastic with a great choice of food as a buffet but they also have a special cooked breakfast which changes daily as well as eggs cooked how you want . I really enjoyed the Bircher muesli with yogurt and fresh fruit it’s one of the nicest I’ve had. Coffee to order which was also good.
The pool area was lovely we had no problem every afternoon getting a bed , fresh towels were always available and plenty of smiles from the staff . There was a bit of a breeze up there so it was a lovely relief from the street where there was none , it also has a view of the water and a great place to see the sunset . We ate a few time at lunch at the pool which I’ve must say the fish burger was amazing.
We ate at the bbq buffet one night , it was really good and worth the price beef chicken fish seafood including lobster as well as ribs cooked fresh with so many side dishes you could also get Mie Goreng cooked with your choice of type of noodle plus ingredients it was so good .
The location is fabulous right on eat street with so much choice for food and bars , an easy short walk to the beach and shopping square .
This is not a place for families but there were a few toddlers with their parents, I would probably not recommend this hotel if you have problems with stairs it would be difficult to get to the pool but everywhere else has lift accessibility.
Overall our stay was wonderful thanks to everyone at the U Paasha for making our time in Seminyak wonderful.",U Paasha Seminyak

697,Another great stay at U Paasha and an extraordinary experience of professionalism,50,August 2019,"I have written about this hotel before. It's one of my favourite places to stay in Bali. Location, value for money plus a team that has delivered a great experience over many years! Need I say more?!

However this time I would like to put an example for the outstanding team spirit! During my stay (through no fault of the hotel) I fell seriously ill. On my check out date I was unable to travel. The hotel was fully booked for that night, what to do? Meet Chandra Sekar Pratiwi from the rooms division! She turned into my life saver. She shifted check ins and check outs and God knows what else, so that I didn't need to be moved (couldn't move at all at that time) and succeeded. Not only that, she reserved my room for a few days more just in case at no up front charge. Next to her the whole team stepped up to assist me whereever they could! I know some may say that's normal, however I think it's extraordinary in these times!

Thank you all for the magic! Needless to say I shall return and not in the distant future either!

So if you are looking for a smart choice on Bali, with a great team to look after you, look no further!

Thank you U Paasha",U Paasha Seminyak

Great location in the heart of bustling Seminyak with all the bars & resturants on our doorstep.

The breakfast buffet was pretty impressive with lots of varieties on offer, average service which is pretty much the case in general in Bali, however no complaints at all.

Great rooftop pool with bar and restaurant, offering sunbed service so you can laze around in the sun.

Gym facilities are ok too.

It's in a great location with generous size rooms and beds, plus a lovely breakfast to wake-up too every morning. The issue that we have with the hotel is that management isn't maintaining it. For example the gym had the same 3 pieces of exercise equipment out of order as they did 12 months ago when we stayed there... No one has fixed them plus the gym itself could do with a good deep clean. The titles in the lobby are still smashed and broken from 12 months ago. The tiles in the bathrooms are starting to fall off the walls and there is visible water damage on the roof in the room that we stayed in. We would love to stay there again next year, but that's in question because there are newer and better maintained hotels in Seminyak for the same amount of money...",U Paasha Seminyak

719,Heaven in the sky,50,July 2019,"Well what a surprise this hotel was from the very start...I have walked past this hotel over several years and always liked the look of the reception and was given a thumbs up by friends recently to stay here. It did not disappoint even when we had the earthquake tremors for breakfast on July 16th the place ran smoothly and efficiently. The GM Brendan was fantastic and so was Chandra when we booked in. The breakfast buffet was great, the rooms were extremely large as was the shower. We loved the rooftop pool which we visited every day. A great location and very quiet rooms. All in all I would stay here again and am hoping to in November this year and next February 2020. Thank you to all the staff. You made four ladies very welcome.",U Paasha Seminyak

723,Convenient location and gorgeous rooftop pool!,50,August 2019,"Have stayed at UPaasha multiple times, as they have a delicious breakfast, lovely staff and beautiful rooftop pool in the heart of Seminyak. They have a check-in anytime and check-out at the same time service, which is great. Also, if you miss breakfast, you can have it served in your room at any time of the day. Great for families, couples, or friends.",U Paasha Seminyak
724,First stop in Bali trip.,40,July 2019,This was a great location in the heart of Seminyak. It was close to everything you needed. Only a 10 minute walk to the beach. The buffet breakfast was one of the best we had in Bali. The rooftop pool was perfect with views to the ocean and surrounds. The rooms were clean and spacious. Would recommend it to our friends.,U Paasha Seminyak
725,"Quiet, comfortable room and friendly service in the middle of everything",50,July 2019,"Even though the hotel's in the middle of a pretty busy shopping and nightlife (restaurants and bars) area, my room was very quiet.

The room was not 5 star luxurious, but very big and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were high quality and conducive to a great sleep. The shower was massive!

The staff welcomed you and were very friendly and professional. A particular thanks to Chandra, the rooms division manager, who helped me with a money exchange issue - be sure to count your cash at the money exchange! She was extremely professional and helpful and genuinely cared about her guests' welfare. Thank you Chandra.

The breakfast buffet staff were very friendly and professional and it’s nice that it’s open until 11am. The waitresses worked very hard and did a fantastic job, but the hotel should have an extra one or two.

The breakfast buffet was good, but I prefer more nutritious muesli to the very basic cereal on offer. On the positive side, good coffee and delicious papaya.

I enjoyed the rooftop buffet. The selection was limited, but good value for money and a beautiful location. The bbq seafood was pretty tasty. They should lower the very bright lights on the tables by the edge. Not exactly romantic!
was looking forward to the nice looking pudding but it finished at 8.30pm - one of the stuff rather brusquely stated no more coming. Ice cream in such a warm climate would also have been nice.

Overall a really good value for money hotel in a very central location and great staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
726,"Great rooftop pool, location and service",50,July 2019,"What a lovely place to stay. Great location, rooftop pool, breakfast and just great in general.

729,Seminyak with a little bit of Palm Springs,50,July 2019,We booked this hotel based on pure location alone as husband had never stayed in Seminyak before just day tripped. Was amazed at location but also loved the decor of our room. A mid century vibe and concrete. We were located 5th floor and couldn’t hear much street noise. Not type of hotel for kids and many guests did not have them. Pool amazing but windy at times and busy. Buffet great.,U Paasha Seminyak

The hotel is modern, clean and located in the heart of Seminyak ensuring an easy walk to the best restaurants, shops and beach clubs. The service was exceptional and all of the staff were warm and welcoming, including the manager who made efforts to come down to the breakfast buffet and interact with the guests. The room was spacious and comfortable and had everything that we needed. Highlights included a cool towel and welcome drink on arrival, a choice of soap/ shampoo and body wash and the opportunity to have breakfast at any time (if you sleep in and miss the brekky buffet). There is a rooftop pool and bar overlooking Seminyak or you can sit in the courtyard out the front of the hotel and enjoy a cocktail. Although it was a quick stay, I would recommend this hotel for its price and location.",U Paasha Seminyak
738,Sensational,50,July 2019,"Friendly, helpful staff from the general manger Brendan, floor staff to the maintenance crew. We loved the breakfast buffet every morning, top quality food and wide variety. Our family are coffee snobs and couldn't fault the excellent barista coffee. The 24 hr check out policy is a brilliant idea. Our second room wasn't ready until 7:30pm on the day we arrive so we checked in to one room which was ready. On the day we were leaving we didn't have to check out of the second room until 7:30pm. Worked out perfectly for our flight time. Very sad to check out of the hotel we were very spoilt here. 10/10",U Paasha Seminyak

742,Best staff and best nasi goreng!,50,July 2019,First time I've traveled to Bali and this hotel was by far my favourite. I stayed in some beautiful places in Bali but the highlight for me was the staff and the nasi goreng breakfast with soy iced latte! It was complimentary but I would of paid good money it. You had the choice of room service as well. I wish I knew all their names but they were all super friendly and attentive that they deserve a special mention. Their smile made me smile.

Almost opposite ginger moon which is an amazing restaurant and a 4 min walk to Spring Spa which is a spa id also highly recommend. The rooms are huge with big comfy beds and great amenities. The buffet breakfast was awesome with more than ample amount of food! The service was great and all staff members were so friendly. We also had laundry/dry cleaning done (for about AUD $7) which came back immaculate! Highly recommend if you’re looking for something central to enjoy a bit of luxury while enjoying the shopping, spas and restaurants of seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak

Thank you to everyone who made it so amazing!",U Paasha Seminyak
757,Amazing service from beginning till end.,50,July 2019,"The first thing we saw was the open-concept design of the lobby. We were greeted by the kind front office personnel, Detha. He made us feel like home-away-from-home. Well done Detha for the wonderful welcome service you have done for us. When we got our room key, we were conveniently located just a 2 rooms ahead on the ground level, Room 103. And then came the room, fabulous! We even loved the two sinks separately placed for individuals. Toilet and shower room were spaced evenly and adequately i would say. As for the breakfast buffet, it was a game-changer, we had a plethora of goodies! As you can tell we are foodies, so no complains about food. Just as we were about to check-out, i believe she was the Manager of the Front Office, Chandra. She gave us the most ever sweetest farewell and hoped she would see us again here. Thank you once again!",U Paasha Seminyak
758,Great Rooftop bar & restaurant,50,June 2019,Don't walk past large hotels in bali - PAASHA Seminyak has a great Roof top bar and restautant- Excellent cocktails at happy hour- by one get one free and great food.

759,Amazing! Wonderful hotel and exceptional staff,50,June 2019,"My daughter and I stayed here for 10 days in June, and I""v ejust arrived home, my daughter going on to volunteer and travel in Bali. Hotel, amenities, and general relaxed and 'nothing too much trouble' vibe of the place made for a faultless holiday. All the staff are so friendly and professional but special thanks to the fabulous Gede who looked after and entertained us at the rooftop bar, and Mulya, who ensure that our Vegan needs were catered for every day, with her exacting standards and glorious smile. The staff on reception were super-helpful too with various queries that we had, and even telephoned the accommodation that my daughter was next travelling to to ensure she could check in late. We even had a visit from Brendan, the hotel manager to check we were happy, a real indicator of the personal care taken here. As well as the staff, the hotel has a really spacious, cool layout which adds to the relaxed feel. Would highly, highly recommend you stay here.",U Paasha Seminyak
760,Awesome stay at U Paasha Seminyak,50,June 2019,The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating to my needs.

763,There are better options than this hotel,30,June 2019,"I’m a female solo traveller these are my pros and cons:
Pros:
Nice clean big rooms
Location near many shops and restaurants

Cons:
Too overpriced, there are much better options nearby for that price
The hotel is not that close to the beach, you have to walk 25 minutes
The front desk staff are not very helpful, I was trying to find out how to get to Candidasa using public transfer , every time I asked the front desk they said just get a taxi and did not want to bother to help, I did the research on my own, found out and it was easy and inexpensive to take a public shuttle which I did. I travel a lot and this was the first time I repeatedly asked and the hotel staff avoid helping me.

I won’t stay here again and don’t recommend it. In Bali there so many great hotels with super friendly staff why would you want to stay here when you can easily find a much better hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
764,Over my expectation.,50,June 2019,"The hotel is just in the middle of the hustle of Jl. Kayu Aya Seminyak. Surrounded by many good restaurants, cafe and shops.
The room is big and very clean with nice ambience.
I really enjoy my Aperol Spritz at Rooftop Bar since it's very hard to find this cocktail in Bali.
One of my favorite hotel in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak

Only downside was the slight smell in our bathroom. Likely to be poor sewerage systems. We were on the ground floor.",U Paasha Seminyak
766,Great times @UPAASHA,50,May 2019,"Maurice and Melinda
It was great to arrive at Upaasha again and see old faces and some new.
There's a reason why we continue to stay at Upaasha on out trips to Bali. The service and attitude of all staff is fantastic. Brendan the new GM is never too busy to stop for a quick chat, and willing to go the distance in ensuring clients are looked after. Front desk were enthusiastic in helping with corporate requests and nothing was to much trouble.
The rooms as always were clean, well presented and oh so comfortable to stay in.
Being in the center of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak is great and when a break is necessary the top floor swimming pool and Bar are a great way to relax. wouldn't have it any other way.
Thanks!! Upaasha
M&M",U Paasha Seminyak
767,A Very Good Hotel,50,June 2019,"We stayed here for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff were very welcoming and the room was spacious and well presented.

great gym as well
definitely a winner",U Paasha Seminyak
772,Hidden Gem,50,June 2019,"Been to Bali around 15 times now, I have stayed in villas, hotels and resorts. After discovering Upaasha I refuse to stay anywhere else. Staff are so welcoming and always remember your face and name, they definitely make you feel like royalty. Hotel rooms are always immaculate and so comfortable, definitely feels like home away from home. Food at breakfast is always different and very generous and the cocktails by the rooftop pool are fantastic and super fast service.
Manager Brendan is so kind and helpful, always makes time for guests and makes them all feel welcome. I actually love this hotel I almost don't want anyone to discover it, it is definitely a gem I want all to myself. 
Got back yesterday, ill be booking my return as soon possible",U Paasha Seminyak
773,10 STARS NOT 5!!!,50,June 2019,"On arrival we were warmly greeted at the courtyard and had our bags brought up to reception.
The receptionist Cindy was very helpful, friendly and extremely polite and remained so till the end of our stay (especially helping us with a last minute taxi on our last day).
The hotel staff were fabulous, always saying hello and asking how we were. Always had time to help you with a query if asked.
The hotel location was spot on. It’s on one of the main roads to the beach, bars, restaurants and shops.
The hotel was thoroughly kept clean and tidy, the room could be restocked and cleaned everyday if needed.
Our room was huge and had a large adjoining bathroom with walk in rain shower.
The rooftop pool was lovely and clean. There was a nice breeze which in the heat was an added relief.
Staff were always around to help us if we needed a drink or food (even resetting our towels on the sunbed). A big thank you to Gede and Rika who showed us excellent customer service. Throughout our stay they were always smiling and helpful (the icing on the cake).
The rooftop bar was great for watching the sunset and overlooked Seminyak (we enjoyed a few happy hours while watching the sun go down).
Breakfast offered lots of fantastic options and we were never disappointed.
Overall, this was one of the best hotels we have stayed in throughout our travels for the lovely customer service, facilities and location.",U Paasha Seminyak

location, staff, cleanliness, rooms were all really nice
悪い点: 騒音/noise level
最上階に泊まったのですが隣接するヴィラからの騒音で寝付けなかったです。クレームを入れたら即対応してくれましたが廊下からの音もかなり響くのでハイシーズン中はナイトライフを中心に楽しむ予定がないのであれば避けたほうが無難かと思います。
We were on the top floor but still had a hard time sleeping when there was a loud party going on at the villa next door. Noise from the hallway also travels so can only imagine during the busy periods in Bali, this hotel would be great if you want to party into the night, but if you are planning an early start the next day and/or want to get good sleep, this hotel is best avoided.",U Paasha Seminyak
776,Perfect Bali Hotel,50,June 2019,"We recently had the most wonderful stay at Upaasha Hotel. I’ve been holidaying in Bali for 40 years staying at 3-5 star accommodation and Upaasha impressed me with its unique character, ultra modern design and location. The staff were genuine and friendly at every touch point. We loved the beautiful pool area, free breakfast, bikes and yoga class. It’s located in the heart of Eat St but so quiet inside. The beach is a short walk away and of course a wide variety of cafes and restaurants are on your doorstep. Thanks for enhancing our Bali holiday.",U Paasha Seminyak

785,Being in the bustle of Seminyak area,40,June 2019,"The location of the hotel is very good because it is in the middle of the Seminyak area, so it's easy to walk anywhere. Near to Seminyak square, restaurants and food are plenty around it, but access to the beach is quite far when walking.
Room size is quite large, beds are quite comfortable, large bathroom with shower and separate closet. But the jet washer in the closet is very uncomfortable to use, the spray is too strong so it is quite painful to use, this is complained by the wife and child too. In addition, the floor feels very slippery in the bathroom area, maybe you can add a rubber carpet or anything that is not too slippery.
Breakfast is quite varied, only for very little local food. It tastes pretty good, what I like best is the beef sausage. Parking is quite large in the basement, and there is a fast food Yoshinoya in the hotel basement so it's easy to eat when hungry to attack.",U Paasha Seminyak
786,10/10,50,June 2019,"Amazing customer service here, the staff are just beautiful and can’t do enough to help you. The rooms are beautiful, really clean and modern with great air conditioning. The rooms are serviced daily which was great. The pool area is stunning with incredible views of the seas and a great sunset. All the food and cocktails are great, we highly recommend staying at the U Paasha, the location is 5 star.",U Paasha Seminyak
787,Excellent,50,May 2019,"Can’t fault this hotel in any way. Right in the middle of bars and restaurants (not noisy at night though). The room was gorgeous and spacious, the bed was huge! The pool area is beautiful with plenty of beds and umbrellas. The breakfast was good with fresh coffee and eggs made to your request. We went to the Bbq at the rooftop bar and it was delicious, it’s a shame more people don’t take advantage of it. Best of all the staff were absolutely lovely and helpful. We will definitely stay here again when we return.",U Paasha Seminyak
788,Great stay in Seminyak,40,June 2019,"Stayed here 7 nights in June. I’ll start with the pro’s of this place.

Pros
- great location, so many fantastic restaurants on the same street. Also close to Seminyak mall and a 10/15 min walk to the beach.
- rooftop pool area was fantastic, beautiful views, always easy to get sunbeds, good cocktails and quick, friendly service from the staff. Happy hour from 4-7pm at the rooftop bar was great watching the Seminyak sunset.
- Room was spacious and hotel was always clean. Shower in particular was great!
- Good well equipped gym.

Cons
- aircon in our room (327) wasn’t great. Asked about it at reception and one of the maintenance guys came had a look at it. While there was improvement after he looked at it, it still didn’t feel as cool as we would have liked. Having read other reviews I suspect it must have been one of the room which hasn’t got the upgraded aircon.
- as we were facing on to the street at the front it could be a bit noisy at night, if I was going back I would definitely request a room not facing on to the Main Street and with better aircon!
(this is the only reason I haven’t said 5 star for the review)

Special mention to Rika who worked at the Areo bar downstairs. Excellent service and she was so lovely to chat to. Both myself and my husband really enjoyed chatting to her and learning more about Bali from her. The Areo Bar is definitely worth a visit to sit and have an Aperol Spritz while watching the busy Seminyak Street.

Would definitely visit again, hopefully next time get a room with better aircon and slightly quieter.",U Paasha Seminyak
789,Almost Perfect,40,June 2019,"Just returned from an enjoyable 8 night stay at UPaasha and would highly recommend staying here. The biggest drawcard for me was their check in concept. We arrived at 11pm at night on day one which meant we had up until 11pm on the day of leaving to check out. This was perfect for us as we had a 10pm flight back to Melbourne.

We stayed in a superior room on level 2 down the other end of the hotel which was nice and quite. The room was massive and the king bed was one of the best I've slept on. There was a slight smell from the bathroom on the first night which either went away or we got used too. Didnt expect a view so wasn't disappointed with the view of villa rooftops.

Breakfast was great, with a choice of eggs and hot drinks that you got to choose by filling out a piece of paper on your table instead of waiting in a line. Staff at breakfast were very accommodating and friendly.

Rooftop Pool was awesome! Always a spare sunbed and they were super comfy too, water was very refreshing and not over chlorinated. We spent time up here nearly every day of the 9 day trip.

The location was second to none. We had everything at our doorstep, from a minimart across the road to a 250m walk to Seminyak Square. Also all the insta famous eateries such as Motel Mexicola and U look hot in bikini were within walking distance too.

Areas for improvement -
- Soft close fix for the room doors. Extremely loud banging of doors during the night and morning while trying to sleep.

- Cleanliness of room. Was very disappointed with the quality of house keeping. Had footwear on for the duration inside our room including in the shower.

- Furniture and room fittings. We were in a newly refurbished room however I feel they missed the mark with furniture and tile choices as well as a lack of artwork. The blue fabric looked filthy on the bedhead, daybead and couches as they showed up every stain. White tiles in the bathroom are always going to be hard to keep clean and unfortunately they were quite dirty. The gold panelling along the stairs at the entrance to the hotel would have been a much better choice and much easier to keep
clean.

Rooftop Pool - The music was very repetitive and quite annoying. A new playlist is definitely required. Staff around the pool area could be more proactive and more engaging with guests. Had to always get their attention.

Staff - Although friendly, polite and always smiling it seemed a bit forced. I have made friends with staff and have them on Facebook from other hotels in Bali and around the world, sadly I couldn't remember the name of one staff member at U Paasha and I doubt they would remember mine.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would return and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting an affordable stay in the best location in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
790,Amazing value of money,50,June 2019,"The hotel is just off a busy street but if you’ve been to seminyak you’ll know just how busy all the streets are. First impressions were outstanding, couldn’t fault how beautiful it looked. Once in our room it definitely didn’t disappoint! Never saw a bed so big in my life. Buffet breakfast was a solid 10/10! Highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
791,50th Birthday,50,June 2019,With a recommendation from a friend went with the missus for my 50th birthday for a week. Airport transit. Big room. Great people and even a little cake and birthday message from them. Couldn't fault it. Would recommend.,U Paasha Seminyak
792,Modern luxury in Seminyak,50,June 2019,"Very well appointed modern luxury hotel in the heart of Seminyak. Close to all the best restaurants & shopping. Gorgeous views from the rooftop pool & bar, great spot to enjoy a few cocktails & watch the sunset. Lovely, friendly & efficient staff. Everything you need in the room, all the mod cons. Amazing breakfast buffet too! Highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
793,A nice hotel with great surroundings,40,June 2019,This hotel has a big room. A good choice for couples who are keen to explore places to eat and drinks and late night hangout. However riding a car is not an option.The traffic coming in and out the area is a disaster.,U Paasha Seminyak
794,very good place,50,May 2019,"It's in the center of Smile, but it was nice to have a better service at an inexpensive price. If I come back to Bali, I will stay again. The roof tower, the pool was the best. The view from the room was pretty good.",U Paasha Seminyak
795,Great location,30,June 2019,The rooms are large and spacious. Great location. Close to shops as well as great restaurants. Negatives our aircon was very very loud. Sounded like a plane on take off and landing. Pool area is not huge but works well. Overall a good stay.,U Paasha Seminyak
796,Don't stay on level 5!!!,20,June 2019,"We stayed at U Paasha for 3 nights. Unfortunately we were woken every morning at 6:30am with gym using dropping weights at the end of sets. They sound like they are about to the fall through the roof of the room.
If you check in and they give you level 5, ask for another room! We trudged down to the reception each morning at 6:30am and asked for something to be done but no help was given, only an apology after checking out.
Very disappointing!",U Paasha Seminyak
797,"Short visit in Bali, nice stay at the hotel",40,June 2019,"Nice location, right in the middle of Seminyak - walking distance to good cafes and restaurants. The room is spacious (i got room 309) but toilet/bathroom can be more private. Nice rooftop pool. Nice breakfast buffet caters both Indonesian and Western. Overall nice and practical - not blowing my mind, unlike W or Alila but for the price will come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
798,Excellent stay at U Paasha,50,June 2019,"For anyone reading this, U Paasha is excellent. Extremely friendly staff, although this appears to be the culture in Bali where everyone is great.

The hotel is very clean, easy to navigate and has great facilities. The pool is in a great spot, being on the rooftop and has plenty of beds and space to chill out. The gym is basic, but covers all you need on a holiday.

Breakfast was everything you need and no query was too small for the breakfast team. We didn’t eat there outside of breakfast, apart from a couple of pool side snacks. In all honestly, these are probably slightly overpriced, but hard when you are comparing to the rest of Bali, which we found super cheap.

Took the recommendation off of a colleague to stay here and don’t regret it one bit.

Only thing for me is that the airport transfer is slightly more in price than you would pay if it was with another company, but the service was everything we needed and can’t be
faulted.

Overall, loved our stay and would happily return. Thanks to the staff at U Paasha for making out tip enjoyable.",U Paasha Seminyak
799,Great spot and service,50,June 2019,"This is our 3 trip to this Hotel U Paasha , lovely Hotel service impeccable, close to shops in the centre of Seminyak , Brendon GM very approachable and always on hand to assist if needed , my wife enjoyed a relaxing holiday , we also invited our family and friends along this time , they we also very impressed with the Hotel , large rooms and very clean, thanks Brendon and staff for making our holiday , see you guys next year Bob / Anne",U Paasha Seminyak
800,No complaints here!,50,June 2019,"Very much enjoyed our stay at U Paasha. The hotel is modern, clean, big rooms and in such a convenient location in Seminyak.. walkable to all the main restaurants and bars around the area. Surprisingly the rooms are very quiet for being on such a busy main road so that’s a tick from me!
The rooftop pool is amazing! It was never overly busy so we could always get a bed and easily spent the day enjoying the sunshine and drinks. Plus side, no kids running around! Awesome adult hotel. I would definitely stay at U Paasha again. Great value for money!!",U Paasha Seminyak
801,superb!,50,June 2019,"nice nice nice hotel in the middle of crowded seminyak.

803,Lovely place for a holiday!,50,June 2019,"I stayed at U Paasha for a holiday with my partner - from the moment we got there we were greeted with great service and were so happy with the room. The room was very comfortable and tidy, and the staff were always polite and happy to help. The location of the hotel is great, as it is within walking distance of many restaurants/bars or even the beach. The rooftop pool and bar is amazing! Highly recommend for any couples/friends that are travelling.",U Paasha Seminyak
804,U Paasha - Amazing!,50,May 2019,"We have stayed at U Paasha once previously and were so amazed at how beautiful the hotel was, the room and the service, that we chose to stay here again when we returned to Bali a year later! The staff are so friendly and kind and the rooms are impeccable.",U Paasha Seminyak
805,Best place to stay in Seminyak,50,June 2019,"Great location on what is described as Eat Street. Rooms good size and clean. Fantastic breakfast..until 11am. Roof top pool with heaps on lounges, pool 30m long so good to exercise and have relaxation. Staff very personal and attentive..seriously keen to make sure your stay at UPaasha is second to none.",U Paasha Seminyak
806,Fab hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,May 2019,"A really lovely fairly modern hotel on the heart of the action yet quietly setback from the noise
Great facilities including a huge pool on the rooftop perfect for lengths or sipping cocktails watching the sunsets
Staff were so helpful and friendly
Room was immaculate and I was upgraded
Breakfast delicious and great selection of international and local choices
Will defo be back to this gem",U Paasha Seminyak
807,"Great rooms, location & staff!",50,June 2019,"This is out first time in Bali and we started off in Seminyak, we chose the U Paasha as the location seemed central to everything we needed in terms of shops, restaurants and beachside bars.

We travelled from the UK so knew we would suffer from jetlag for the first couple of days and didn't want to do too much exploring just yet.

When we first arrived we were greeted with the biggest smiles, and happiest faces - the staff are truly the most friendly people we have ever met, everyone says hi as you walk past and asks how you are, even the gardener watering the plants around the pool.

We arrived in our room (we booked suite with a view which is on the top floor, it costs a little extra but has the views) and it was huge, really bright and light with huge floor to ceiling windows so the light comes streaming in, no one is over-looking you and not once through our stay did we shut the curtains, it allowed the natural light to wake us up in the morning.

The bed is so comfortable, it's ginormous too and there is a pillow menu available if you need to change them at all.
The rooms are also very clean and have a contemporary design, I especially loved all the hexagonal tiling in the bathroom with the mirrors to match.
The breakfast selection is great, there is loads to choose from including musli, fruit, fresh juices, pancakes, waffles, cooked breakfast items including eggs done any way you like, pastries, breads, and then there are salads and Asian style breakfast items such as noodles and dim sum, oh and fantastic coffees!!

This hotel is right by a busy street loaded with shops and restaurants, coffee shops and bars, not to mention busy traffic - however we couldn't really hear this from the room when the doors were shut on the balcony, you can't hear it from the rooftop pool either which is great when you're relaxing during the day.

We think this hotel is a great price for what you get, it's only 15 minutes walk to the beachside hotels, bars and restaurants which are quite expensive, so it's nice to have the option to visit them without paying top dollar to be actually staying on the beach, we would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
808,Perfect hotel,50,May 2019,"I wouldn’t stay anywhere else. The location, the staff, the breakfast, the rooftop pool, the bed and pillows - all perfect! I travelled to Bali seven times last year and stayed at U Paasha every time.",U Paasha Seminyak
809,Great service and rooms,50,June 2019,"Brilliant hotel, staff are friendly the rooms are huge, clean and modern. Ideally located away from the big bars but close enough to walk anywhere. Roof top pool and bar is great with some perfect views of all Bali. Would stay here again I love it. Thanks a lot!",U Paasha Seminyak
810,5 night stay at Upaasha,50,May 2019,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights. Could not fault the hotel or service. Location is great, rooms were huge, clean and bed comfortable. Breakfast had everything you could ask for with your eggs cooked fresh and coffee made to order.

Rooftop pool was a great way to end the day with a few drinks watching the sunset and getting away from the hustle and bustle downstairs.

We will be returning for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
811,Wonderful and relaxing stay,50,May 2019,"I always have a wonderful time at U Passha... it's the perfect location for beach walks, shopping and great food nearby. The staff are really friendly and helpful, the rooftop pool is amazing and the breakfasts are wonderful.",U Paasha Seminyak
812,Outstanding service,50,May 2019,"I’d like to mention Mantra from the front desk. He went above and beyond to get special arrangements made in the bedroom. There were a few hiccups, but he quickly got it all fixed to the way I wanted, all at the last minute!
Thankyou Mantra",U Paasha Seminyak
813,Amazing,50,May 2019,Was amazing place and staff were lovely people... would recommend this place..staff in the pool area were also nice and really good entertainment having a joke round with everyone.. food was also great,U Paasha Seminyak

The staff members are so nice ! Thank you again ! And a special attention for my Birthday ! So surprised ! Thanks again
I will come Back !",U Paasha Seminyak
815,Excellent service and large comfortable rooms,50,May 2019,This is the second time I stayed at Upaasha and it was even better then before. The first time I told them internet was a bit slow and they happily received my feedback and fixed it. I have zero complaints this time and the service is exceptional. Most 5 star hotels can't top their warm welcome.,U Paasha Seminyak
816,Great location great hotel,50,May 2019,"loved the location - loved the Roof Pool, rooms were big and clean, would stay here again.
had a great bar at the front of the hotel and enjoyed a Night cap at the end of the evening.
would recommend U Paasha",U Paasha Seminyak
817,A mid-range hotel with amazing rooms at the most central location,50,May 2019,"The location of the hotel is outstanding. It is right smack in all the action - all the bars, restaurants and shops are at its doorsteps. there is a convenience store right at its entrance. To the left is Seminyak Square and Seminyak Village (shopping centres) - just 3 to 4 mins walk if you want to hide from the sun. We also used Grab Car and Go Car to get to further places. It is one of the few hotels on that street where the cars can drive in to pick u up and not park at the side of the road. FYI, in GrabCar, the location is shown as Paasha Hotel.

Check in was a breeze, staff was helpful and polite. The rooms are huge, modern and clean with a day bed. The bathrooms are separated ie rain shower, and toilet. The entrance to the shower and toilets are wide. there are 2 sinks. Water pressure is good. The bed is extremely comfy. The TV is very large and has a great selection of channels - cartoon network, national geographic, HBO etc etc. Love the coffee machine in the room! It was a pleasant surprise. Standard drink and toilet amenities are provided. There is also a safe.

The breakfast buffet is better than other average hotels with warm pastries, fresh coffee and an egg station. They also have fresh pancakes, freshly squeezed juices, salads, cereals, some local fares etc. At level 5, there is a rooftop bar where you can redeem your welcome beer/drink. There is also a beautiful pool overlooking the city.

I would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families with children as it is a very accessible and comfortable stay. Will definitely come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
818,Great location and comfortable clean rooms and bed,40,May 2019,"Hotel is located right in the center of Seminiyak, close to many things. Great service and friendly staff. Love the flexibility of in room ordering of complimentary breakfast. Rooms are spacious and clean, with comfy bed. Only gripe is the deposit held on credit card takes 14 days to refund. Slight moldy smell in room, be nice to offer essential oil burners.",U Paasha Seminyak
819,Outstanding,50,May 2019,"Can't recommend this hotel enough!
The location is second to none, if you like being close to everything and the rooftop pool views are amazing.
Staff were very friendly and accommodating especially being our first trip with a baby (1yr old)
Hotel is modern, clean and rooms size is great
The buffet breakfast was also top notch.
I will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
820,Our favourite place in Bali,50,September 2018,"The U Paasha is by far our favourite place to stay in Bali. We have stayed there three times now and will be returning for our fourth in September this year. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the Main Street and close to just about everything you need. The staff are amazing, some of the friendliest we have met and the rooms are huge & comfortable. Being able to check in at 6pm and check out the next day at 6pm is definitely one of the best things about this hotel as well, every hotel needs '24 hour use of room'. We love the rooftop pool and bar, and the great service you receive up there. Breakfast is also one of the best we have received in Bali. We can't wait to return to the U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
821,Will definitely stay here again!,50,May 2019,"U Paasha Staff were brilliant. Very attentive and professional without being overbearing.
Breakfast was fantastic, rooms were large and the rooftop pool was very spacious. Close to everything in Seminyak whilst not being to noisy.
Would definitely recommend this to friends and would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
822,Gem on Seminar eat street,50,May 2019,Fantastic location right on main of eat street yet quiet in the rooms. Great rooftop swimming pool and buffet breakfast exceeded expectations. Spacious rooms with good service staff. Reasonably priced and really appreciate the check out hours based on when you check in on the 1st day given that we had a late night flight!!,U Paasha Seminyak
823,Fabulous location and great staff,50,May 2019,"Having stayed at this hotel numerous times, we returned again for a short trip. The main reason we do is the quality of the staff and the fact that they will always try to go that extra mile for you. It’s location is also great for a variety of restaurants and cafes close by. The rooftop pool is a perfect size and always well maintained. The staff are always smiling - from the reception, to the breakfast and even to the security gentleman outside. If you’re looking for a reasonable priced, great location hotel with the friendliest staff you won’t go far wrong with U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
824,Great!,50,May 2019,We stayed there for 6 nights and could not fault anything. All staff are super friendly & helpful. The breakfast & all good in general was delicious. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a relaxing break!!,U Paasha Seminyak
825,Excellent stay!,50,May 2019,"U Paasha is definitely an hotel that I would recommend. The rooftop pool is incredible with a nice ocean view, the staff is friendly and the room is really nice, quiet and clean. Definitely a good choice for a stay in Seminiak.",U Paasha Seminyak
826,Great Value in the heart of Seminyak,50,May 2019,"Lovely large room with super shower and king sized bed. Our view from the third floor was OK and had a small balcony (which you couldn't sit out on). Was better than those on the first floor with no view at all.
Situated in the heart of Seminyak but you are completely unaware of traffic when in the hotel. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. Highlight was the rooftop pool which had just enough sunbeds. Happy hour from 5 - 7 was good value and well timed for the great views of the sunset which can be enjoyed from the pool and the adjacent bar.
All the staff were super friendly and really helpful.
Although not on the beach, the cost of the hotel is great value considering its location and the facilities. We will return when we get the chance.",U Paasha Seminyak
827,BEST EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOTEL!,50,May 2019,"This is my first time travelling to Bali and i choose to stay in U Paasha Seminyak. The Hotel is really really good in services, providing a variety of hand soaps and shower gel especially the Jasmine soap which i like the most, DELICIOUS breakfast and friendly staffs that make you feel like you are actually staying at your home! I sincerely recommend couples or family to stay here for your Bali trip!",U Paasha Seminyak
828,Outstanding!!!,50,May 2019,"Absolutely outstanding in every way.
The service, the location, the food ( particularly the roof top bbq and breakfast all day anywhere you want )
The roof top pool is amazing.
Special mention to Gidi and Guda
These guys made our stay something very special. We will definitely be back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
829,I was able to see the staff and relaxed,50,May 2019,"I m glad I met a GM and manager,I like to watch guests and staff on the pool side during my stay.
There are few japanese people ,but Ilike this hotel in the seminyak area.
Best wishes for the development of the hitei.",U Paasha Seminyak
830,"Magnificent, beyond expectation.",50,May 2019,"Stayed 4nights at this hotel, my very first time. Room is spacious.
If I have to fault, it's the sewage smell in the room especially in the middle of the nights.
Other than that your staffs are fabulous, they rem my name.
Very accommodating, I had my birthday cake from the aeroplane and they kindly kept it for 2 days and rem it.
Told them my gf birthday during breakfast and I wanted my cake to be served, the chef rem and the staffs presented with another cake as well from the hotel.

At the pool side, I had a drink and during dinner before I could eat anything I fell and black out for few seconds.
The staffs were quick and very caring and concerned throughout till the next day.
Special shout out to the sweet Sumari at the pool deck who chatted with us when we Sun tanned. Rini, Okta, Guna at the breakfast cafe. Didn't get the names of the two gentlemen at the check in reception.
Your staffs are a gem to you.
I will be back to check out your penthouse.",U Paasha Seminyak
831,Bali Best for 48.,50,May 2019,"So great to have stayed at U Paasha. Staff was friendly, polite and people concern Staff. So hard to find nowadays. I want to thank the following staff whom have made the trip so unforgettable ;
Ms sumari
Ms Rini
Mr Guna
Mr Raka

and all the staff working at the poolside BBQ Restaurant on the 15th night. They were great people and genuinely
show concern and empathy to us when we needed it. Thank you for the great stay!!! will definitely come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
832,Great location and value,50,May 2019,If you want a hotel close to all the action of seminyak and changuu then this hotel is spot on. The staff and facilities were excellent. The rooms were spotless and there was a great pool area for the day. Breakfast was ok but I’d recommend you venture out if you want traditional açai bowls and pancakes etc.,U Paasha Seminyak
833,A great location and amazing rooftop pool,50,April 2019,A great place to stay and relax. Close to everything and easy to get around. I thought value for money was good. I could spend all day at the rooftop pool. I was staying by myself but travelling with a number of friends and visitors were welcomed and treated just as well as the guests.,U Paasha Seminyak
834,Holiday home,50,May 2019,"Really enjoyed our stay at U Paasha. Perfect location for Seminyak lovers. Near all of the main venues such as Ku De Ta, Ultimos and La Luciola etc. Not forgetting the endless shops. The rooftop pool was really nice and cooler than ground floor pools from previous experience. Prices at the pool were not overinflated and the food was mostly good. Room service was always prompt and good. It's not far to walk to the beach and given the usual overindulgence a good idea to walk off some excesses. Handy sports bar next door called Nirvana which seems to have a good atmosphere most nights. Breakfast was also really nice and plenty to chose from.
You should get up to the rooftop bar at sunset as this is perfect to watch whilst enjoying happy hour.
All round a definite 5 out of 5.",U Paasha Seminyak
835,FIRST TIME IN BALI,50,May 2019,"EXCEEDED EXPECTIONS!!
Had 6 days away with my partner & another couple and had the best time! The staff were super friendly, lovely, always smiling and willing to help us with any questions/ queries. The General Manager Brendan was very friendly and approachable also! I will 100% be coming back to UPaasha in the coming months.",U Paasha Seminyak
836,Wonderful!!,50,May 2019,"U Paasha gets 5 stars for wonderful staff, rooms, location, facilities and the breakfast is amazing and caters to all tastes.
Wonderful view from the pool on the roof and the BBQ is fantastic. Because we checked in late we were given a late check out which was great as the flight left at 10:15 pm.",U Paasha Seminyak
837,U Paasha paradise,50,May 2019,"This was our first stay at U Paasha, and everything was delightful - the room, the staff, the pool, the spacious gym, and especially the breakfast. We stayed for a week and would gladly have stayed for two. The complimentary yoga was a really lovely touch, too - hard-pressed to find anywhere better to do it!",U Paasha Seminyak
838,Great location,40,May 2019,"Great location.. it’s good for short stay
There are many good restaurants near by the hotel.
The breakfast is very good. It’s unexpected. The staffs are very nice. They will help the guests to celebrate birthday. How sweet they are!
The room is big",U Paasha Seminyak
839,Highly recommended,50,May 2019,"Stayed here for 3.5 days, service was unparalleled : attentive, meticulous and the staff even took the initiative to check if we needed anything else. Service was seriously 12 out of 10.
Rooms are huge, spacious, clean and comfortable. Air-conditioning and water supply is strong. A previous occupant had used the fridge to store durian and the housekeeping team managed to clean out the stink within just 2 hours while we were out - impressive turnaround time by reception and housekeeping team. They also followed up on other requests and were helpful, polite and friendly.
The location, room quality, service and gorgeous rooftop pool were well worth their prices.
Just one thing management might want to review, allowing guests to check out 24 hours after arrival needs a lot more robust booking system and sophisticated coordination across multiple booking sites. quite a few guests, including us, had to wait for rooms to be ready due to unusual check-in and out timings. This puts unnecessary stress on reception and housekeeping to deal with angry guests and sets a bad initial start. We already arrived 5 hours later than the usual check-in time and still had to wait >1 hr for our rooms to be ready.
Otherwise, the hotel was exceptional, we enjoyed it, would come back. The bbq buffet was pretty decent value for money. Serving in small portions + order on demand system resulted in a fantastic off the grill quality and beautiful wok hei with the carbs (just keep ordering, people)",U Paasha Seminyak
840,Central Eat Street Seminyak,50,May 2019,Modern hotel centrally located on the street of restaurants in Seminyak. 10 minute walk to the beach. The staff were very obliging. We had a king size bed room which was quite spacious and with everything you could possibly want or need. The internet was faster than we had experienced at other hotels in Bali. The coffee machine at breakfast is an absolute godsend for those that love a decent coffee.,U Paasha Seminyak
841,U paasha Seminyak Bali,50,May 2019,"Could not fault this hotel . Perfect Seminyak location. Great rooms. Large , very excellent mattress and aircon . Super helpful friendly staff , great breakfast, good hotel food and cold beer 🍺. We loved it",U Paasha Seminyak
842,Happy,50,May 2019,"friendly staff, very clean room. the location of hotel also was good. close to shops, beach and clubs. In total we are happy spent time there and recommend to every body. Just wish we had a bath tube in our room;)",U Paasha Seminyak
843,Excellent location!,50,May 2019,The hotel is located in the heart of Seminyak. Amazing views from rooftop with delicious cocktails. The rooms are very spacious and modern. Restaurant is very vegan accommodating. Will be definitely back.,U Paasha Seminyak
844,Great Hotel,50,May 2019,"We stayed here for 4 nights in May and the service was second to none. The hotel is worth it for the rooftop pool alone, an oasis from the hustle and bustle below.

I’d recommend asking for a quiet room towards the back of the hotel, away from the Main Street as the hotel is opened fronted and the sound travels down the corridors though in saying that the walls are thick and sound between rooms is minimal.

Service wise we could not ask for more. All the staff were very attentive and incredibly nice.

Food - the breakfast is great with a lot of options, poolside food is also top notch but DO NOT bother with the bbq buffet... we did it and it’s such a waste of money considering the fab food locations so near by. It wasn’t even half the size we expected and the meat was so small and bland, a real disappointment considering how god the day to day food is. That was my only complaint - other than that we had a lovely time there and would recommend it to anyone.

Locally I’d recommend Mama San and La Favela for food and drink and if you went to go to Tanah Lot go at sunrise and not sunset to avoid the crowds.",U Paasha Seminyak
845,Loved U Passha,50,May 2019,"Large rooms with soft beds and pillows, Loved the Coffee Pods! Warm pool to view the great sunset with happy hour drinks, Extensive choices for breakfast, perfect location on Eats Street. Would definitely stay again",U Paasha Seminyak

848,In heart of Seminyak with spectacular roof-top pool,50,April 2019,"Pros: central location, huge rooms, spectacular roof-top pool, good food, friendly service.
Cons: 24/7 check in is an exaggeration as it depends on when your room is released after previous occupant checks out. First room offered was marred by external noise from aircon plant. Final L2 room fine though.",U Paasha Seminyak
849,Amazing swimming pool at roof top,50,May 2019,"U paasha is a very nice hotel at the center of Seminyak.
Various kind of food for breakfast you can choose no only long black coffee but all kinds of coffee with milk.

853,Nice concept but lacking in details,30,April 2019,We really liked the big space and room we had. I loved the toilet dual sinks but the toilet bowl makes a screeching sound when flushed. The bed is very comfortable but the paint on the ceiling was cracked in some parts. Also the docking system and sound system beside the bed is spoilt.,U Paasha Seminyak
854,Amazing as always,50,April 2019,"U Paasha is my go to hotel every time i'm in Seminyak. The best location, great staff, big rooms and stunning rooftop pool. Brought a new group of friends this time who share the same thoughts. Hard to fault.",U Paasha Seminyak

The quality of the hotel itself is exceptional, this includes the rooms the rooftop pool, amenities, bathrooms/showers, breakfast etc. the staff are extremely friendly and always willing to help and no doubt you will be greeted with a warm hello from the GM to check in on how your stay is going - something rare to find these days! The food and beverage staff are also lovely and will also go the extra mile. Last but not least LOCATION. This hotel is smack bang in the middle of Seminyak and walking distance to everything - Potato Head, Mrs Sippy’s, KuDeTa, Motel Mexicola, the list goes on! Would definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
856,Best place to stay in Bali,50,April 2019,"This is my third time here. Very central location, great buffet breakfast, fantastic room service, the best roof top pool, the rooms are huge.

857,Great stay and will happily return again!,50,April 2019,"The staff were friendly and the breakfast was elite! The rooms were spacious, luxurious and sleek in design. The roof top pool was great for tanning because it is located on the top floor, the sun is always out. There location of the hotel was very convenient, it is located in the heart of seminyak so you can walk everywhere. We were very impressed.",U Paasha Seminyak

Check in was fast and very good with a personal touch offering a personal choice of fragrance toiletries for the room. Bedrooms large and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with a good variety of choice. The rooftop pool was amazing with an excellent food and drinks service at hand. The sunsets were amazing from there too.Hotel positions is great for access to loads of nice restaurants, bars and shops.",U Paasha Seminyak
859,First stop on our Bali trip,50,April 2019,"The U Paasha is a great place to base yourself in Seminyak with plenty of restaurant's and bars to choose from.

The room was very clean and spacious, the breakfast was also very good and plenty of choice.
We used the rooftop pool everyday but beware the wind can catch you out when it comes to sunburn.

Also thanks to the housekeeping for the beautiful decor we had in our room for our honeymoon.",U Paasha Seminyak
860,Wonderful hotel and staff,50,April 2019,"We arrived earlier than our due check-in time and luckily our room was already clean so we were shown straight to it. The staff allowed us to have the complimentary breakfast that morning, even though we weren’t entitled to have it until the following day and it as delicious with plenty to choose from.

The room was spacious and had everything you could need. We stayed for four nights and the staff were so helpful throughout the entire stay, there was nothing that was too much for them to do.

The location of the hotel is great, plenty of nice restaurants right outside and the beach front only a 10 minute walk. And of course the hotel has its own rooftop pool which is lovely, we never had to fight over sunbeds - seemed to be enough for everyone.

Only downside is the gym needs a major update and most of the mechines need fixed. However it was good to have some use of this while we were there.

I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Seminyak, and would definitely come back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
861,Second time back and not the last,40,April 2019,"Love U Paasha for the location and service. Breakfasts are pretty good, but some variety when you're staying for longer than a week would be nice. Still notice a bit of a sewage type smell in the lifts and sometimes in the bathroom. Priced excellently for what you get.",U Paasha Seminyak
862,Great hotel and excellent value for money.,50,April 2019,"Fantastic friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, great food and an awesome rooftop pool with an impressive view.

864,Honeymoon Stay,50,April 2019,"Was greeted with a warm welcome by a friendly front office team. Fast and efficient checkin and explained all facilities. Lovely suits with great beds and bathroom facilities. Even have the choice of fragrances with bathroom toiletries.
Was greeted by the lovely honeymoon gestures and a letter from Brendan the Resort Manager which was lovely. Great location was lots to see and do. Awesome shopping with a mix of markets and boutique store. Only thing I would recommend is changing in room dining menu. Not enough options for light meals ie, club sandwiches or wedges or alternatives if you don’t feel like Indonesian meals? Simple food ie pizzas etc would be appreciated. Beautiful pool on the roof top with a bar and meals available but similar menu to that in room and restaurant.",U Paasha Seminyak
865,Comfortable and friendly hotel,40,April 2019,"We found the U Paasha an excellent experience for us. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. Included breakfast was of a high standard. Location relative to shopping, dinning in central Seminyak we also a plus for us.",U Paasha Seminyak

867,Almost don't want to say how good it is...,50,February 2019,"...lest it gets too popular!

Amazing spot, right in Seminyak and central to a lot of the dining and experiences we like to get from our trips to Bali.

Rooms are a great size, lots of space to get settled in.

Staff are always friendly and reliable. Smiles all round and always happy to help in any way they can.

The rooftop pool is amazing! Clean, safe and a great space. As someone who needs shade (yes, I am a ginger) they have great beds with shade available and the atmosphere of being by such an amazing pool while overlooking the Seminyak cityscape is insane.

Food by the pool is really good and a great price and the staff who work by the pool deserve medals for how well they keep it up there, both service and generally looking after the space.

This is our go-to accomodation when visiting Seminyak and I am very much looking forward to going back again soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
868,"Fantastic! Great hotel, awesome location",50,April 2019,"Absolutely brilliant. Great location right in the heart of seminyak, big spacious rooms very very clean. The staff are brilliant, nothing is too much trouble. The rooftop pool is awesome, lots of sun beds and the pool staff are super friendly and efficient. Breakfast is the best. Great variety and the food is fantastic. This was our second stay at this hotel and we will be rebooking for November. You can’t beat this hotel and wouldn’t find better right in seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak
869,Great place to stay,50,April 2019,"Happy we ended up here, loved everything about it. Highly recommend it and the staff are lovely. Look out for Gede up at the pool area. He’s got a voice like an angel and is very entertaining. Pick this place, you won’t regret it.",U Paasha Seminyak
870,"Great hotel, excellent value and ideal location ( not on beach)",50,April 2019,"Best value for money in Bali. Great staff and great location in the heart of Seminyak. Added bonus of being opposite Cafe Bali.
If Seminyak is your bag don’t look anywhere else. Very large rooms, good breakfast and relaxing roof top pool.
Unbeatable!",U Paasha Seminyak
871,Nice hotel near all the best restaurants in seminyak!,40,April 2019,"Recently stayed for 5 days on a business trip. All The hotel staff were absolutely lovely and the rooms were very spacious! The internet was strong and the bed was extremely comfortable! Breakfasts were good serving a variety of Asian and western options. Spent many evenings at the rooftop pool enjoying the sunset and the 2for1 happy hour. Also highly recommend the cocktails at the aero drink truck at the front of the hotel - the bartender makes awesome capiroskas! Food I ordered at the rooftop pool was also really good and highly recommend the crab cakes. One great plus about this hotel is they allow check out at the same time you checked in.

I stayed on level 1 which sometimes got a bit noisy with people walking by or hearing doors slam, but otherwise was ok sound wise. Back Elevator did have an unpleasant odour coming from it that should be addressed. Bathrooms could potentially use a reno as the floor material was stained or the option of a having a bathtub would be nice.

Overall Great stay and would happily return for a holiday or business!",U Paasha Seminyak
872,Incredible Customer Service,50,April 2019,"Surprised in immigration queue at airport departures by a U Paasha staff member who had raced from the hotel (45mins) to return my iPhone which I had accidentally left in my room upon checkout. I hadn't even realised that I had left it until then!
I haven't heard of, let alone experienced, such commitment to customer service

Good rooms, great staff, and a good location if you want to really be in the thick of things.",U Paasha Seminyak

Going up to our room and the layout and cleanliness of it is amazing! Staff are extremely friendly and will help you with everything and anything you require! You definitely don’t need to go any further this place is definitely the best! The pool, facilities and food is unreal. Returning guests and we will definitely be coming back more. Terima Kasih 🙏🏼",U Paasha Seminyak
875,Great stay,50,March 2019,"My family recently stayed here and we cannot wait to come back.Good location and when your sitting on the rooftop pool sipping a cocktail you don’t feel the hustle and bustle on the streets below. The best thing about this place is the genuine warmth of the staff. The breakfast is great also with enough food varieties on offer to satisfy everyone from kids to adults.The rooms are huge and comfortable.
Kudos to the U Paasha team !!!",U Paasha Seminyak

879,Trip To Bali 7-13 Apr 2019,40,April 2019,"Overall we are satisfied with our stay. The staff are friendly and fun, and the room is comfortable and clean. The only setback is checkout took a little bit longer than it should be. The location is excellent, with plentiful of shopping, massage, food, etc within a walking distance. Great place to stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
880,Great place to stay!,50,April 2019,"U Passha was a fantastic place to stay right in the heart of Seminyak.
The staff were amazing as nothing was a problem.
The rooms nice and spacious with all that you need.
Had to get the doctor for my daughter who is a type one diabetic on the last night of our stay. The Dr and nurse who arrived were great and my daughter was fine thanks to a needle to stop her vomiting, so we could resume our holiday with one day to go thankfully!
The rooftop pool is a nice sanctuary away from the hussle and bussle of the street, so if your after a nice place to stay and want to shop and eat this is the place for you! Would definitely go back!",U Paasha Seminyak
881,U Paasha U Are Fabulous,50,April 2019,"Cannot recommend highly enough,on every level the U Paasha is a truly lovely property right in the thick of popular Seminyak.! Staff are more than accomodating,genuinely welcoming.Rooms are a great size & beautifully designed.Food just superb.We will return,Thankyou",U Paasha Seminyak
882,Great stay,50,April 2019,"If you want to be close to where the action is, this must be the ultimate hotel then. Given that so many of the top restaurants and bars are all within walking distance, and how absolutely atrocious the traffic is, Upaasha ticks so many boxes. The beach is only 10 mins walk away.

Our room was faultless, with an efficient quiet air conditioner, blackout drapes, great bathroom, super comfy beds, and very quiet. The staff at this place are incredibly friendly, and very helpful. The pool and associated surrounds are really good, and attentive staff look after any needs.

The manager Brendan came over and had a chat at breakfast, and it's quite obvious why this place works so well. He actually cares what people have to say, and is genuinely interested in making sure you have a good stay. I can honesty say that this is the first hotel in Bali where you can get a decent coffee made with a real machine, that tastes similar to a Melbourne cafe coffee. Certainly not worth paying 50,000rp at revolver around the corner, when you can get this for free!",U Paasha Seminyak
883,13 days of bliss,50,April 2019,"We just spent 13 days at the U Paasha for our anniversary. We selected the U Paasha for 2 reasons, the central location and the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. from the quick and flowing check in it made the perfect start. We first saw the rooftop pool and bar with stunning views across Bali from Mt Agung, the airport, the ocean views, all of Seminyak and right around to Mt Kintamanti there is not a better place to relax with a cocktail and watch the brilliant sunset. We were blown away with the service from the staff. From Mulya, who was the 2nd in charge, Galang at the bar always willing to chat and to keep us smiling (helping him learn English), Ketut in housekeeping who was a good companion early morning poolside and him leaving us little notes and towel animals in our room and Rika at the breakfast buffet. she would always stop to ask us how we were, what we were doing and would always say hello even in passing. the staff all knew our names including the many security guys. We also had interaction with Brendan, the Aussie GM who always had time for us even to the point that he sat with us and gave us a list of restaurants he recommended (getting through about 6 of them). The room we had, 523, was quite, spacious and after a few days the air con stopped blowing cold air. it was re gassed and fixed within 15 mins.
We cannot fault the hotel as it is on the well known Eat Street so dozens of quality restaurants were all a short walk, as were the shopping, mini marts and only a kilometer to the beach.
Our next trip to Bali will be at the U Paasha for sure. Thank you to Brendan and his amazing staff that made our stay so much better than expected.",U Paasha Seminyak
884,Nice place to stay in centre,50,April 2019,"Stayed for one night after long hawl from UK, really comfy large bed, slept like a baby, so much so we missed breakfast. Great food, shopping and massages to be had very close by, nice rooftop pool and bar",U Paasha Seminyak
885,Great location but a little tired,40,April 2019,"We spent a long weekend in Seminak eating and relaxing. This was/is a great central location. We did ask for a renovated room, but were not given one so I can't comment on the renovated rooms. The common areas are a little tired, but as a whole the place is clean and tidy. The room was very spacious and comfortable. Very noisy aircon and waaaay too much perfume in the room on arrival (I suspect may have been hiding something). Breakfast was good. Nice setting but not a huge selection, but good quality. The pool is well located with distant views of the ocean. Service at the pool was great. We ate at the pool on one occasion and the food was brilliant, wow. Unfortunately we used this as a guide and stayed for dinner which was pretty ordinary based on what you can get in restaurants in Seminak nowadays. All in all a good stay, great value for money.",U Paasha Seminyak
886,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,50,April 2019,"The Service, staff and location was Amazing and can't fault it at all. Nothing was too hard for them and accommodated us with every request we had. Definitely get value for money and will coming back to this Hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
887,Good location and great staff.,40,April 2019,Our stay was excellent. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Great location. Pool was a little murky. Breakfast was lovely. I would recommend this hotel for it's location more than it's facilities or setting.,U Paasha Seminyak
888,Exceeded My Expectations,50,April 2019,"Great hotel right in the middle of the action in Seminyak. Our family stayed for 4 nights.
Top restaurants, bars and shopping surround. We were recommended to stay at U Paasha and it certainly lived up to that. Roof top bar and swimming pool are excellent. Great location for happy hour drinks.
Our family tried out the roof top BBQ offer for our family function for 10 people. Could not fault the BBQ food, and the setting.
Rooms are modern, spacious and clean. Comfortable beds. And the bathroom towels are white and fluffy.
Breakfast was included and the spread is very, very good. Everything you could want for breakfast was there. Eggs are cooked to order. I absolutely enjoyed the eggs royale (a variation of eggs benedict but with smoked salmon)
Staff are friendly and their service is very good.
I absolutely recommend U Paasha Hotel in Seminyak.
(and no, I don't work for U Paasha.........Hahaaaaa)",U Paasha Seminyak
889,Recommend to all,50,March 2019,"Great position in Seminyak, right in middle of ""eat street"" truly amazing staff and service and huge rooms at U Paasha. Roof top pool and bar are fanstastic, can't wait to return. Breaksfast is fantastic and each and every staff member will greet you with a smile.",U Paasha Seminyak
890,"Welcoming, comfortable but not suitable for elderly",30,March 2019,"Reception very friendly and welcoming. Even messaged me to let me know that my room is ready. There are signs of age in the room, thou not overly noticeable. Like stains on the floor and in the bathroom. Breakfast is very good! There is variety and different from other hotels, they offer more customized healthy juices. Downside, there is a flight of steps from ground to reception, no lift, not so good for elderly with joint issues. Lift also does not get to rooftop pool. Rooftop pool has hardly any foliage and pool water is so hot it does not offer any respite from the scorching weather. Not the kind of break I was looking for. Bathroom taps were also strange as the water can be boiling hot! There were no indication of which way to turn for the temperature. Shower water pressure is weak, even at maximum is a trickle, no waterfall. Bedsheet had stains.",U Paasha Seminyak
891,Great Stay,50,April 2019,"We had 5 days at the U Pasha Seminyak and was extremely happy with the choice we had made. From the minute we checked in ( which was early) and taken to our room I knew we we going to enjoy our stay. Our room was large,bright,modern and spotless. We had a lovely view and plenty of room to spread out. The wardrobe was large and could fit in our bags and had plenty of hanging space.
We then headed up to the pool which was great a spot and we ended up spending many hours of our stay there. Great happy hour 2 for 1 cocktails and a great quiet spot to cool down. The pool attendents are so friendly.
The breakfast is delicious and eggs made to order which we appreciated.Coffee and fresh juices went down well.
Finally I would have to say that above all the staff at the UPasha made our stay so memorable. The pool attendents were so happy and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble especially the two boys that were thought were brothers. The staff at breakfast were also exceptional especially Reka and the Food and Beverage Manager who greeted us everyday with a beautiful smile and even helped us out getting a later check out.
We are looking forward to out next stay there.",U Paasha Seminyak
892,Great spot,50,April 2019,"We loved staying here. We didn't want to spend mega bucks on accomodation as we wanted to get out and about and spend more on exploring so we settled for U Paasha.
As it was our first trip to Bali we weren't sure what to expect.
The staff are super friendly and helpful.
Bottled water is on the house as much as you want.
The room was well kept and very spacious with a king bed.
We organised an airport pickup through them which was on the expensive side but as we were arriving late at night we didn't want the hassle of trying to work out how everything worked in Bali. It was worth it. A bootle of chilled water and free wifi in the vehicle was awesome.
Breakfast menu is pretty good.
Rooftop pool is pretty good with great views.
It is on the main shopping strip in Seminyak so it's pretty busy, but on the flip-side close to great food.
Further away from beach than I thought but not a deal-breaker.",U Paasha Seminyak
893,March 2019,50,April 2019,"My son was staying at U Paasha on a holiday and became very ill. The Hotel staff were amazing and helped him from his room to the hotel car and took him to an emergency clinic after which he was admitted to BIMC Hospital. They arranged a car to meet me at the airport, took me to the hospital and took my suitcase to the hotel. The staff are incredibly caring and friendly and go well beyond expectations.",U Paasha Seminyak
894,Happy to recommend U Paasha,50,April 2019,"Really enjoyed our stay at U Paasha. Rooms were big and modern. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming, whatever part of the hotel they worked in. Rooftop pool was great with interesting views of the area. Good cocktails. It’s located right amongst the action and restaurants but you feel far away from the hustle bustle when you’re inside the hotel. Breakfast buffet was great - good coffee and eggs made to order. My partner loved the bacon, perfectly cooked. We can happily recommend U Paasha if you want to stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
895,Great stay,50,March 2019,"Wonderful hotel situated right on the main trees of Seminyak surrounded by restaurants such as Ginger Moon, Batik, Ultimo and Chandi. Staff were all wonderful with great English and service and very attentitive. Price is a bit expensive for us but well worth for large and clean modern looking rooms. Breakfast was great. 24 hour systemfr the rooms was also a plus. I love that you check out the time you check in. Would happily come back and stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
896,short break,40,March 2019,great position in central Seminyak Service friendly and efficient Well recommended Many good restaurants near by .Breakfast great selection with pleasant service . Would be prepared to stay again Good roof top pool . Air conditioning good and room very quiet,U Paasha Seminyak
897,Great location is only the beginning,40,April 2019,"This hotel has it all. The rooms are huge and decorated in a modern decor style. There's even a huge day bed to lounge in. The king bed is very comfortable with comfortable pillows. The only drawback would be insufficient light in the bathroom to apply makeup but that's something that can easily be fixed and also drawers so that you can unpack your suitcase would be helpful. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious with helpings of both Eastern and Western dishes on offer. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Pool is situated on the roof top which meant you could feel a gentle breeze in the late afternoon. Recommend going to the BBQ banquet which they have on the rooftop Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Rooftop was also a great place for a happy hour drink and watching the sunset. Located in Seminyak you can literally walk out front and find some of the best restaurants, bars and shopping in Bali. There's a supermarket across the street where you can buy snacks, toiletries or change money. Walking distance to Seminyak Corner, flea markets, massages this hotel is ideally located for travelers that don't want to be caught having to catch taxis.",U Paasha Seminyak
898,Love!,50,March 2019,"My fourth stay at Upaasha and won’t be my last!
Brendan and staff Thank you once again for an awesome stay.
As usual the cleanliness, friendliness, breakfast, dining, service,room and pool were 5 star quality.
I love my getaways at Upaasha every time I come every few months something is new or upgraded. Love the new Aero Bar Caravan at the front of the hotel now such an awesome little area to sit have a Aperol Spritz some Tapas and watch the world of beautiful Seminyak go by!
See you soon guys! Marie 😉😉",U Paasha Seminyak

The breakfast is amazing, caters for all your needs. The rooms are always fresh and clean. Love the roof top pool, enough Lounges for all. I can’t wait to go back to this great hotel🙏🏻🙏🏻",U Paasha Seminyak
900,Great Hotel,50,March 2019,"Large, clean rooms - great quality for this price range. Walking distance from shops, restaurants, and beach. Good free breakfast. Staff was friendly & helpful. I'd recommend this hotel to friends staying in the area.",U Paasha Seminyak
901,Great holiday stay,50,March 2019,"Have stayed at U Paasha many times now and each time it has been a wonderful experience. Friendly staff, clean rooms, fabulous rooftop pool, delicious breakfast and best location. Only thing I find is the lighting in the bathrooms is rather dim especially do to makeup.",U Paasha Seminyak
902,Fantastic!!,50,March 2019,"We stayed here for a week, our last day being tomorrow. Unfortunately its passed too quick, U Paasha, you have been amazing, this is the hotel to stay at. The location of U Paasha is ideal, right outside the hotel you have all the restaurants in front of you. The beach is a short 10 min walk if your a beach person.

The staff at U Paasha are amazing, always a smile on their face and always giving a helping hand if needed. Nothing seems to much for them. The breakfasts are yummy with an amazing choice, i per usual my toast and honey with a few extras.

I felt relaxed at U Paasha, i was a little concerned booking a hotel on the busy strip of seminyak but all the rooms are a set far enough back that nothing can be heard. Our room was right at the far end so we couldnt hear a sound other than the storms we got at night.

The roof top pool was fantastic and again no noise from the main strip could be heard so it made ur afternoon peaceful with an enjoyable cocktail or two. If i was to really think hard of a complaint it would be the depth of the pool, but thats only because i like to dive in. I would certainly recommend this to anyone and i certainly would stay here again without a doubt. Its a shame my week has gone so fast.

U Paasha, keep up the great work with fabulous smiles. Good work guys.

Gary.",U Paasha Seminyak
903,Fantastic!,50,March 2019,Everything was great!! Staff were extremely friendly and we felt so welcomed. Location was great and right in the heart of Seminyak. Room was very big and spacious. Will definitely be back again!! :) thanks for everything!,U Paasha Seminyak
904,Great Hotel with amazing staff ❤️,50,March 2019,"We stayed here for five nights and we enjoyed every moment. Upon checking in we had a problem with our room and the GM Brendan resolved the situation and went over and beyond by giving us an upgrade to an amazing spacious room with beautiful views of the water.

We loved everything about this hotel. It’s conveniently located near Seminyak Square with plenty of shops, restaurants and nightlife you need to have an unforgettable time.

They have a huge rooftop swimming pool with a restaurant where they have Buffet Dinners 3 nights a week at a fantastic price.

The breakfast here is a must with fast and friendly service and delicious food that is sure to satisfy.

Compliments to Bredan and the entire staff for making us feel at home!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND",U Paasha Seminyak
905,What a pleasant stay here,40,March 2019,"Love this place. This is a very clean and nice hotel to stay at. Friendly’s and polite’s stuffs here. Will I come here again? Yes, I will definitely come again. One bad thing: tried their BBQ buffet, so much room to improve though. Other than that, nothing much to complaints at this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
906,"Great location, delightful staff",50,March 2019,"Would definately stay @ UPasha again, amazing staff , The location is great
Beautifully diverse ans varied bfast was included ...Thank you team @ UPasha
Thank you Rika by the pool for your lovely chats and also it was delightful to meet the GM Brendan",U Paasha Seminyak
907,"convenient, excellent breakfast buffet",50,March 2019,"First of all, loved that it's right smack along the main street for shopping, restaurants, etc. Easy to get a taxi. Across the hotel is a mini mart which also has a money changer kiosk inside!

Second, the breakfast buffet was just great! I loved their iced mochaccino, which I had a glass of every breakfast. And I'm not even really a coffee-drinker!

Third, the rooftop pool was amazing. We ventured out 8am on a Saturday and there wasn't any person swimming in the pool, but us! Everyone was still asleep I guess!

Fourth, more importantly, the front desk accommodated freezing my multiple ice packs, which I use for my cooler. I was pumping milk to bring back home to my baby the entire trip, and there was no freezer in the room's mini fridge. The front desk was very helpful and kind in keeping my ice packs frozen for me overnight, ready for use the next day.

Will definitely stay here again next time!",U Paasha Seminyak
908,Wonderful stay,50,March 2019,I had a wonderful stay here for 3d2n with my friend in 2. Staff is friendly and helpful . The pool is nice. Breakfast having lots of choice . The door of the room is not soft close. It bang very hard when close.,U Paasha Seminyak
909,Great place to relax in Seminyak,50,March 2019,"This is our second time in Upasha and it's still the best. Great place to relax in the heart of Seminyak. Convenient to many places like ku de ta, potato head, bambu and many more awesome places. Staff were really friendly and constantly checked if we were doing ok. A+ for hospitality!
The rooms were really modern and chic we were planning to remodel our house after it!
Thank you for having us and we will definitely be back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
910,Fantastic,50,March 2019,"The hotel was very clean, spacious rooms, excellent service and breakfast. Couldn’t fault them. Staff went out of their way to help. Location was perfect. We were on the 5th floor and it was very quiet, pool was lovely.",U Paasha Seminyak
911,Restaurants Galore,40,March 2019,"We love the Upaasha in Seminyak because Of its location. Close walk to the beach, lots of Fab eateries within walking distance. Miss all the Kuta/Legian traffic 😂Winning. Rooms are huge, Staff ver attentive, always smiling.",U Paasha Seminyak
912,Always an amazing experience to stay at U Paasha,50,March 2019,Been couple times staying at U Paasha. Always great experience in everything except the last one we had problem with check in as the room was not ready when we arrived but Hotel Management handled it well.,U Paasha Seminyak
913,Great,40,March 2019,"Overall clean room, comfortable bed,
fantastic location - easy to get to along the Main Street full of restaurants, great fast service, delicious drinks by the pool, little bit noisy outside from the villa partying next door but apart from that everything was great",U Paasha Seminyak
914,Surrounded by best restaurants & shopping close to beach great Boutique Hotel,50,February 2019,"Great position, best staff & Brendan the manager very friendly & welcoming. Great Boutique hotel large rooms, great roof top pool, beautiful all day breakfast, with late check in late check out great for those 11.00pm flights. Been staying here since t opening 5 years ago, never disappointed. You will also find the friendliest cocktail maker ""Gida"" at pool bar for sunset drinks.",U Paasha Seminyak
915,U PAASHA SEMINYAK,50,February 2019,This is a fantastic place to stay. The staff are very professional. The room was clean and large. The breakfast was fantastic. The rooftop restaurant and Pool Was fabulous. Highly Recommend. The gym was great.,U Paasha Seminyak
916,"Ok hotel, marvellous location",30,June 2018,"Booked a family room with balcony and as requested we want a quite room. So we got this room further back which was great. Until we open the window and we can see pile of trash as our room view. There is an empty lot on the ground floor that are being used to dump trash place. Unpleasant view. So we closed the curtain most of the time and we never open our balcony door.

Pro: strategic location, great rooftop pool. Great staff.

Cons: Hotel bathroom can use some improvement. Towel hanger is so high up there. Can’t reach it. Can’t use it. I am 5’7” and hardly can hang my towel there, left alone the kids. Separate bathroom and shower room is great. But somehow you know that someone is doing his or her business because you can just smell it once you entered the room. They have this open modern concept room.",U Paasha Seminyak
917,Great Spot,40,October 2018,Loved the pool area on the top level - made for some gorgeous sunsets. Staff were attentive without being in your face - rooms and beds were clean and comfortable. We didn't have any meals here - mainly as we were out and about exploring most of the time.,U Paasha Seminyak
918,Amazing 5 star stay at U passsha,50,March 2019,"Fresh, clean, great breakfast, room service included with breakfast, restaurant great, roof top pool fantastic, reception staff amazing for my birthday I got free lunch drink & late check out very happy",U Paasha Seminyak
919,Great hotel and location,50,March 2019,"This hotel is in a great location surrounded by bars and restaurants. Can walk every where without it being too far. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very spacious and modern. Staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. I would highly recommend and stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
920,Excellent Location In The Heart Of Seminyak,40,March 2019,"Modern & clean hotel conveniently located on one of Seminyak’s main streets. Would make for a great base if you’re exploring Seminyak for a few days as it’s a stone’s throw from heaps of restaurants and spas. We had a surprise visitor in the form of a lizard one night and the housekeeping staff were quick to arrive and get rid of it. The hotel runs on a 24 hour check-in basis (you check into the room after the previous occupant checks out), which can be either good or bad - for us, they wanted us to check in at 5.30pm when we arrived earlier that afternoon, which didn’t seem very reasonable (especially for a weary traveller who’s gotten off a long flight). We managed to get them to give us another room, thankfully. The toilet also smelled a little bit funky but apart from that, it was a relatively good stay 👍🏻",U Paasha Seminyak
921,In the heart of Seminyak - an unforgettable stay,50,May 2018,"Our room was clean, modern and spacious and had everything we needed. Was larger than most giving us plenty of space with two sinks and a modern power shower.

The hotels reception area is really breath taking and is a great space in itself.

The location of this hotel is fantastic, you can walk to anywhere it really is in the heart of Seminyak. There are so many restaurants bars and shops within a short walk this is the ideal base to explore Bali.

We had room and breakfast and the breakfast was amazing. We also often ate by the roof top pool which was more expensive than eating locally but not overpriced.

For its location the hotel was quiet and we felt very safe their. The hotel security always helped get a cab if needed.

the staff were helpful when booking transfers (we went over to Gilli T for a few days - highly recommended!)

I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel and hope to back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
922,Excellent hotel in the heart of seminyak,50,March 2019,"Stayed here a few times in the past, and it has always been lovely. Rooms are spacious and clean, all the staff are warm and helpful, pool is great and don't get me started on the location, at the center of seminyak - everything is there!
Superb value and will come again",U Paasha Seminyak
923,Home away from home,50,March 2019,"There is no place like this hotel, from the food and drink, to the personal and friendly service, the clean and spacious rooms to that incredible rooftop pool, this place is hard to fault. Apparently my 7th visit to upaasha now, refuse to stay anywhere else.",U Paasha Seminyak
924,Pretty much perfect for my quick visit,50,March 2019,"A boutique, modern oasis right in the middle of Seminyak. A welcoming reception, a vintage Aperol Spritz bar, and a relatively generous breakfast offering are some key highlights.
Importantly, the relatively large rooftop pool and sun beds provide prefect place to relax away from the friendly hustle and bustle of ‘eat’ st.
Position perfect and warm and friendly staff made a really good stay great!",U Paasha Seminyak
925,Wonderful hotel with spacious rooms on a great location but above all with great staff.,50,February 2019,"Wonderful hotel with spacious rooms on a great location but above all with great staff.
Don't miss the breakfast and the pool on the roof. In a busy area you find rest in this Hotel.
Nice restaurants in the neighbourhood and in walking distance from the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
926,Friendly quick getaway,40,March 2019,"Enjoyed our stay. All staff including GM genuinely greeted and provided us with friendly service.
Location was fantastic walking distance to all places we were interested in. Large clean rooms and lovely amenities provided as well as stocked mini bar",U Paasha Seminyak

We found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly and always try and go that extra bit to make sure you are happy.",U Paasha Seminyak
928,Love this hotel!,50,March 2019,"This was my third stay at UPaasha. Best location, awesome rooftop area and pool with views of the ocean and volcano in the distance. Staff are so lovely and friendly and the rooms are really spacious. 10/10 would recommend",U Paasha Seminyak
929,Best place on the Seminyak strip,50,March 2019,One word is describe U Paaaha - AMAZING! Staff are beyond friendly and helpful; amazing architecture and decor; convenient location; and very clean. Breakfast was delicious with different options daily.,U Paasha Seminyak
930,Going to Seminyak? Stay here.,50,February 2019,"I stay at U Paasha whenever i’m In Seminyak. Not only is it’s location unbeatable, but the facilities are great and the staff are wonderful.
I can not recommend it highly enough.
24 hour check in/out and amazing buffet breakfast.",U Paasha Seminyak
931,"Great location, great staff.",50,February 2019,"We had a 3 night stay recently and had a great time. The views from the Rooftop bar to see the sunsets were amazing. Great rooms, breakfast was yummy and the staff are excellent!! Shout out to both Duty Manager Gusti who assisted us when we had a slight issue with aircon and Brendan, General Manager who made the effort to introduce himself us and made us feel very welcome.",U Paasha Seminyak
932,Another fabulous stay at this gem in Seminyak!,50,February 2019,"Second stay at the hotel, we loved it so much on a short stopover that we came back for 2 weeks this year. The hotel is ideally located in Seminyak amongst all the restaurants, bars and shops and is a ten minute walk to the beach.
We had a room on the 5th floor with a view of the resort. Our family had a room on the other side of the 5th floor with sea view. The room was large and well appointed and kept immaculately clean by Kam and the room attendants. Couldn’t fault it!
Check in and check out was expertly managed by Cindy, very helpful and professional. You have the room in 24 hour intervals from your check in time which is excellent.
Breakfast was in the Alcove Restaurant and there was enormous choice - egg station (poached, scrambled, boiled, fried, omelette); cooked breakfast; Asian breakfast; fruit; continental; waffles and pancakes cooked to order. Team at breakfast always friendly, interested in the guests and happy to advise about the hotel and local area. Special mention to Sumari and Gunna.
Pool area is lovely, warm pool, comfortable beds and 360 degree views. Pool drinks and snacks are reasonably priced and the team were always friendly and helpful. Especially Rika, Rini and Gede who always went above any beyond and genuinely remembered guests who had visited before. Also do try the BBQ it is fantastic, chefs do a brilliant job of meat, lobster and fresh food. Sunset happy hour cocktails were our favourite!
We can’t rate the team highly enough, it was lovely to see the same faces on our second visit, a credit to the hotel. People asked why were we staying two weeks in the same place whilst in Bali? The answer, quality, location and the genuine warm reception. Will be back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
933,Very pleasant stay,50,March 2019,"The U Paasha is a very friendly and well maintained resort. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Lots of shopping bars and restaurants close by.

The roof top pool and bar are very pleasant. The breakfasts are very good

Very nice that you can stay late if you have a late leaving flight.

This is a good choice if you are not bothered about being in a beach front location",U Paasha Seminyak
934,We LOVE U Paasha,50,March 2019,"This was our 5th stay at U Paasha (I think). We make at least 2 trips to Bali each year and we have tried our fare share of accommodation - from budget right through to high-end and we can’t seem to go past U Paasha. The location is perfect if you’re wanting to be close to good food, shops, bars, coffee, beach clubs, I could go on. The rooms are always clean and get refreshed each day. The rooftop pool is a huge draw card for us and they offer happy hour each day from 5-7pm. They have free bike hire which we take full advantage of and often take this option to ride to Potato Head instead of taking a cab or walking. The buffet breakfast offers everything you could want - fruit, pastries, hot breakfast, cereal and muesli, salads, asian options, waffles and most importantly, great coffee. The staff are very accommodating and attentive and we couldn’t rate them highly enough. We try and bring family and friends to Bali each time, just to show them how great it is and they always check into U Paasha too and love it.

Thanks again for a great stay, U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
935,"Location, friendly staff, great rooftop pool!",50,February 2019,"We stayed here in mid-February for 3 nights before moving to a beachside hotel in Kuta. Transfer from airport and a smooth check-in was a great start to our stay. The hotel is on Eat Street in THE PERFECT location! Our room 101 was on the ground floor (same as Lobby) so right near the restaurant for breakfast - which I might add was abundant in what was on offer - and so many choices! Our room was very spacious with a huge shower and all the amenities you could want. Bed and pillows extremely comfy. A lift takes you to the rooftop pool deck or you can use the open staircase for those, like me, who don't like lifts. The pool is the same depth throughout so would suit those who aren't confident in the water and has wide shallow steps so is very safe to enter and exit. Plenty of sun lounges too and great food to be had poolside. From the pool deck there are amazing views over the surrounding area including great sea views. The staff were so friendly everywhere throughout the hotel. The new Aussie General Manager Brendan, made time to stop and say hello a couple of times during our stay and I observed him do this with others as well - very thoughtful. Out the front of the hotel is a little silver retro caravan serving great cocktails and food where we often sat to have a pre-dinner drink before heading to tea. A short walk takes you to the Seminyak Village/Square shopping area. The hotel is surrounded by top restaurants/bars/cafes AND lots of shops. There is a mini-mart directly across from hotel - very handy. I would 100% recommend this hotel without question. On a side note, I mentioned in my survey to the hotel following our stay, that it would be a great idea to have an iron and ironing board in each room. Well I received a follow-up email yesterday from the GM advising that they have placed their first order and will be rolling them out to every room over the next few months. How about that!",U Paasha Seminyak
936,Good location but can do with a renovation,30,January 2019,"Location and the rooftop pool are its strongest attributes. Has a lot of bars, restaurants, convenience stores and massage joints (Kimberly spa) around. A neat little sports bar next door (Nirvana). The hotel in itself is not too noisy or busy and the staff is helpful and polite. The rooftop pool is also very relaxing and has a lot of day beds and there was never an instance where i struggled to find a place to chill. They also do an unlimited bbq deal at the rooftop restaurant on some nights which was good value for money.
The breakfast was good with western and indonesian options however do not expect the spread and quality you would from a 5 star hotel.
The rooms are large but aging. The AC in my first room did not work well on the first night and the taps in the shower were old and rusty with a little bit of an off smell. I asked to move rooms and the second room was better on all fronts, however i think the hotel could do with renovating some of its rooms. I was also told that i would be transferred to one of the renovated rooms on the third night but no one followed up and i made peace with the room since i did not want to continue changing rooms.
Overall, if you are not spending too much time in the room, this a quiet boutique hotel in a great location. My rating would have been 4 if it was not for the aging property and my first night experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
937,More than expected!,50,February 2019,"Great breakfast, location, wonderful pool and wonderful people who go out of their way to accommodate your every need. Be sure to bring a converter if you have an iPhone being that there are none at the hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
938,Excellent Again,50,February 2019,"Our 5th or 6th stay at Upaasha. Fantastic location on 'Eat Street"". Staff were excellent as usual. The little food van/bar out the front is a perfect addition. Nice to sit out there for a pre-dinner drink and watch the world go by. We met the new GM Brendan who was proactive and keen to receive feedback about his Hotel. (always a good thing). Our room (524) had received a recent minor renovation which was welcomed as we noticed the upholstered bedheads and furniture was starting to look a bit tired/stained after our last stay. Room was fresh and clean. Great Hotel in a Great location. We will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
939,Always good to be back,50,February 2019,"I have stayed in U Paasha many times since it opens. One just can't go wrong with this hotel, unless one needs direct beach access. The team has been consistantly helpful and friendly over the years and the rooms are spacious and well maintained!

If you need a great value for money hotel, without compromising quality, U Paasha Seminyak should for sure be one of your top choices.",U Paasha Seminyak
940,Chill fest,50,February 2019,"Lovely hotel just a short walk from the beach, Motel Mexicola, Mrs Sippy and other great venues. Pool is divine, and the staff are very attentive especially by the pool side. Good sunbeds, they even have sunscreen for you to use! Breakfast was delicious, pancakes and waffles to order as well as a selection of pastries and fruit juices oh and iced coffee which was sooo good. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat.",U Paasha Seminyak
941,Great time in Bali (UPAASHA HOTEL SEMINYAK),50,February 2019,We enjoyed our stay it was not long enough we will be back the staff were excellent and the food was great it was very relaxing we will definitely go back to the UPAASHA HOTEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE 5star,U Paasha Seminyak
942,Best hotel in my life,50,February 2019,"Prices where about 80 euro a room. Thats really cheap compare to other similar hotel nearby.
Even i stay before at 5 star hotels. This 4 star hotel is better. Staf is very friendly as well. 10 out of 10",U Paasha Seminyak
943,Short but stunning,50,February 2019,"My wife and I stayed at the U Paasha Seminyak for only 1 night before we moved to our private villa.

The hotel was great, the staff were welcoming and nothing was too hard for them. The most amazing offering from this hotel is that you get to enjoy the room for 24 hours which allows you to check in and check out at the time you please.

After being showed to our room and settling in, the reception phoned up to ensure we were comfortable or if there were any issues.

Upon checking in we were also provided 2 complimentary drinks to be used either up on the roof top or the 2 bars downstairs.

The pool was on the rooftop and whilst there was no natural shade the umbrellas were sufficient and provided the covering you need whilst swimming.

The breakfast was also great with all the normal buffet options. You also have the chance to order ala Carte from the egg chefs directly in front of you.

Thanks again Upaasha and you will be at the top of our recommendations to friends.",U Paasha Seminyak
944,Amazing stay!,50,February 2019,"We had an amazing stay. The hotel and rooms where super clean. Hotel staff where amazing, there was nothing they wouldn’t do for you. It’s in a great location in the heart of eat street. With a legitimate money changer across the road. The rooftop pool and bar are fantastic, great cocktails with great sunset views. The rooms are large and spacious, and cleaned daily. The security staff at front of hotel where so wonderful, helping us cross the road and getting us a bluebird taxi. We will definitely be back.",U Paasha Seminyak

946,"FANTASTIC LOCATION, GREAT STAFF, LARGE ROOMS.",40,January 2019,"Enjoyed a girls trip. We booked 5 rooms and twin share. Rooms are very large and modern. Bathrooms are large but it would be better not to have gaps on the glass doors in the toilets. (No major issue).
The staff are amazing. Brendan (Manager) has some amazing staff. They are so friendly, happy and helpful.
The location is fantastic. Across the road from Mimi-mart. Lots of massage places walking distance. 5 min walk to Seminyak Square. You can walk to Seminyak Markets (8mins). Walk to Alila Resort for sunset cocktails and Mrs Sippy. Walk to Chandi, Ginger Moon, Char Char Bar & Grill. It is the absolute perfect location. Minor issue that some of our friends had was the air conditioner was not working well. This was the only disappointing issue, problem was solved when they moved room.s
Thank you so much everyone for making my birthday a very special one.",U Paasha Seminyak
947,U Paasha Seminyak Amazing,50,February 2019,4th time to Bali bit 1st time staying at U Paasha. We were so impressed by how friendly & helpful all the staff were. Friendliest staff we've come across. The rooms are very spacious & very clean. Bathrooms are beautiful. Bed & pillows also extremely comfortable. We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast. Food was of a very high standard. We also enjoyed the buffet sunset bbq up on the rooftop. Excellent value for money & once again food quailty excellent & staff so friendly. Location is excellent. Walking distance to all there is to offer in Seminyak.I really could go on & on how fabulous U Paasha is! We will definately be back on our next trip to Bali. Thank you U Paasha.,U Paasha Seminyak
948,Birthday and Valentines week,50,February 2019,"Came for a romantic get away and the U Paasha delivered. It was our first time in Bali so we weren’t familiar with the area and wanted to organise a surprise for my partner, so asked for assistance from a member of the hotel his name was Mr Gusti and he decorated the room with balloons and roses and statues of swans and wrote a msg for my partner with rose petals on the bed. My partner was so surprised and happy. Thank you once again Mr Gusti, Miss Cindy and all the staff of U Paasha for such a memorable weekend.",U Paasha Seminyak
949,GOOD LOCATION IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THE HUSTLE & BUSTLE OF SEMINYAK,30,January 2019,"This was a good Hotel if you want to step out and be in the hustle & bustle of Seminyak. The rooms are a good size and the air conditioning worked well. The Breakfast was Very good and the staff very attentive. The only pool is rooftop and shallow, so the water is luke warm - not refreshing at all.",U Paasha Seminyak
950,Great Stay,50,February 2019,"Wonderful stay at U Paasha, very helpful staff at reception flight was cancelled and moved to next day, went out of their way to accommodate us, breakfast great, rooms clean, look forward to staying again soon. ☺️",U Paasha Seminyak
951,Excellent Property,50,February 2019,"Fast friendly check in by Mantra, GM Brendan is very visable ensuring every thing is perfect. Very big, clean rooms, comfy bed, quality toiletries, fast WiFi, Warm roof top pool, big choice of buffet breakfast, happy hours drinks, best quality bbq dinner cooked fresh on 5th floor watching the Sunset attended to by a very friendly team. Cannot recommend this hotel enough to potential guests. Best all round experience in 23 visits to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
952,5 Stars For GM Brendan and the All day Breakfast Concept,40,February 2019,"Thins hotel benefits from a very hospitable GM Brendan who will go the extra mile for to make things right. The innovative concepts of all day breakfast and 24 room check in-out really deserves praise as a touch of unique experience.

Step out and you are surrounded by great restaurants. We were not aware of its proximity to the beach and only found out after, so we missed the beach completely! Suggestion to management: inform guests of the nearby attractions at check in with a infor kit or a screen display at hotel. These details are missed out. We also stumbled upon Seminyak square by chance. Hotel should not assume guests are familiar with the area and what it offers!

Aircon issues are being sorted; if you are allergic to the heat and humidity, better ask for a room with new AC units well in advance!

Room size is big and there are activities like yoga on select days.

Overall makes a great base for touring Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
953,Really nice place to stay,50,February 2019,"hotel located in central seminyak so it's really easy to get around. the room was large, the buffet breakfast every morning was great and the rooftop pool was great to hang out in especially when storms were approaching. will stay again",U Paasha Seminyak
954,"U ,never go wrong!",50,February 2019,"we always stay in U wherever we travel in south east Asia. we love this brand because they are considerate, especially the 24 hours room usage policy.
U Paasha located right in the middle of the shopping street full of restaurants too, you could just go downstairs do shopping and dining anytime you want, they all open early and close late.
Staff in U Paasha are super kind and helpful, we checked in with Dodi he was super nice and friendly, We had a room change issue and Gang Tia helped us to move luggage with smile and we really appreciated their profession.
Breakfast was nice too, all the staff they always carry smile on their faces, especially Wiji she was extremely friendly and sweet. my family and I like her so much!
food was good, many choices and you can always make your own selection of eggs and they will deliver to your table.
The only thing we would like U Paasha to improve is having a NON SMOKING pool, it will make some differences.
Thank you very much for making our pleasant stay for the whole week.

Cheers.",U Paasha Seminyak
955,Can't find anything bad at all,40,February 2019,"Well prepared breakfast, spacious rooms, nice friendly service, great atmosphere and location, and breakfast can be arranged at any time to boot. Even the GM came personally to dining area to greet us! Only negatives are the slow lifts and faulty air cons in certain rooms (be sure to ask for room with new air con), otherwise everything was near perfect. We'll done and highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
956,Great location,40,February 2019,"We stayed here for 5 nights last week and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a great location surrounded by good restuarants and all you need in the area.
Breakfast was good, only breakfast issue was having to ask 4 times for our coffees 1 morning but was always good otherwise.
The roof top pool is a nice area to relax and escape the s streets. All the staff at the pool were very friendly except for 1 male member that argued and got quite angry when he bought me the wrong drink and i told him i ordered something else. He then realised he was trying to give me the person next to me my drink and no real apology was offered. The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. Our stay here was nice and i would recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
957,Great hotel,40,February 2019,"This hotel was perfect location! Some of the best places to eat within a 10min walk.
The rooftop pool is relaxing and the vibe is exactly what you want on a holiday.
I recommend this property for friends or couples travelling. We got sick last two days which Sucked and was a terrible way to end trip but the hotel helped where they could",U Paasha Seminyak
958,Excellent stay,50,January 2019,"This was our second time staying at U Paasha, Seminyak and it was just as good if not better than our first stay. The friendly staff really made our time there extra special and their attention to detail is excellent. We really loved the breakfast buffet every morning and also the beautiful pool. We will definitely be returning to this Hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
959,We will be back!!,50,December 2018,"My partner and I spent a week at Upaasha and loved every minute. The breakfast was beautiful (all you could want) and the rooftop pool was so relaxing with the best views of Seminyak beach. The hotel is the best location (everything at your door) and so clean! We felt so spoilt every day as the staff are absolutely amazing. We cannot thank them enough. We made a beautiful friend, Tya who is more than accommodating for all your needs. They offer some amazing activities ie. cocktail making/events and we booked for the lovely Xmas eve dinner which made our stay even more special! Highly recommend!",U Paasha Seminyak
960,4.7 out of 5,50,January 2019,"On the main street headingnl down to the resorts you would think that this hotel would have issues with noise from the street and surrounding restaurants - but as soon as you enter the open foyer, the noise just dissappears.
The rooms are large (they used to be apartments); comfortable bed; coffee can be brewed; no bath but a large shower. Balcony has a small clothes dryer which came in handy for drying out togs; pool gets the sun all day so is warm. The breakfast buffet was one of the best - and there is a barista to take your coffee order. But the aspect that sets U Paasha apart from all the other hotels we have stayed at over the past 35 days is the staff. Professional? Yes. Helpful? Incredibly. But also great to have conversations with - they were all wonderfully friendly.
Oh ... and when they (the staff) promise you something - such as complimentary transport - they keep their word without having to be reminded",U Paasha Seminyak
961,Amazing stay,50,January 2019,"We booked this hotel based on location & how the photos looked & are so impressed!! The staff are so kind & amazingly happy. The lady at the reception (Cindy) found out it was my wife’s birthday & had the room decorated with rose petals & cake for our return that day. So kind. The hotel is in a fantastic location on ‘eat street’ too. Great rooftop pool & bar. Great modern rooms, great staff, great price, great location.",U Paasha Seminyak
962,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!",50,January 2019,"We found out that we booked the U Paasha through a dodgy agent that cancelled our reservation a few days before arriving. That could have potentially ruined our holiday and NYE celebrations, but the GM Brendan didn’t let that happen... even though the hotel was fully booked, Brendan let us use the pool, found a temporary room to use to get ready for the NYE party and organized a lift back to another hotel later. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and the staff including Gede were amazingly. We will definitely stay here when we come back to Bali!",U Paasha Seminyak
963,Recommended!,40,January 2019,"Stayed our first four nights in Bali at U Paasha and was really satisfied.

Quick and good check in even though we arrived at midnight.

Very spacious and clean room. Maybe the shower and toilet could use a bit of refreshment, but overall the room was really nice.

The rooftop is where you spend time if you’re at the hotel during the day and it was super nice. Clean and fresh, a really nice view and super friendly staff that takes care of you.

Big thanks to Brendan and his staff, 10/10 in hospitality!",U Paasha Seminyak
964,New Years Holiday,50,January 2019,"Our 3rd visit to U Paasha and our 1st holiday to Bali in January.
Weather- clear skies and little to no rain.
Food- Yummy at all venues visited.
The Stay has been beyond amazing, the service of the staff and management at U Paasha has been exceptional, big shout-out to Manager Brendan for your hospitality.
Yes we would recommend staying at the UPaasha and looking forward to our next visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
965,Amazing and Stylish Hot,50,May 2018,"I am a great fan of all the U resorts Hotels and U Paasha does not disappoint .Great Facilities ,stylish and big room in the center of Seminyak .Breakfast was delicious as expected in any of the U Hotels .I must say that I was very impressed by the Front Desk Manager that was very friendly and professional .Thanks you for an amazing stay .",U Paasha Seminyak
966,"Great hotel, lovely staff & well situated",50,January 2019,"U paasha is great hotel in the Seminyak area of Bali. The location is great for all Seminyak has to offer, shopping, restaurants, beach clubs and beach. The service is fantastic and all of the staff were so helpful and friendly. Great rooftop pool with awesome ocean views and nice cocktail menu. The included breakfast is also a great bonus. We will be staying here again for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
967,Decline in quality since last visit,30,January 2019,"We were here 2 years ago when the hotel was new and had a great stay as per last review.

However, upon returning to expect the same experience a few things were disappointing:
- As mentioned by other travellers aircon does not work very well and it is constantly warm and humid
- Wifi horrendous. Very slow and doesn't load basic pages - we had to hot spot using mobile data for emails
- Not much hot water after a few minutes
- Bathroom and toilet has mould and water damage, the drain in the toilet was blocked upon check in so the floors stayed wet after house keeping must have hosed it down
- Small details that we had on our last stay were missed: no bath robes, no floor towel and bath items missing
- Breakfast quality drastically declined. The last stay we had the buffet breakfast for 8 mornings but for this stay there was limited choice and the quality wasn't as good.

For the price I would say staying at Ize Hotel few doors down is almost the same but 25% cheaper so long as you don't mind the bar noise/get a quiet room.",U Paasha Seminyak
968,Awesome 360 rooftop views of fireworks on new years eve,30,January 2019,"Positives:
-This hotel is centrally located
- It is close to alot of good restaurants
- The staff are very attentive
- The rooms are spacious
- if you miss breakfast, you can always order it anytime before 11pm

The down sides are :
- that the air-conditioning doesn't always work and you wake up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.
- the bathrooms are a bit smelly
- no fresh juices for breakfast",U Paasha Seminyak
969,"Would highly recommend the U Paasha, great service, great staff and very clean and spacious.",50,December 2018,"This was our first visit to Bali with other family members and we could not have been more delighted with the U Paasha hotel. Right from the get go the staff and management could have not made us feel more welcome. The rooms were very spacious, modern and exceptionally clean and included a well stocked fridge, a good selection of tea and coffee,a safe and a very good wifi signal and air conditioning. There was an amazing choice of food for breakfast, a great rooftop barbecue and delicious meals in the restaurant. The staff were second to none, always helpful, friendly and very cheery and played a big part in making our holiday a success. The hotel is ideally located for shops/bars/restaurants and walking distance to the beach. We will definitely stay there on our next visit. Tom and Anne, Scotland.",U Paasha Seminyak
970,"Clean, Spacious and Modern",50,November 2018,"We loved U Paasha Seminyak and would go back there if we're back at Seminyak! Service was 10/10, cleanliness was 10/10 and the hotel design was modern and super cozy. Highly, highly recommended to anyone visiting seminyak for its value and location :)",U Paasha Seminyak
971,Can’t go wrong with this choice!,50,December 2018,"We deliberately chose to stay in Seminyak to experience the restaurants and shopping with ease without having to make our way there each day without going through traffic. We weren’t disappointed!

The rooms are a good size, bright and spacious.

The Rooftop pool offers fantastic views of the ocean ( and Mt Agung) and is a great place to rest from the nearby shopping and watch sunset.

Compliments to the new Hotel GM Brendan, who greeted us and chatted with guests. His team are friendly and efficient, always happy to help and offer assistance.

Upaasha met the brief and then some! Great staff, great rooms, great food!

All in all a great experience and we will return again and again.",U Paasha Seminyak
972,Great service,50,December 2018,"We stayed only a short time but really impressed by the friendly and very helpful staff. Excellent location with fab eating and shopping at the doorstep. Breakfast was fantastic, everything included, and nice to see the hotel winning an ocean conservancy award.",U Paasha Seminyak
973,Relaxing stay,50,December 2018,We stayed at the U Paasha Seminyak for 3 nights. The room was spacious and well maintained. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was good and the coffee was excellent. The pool was a nice place to just hang out and relax. Wifi is on the weaker side. We enjoyed our stay there and look forward to coming back.,U Paasha Seminyak
974,A lovely reprieve from the hustle of Seminyak,50,December 2018,"Biggest rooms I’ve ever had for a ‘standard room’ in a hotel, I think every room is a suite. Styling is spot on, the cement walls and floors so stylish, the furniture and fittings down to the gorgeous jasmine soap are thoughtful. The reception is stunning, the staff so welcoming, the buffet breakfast outstanding and location unbeatable. The rooftop pool is fun, a little shallow for my liking but a nice space, getting shade can be challenging. Seminyak is busy, the roads are busy the place is packed, this is a pleasant reprieve from all the hustle and hassle of street life. I’m totally happy I found this hotel, it’s a phenomenal deal for the price.",U Paasha Seminyak
975,"Great stay, well run hotel in great location.",40,December 2018,"This hotel is classy, clean and well run. Great location great breakfast, lovely staff and nice big rooms. Wish they had a full balcony but can’t have everything. Yoshinoya downstairs attached to hotel-so yum. Roof top pool nice but this time of year could be slightly cooler, hair conditioner needs to be included in toiletries but facilities, amenities and service very good.",U Paasha Seminyak
976,Quality hotel with super quality staff,50,December 2018,"What a wonderful hotel, brilliant hotel in fantastic location with lots of quality restaurants nearby. The staff are what make this hotel special, from the security staff at the front gate who are always polite and accommodating to the staff at the front desk who will bend over backwards to make your stay's special, the breakfast staff who cannot do enough to make the food presentable and yummy to the bar staff around the pool who will have a joke with you and will never stop bringing the unlimited drinks poolside. Nothing is too much trouble to the staff here. They are to be commended on their customer service. A two week stay for us left a big impression, congratulations for your hospitable approach and warmth, big thank you to Gede and Galan (poolside), Rika for her beautiful personality, Bimbi for her gorgeous nature and wonderful help, Chandra for her worldy approach to hospitality and to Brendan the hotel Manager for making our stay perfect, what a focused and well appointed man for the job.",U Paasha Seminyak
977,Lovely hotel in a fantastic location.,50,December 2018,This hotel is an oasis in Seminyak. It is located in the heart of the shopping district with a multitude of great restaurants all within easy walking distance. The rooftop pool is a welcome and relaxing reprieve away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Would definitely stay there again.,U Paasha Seminyak
978,Excellent experience,50,December 2018,"The hotel is clean and modern, located in the heart of Seminyak, generous parking slot, clean and spacious room, the hall also wide, good food, and there’s Yoshinoya on the ground floor, great hospitality",U Paasha Seminyak
979,Great Place to Stay in the Heart of Seminyak,50,December 2018,"The location was just perfect, the staffs were polite and helpful. My room was super big compared to the other room occupied by my parents. The only thing disturbing was the noise from the road since my room was facing the road. Definitely will come back and very recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
980,awesome hotel and rooftop pool!,50,December 2018,"it was our honeymoon trip, and decided to stay at u paasha. wonderful welcome from frontdesk and very comfortable room , big bed, nice sofa and if you go to the rooftop you can spend a lot of time here.. love the pool ...",U Paasha Seminyak
981,"You really MUST stay To fully understand how good, unique and special this Hotel is, it’s too hard too put in words",50,December 2018,"I can not even begin to tell you how amazing this hotel is!! You just have to book it... go.... and experience it for yourself but I will share a few things from my experience... as I literally have too many to list... so I will condense it...

** Booking was easy and correspondence was prompt and very helpful, easy and you could tell that the person on the other end of the email was genuinely trying there upmost to ensure they would get everything right for your stay

** Prior to arrival I had asked for some help to make it special.... as we were visitor birthday celebrations with our family who we had not seen for many years.... I was blown away with the attention to detail.... upon arrival to the rooms....

**At check in .... we were tended too by a lovely fellow who’s name escapes me... and I feel terrible for this .... anyway on checking in however this young man remembers who we are!! From 7 months prior when we had gone to look around the hotel and see the rooms, he was the young man who showed us around.... when we asked to view rooms and the hotel ... with no prior arrangement and with no hesitation he gave us a tour of the amazing hotel and he remembered US.... I think this is phenomenal and excellent customer service considering how many guests must stay during that time frame...

** Reaching the room.... we were shown to our rooms and on arrival they were even better than I remembered .... balloons, flowers and a birthday cake awaited us.... along with exceptionally clean, shower, toilets and wash hands basins, well looked after and comfortable chair and lounge, and massive bed that was super comfortable!! I never sleep well in hotels, but I really struggled to get up out of bed at UPaasha As it was so comfortable

** The food.... the really important stuff...
WOW.... so much choice, so good, tastey I had too much choice... that’s my only complaint....

My favourite meal of the day had to be breakfast .... it was amazing so much too offer and changed daily so not like many other hotels where it’s the same every day... and I have to mention especially “Guna” one of many amazing members of the UPaasha restaurant team was always there with a smile and greeting us with genuine kindness and sincerity, he also went over and above to help ensure our needs were met.... and we were not in any way fussy .... he just genuinely wants to make sure all the guests get the best service and feel like they are in a home from home .... he remembered our names, and for me it’s the little things like that that make your experience one to remember.... he got us water, pots of tea, the perfect coffee
But most of all he was funny, light hearted and sincere, every member of staff makes you feel welcome I can’t remember everyone but you are all amazing!!

** The Rooftop Bar/Pool
Well this area is like a beach club.... your very own private beach club... the staff here are all fabulous, again making sure your well looked after, customers are made to feel genuinely cared for, keeping us hydrated, sunscreen if we needed it, food when we wanted, were we wanted, what an amazing place to watch the sunset, relax by the pool, get to meet other guests if you wanted too... we met a very special humble young man called Gede... he was full of life, funny, chatty, he gave us lots of advice of things to see and do, he was there every day to greet us, made sure we had our drinks, our lunch/dinner, sunscreen and kept the humour going and brought guests together with his contagious personality, we wanted to go to the rooftop bar daily to catch up with him, he is hardworking and always doing his job, but also making sure your enjoying you day, without disturbing you... that takes skill! Gede and all the team by the rooftop bring happiness and fun to the whole experience.....Again I can’t remember everyone’s names... but you can go to the rooftop to relax and be sure you will be looked after.... and if you want to have fun and a chat, and meet other guests this is the place to go.

We got to know Gede and I can honestly say.... he is selfless with a massive heart, and I’m so grateful for all that he does, at UPaasha as again the attention to detail and guests experience he puts every other person first and genuinely wants people to be happy and enjoy there stay at UPaasha.... I can’t wait to come back to catch up with Gede and the team on the rooftop!!

Lastly but by no means least... Brendan the amazing UPaasha manager...
Iv never stayed in a hotel were the manager takes the time to meet and greet all the guests daily, speaks to everyone, comes and has a chat, wants to make sure your enjoying your stay, wants to find out about how your finding the experience. I know in wasn’t the only guest at the hotel.... but Brendan certainly made us feel appreciated, sincerely cared about, and most welcome....

what a humble, genuinely caring person... I was blown away by how much you appreciated and loved your job.... you have an amazing team",U Paasha Seminyak
982,All smiles at U Paasha!,50,November 2018,"We had a wonderful 7 nights at U Paasha hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We loved the views from the rooftop pool and spent a lot of time relaxing sipping cocktails! The rooms were really clean, the location was excellent and only a short walk from the beach and lots of restaurants. Would definitely come back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
983,Simply the Best!,50,November 2018,"Even though we stayed in this hotel for one night, yet it gave us an amazing experience.Pros - Room, Location, Buffet Breakfast, Free Drinks, Hotel Service, StaffsCons - Faced a little hiccup with the billing of the car that we rented from hotel but it was sorted out after explaining to them.",U Paasha Seminyak
984,Third visit,30,November 2018,"After a somewhat disappointing experience in 2017 I returned in 2018 for a 3rd visit after a personal invitation. Even with the discount I was a bit hesitant but General Manager Daniel Kerr wanted the hotel to get a chance to redeem itself.

Unfortunatly U Paasha only somewhat convince. Check-in was friendly but ended abruptly in a ""Your room is not ready in an hour..."" When I returned the reception insisted to bring my luggage to the room, but used 30 minutes to complete a task I could have used 4 minutes to do myself. I was given a personal internet code which did not work and had to contact the reception to activate it. Next morning the staff come around the breakfast tables to take coffee/tea orders, but forget to deliver. All in all small issues, but together significant alarm signs of what I've seen from former favourite hotels.

Cleaning was spotless and exellent, but I feel somewhat snubbed from an sunset view as I felt my 321 view from 2017 was way better than the 503 from 2018,

To conclude: My personal experience of the service quality is that it has declined - even with the perspective of a guest returning personally invited by the general manager.

If you can get a higher odd number at the 3rd floor it will be better than a smaller number at the 5th floor - and you will avoid the strange add-on for a higher room.",U Paasha Seminyak
985,Charming boutique hotel close to Seminyak Square with great amenities,50,November 2018,"Only stayed overnight at their suite room, and it was beyond my expectation. The suite room was really huge! Very comfortable beds, nice hot shower. Toilet and bath are separate. The rooftop pool is very clean and calming. Buffet spread is great and super worth it! Will definitely come back again. Thanks, U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
986,Exceptional service!,50,December 2018,Amenities and staff were superb and beyond our expectations. Room was clean and modern (we are actually considering to model our home like the room). The hotel was also kind enough to accede to our special request for our anniversary. Will come back!,U Paasha Seminyak
987,"Nice hotel in a good location, but be aware of traffic in evening",40,December 2017,"We thought the hotel was nice a mid-range hotel with central location. The staff was attentive and friendly during check-in and other interactions. We really liked the breakfast buffet and thought it had enough variety with decent service by staff. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The room did have a little wear like a red stain or splatter on the mirror, which was a little concerning. Due to a busy schedule we only had an hour to hangout at the pool and found the lounge chairs nearly full.

Overall the hotels location has pros and cons. It is located on the main street in Seminyak with many restaurants. However, we also found that in the evening taking a taxi would often take 15 minutes to get to a main road and walking was often just as fast or faster. We could not find shortcuts to get out of the main traffic jam. One evening it took nearly an hour to go from Kuta to Seminyak. Kuta’s traffic was by far worse. In the morning and middle of the day traffic was pretty smooth and our driver got out of Seminyak fairly quickly.",U Paasha Seminyak
988,Fantastic hotel in a great location!,50,November 2018,This was our first time to Seminyak but found the location of this hotel perfect for exploring all of the great restaurants and bars. The rooftop pool was really big with plenty of sun lounges. Large spacious room and bathroom with big comfy beds. Only feedback would be to upgrade the towels as they are getting a bit worn. The service and friendliness of the staff was a standout for us. We will be back!,U Paasha Seminyak
989,6-star service!,50,November 2018,"My wife & I just returned from an excellent trip to Bali & kudos mostly to the staff in general but most significantly Bimbi & Eka! It seemed like they went out of their way to accomodate our needs in almost all aspects but I strongly feel that this is just part & parcel of their normal routine(s). The hotel itself is also above average in terms of amenities & the location couldn’t be better. I have to add that I’ve not encountered another hotel that’s so accomodating in every which way & when we experienced a relatively insignificant problem one morning, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a follow-up, in terms of an apology & an assurance of a non repeat of the problem, details of which are unimportant. There’s no doubt that we will return to U Paasha when we go back to Bali, in spite of the numerous properties available in Seminyak alone & its primarily because of the quality service! But to be fair in my assessment/review of the hotel, two main things come to mind: breakfast spread could be a bit better - not enough variety & reception area (lobby) could well do with some ceiling fans. The lobby area does feel like a sauna on a hot day! Anyway, we were generally satisfied with our stay & we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
990,Excellent trip made better by exceptional accomodation.,50,November 2018,"Absolute fantastic hotel, in the best part of Bali. The staff at U Paasha are fantastic, very friendly and really make sure that your having a fantastic time. The rooms are clean and have everything that you need. The pool is excellent with staff always there to assist with food and drinks. The breakfast buffet is excellent as well. The front desk staff were very helpful in assisting me when my flights were altered and needed to source other accomodation in another county, just going above and beyond which I really appreciated. Will be back for sure. Thanks to all at U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
991,Great hotel in the heart of seminyak,50,November 2018,"Fantastic hotel with great staff and a beautiful roof top pool. Hotel is ideally located within walking distance of all the best spots in Seminyak. Hotel does feel and look a little older and worn out than in the photos, however the place is clean and tidy. Breakfasts are fantastic buffet and the rooftop cafe has great food too. Would recommend this place and happily return!",U Paasha Seminyak
992,Great hotel and lovely staff!,40,November 2018,"Staff were extremely friendly, happy and helpful (including the fantastic security who always welcomed you as you entered/exited the hotel). The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to great eateries and shopping with a Mini Mart across the road and a chemist 2 minutes away. Nice, clean and well maintained rooftop pool. Decent buffet breakfast. A little mould in the shower but I suppose you can’t do much about that given the climate/humidity in Bali. Overall, we had a great experience and would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
993,Great Hotel.,50,November 2018,Perfect location to all the great restaurants and shopping. Delicious breakfasts and very friendly staff. I always enjoy my visits to Upaasha. Rooftop pool is a favourite and sun or shade all day. Would highly recommend.,U Paasha Seminyak
994,Perfect hotel for a girls trip,50,November 2018,"I came to Bali with a friend for our birthdays. We chose U Paasha for the pool (which confirmed, is amazing!) and were pleasantly surprised throughout our whole stay. The breakfast is amazing!!!!! We found ourselves eating 2-3 plates and skipping lunch. The pool area is beautiful and a nice spot to watch the sunset. The staff is so friendly and attentive! This place is a gem and would 100% stay at again!",U Paasha Seminyak
995,"Excellent hotel, great location and good value.",50,November 2018,"This is the most enjoyable hotel I have stayed at in Bali.

Recomended for travellers from Europe,with late arrival flight, because they offer 24 hour stay, super useful.",U Paasha Seminyak
997,Potential,40,October 2018,"Great location and pool area ; hotel could make more of this with more proactive service ie offers of orders for food and drink . Room spacious, clean and efficiently serviced. Robes and on occasion towels a little worn and need replacing.",U Paasha Seminyak
998,My experience,50,November 2018,"Everything was amazing - the rooms were so good, the pool was amazing service and the staff were amazing.If I could say one area for improvement would be thw gym .. a lot of people use it... could it be improved by any chance or extended?Would love that if more machine options .. ta",U Paasha Seminyak
999,"Lovely location, superb breakfast",50,October 2018,"I stayed there 3 nights and it was an excellent stay. Its location, staff and service were great. My room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was superb with lots of varieties. Roof top swimming pool was an incredible place to lay and relax for hours. I really loved this hotel. Thanks",U Paasha Seminyak
1000,"Great location, clean and comfortable hotel",50,October 2018,"Weve stayed here 4 times now and love the experiance every time.

1001,Great Location & Excellent Staff,40,November 2018,Very helpful staff and located right in the heart of Seminyak. Their staff makes staying there relaxing. They have a simple breakfast buffet but the chef that is manning the station where you can have your eggs cooked is pretty good.,U Paasha Seminyak
1002,Love U Paasha. Highly recommend!,50,October 2018,"Hubby and I have stayed here twice before this recent stay and we love the place more and more.

After our first week in Nusa Dua moving to U Paasha was the best thing we did to enjoy our final week after a big family wedding.

We picked U Paasha for many reasons, mainly the location and the Hotel itself and its set up. We’ve always been satisfied with our stay here so why not bring the whole family to experience it too haha.. and they absolutely loved it!

The food at U Paasha is so good!! From breakfast to lunch so amazing!! The roof top BBQ nights were amazing too.. must do!

If you don’t want to sit in traffic and worry about catching taxi’s to get around U Paasha is the hotel to stay at, the location is perfect! You walk out and everything is right there.. I mean everything! From different restaurants, cafes, bars, boutiques, other shops for shopping, mini marts and also different massage places.

The staff are always so accommodating and welcoming, nothing is ever too much or difficult to handle for the beautiful team here at the U Paasha.

From arriving to checking in, our entire stay until check out, The entire team in all departments were just amazing, including the security guards at the front who were always smiling and stopped traffic for us to cross the road safely..what legends!

Special mention to the beautiful Devi at the front desk, her customer service was seriously the best we’ve received anywhere we’ve travelled too. She was welcoming, professional and always went above and beyond to help us during our stay.

My sister in law was in hospital and I needed help with documents that our insurance company required, I reached out to Devi for some help and she assisted us with no hesitation, she helped us get what we needed done quickly and we’re so grateful.

Thank you for everything Devi xx

We met Giddy too, what a awesome guy! Our family become attached to him lol.. always good laughs poolside during happy hour with Giddy, his sense of humour and jokes was fun.

Was awesome we got to meet the GM Brendan, We’d seen Brendan around during the day working hard like everyone else there, not realising he was the GM until he came over to say hello to our family and introduced himself.

What a awesome GM leading by example and being out and about not just for his team but all his guests, thank you for making our family feel right at home Brendan, you and your team made our family holiday the best one we’ve had so far.

Thank you again U Paasha see you guys again soon xx",U Paasha Seminyak
1003,Nice location,50,October 2018,"Love the place so much, love the friendly staffs, love the swimming pool with nice sky view, love the breakfast and dinner. Surrounded with many nice cafes. A place where you can relax peacefully. There is a room 527, aircon is not strong and requested for Fan but it didn’t send to the room. And we requested 2 rooms with all king size bed but turn out my room was 2 doublebed join together. And my kid have to sleep in the Centre with a line. Can improve on this.

1007,An amazing hotel find in the heart of Seminyak!,50,October 2018,"We have always wanted to stay in the heart of Seminyak, amongst all of the shops and the yummy restaurants and the location of U Paasha did not disappoint. There was an added bonus of a rooftop pool which meant there was sun all day and a spot for a beautiful sunset each afternoon / night! We could not fault the service we received from all of the staff and were so impressed with the size and luxury of our room. We are especially thankful for one staff member in particular - Gede, who is the star of the rooftop pool. His energy and positivity is infectious and we loved going up each day to have a chat! Thank you again, we will be recommending U Paasha to our wedding guests for when we return for our wedding next year :). X",U Paasha Seminyak
1008,Best Value Hotel In Seminyak,40,April 2018,"This is such a great hotel.

For the price you pay, it has everything you need. I have stayed here at least 8 times.

The rooms are HUGE with plenty of space, international Tv and a nice bathroom with double sinks. There is no bath but a huge shower. Not too much privacy but enough.

The rooftop pool is one of my favourites in Seminyak. Sun all day. People around. Lovely staff. Good food. Good drinks. It’s big clean and lots of sun chairs.

The location is one of the best. Right on the Main Street, eat street, surrounded by shops restaurants clubs and pretty much everything you need in Bali.

The staff are lovely and accommodating. The buffet breakfast is great and I have stayed at this hotel at least 8 times from when it first opened to this year in April.

I’d you can’t afford mad prices like $500 a night, Definitely stay at this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1009,Always delivers,50,October 2018,"5th stay at U Paasha, however it was first time with family... It is seen more as an adults only place, however my children were more than welcomed and really enjoyed the stay.

Cannot speak highly enough of management and staff to make our trip memorable especially after a few teething issues with our room on arrival.

Rooms are spacious, clean, modern and comfortable.

Roof top pool and views are amazing... can spend(actually did spend) many an hour or two just lying in the pool with no worries in the world. What makes it more attractive is the happy hour 2 for 1 at 5pm - 7pm.

Buffet breakfast is great and caters to all needs and also kid friendly. The staff always make you feel welcomed and go out of their way to assist you.

Will visit again and family too!",U Paasha Seminyak
1010,5 star + awesome,50,October 2018,"Stayed here for 12 nights for our honeymoon.. on arrival staff where so welcoming . Love the check in check out policy allowed us to shower etc before getting on our night flight. Room was very spacious biggest room I’ve stayed in in Bali and staff had made love sign out of rose petals .. was a lovely touch. Situation is excellent we walked everywhere, restaurants at your door step kudeta 10 mins one way .. potato head 15 mins the other and motel mexicola one of our favourites right in the middle . Gym was great supplied enough basic equipment plus towels air con and filtered water.. the highlight would be the rooftop pool .. watching sunset from there best view in Seminyak. Staff gede and Krystna were awesome always happy to help find a bed or get you food and drinks nothing was too much of an issue and made the day fun. Although the pool was busy could always get a bed with plenty of sun or shade if needed. The new manager Brendan went out of his way to meet and greet guests and get to know them which made the holiday very personal . Have stayed in a few accommodation places in my time in Bali but this is the best so far .. highly recommend and can’t wait to come back missing Bali already ( home a day )",U Paasha Seminyak
1011,Very very good!,50,October 2018,"So good location, lovely breakfast nice staff. Anyway we spent there our honeymoon and didnt get any greetings, thats not so nice...but despite this hotel itself is worth the money you pay. We also enjoyed Japanese restaurant Youkushima near hotel. Good price and nice food . Try it!",U Paasha Seminyak
1012,Great location,50,September 2018,Staff were incredibly welcoming and accommodating. The hotel is situated in a perfect location with lots of shops and restaurants nearby and it’s very easy and cheap to hire a scooter from the hotel for longer distance trips. No faults with the room or breakfast - both were fantastic. There’s also a great rooftop pool. Highly recommend!,U Paasha Seminyak
1013,tracey,50,October 2018,"Excellent place, good price great location, loved it.. can't want for our next Bali experience.Money for value, food and service excellent. loved the rooftop pool, gym good room service great. food excellent.",U Paasha Seminyak

1015,Amazing location and lovely staff!,40,October 2018,We stayed here for a week in October with our two children under 2. The rooms were a great size and they still felt very spacious even with two cots in the room. We ate a buffet style breakfast every morning in the restaurant and the staff were great with our little ones. The breakfast choices are endless! We had a great holiday here and loved that we didn’t have to walk far with our children to the many restaurants and shops.,U Paasha Seminyak
1016,Fabulous,50,October 2018,"We had a great 4 day stay here! Given there are so many Hotels, and villas in Bali it is really hard to choose. U Paasha is in the popular Eat Street and shopping district and near Seminyak Square. So many restaurants and about a 5-10 min walk to the beach area. Massage places just across the road. Breakfast wasn’t a huge choice if this is what you are used to but it certainly is enough, juices, coffee, cereal, toast, pastries, hot food to go with freshly made eggs and fruit. Pool area is lovely with pool/bar service. Staff are wonderful. There is a small gym. Hotel staff are very accommodating- soaps and lotions are replaced every day if needed. I asked for some fresh milk and new waters and they were brought to our room. Staff lovely. Overall we wouldn’t normally stay in a Hotel but we after leaving here to move on to a noisier big Resort in Nusa Dua, definitely U Paasha is our better choice. We loved it and Seminyak. Thanks U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1017,"Great Location, great room.",50,October 2018,"U Paasha was a great hotel. We only stayed for two nights but was perfect for what we needed. room was really lovely, clean and spacious. Great breakfast selection and was really nice. The rooftop pool was very nice and relaxing. We were not there in high season but even then all of the sunbeds were always full. we always managed to get one, but I imagine it would be harder if you are there when it is busier. Would stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1018,Right in the Heart of Seminyak,50,October 2018,Great for both family and couplesMassive bedroom and bathroomRoof top pool was great as you got a breeze during the day to cool offBreakfast was amazingRight in the heart of street life and shopping but quiet as wellWell priced and not to far from the beach,U Paasha Seminyak
1019,Fantastic location and great hotel,50,October 2018,"Close to good restaurants and spa's.Excellent hotel, friendly and helpful staff, big, clean rooms and comfy king size bed.The rooftop pool and bar/restaurant were a real oasis on a hot afternoon.Second stay here and will be back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1020,Best stay!,50,October 2018,We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon and we were so overwhelmed with how incredible U Paasha was. The buffet breakfast was incredible. Room was amazing! Rooftop bar and pool seriously unbelievable! All the staff were so nice and lovely. Could not recommend this place enough!,U Paasha Seminyak
1021,Holiday,30,October 2018,Issues with the Internet. Pool was shallow didn’t expect that hard to do laps due to that . Good location to shops.Airconditioner seemed to be noisy especially at night. Fans should be supplied .The security staff downstairs assisted with crossing the road was very much appreciated.,U Paasha Seminyak
1022,Fantastic stay at UPaasha,50,October 2018,"My friend and I stayed here for 6 nights in October and couldn’t have been happier with the hotel. It’s in the perfect location in Seminyak, right in the middle of the action and we were able to walk everywhere we needed to get to. Rooms were huge, spotlessly clean and very quiet! And the bed was amazing - so big and comfortable. The breakfast was awesome too. But orobably the best thing about the hotel is the rooftop pool! It was gorgeous! We didn’t bother with beach clubs during our stay because the rooftop was so good. Staff were also very friendly and attentive. I don’t have a single criticism of the hotel - I’d highly recommend UPaasha to anyone travelling to Bali and will definitely be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1023,Nice escape from busy Seminyak,40,October 2018,Great pool and good facilities for the location. Easy to forget you were in the busiest part of Seminyak at times! Driving there during peak traffic can be difficult as the street is very busy. Pool was great.,U Paasha Seminyak
1024,Hidden Gem,50,October 2018,"I have been reluctant to review this place for fear of it becoming mobbed. However the time has come to share. I have never stayed at this hotel but I frequent the rooftop bar and pool to watch the amazing sunsets. The staff are wonderful and welcoming, the views are awesome, no crowds to contend with and just an amazing place to escape the Seminyak streets below. They have happy hour in the afternoon (two for one) and their Mojitos are the best in Seminyak. This time I had the pleasure of having a buffet dinner there. We were spoilt for choice and to say the food was amazing would be an understatement. I had no idea you could participate in the buffet if you weren't a guest of the hotel but you can and if your in Seminyak you should. Like I said I have kept this hidden gem to myself but truly check this place out you won't be disappointed.",U Paasha Seminyak
1025,Perfect location,50,October 2018,"Great location comfortable and spacious rooms. Nice rooftop pool and sunset views. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I can’t fault it, great value for money . 10 minutes walk to the beach and all the best restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1026,Perfection in the heart of Seminyak,50,October 2018,We had such a great time. Room great. Food unbelievable and room and staff amazing. This property exceeded all our expectations and the management is professional and very friendly. We will be back. Already raved at a party today about how great this place is. I am desperate to return!,U Paasha Seminyak
1027,easy to go to semynyak downtown,40,October 2018,"Also it's 24 hours check-out system allows more flexible schedule during your stay in seminyak. The room was pretty clean, but the bathroom/showerroom door was not in a good condition. The breakfast was pretty good too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1028,Great location & great staff,40,September 2018,"Great location and fantastic staff. The only issue we had was the cleanliness of the room towels, they had stains. We really enjoyed our stay here, the breakfast was amazing and we were in the centre of Seminyak! Can’t recommend enough.",U Paasha Seminyak
1029,Improve Cleaning Staff and I’ll give 5/5,40,October 2018,"Came and stayed here for 10 nights.

CHECK IN
Check in was a little slow. We were told to leave our bags and they’d bring them up whilst we were served at the front desk. Despite arriving at 5pm our room still wasn’t ready and we had to wait 30mins until we were able to go to the room. We were however offered a complimentary drink at the rooftop bar while waited.

LOBBY
The lobby is open plan and very welcoming. Blends the outdoors with modern architecture and goes straight onto the main street.

ROOM
It is massive!!! Two sofas, plenty of chairs and places to put your bags. We were lucky enough to have a room facing the sunset each evening which was spectacular; the sky is so red!! Unfortunately the air con stopped working one night and wouldn’t turn on so we woke up in puddles of sweat until it was fixed the next day. Welcome fruit bowl also a nice touch.

BED
Super comfy and HUGE!! Lovely soft pillows. They changed the sheets and bedding once during our 10 night stay.

BATHROOM
His and her sink is a very nice addition! Unfortunately the workmanship in the build of the bathroom isn’t great. Shower is a little rough round the edges, grout lines missing, couple broken tiles and the shower head keeps falling out its holder where a bodge job has been done of screwing it to the riser. One light bulb was out so it was kind of dark. But think this is quite common for most accommodation in Bali, Gili etc. Very spacious and love the style of the decor though.

DINING
Nice varied selection of American, Asian, European-continental choices at breakfast. Eggs and pancakes cooked to order. Very good strong fresh coffee as part of the buffet. All the staff were very friendly and were accommodating to me asking for omelettes to be made of just egg whites. Never tried the Japanese fast food place below the hotel. But did try the rooftop food by the pool and it was fairly good: chips and satay sticks.

POOL
Nice sized pool with plenty of sun loungers that get the sun all day right up till sunset. Service round the pool for drinks and food is very good.

GYM
The gym has a machine Bench Press, Pull down, cable Row, leg Extension, Leg Curl all in one multigym. Dumbbells go up to 20kg, an adjustable Bench and there’s a couple cardio machines. Not too bad and decent enough for a full body circuit.

SERVICE
Cleaning services was quite poor, on more than four occasions they had taken away our towels and emptied bins. Never restocked toilet paper and we had to chase reception for more and same with teabags and complimentary water.

The receptionist was helpful in booking us a day excursion to Nusa Penida and a boat to Gili Trawangan. Both services they booked us were very good and came within 15-20mins of the stated time to collect us from the hotel.

LOCATION
Location is excellent! Very close to all the fantastic food places, cafes and close by to Sisterfields, Seminyak Village and Square, Ku De Ta, Potato, Mrs Sippy and La Favela.

MISC
Toilets by the pool and under the lobby reception were very clean and cool in temperature.

NEGATIVES
Slightly odd smell of sewage in the corridors when you come out your room.

Cleaning staff not doing a thorough clean of bedroom, leaving bins unemptied, taking towels and not supplying new in their place. All very irritating things that must be right! If a Travelodge in England, plus very standard hotels or even the 2/3 star resort we stayed at in Gili T can manage it then I don’t see why a 4/5 star that’s £100-200 a night can’t!

OVERALL
I’d highly recommend U Paasha and would most certainly stay here again as location, rooms and rooftop are wonderful. If they improved their cleaning of rooms and made sure the staff had a tick list of duties so they don’t forget to replenish towels, water, emptying bins etc. That would bring it up to a 5/5 for me.",U Paasha Seminyak
1030,"Fantastic location, rooms, pool and more!",50,October 2018,"Beautiful big rooms with huge comfy bed. Location right in centre of eat street with amazing restaurants within walking distance. Hotel itself is clean, not over crowded and has great pool on top floor with lovely views and delicious cocktails and juices. Great place to stay, highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
1031,A TRULY DELIGHTFUL 5* HOTEL WITH A ROOFTOP POOL TO RIVAL THE BEACHCLUBS!,50,September 2018,"5* This hotel was a delight - from the open and beautifully decorated lobby, through to the well-appointed, stylish and very comfortable rooms, to the ultimate gem which is the stunning rooftop pool. The views are amazing from the roof and, despite the hotel being located in the centre of the action, it’s utterly quiet and peaceful up there. The pool area has such a nice vibe that we spent several of our ten days there and we saved a fortune by going to the beach clubs less than we thought we would. The breakfast is wonderful, with excellent coffee and food choices. The staff were amazing – super warm, friendly and helpful. Right outside the hotel are multiple, excellent restaurants. My only criticism is that they allow smoking in the lobby, otherwise my partner and I LOVED this hotel and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it or return.",U Paasha Seminyak
1032,We Loved U Paasha,50,October 2018,"Had a fabulous stay at this hotel in the centre of Seminyak. The rooms were very, very spacious, well appointed and had everything you need.
The rooftop pool was beautiful, plenty of sunlounges and very peaceful. Breakfasts fresh with lots of choices.
Thank you to the General Manager, Brendan who found a room for us so we could stay an extra night. We met him at breakfast checking on the guests, that says it all.!",U Paasha Seminyak

1034,Great visit,50,October 2018,We stayed for four nights and the staff were friendly & accommodating. Breakfasts are beautiful & the Chef was happy to cook me any GF alternatives.

Breakfast was yum and lots of choices. We lay by the roof top pool every day and never had any issues getting sun beds. Our friends who were travelling with us had an issue with their air conditioning but the staff were very prompt in dealing with the issue and moved her to a room when the issue couldn’t be fixed right away. Great location if you enjoy being right in the buzz of Seminyak",U Paasha Seminyak

1039,Such a great spot!,40,October 2018,"Brilliant location for all the restaurant action of Bali! Right in the heart of ‘Eat St’, I was worried it would be noisy but we couldn’t hear a thing and slept beautifully!
Best thing besides the, gorgeous spacious clean rooms and the rooftop pool was the breakfast! Wow! My husband and I have been to Bali 12 times and the choice available and quality was right up there with the best! Everything is made fresh and Maguna ( the Executive Chef) runs an amazingly smooth operation, nothing is too much trouble. The coffees and choices available is ‘Melbourne’ Standard ( we are very fussy), excellent barista! My husband is gluten intolerant and the chef ensured a brilliant alternative and choice every day! Thank you U-Paasha you have far exceeded my expectations. Superb!",U Paasha Seminyak
1040,"Good location, service and cleanliness!",50,October 2018,"Stayed here for 2 night. This hotel is value for money. The staffs are really friendly.

1049,Great value for money at U Paasha,40,September 2018,"U Paasha is an excellent 4 star hotel option for Seminyak.
The rooms are modern and very large. We stayed for 2 and half weeks and we had more than enough room to be comfortable. Huge super-king bed which was great.

We paid extra for the 'room with a view' on the 5th floor which I strongly recommend. The view from the 5th floor facing the beach is fantastic. There are no view obstructions, just one story villas and palm trees. You can also see a fair bit of ocean which is amazing considering the hotel's distance from the beach.Since we had such a great view, our extended stay was very comfortable. The balcony doors open two thirds of the wall making an amazing into/outdoor feel that you can pull the two day beds out to. Sunset view from the balcony is also excellent. You can even sun bake from the day bed in your room which is very unique for a hotel.

The rooftop pool is excellent, very modern. Never had any issue getting a sun bed. Prices for food and drink at the pool at reasonable. Happy hour 2 for 1 on the rooftop from 5-7pm is also excellent. They allowed us to buy drinks on the rooftop and take them down to our room. We asked for strong cocktails and they made great ones (often cocktails in Bali can be hit and miss).

The location is extremely convenient if you are going to be walking around Bali. Plenty of restaurants and shops extremely close. I hate walking so I loved that we never had to walk very far to get anywhere.

It is a hotel as opposed to a resort. I like the hotel style as it is more boutique, less people, better service. I also like not having to walk very far from the elevator to my room, breakfast, pool etc. I think the hotel is more suited to couples as children would probably benefit from a resort with more space to run around.

Service at the hotel was excellent. Very satisfied. Staff are lovely. Proper Australian coffee at breakfast.

The only downside I experienced is the faint Bali sewage smell which sometimes wafted out through the toilet. This was not all the time, only sometimes and it was faint and not a deal breaker. We bought incense sticks which covered the smell nicely. I wouldn't let this issue turn you off the hotel, it was only minor but obviously an on going problem that the hotel tries to manage as best as they can.

Overall. I think this is an excellent value for money option if you wish to stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1050,Great hotel in a perfect spot,50,September 2018,"Have stayed here for 4 years. Great staff, great amenities and wonderful service. As for the location perfect. I could not fault the staff or the food. The roof top pool is wonderful place to relax and meet people.",U Paasha Seminyak
1051,Great Location Lovely Staff Definitely Would Stay Again,50,September 2018,"Loved this hotel very friendly staff location is perfect great rooftop bar, breakfast is excellent would definitely return. Great value for money. The shopping in Seminyak is very good, you do get pestered a fair bit but just ignore them.",U Paasha Seminyak
1052,Excellent stay,50,September 2018,"We really enjoyed our stay here. It’s right in the middle of Eat St, a short walk from our fav’s, Ginger Moon, Ultimo and Sisterfield. Terrific rooftop bar and pool area that catches the breezes. There are plenty of sun beds and shade. Great service for drinks and food. They do roof top buffet bbq’s 3 nights a week. The rooms are really spacious and the breakfast’s with live egg station are fantastic. We will be back for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
1053,Excellent stay in the heart of Seminyak,50,September 2018,We had a great stay at U Paasha. We stayed for a friends wedding on the rooftop and it was exceptional - the decor was perfect and every detail was carefully considered. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a stress free stay and enjoyed the wedding day. The canapes and sunset cocktails were lovely. Bimbi on the front desk was incredibly kind and helpful - her dinner recommendations were brilliant.,U Paasha Seminyak
1054,Another Fabulous Stay,50,September 2018,"Great hotel for couples and mature singles who are wanting a relaxing spot by the rooftopool and right on eats street. THIS IS NOT A CHILD FRIENDLY Hotel - so those with children, please think about this. There are PLENTY of hotels that cater for children and families, so please think twice before you book here with a young family - its not fair on the rest of us who have grown up children and want peace and quite, not little ones pounding the pool boards, yelling and jumping in and out of the pool, yelling and screaming in their excitement of being on holiday - its normal, most of us have had children, but PLEASE this is not a hotel for CHILDREN under 15 years of age.",U Paasha Seminyak
1055,Great location. Cool vibe,40,September 2018,"A friend recommended this hotel as the poor mans W Hotel which I totally agree with. The interior design was beautiful, there’s a rooftop pool with day beds and playing great chill out music. Friendly staff will bring you cocktails and food. The location is great for exploring, shopping and a short walk to the beach. For the price it is a gem.",U Paasha Seminyak
1056,Center of Seminyak,50,September 2018,"You can't find more convenient place than this place. Centrally located, great fecilities and loads of activities surround the erea. It was a bit pricy but really worth it. I saw lots of couples & honeymooners in the hotel",U Paasha Seminyak
1057,Holiday,50,September 2018,"I have been coming to the Upaasha for almost 3 years and its the 4th time staying here. I highly recommend without any hesitation the price, hospitality and service from all staff including Harry the reservation manager to Guna and Rika the hosts and to many others to mention. Mr Daniel Kerr you and your team are doing an outstanding job overservicing your guests. You all are amazing. Upaasha number 1. Thanks for everything and definitely be returning among my other friends as i will keep recommending the Upaasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1058,Not recommended,20,September 2018,"I did not feel comfortable from the 1st time I walked in the room. The room did not smell very nice and the shower was dirty. The toilet got flooded so we asked to move to another room which we did. However the shower was still dirty and the towels were not clean, we always had to ask for new towels. Also the bed sheets had stains so it was not comfortable to sleep in.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, we had an unpleasant stay and the service was not great. They did not even offer to give us anything as an apology of the bad experience we had, we had to ask which I think is very unprofessional.",U Paasha Seminyak
1059,Beautiful haven on the main strip,50,September 2018,"We had a lovely stay at U Paasha. U Paasha organised airport pick up for 250,000 rupiah. We would highly recommend utilising this service as it made arriving effortless! The driver was lovely and offered us coke and water (just what was needed!)

The hotel itself was very beautiful and the rooms great, very modern and spacious. The bed was two singles pushed together (which would be my only con!). The rooftop pool was great, plenty of pool chairs and lots of opportunities for cocktails. WiFi was great the whole time.

The staff were excellent at English and incredibly friendly. We had an issue with the smell in the room when we arrived and that was fixed promptly by staff.

The buffet had a wide range of hot and cold food. You good order pancakes / waffles / egg Benedict and coffees were freshly made by the barista. Perfect!

We loved it here, would highly recommend!! The location alone was 10/10 (walk right onto the main strip).",U Paasha Seminyak
1060,Gorgeous hotel. Excellent service from staff. Great location.,50,September 2018,"Was a little bit hesitant staying here as it’s located on a very busy street in Seminyak, but it came highly recommended from a colleague so I took a chance. And let me tell you, U Paasha did not disappoint! Gorgeous property located right on Eat Street, lots of fantastic restaurants, shops, spa places and bars right at your doorstep. The hotel does not get any of the street noise which is fantastic, as soon as you enter your room, it’s an oasis of calm and serenity. All staff were so friendly and accommodating in every section of the hotel: reception, restaurant, rooftop bar, housekeeping, just everyone, bent over backwards for us, and all with a smile on their face while doing so. Rooms are huge and allowed plenty of room for the two of us to move around freely, did not feel like I was on top or in the way of my roommate at all the 7 days we were here. Bathroom configuration is a little odd: the toilet and shower are two separate cubicles which have their own door, but no main door separating bathroom area from bedroom area, so made it a bit awkward when one of us had to use the toilet as you could hear everything!
Buffet breakfast was delicious, with wait staff being very attentive as soon as you walked into the restaurant area. Rooftop bar and swimming pool were great.
There were a few odd smells lurking in the corridors, this could have been smells from the street wafting in tbh. As far as cleanliness standard goes, this place was CLEAN; housekeeping were very efficient with cleaning our room every morning, we never had to call them to remind them to come make up our room.
I would definitely stay here again when coming back to Seminyak!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1061,Bit tired.. great location . Terrible gym,30,August 2018,"Needs a complete update... great location and great breaky but that’s about it. Need new towels, new gym equipment and a good clean if the gym. The tv channels offered are just enough. Need to get faster internet",U Paasha Seminyak

Great concept of the 24 hour check in/out and the breakfast anywhere/anytime, meaning if you didn't make the buffet you could order off an a la carte menu and say, eat it at the Rooftop restaurant at 4pm. The hotel was very full, but never had any issues with finding a sun lounge. Housekeeping were excellent, room was extremely spacious and very clean.",U Paasha Seminyak
1073,Fantastic Stay,50,August 2018,"Great hotel to stay at, very convenient location, spacious rooms, value for money and we like the 24hr check in/out option.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating on our arrival which was nice after a hectic day of travel.

The hotel is in a very good location in the heart of Seminyak walking distance to many shops and restaurants. Rooftop pool was nice however could get a bit windy at times.
Breakfast was excellent with a large variety of both food and beverage to choose from.

Only downside was some of the furnishings in our room were quite worn and cleanliness could be improved.

If you want to be in the middle of Seminyak we recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1078,First time to Bali,50,August 2018,"This was a good location for a first timer. It's in the center of lots of spas, shops and restaurants. So easy to just walk out the door and explore. They have a nice big breakfast buffet that goes on most of the morning which was a relaxing way to start the day. The pool is on the roof, but is spacious enough and has plently of sun couches etc. I enjoyed the gym which was well equipped for a hotel. A bit if a walk to the beach, maybe 10-15min. This has the feel of a business hotel, the staff were excellent; very friendly, helpful and well spoken. The rooms were spacious, clean and high quality. I would happily return here..",U Paasha Seminyak

We have chosen it for its perfect position in one of the main street of Seminyak.

Expectations were respected.
Our stay was good even if just for one night and during the earthquake which obliged us to evacuate.

Service, Cleanliness, Structure were all positive.

Couple of Suggestion
Suggest to change the Amenty Kit, I would go for a more charming and special samples of shampoo/conditionair etc.

Improve the Bar Tender on the roof-Top, we ordered two Mojitos which were a complete disaster, big ice and no taste at all.

Good Points
Nice the chose of the soap while checking in.
Breakfast is nice and well furnished.
Price is competitive.",U Paasha Seminyak
1089,"Great location, gorgeous staff.",50,August 2018,"We stayed at U pasha for eight days and it was everything you could want. It was across the road from eat street which contains such fabulous restaurants. It is also part of the high end shopping strip as well close to great markets and ex pats locations such as Sisterfields and Kim Soon home. The staff were fantastic, so accomodating and friendly. We had a minor earthquake whilst we were there and the manager promptly reassured us with a personalised note- such service! The breakfasts are brilliant and the location is outstanding.

The service at the hotel was impeccable, the staff were very friendly and quick to respond to any request. The rooms were huge and the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel had a great rooftop pool area. Breakfast lacked some variety however was quite adequate. The hotel I believe is about 4 years old but could do with a bit of a spruce up, particularly in the foyer. All in all, a great location so served our purpose this time in Bali. Good nearby restaurants include Ginger Moon, Batik, Chandi, Ultimo to name a few.",U Paasha Seminyak

The location is great - on eat street, near to all the best cafes and walking distance to many of the best restaurants. The hotel staff make everything very easy, no request was too difficult. I generally dont eat the buffet breakfast in Bali because there are so many good cafes (Cafe Bali is just across the road), however, we had a few early morning activities and tried it and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and coffee. The cost for what you get is the best in Seminyak! This was my third stay at Upaasha and I would highly recommend to anyone!",U Paasha Seminyak

The hotel was really lovely, beautifully done and immaculately clean. We arrived really late but there was a room ready as check in is in 24 hour blocks. The room was huge, modern and had all amenities: fridge, hairdryer, tea and coffee.

Breakfast was amazing, choice of freshly made eggs (scrambled, fried, poached or eggs Benedict), cooked, continental or Asian breakfast.

The rooftop pool area was lovely, relaxing, clean and with great views.

We went to one of the twice weekly BBQs on the rooftop restaurant which was amazing - lobster, meat, veg, traditional Indonesian food. Highly recommend!

Staff were all very helpful and we couldn’t fault them! Very convenient location- in the middle of the two areas we wanted to go to (motel mexicola/potato head on one side and La Plancha/Mama san on the other) both a short walking distance- best to walk everywhere as traffic is terrible. Lots of shopping and massage parlours near the hotel.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star is the towels in the bathroom were worn and you can see the wear and tear in the room. But very good value for money and has great aesthetics.

Would definitely go back!",U Paasha Seminyak

1108,"U Paasha....""Fabulous Gem""",50,July 2018,"My wife and I will only stay in 4-5 star accommodation when overseas.....and this is our 3rd visit to Bali. We chose to stay in a more central location in Seminyak this trip, as we didn't want to hire a motorcycle to get around. U Paasha was the perfect Hotel to fit that requirement. From the moment we arrived, we were pampered the way all guests should be treated. Check-in was very quick and the staff were super efficient. The Hotel decor is very modern and well maintained. Our room was very spacious, spotlessly clean, super comfortable bed and pillows, great cable TV (with English speaking channels), iPod dock, very good air con, 2 x lovely couches.
Make sure you include the daily breakfast.....its 100% worth it! Delicious food with a great selection. The restaurant staff are so nice and offer exceptional quality of service.
The roof top Pool is awesome! (on the 5th floor)....its huge and has plenty of sun lounges. The 360 degree view over looking Seminyak is stunning.
We have absolutely had a wonderful holiday in Bali, which would not of happened had we not stayed at U Paasha. We will be coming back next year and will definitely be coming back to stay at U Paasha!
Thank you to the Management and all the Staff....👌10/10.",U Paasha Seminyak
1109,Wonderful Stay in the heart of Seminyak,50,July 2018,"We visited Bali to celebrate a special occasion and are really happy we chose U Paasha for our stay in Seminyak.
We were in a room on the top floor with a nice view over the Seminyak skyline. The room itself is very spacious and equipped with all the amenities that one would need for a comfortable stay. Moreover, the location of the hotel is one of its greatest plus points. It is in the heart of Seminyak and the major places one would want to visit are within a short walk.
Special thanks to Mr. Daniel, the GM who answered our queries very promptly with regards to our reservation as well as after the sudden eruption of Mount Agung just one week prior to our visit. Also, thanks to all at U Paasha for the added touches that made our celebration truly special.",U Paasha Seminyak

1113,Not a bad start to Bali..,50,July 2018,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for
two nights before heading off on a Bali adventure(Ubud,Gili and Sanur).I organised a airport transfer with the hotel and despite being held up at immigration&our bags taking a long time to appear we were greeted by the driver&all was fine.

Despite arriving late at night check in was simple&straightforward.

The breakfasts are great with a wide choice available.My favourites were the made to order pancakes and waffles.

We did eat dinner at the hotel but popped up to the rooftop bar one evening whilst the BBQ was on and the food did look and smell excellent.

This hotel is in a great location and only a short walk(10mins)to the beach.

When we were leaving I had arranged for a pick up to a hotel in Ubud and after it hadn't turned up I asked a member of the reception team to ring the hotel in Ubud to find out what was happening,he did it without question.

Book here you won't be disappointed..",U Paasha Seminyak

1128,We came back,40,July 2018,"The hotel is clean. Staff are very friendly. Rooftop pool is quiet and calm. Breakfast is absolutely HUGE!! Management is very nice too. 10 minute walk to the beach. 3 of the best dinner we had in Indonesia (Ginger Moon, Chanti and Bali Cafe) are literally across the street. Showers are the best we’ve had so far.

We checked out the afternoon of the eruption. After going out to the airport to sort out our lives, the hotel got us back and at a discounted rate (at least cheaper than originally booked).

I wouldn’t vacation here. But to rest and recoup for a couple nights...I’d definitely come back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1129,Always amazing there,50,June 2018,"Always an amazing stay every time I come. My favourite hotel style accommodation in Seminyak. It’s in the best position, the rooms are amazing, the food, rooftop pool & staff are all second to none.
My third stay there and won’t be my last!",U Paasha Seminyak
1130,Great Spot. Will be back next year,40,June 2018,"Hidden little gem really, and I’m sure the word is out. Great location, basically staggering distance from anywhere, if not a nice walk along shops or short taxi to all the heart of Seminyak. Friendly staff, with Daniel (manager) making himself known both inside and outside of hotel. Keep a lid on this place as don’t want it to become too popular! Lol",U Paasha Seminyak
1131,Excellent location,50,June 2018,"This is our second stay at U Paasha. This time we stayed with many family and friends after a wedding. The location, on the main street with many fantastic restaurants, is excellent. The rooftop pool was a great meeting place, as we relaxed with a cocktail or two.
The younger ones (after hard nights out partying) enjoyed being able to have breakfast in their rooms up until the evening. We also thoroughly enjoyed the special evening rooftop banquet.
The rooms are large and very comfortable. One couple had trouble with the air conditioning, but maintenance attended to it promptly
Thanks to all staff, who were so friendly, and eager to assist . Thanks U Paasha for another great stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1132,"Excellent Location, Great Pool",40,June 2018,"I stayed at U Paasha in June 2018 for 6 nights. I travelled with my 9 year old daughter.

The hotel is in an unbeatable location and for that reason, is always heavily booked. It is right in the middle of ""eat street"". We barely had to get in a taxi. Which is good and bad. Because you have so many restaurants close by, you tend to miss out on those that may be a little further afield and which are also excellent.

When we arrived at 6pm we were advised our room wasn't ready. Which is surprising given the time. At this hotel, the time you check in is the time you check out. So, if you check in at 7pm you don't have to check out until 7pm. Which is handy for Australians who mostly travel home on late flights (1115pm). But not so handy when a lot of guests are checking out late and your room is therefore not cleaned and ready when you arrive at 6pm.

The first room I was put in overlooked a rubbish tip. Literally. I was furious. I don't go on one holiday a year to open my blinds and look at a tip. I requested I be moved and was told I'd have to wait at least another hour for another room to be cleaned. I didn't care as I wasn't going to look over a tip for 6 nights. FYI, that room number was 320. We were moved across the hall to 321 which overlooked some villas and the town generally. Much nicer.

The room is a hotel room - nothing particularly special about it. A King bed, a couch, a small day bed and a balcony only big enough to stand on. No chairs on balconies (too small). The bathroom is an extension of the main bedroom so no door between the two. The toilet and shower do have a frosted glass door though. The sliding mirror doors on the cupboards are in need of an upgrade - there are rust marks on the mirror. There are also no drawers in the cupboard only a couple of shelves. Plenty of hanging space though. The light in the bathroom is muted so I had to apply makeup in the bedroom (more natural light).

The pool area is lovely. The pool is about 25m and there are plenty of lounges. The food and beverage service at the pool is good. Beverages take a VERY long time to arrive for some reason. I mentioned this on my last day when I was dying of thirst and they did offer me a free drink. Prices seem fair for food and beverage. Not expensive but certainly not cheap once taxes are added on as well. They offer a reasonable variety of food and you can make up your own salads which was a popular option.

Breakfast buffet is extensive and good. Service is very good.

I will say the service at this hotel is excellent. We had a faulty fridge and it was replaced within half an hour. Then our air-conditioner seemed to not cool the room and so someone was in our room fixing it within 30mins. They regased it and it seemed to work fine after that. Then the staff phoned me the next day to make sure that it was working well enough. I was very impressed.

The only thing slightly lacking is the cleaning of rooms. Our shower and the sinks in the bathroom remained uncleaned the entire time. There was dirt in the shower from my feet (walking in the pouring rain) from the 2 night of our stay which remained there the entire time. Our sinks had toothpaste all over them and the benches seemed unclean.

I would however definitely recommend staying here if location is what's most important to you. You are literally a 5 min walk to Seminyak Square and a 10-15min walk to the beach near La Lucciola. It's faster to walk than drive there. The traffic is terrible on the streets outside the hotel and even the motorbikes have started to use the footpaths!!

We enjoyed our stay here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1133,Location Location,50,June 2018,"Hotel had a fantastic location close to all restaurants & bars on eat street, wonderful helpful staff, we checked in around 2ish & we checked out same time on departure, loved rooftop pool, spacious rooms, fab breakfast buffet, would definitely recommend & stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1134,BEST SERVICE!,50,June 2018,"I was extremely happy with the service I received at U Paasha in Seminyak.
The hotel was beautiful, in a great location in the centre of all boutique shops.
Our room was spacious, clean and modern.
The check in & check out staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, making us feel at home on a constant basis.
The breakfast was amazing, always offering new menu items everyday.
Would definitely recommend & stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1135,EXCELLENT HOTEL!,50,June 2018,"U Paasha is a great hotel to stay in Seminyak.

The location itself is perfect, with exceptional dining options at its doorstep. The breakfast buffet was great, with attentive staff and very good food.

The best part of this hotel is its 24 hour check in service, which meant that whatever time you checked in, this was the time that you checked out. This was perfect for my group of friends as we had an evening flight and this service helped us to make the most of our last day, allowing us to leave our bags in the room and come back for a quick shower before heading to the airport.

Really a 5 star hotel! I will be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1136,Good location and modern design,40,June 2018,"Good location and value for money, 15 min walk to well known beach clubs eg Potato head. Good service and friendly staff. WiFi also reasonable in speed. Only criticism would be a slow checking in process.

The mirror in our room had stains (almost like paint stains) on but other than that, rooms very nice and nothing a little maintenance wouldn’t resolve

Good rooftop pool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1137,Perfect Location,50,May 2018,"Hotel is an excellent Location on ""Eat Street"". Staff were friendly and obliging, and the breakfast was very good. The amenities were good [lovely rooftop pool] and excellent value for money. Would stay there again",U Paasha Seminyak
1138,Looking forward to next time already,50,June 2018,"Typically one for the real Balinese thatched roof style of stay, we stepped up this time and came across U Paasha. Unassuming from the front but a fantastic hotel. Large rooms, larger bathrooms and really comfortable. Staff were A + at all times and couldn't do enough to help. As for the rooftop pool bar and restaurant, thats a diamond in the rough. High, secluded, beautiful area and amazing sunset views. Only issue we had is we probably need to wait another year before we go back. Definitely recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
1139,We’ll be back!,50,June 2018,"We have just returned from a 9 night stay with friends and we all agreed that this is an excellent hotel. Close to heaps of restaurants, shops, and walking distance to flea markets and beach clubs (ku de ta), the location is perfect. Food is excellent by the pool, build your own salads, yum chicken tenders and bruschetta. The rooftop pool is awesome, staff are friendly and attentive. Gede who works at the pool is a real uplifter, singing songs and teaching secret handshakes and makes everyone feel welcome. What a great employee. Despite being quite full we always were able to find a deck chair. The cocktail list is great and I very much recommend the frozen passion fruit mojito! (Happy hour 2-4-1 from 5-7pm nightly. Breakfast was good, I enjoyed the birchir museli, yoghurt and dried fruits/nuts. but the offerings didn’t really change day to day so we headed across the road to cafe Bali, fat turtle and sisterfields a couple of times to mix things up. The first room we had 316 was tired and had the strong sewerage smell others have mentioned. The staff sprayed the bathroom which helped. It also had a twin bed pushed together with a big gap down the middle rather than king as we had booked. The next day they moved us to 514 and there was no smell and had the correct bedding. We could see the wear and tear on the rooms is variable- 316 seemed to have a hard life but 514 was great. We were located at the back of the hotel which had s terrible view (dumping ground vacant lot) but was quiet. Overall the staff were so friendly and happy to help, we loved the room, location and pool. Other good things include the security at the front stopping traffic to allow safe road crossing and nirvana spa next door for massages! We would certainly stay again. Thanks for a lovely holiday!",U Paasha Seminyak
1140,It was okay but there is room for improvement,30,June 2018,"The foyer of this hotel was grand and beautiful and set the bar high for the hotel.
Unfortunately our room left us unimpressed.
Despite requesting a quiet room we were put very close to the lifts. There was constant noise of people walking past. The door didn’t seal properly so even putting towels down to block the noice didn’t work.
The room was nice and large, with modern decor. However, it was clearly run down and in need of some tlc. The mirror had rusting spots all over it. It looked like something of a crime scene. The bedding was dirty, as were the towels. The shower and toilet were both white and looked very dirty/ stained which was off putting. The toilet didn’t stop running all night but that was drowned out by the noise of the fan / aircon which was extortionately loud and useless. Not to mention that it seemed like the air pumped into our room from 5.30 am was straight from the kitchen because the smell of bacon and eggs permeated our room.
The breakfast selection was very good, even for vegetarians. The pool area was very nice though I question whether some of the people at the pool were even guests of the hotel.
Our other choice was the Ize but we could see that hotel from upaasha and the pool looked very small and shaded in comparison.
The central location was great. We stayed 2 nights.

I believe this once would have been a 5 star rating but the noise of the aircon and the cleanliness of the room was a let down",U Paasha Seminyak
1141,"Great location, fantastic staff but average quality rooms",30,June 2018,"Staff was fantastic but that’s about it really. We had a strong sewage smell coming from our room and the air conditioning was not working during our entire stay. The staff did offer us free transport to our next destination to compensate but still insufficient. Facilities in terms of swimming pool, gym , rooftop bar and breakfast area is great.",U Paasha Seminyak
1142,Relaxing time in Bali,50,May 2018,"We recently needed a break, and decided to stay at the U Paasha hotel in the centre of Seminyak. Great position close to all the good eateries. Great coffee in the street and close to some of the top restaurants in Bali.
The rooms were huge, well appointed and extremely clean. Breakfast was excellent, with a good selection of food. The staff were always friendly and very efficient. The only drawback, was that the air-conditioning fan was a little loud. Other wise I could not fault the hotel. I will definitely be going back next time in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1143,Great hotel in perfect location,50,April 2018,"U Paasha is in the heart of Seminyak square, just a short walk away from cafes and restaurants alike. This is my favourite location to stay within Seminyak. The pool was amazing with lots of sun exposure and more than enough chairs (with umbrellas if needed). The buffet breakfast was extensive and delicious. I recommend this hotel to everyone",U Paasha Seminyak
1144,Good hotel in excellent location,40,May 2018,"Recently had my third or fourth stay at the U Paasha Hotel in Seminyak. The location of this property cannot be beat if you wish to be in the centre of all the great restaurants that Seminyak has to offer.
Check in was fast and efficient although on this visit I was not offered a choice of scented soaps or music. The refresher towel was most welcome though.
I had paid extra for a room with a few and had requested one away from the lift. Our room was directly opposite the lift but it was rear lift which is less used. It was also on the top floor which made it convenient for the pool, rooftop bar and gym.
The room itself smelled musty and was showing obvious signs of wear and tear - much more so than my last stay here. The wardrobe sliding door did not close properly and the sliding door onto the balcony only partially opened before it became jammed. There was also an unpleasant odour coming from the drains in the bathroom which I have not experienced here before. Perhaps my room just had not been used for a while but either way, it was certainly not at the level of comfort & cleanliness that I had enjoyed on previous visits. The linen quality was acceptable but the towels were worn & thinning.
The roof top pool is excellent although staff are very slow to offer drinks or meals and only come to you when beckoned. Otherwise they just stand around chatting under a tree.
The rooftop bar offers excellent views of the surrounding area & fairly good cocktails that are two for the price of one in happy hour. We were not offered the complimentary snacks that I have been offered the last five or six times I have come to the bar for sunset drinks.
The gym is well equipped and clean although there were only two towels for guest to use when I visited which means some people missed out. The equipment is all. modern & in good working order.
Breakfast was ok. It has never been a highlight of the hotel as the offerings are few and often by the time cooked requests (such as eggs) get to your table, they are cold. We ate there on the first morning & went to Sisterfields on the following - happy to pay for a great meal.
I would certainly consider staying here again but I am starting to feel that the price of the hotel is not justified by the decline in the quality of the rooms and the service.",U Paasha Seminyak
1145,Awesome hotel in midst of Seminyak hustle,50,May 2018,"By far, the only hotel that offer 24H check-in/out whereas you can spend more time in your room. Room is considered spacious and clean. Staff are attentive and friendly.
Location is quite central which is near to amenities, mini market, restaurant,cafe.
Recommended for any of you who will stay at Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1146,Great hotel,40,June 2018,Centrally located in eat street Seminyak. Hotel room spacious. Buffet breakfast has a reasonable variety of food. Staff very friendly & efficient. Nothing is too hard for them. The pool is amazing with a great view. Would definitely come back again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1147,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,50,May 2018,"There's so many great things about this hotel, but the best thing has to be that your check out time is dependent on your check in time. So because I arrived at 11pm at night, I didn't have to check out until 11pm on my departure date!! So great!
It's a great hotel, beautiful rooftop area, friendly staff and fantastic location!",U Paasha Seminyak
1148,Fantastic Location,40,May 2018,"Nice clean and tidy hotel located in Seminyak. Very central however no noise issues. Staff was very friendly. Had breakfast included everyday, more than enough options and lovely service. Room was on the 3rd floor, clean and tidy with housekeeping coming every morning to make the bed etc. Used the hotel transfer to and from the airport $20aud each way.",U Paasha Seminyak
1149,"Gorgous hotel, beautiful rooftop pool",50,May 2018,"We booked this hotel mainly due to the photos of the pool and rooms on the web. This hotel has huge rooms that are modern and comfortable. The beds and bedding are so comfortable, I have a bad back and neck and after sleeping on these beds I felt cured! The breakfast buffett is has a huge assortment and changes daily. The food at the rooftop bar and pool area is fantastic. The hotel is located right in the middle of eat street Seminyak, but only a 10 min walk to the beach, which was not nearly as nice as the pool. The staff here are so beautiful, they cant do enough for you we even felt guilty that we were being waited on all the time. I had read other reviews with people saying there was a sewarege smell in the corridors and or rooms but there was no smell when we were there. Do yourself a favour and book this hotel, you wont regret it!",U Paasha Seminyak
1150,amazing hospitality,50,May 2018,"Ms. Chandra is very welcoming, friendly and helpful manager at U Paasha. We faced a problem with our airline and fortunately she was sooo caring and underatanding. Thank you again U Paasha team for your great hospitality!! Great stay 😍",U Paasha Seminyak
1151,2nd stay,40,May 2018,"2nd stay with u paasha. Location is excellent, good for first timers to bali. On both occasions there were some problems with the air conditioning. Insufficient gas this time. Therefore aircon is not consistent. Should maintain it regularly to avoid such problems. Great breakfast and service crews. Sound proofing can be improved as occasionally we can hear guests walking outside our room, but it's not a very big concern.",U Paasha Seminyak
1152,Simply a lovely hotel with great staff,50,May 2018,"Wow ... a lovely mid size hotel in a great location with many good restaurants just nearby.
It so central that you just need to walk to shop or have a good meal. You can also walk to the beach or take taxi ( bluebird company is more reliable) to other places.
The staff are simply fantastic, very friendly and accommodating .... make you feel real welcome. Special thanks to all those who make our stay so memorable,
The rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable. What ever was not refill were
immediately attended to when requested.
The roof top pool is great, you can see the sunset if the weather is good.( Pity we do not have time to try the restaurant up there.
Breakfast was plentiful & varieties, you can choose your coffee instead of just from one pot. They are so flexible, if you miss the buffet breakfast, they will still provide you with al carte ( have not stay in any hotel that have that option)
They even have free refreshing drink ( plain drinking water with lemon and mints ) ready for you after a long day out at the lobby.
Thank again for the great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
1153,Perfect,50,May 2018,"We stayed here for 6 nights. This hotel is a gem in the middle of busy Seminak. We had 2 rooms on the 5th floor which were large, comfortable, clean and quiet (my only criticism would be the view of the rubbish tip - but not the hotels fault considering location). The staff were pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was great. Location is amazing - right in the middle of the Main Street, but we could not hear any noice from our room or the pool top swimming pool (which was also fantastic). I would definitely recommend the food at the roof top pool it was great (potato wedges were lovely). Would definite return for a relaxing holiday in a great location.",U Paasha Seminyak
1154,Will not stay again!,20,May 2018,"Would not waste $240AUD a night on this place, booked for 7 nights, upon arrival our room was filthy, shower looked like it had not been cleaned from previous people, our toilet would not flush for 12hrs (As you could imagine it was not pleasant) They finally come to fix it along with our broken aircon, we have woken up sweating about every second night during our stay as the aircon has crapped itself, they just keep coming to fix. We requested to change rooms but they said no. They’ve had to fix aircon now 4 times over our so far 6 days stay. Up at 630am with the sweats!!! Would not recommend, if something happens while you stay, they do not care. Also don’t like the fact that every single day you have to request a flannel/face towel. Just leave them in the rooms it’s not hard!!! Breakfast is ok. Location is great if you want to be in the centre of Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1155,Amazing service,40,May 2018,"The only reason this hotel didn't get 5 stars is because the room was noisy - whenever the wind blew, the doors to the balcony let out a very loud and unnatural squeak. You can also hear your neighbors through the walls. Apart from that, we had an excellent stay! The service is exceptional here. The front desk often greeted us by name. The breakfast buffet is delicious. They are very accommodating. The rooftop pool and bar is nice too. A great place to spend the day away from the crowds, but in the center of activity if you want it. The location is excellent - very convenient to shopping, restaurants and the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
1156,"Great hotel, awesome staff and food",50,May 2018,"We stayed here the last night of our 2 week holiday. After 10 days diving and chilling on Lembongan it was awesome to have our last night in a Gucci hotel. Staff are first class as was the insane breakfast and the room on the 5th floor was mint.
We will definitly stay here again when back in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1157,Beautiful Hotel,50,May 2018,"Very very nice hotel.we stayed twice on our trip Bali/Gili T Beautiful rooms,(very large and spacious l would say also modern)amazing roof top pool (5th Floor) and views
Close to beach 5-10 min taxi
Thankyou team for arranging our room specially for our 35 wedding anniversary",U Paasha Seminyak
1158,Excellent stay at U Paasha,50,May 2018,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. It was a great experience. The staff is always smiling, pleasant and helpful. The hotel breakfast is available all day (room service after buffer has closed), the location is fantastic in the middle of seminyak if you are there for shopping, food and beach.
It was an overall great experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
1159,"Great location, service and breakfast",50,May 2018,Having this hotel in the centre of Seminyak allows for most parts of town to be easily walkable (no need for taxis or motorbikes!). The rooms are spacious with quality bathrooms. There is no need to go out for breakfast as U Paasha put on a very good spread with both western and Asian options. The rooftop pool provides the necessary cool down after walking around town. I would love to stay here again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1160,Great hotel great location,40,March 2018,Perfect location and the staff made us feel to welcome. Friendly service and great location. A group of us were travelling to Bali and stayed in Seminyak. We were staying close by in a villa and my mother stayed here. The hotel staff made my mother feel so safe and friendly. Caring for her as she travelled alone. Thank you so much,U Paasha Seminyak
1161,Fabulous location and facilities!,50,May 2018,"We recently stayed for 7 nights and could not speak more highly of this fantastic hotel. We have been to Bali 10 times, staying in a variety of mid-range to luxury resorts and for the price, facilities and location this hotel is unbeatable value.

Lovely large rooms with modern décor, clean bathrooms and comfortable beds. Breakfast was delicious, eggs made to order via the notepad left on the table, pancakes/waffles/crepes made to order, great selection of pastries, hot food, cereals, salad, fresh fruit and Asian dishes. The barista made coffee was a great start to the day. The staff were lovely and went out of their way to assist and would clean-up the plates efficiently.

Check-in and check-out was effortless. No queues and very welcoming pleasant staff. The 24 hour check-out was fantastic! I wish every hotel had this. We had checked-in at 6pm so had the room until 6pm on check-out day, which was perfect considering we had a 10:50pm flight back to Sydney.

The rooftop pool and bar is fantastic. Amazing view of the beach, Seminyak surrounds and on a clear day you can see the mountains. Nice breeze and barely any traffic noise, so very relaxing. View of the sunset and lanterns at night is perfect.

Can’t wait to go back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1162,Excellent Stay,50,May 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at U Paasha Seminyak. It was in a great location, the rooms were excellent and very clean. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to my friends. Thanks for a great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak

Will 100% stay here again 😊",U Paasha Seminyak
1164,Everything Works,50,May 2018,"Comfy large room, lovely view, good food, excellent big pool and sundeck. The gym looked good but we didn't have time.
And, importantly, all the staff were wonderfully helpful, smiling and engaging. Especially Eris, the F&B Manager. Couldn't fault our stay. Perfect.",U Paasha Seminyak
1165,Great location,40,May 2018,"The location of U-Paasha is unbeatable, being situated on 'Eat Street' in Seminyak and close to a range of shops and restaurants. The design of the hotel and the décor in the rooms is stunning. The staff are very helpful and were always on hand to assist with any requests or questions. Maintenance was required however, as our room had a small burn on the bed head and the bathroom tiles are getting dirty. Small details like a hand towel and water bottles to brush teeth were missing unfortunately, with our towels also being dirty.",U Paasha Seminyak
1166,The best stay in my life,50,April 2018,"Although it is an hotel and not a villa, the human aspect of the hotel has made it the best stay I had in my life. The 24hour stay policy as well as anywhere anytime breakfast is perfect for us who stay up to early morning 4am and sleep in till 3pm everyday. I love this hotel's policy and also the staff was exceptional in their service. I have nothing to complain about!",U Paasha Seminyak
1167,Great value for money,50,April 2018,"Friendly and attentive staff, great location, nice room and facilities. Close to great restaurants and , great bars. Perfect for the solo traveler. The rooftop pool is a haven from the craziness below.
Overall fantastic value for money",U Paasha Seminyak
1168,NICE STAY IN THE HEART OF SEMINYAK,50,April 2018,"We spend a night in this hotel as part of our trip in Bali. Upon check-in we had a positive surprise as were advised that we can check out same time like our check in. As we had a later afternoon check-in that meant that we could a later check out.

The hotel is in the heart of Seminyak at busy road full of shops and a good selection of some restaurants and bars.

Room was indeed spacious.. and clean with a nice size balcony and huge shower.
Very clean room it is indeed a bit old but overall in good shape.

We liked to roof top pool and bar as you can have a chillout moment with a drink and nice view. As the hotel is situated in front of the busy street we had requested to have a room on the back side on the hotel so we had no issues at all with noise,

Breakfast was ok and included In the room rate.

Overall a good choice for city style hotel in an excellent location",U Paasha Seminyak
1169,"Good stay, just need some maintenance work",40,April 2018,"Room is very nicely decorated in modern minimalist style, excellent location and great service by the staff. Just need some maintenance work for the shower area. Metal parts are quite rusty and water pressure is quite weak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1170,Location is everything,40,April 2018,"Location: Located at the most convenient place in seminyak. Popular restaurants are within walking distance.
Room: Spacious and clean. But no shaver provided. (Not sure they are available at the reception though.)
Breakfast: It is OK.
Service: Helpful staff and helped us book movie tickets.
Pool: Love it! You can catch sunset from the pool. And also, you can have breakfast by the pool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1171,Great hotel! All you need in Seminyak,50,April 2018,Stayed here with my partner for 4 nights. Really big rooms with comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Staff were lovely and always happy to help. Very clean. Breakfast each morning was great. Rooftop pool and bar is perfect with a nice view of the surrounding area. Great location close to the beach and shopping. Don't think there's much more you really need in a hotel,U Paasha Seminyak
1172,Excellent,50,April 2018,"We had 3 nights all up here whilst in transit to and from another island. Would definitely stay again. Room was big with a comfy bed. Location perfect. But the best was the rooftop bar, restaurant and pool. We ate the buffet dinner one night on the rooftop after a day in Ubud and it was so good - the ribs were to die for, we went back for seconds. The view spectacular and the huge pool perfect for cooling off. The staff were friendly and accommodating always with a smile.",U Paasha Seminyak
1173,"Excellent Location, Lovely Stay!",40,March 2018,"We stayed at U Paasha for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our time spent at this hotel. Firstly, the location is as good as it gets. You are smack bang in the centre of EVERYTHING (if this is what you want). We found the location to be very convenient as it's within a short walk of shops, restaurants, bars and so forth. The room was very spacious and nicely appointed. HUGE shower! Service was very good and the staff was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the daily breakfast, particularly the local Indonesian dishes which varied from day to day. Our only hiccup was that we had requested an iron and ironing board via email pre-arrival for the duration of our stay and this disappeared out of our room one day. When we called to have it returned we were informed that another guest was in need of it which meant we were unable to iron our linens for dinner. The front desk quickly rectified the situation and a replacement was dispatched which we had full use of for the remainder of our week. We enjoyed the rooftop pool area very much. Poolside service was excellent. The young lady working the pool area in the mornings was very attentive. One thing worth mentioning- the elevator needs resetting as it hardly gave guests any time at all to get in or out before the doors closed. Interestingly, we joked about this one day to a gentleman in the lift whom we assumed was a guest. Turned out to be the manager on his day off! Overall, a delightful stay. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for your Seminyak stay. Thank you U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1174,"Comforable, convenient and well catered for",50,April 2018,"Spacious rooms in a well located hotel. Great bed, breakfast and rooftop pool/bar. Excellent service.
Our 2nd floor room was starting to show its age a bit (bathroom fittings etc) but on the whole still very good value and very clean & quiet.",U Paasha Seminyak
1175,"Fantastic location, great hotel",50,April 2018,"Best hotel location for Seminyak shopping and eating, big sized rooms, nice and clean and good range of toiletries, breakfast is great and can be had any time from 6am to 11pm which totally works for me. Bit of a smell from the toilet, but that is fairly common in Bali. Food was lovely and decent choice. Drinks and mini bar were reasonably priced. Pool was lovely though only up to 1.1m deep. Great temperature and lots of sunlounges. Seafood buffet was lovely, decent choices and great price. Only thing was the doors to the rooms are very loud when they close and so from 7am or so you can hear them closing along the hallway, which could wake light sleepers.",U Paasha Seminyak
1176,Excellent hotel in the heart of seminyak,50,April 2018,Top hotel in the heart of seminyak. Roof top bar pool and restaurant were very nice. Good hotel standard gym. Room was clean spacious and comfortable. Hotel was a good standard through out with a nice breakfast included,U Paasha Seminyak
1177,Great stay,50,April 2018,"My partner and I stayed at U Paasha in April 2018. Our stay was excellent! The room was spacious and well maintained, the staff were so friendly, the breakfast was delicious and the hotel was in a fantastic location. We look forward to staying at U Paasha again in the near future.",U Paasha Seminyak
1178,Smelly Room,10,April 2018,"Vibe - full of tourist with fair share or bad behaviour. It's embarrassing to see people from our own country behaving in such an appalling manner.

Hotel Room - Mouldy bathroom with smell of sewage. The smell is throughout the corridor at the lobby level.

Rooftop Restaurant - taste blend and overpriced.",U Paasha Seminyak
1179,Great location and pool,40,March 2018,"This hotel is located in the busy Oberoi street in Seminyak. It is good as you can walk to and from lots of restaurants but naturally the traffic in Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is very bad so you can get stuck in a taxi only metres up from the hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. The aircon is effective but quite noisy and seems to be that way throughout all rooms. Beds are very comfy though a light sheet might be better than a thick quilt. The room balconies don’t have furniture or even a seat which makes having a balcony useless. We did book and pay for a balcony however; we haven’t used ours at all which is a shame. The hotel breakfast is good and has enough variety. The best part about this hotel is the rooftop pool. Plenty of seats and the pool temp is good. Staff here are lovely and go above and beyond to help you. Would definitely recommend this hotel if this is in your budget.",U Paasha Seminyak
1180,Great location and breakfast,40,April 2018,"We decided to stay in Seminyak for our last 2 nights in Bali after first 2 nights in Ubud. Hotel has great location on the main road full of bars and restaurants. We checked in at almost 4 pm, but ee were told that the room was not ready. We have to wait for an hour as they have 24 hours room policy, meaning you can check out by the time you check in. After complaining, we get the room in 25 mins and complementary drinks. The room is good but a little bit wear and tears all over the place. The towel had some smell? We had 2 lotions and no shower gel. It is ok for us. The pool is abit small and is rather for soaking and drinking rather than swimming. The breakfast is good. You can have a good buffet or a la cart in your room.",U Paasha Seminyak
1181,Fantastic hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,March 2018,"My favourite hotel in Seminyak. Rooms are spacious, clean and bright. Breakfast is great with good coffee. Love the pool and roof terrace area. If you're lucky you can join a weekly Yoga session. Very friendly staff!",U Paasha Seminyak
1182,So convenient!,40,March 2018,"U paasha is right in the centre of Seminyak. It's modern and great for couples or if traveling with friends! It's so convenient as you can practically walk to the cafes, restaurants and shops!

They have a rooftop pool and the buffet breakfast is well worth the money!",U Paasha Seminyak
1183,Excellent last night in Bali,40,April 2018,U Paasha is in a great central location of Seminyak. It is large and well kept with modern amenities and lovely staff that were always helpful. The rooftop pool was fantastic and a great place to spend the afternoon before heading to the airport.,U Paasha Seminyak
1184,Great value for money & central location,40,April 2018,"On my 15th trip to Bali I had 5 days on my own so down graded from a Villa to a Resort... in doing my research for several trips I have always noted U Paasha as an affordable option with great reviews. I wasn't let down, the room was affordable, comfortable and the staff at U Paasha were all friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again either on my own or with a small group. There were a lot of families with teens or adult kids (there are better options for families with small children).",U Paasha Seminyak
1185,Great Location,40,April 2018,"As far as hotels go, you’d be hard pressed to find one with a better location than U Paasha. With no need to get a taxi to anything in Seminyak, we enjoyed our time here. The hotel is within walking distance to Potato Head (15 mins at a good pace), Mrs Sippy (15 mins at a good pace), Motel Mexicola (10 mins at a good pace) and La Favella (5 mins at a good pace). The rooftop pool is great, but lacked atmosphere, however it’s perfect if you’re looking for a quiet spot. A wonderful view of Bali as well.

We booked a Room With a View and ended up on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel, which was fantastic as we didn’t hear any of the noise from Eat St which is just outside. Breakfast was included and was great, with a good selection of food.

The room was well presented and spacious. The bathroom is open plan, including the shower and toilet, so not a huge level of privacy from the person you’re travelling with.

Overall, a great hotel in a great location. Would recommend staying here if you’re looking for a quiet, up market place.",U Paasha Seminyak
1186,"Excellent location, great value!",40,April 2018,"The winner for this hotel was the stay for 24hrs policy, which meant that we could check out at 9pm as we only arrived at 9pm for our prior check in. This suited our flight timings perfectly!
Location was unbeatable, in the heart of seminyak, good restaurants all nearby, beach a short car ride away.

Rooms are large, comfortable and clean. Pretty luxurious too. Only feedback I can give is that my king room was rather dim at night, wasn’t good for evening reading. And also the flooring in the bathroom was abit prickly - an attempt to create anti-slip flooring - but didn’t help my sunburnt feet!

That said, would stay here again, as it’s remarkable value!",U Paasha Seminyak
1187,Good hotel,40,April 2018,"Good hotel which is well located in the hub of Seminyak.walking distance to most places.the pool on the top floor is great.
Breakfast have a good selection to choose from.Will look forward to coming back on our next visit",U Paasha Seminyak
1188,Honey Moon Couple,50,March 2018,"Central in Seminyak. You can not ask for more. It is located between all the restaurants, bars and beach. Shops have all the name brands. U Paasha cater for families and couples. Suttle services from airport",U Paasha Seminyak
1189,Could not fault,50,October 2017,"Great location right on “eat street”. You have everything you need at your doorstep. Rooms are really spacious and clean which we loved and the bed was massive and super comfy. Loved the breakfast which had a huge variety of food for everyone ( actual barista making coffee was a plus too).
Rooftop pool was beautiful with constant sun. I couldn’t fault this place and would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1190,Perfect holiday,50,March 2018,"Great hotel, location was really good, accessible to good shopping and great restaurants. If you want a getaway, it’s great. Then just step outside the hotel, all the shopping and night life is there within reach.",U Paasha Seminyak
1191,Best place to stay!!!,50,April 2018,"My favorite hotel in Seminyak. The only hotel I know of that will give you 24 hours from the time you check in. That means if you check in at 4 pm your check out is 4 pm they next day! Got to love that!!! The roof top pool not only had the best views in the city but the best food and service. Gede, one of the waiters there makes you feel at home and amongst family. Thank you Gede for your wonderful hospitality, we will definitely be back to see you!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1192,"Wonderful Experience, Definitely Recommend!",50,April 2018,"Best hotel stay in Seminyak! Clean beautiful large rooms with amazing rooftop swimming pool (has views of ocean), delicious food and wonderful customer service. Gede who works at the roof top was a fantastic host super friendly and one of the reasons my stay was a great one. Added bonus is the hotel policy of getting exactly 24 hours from your time of check in to check out following day.",U Paasha Seminyak
1193,Luxury in Heart of Seminyak,50,March 2018,"This is my 3rd time at U Paasha and I’ll certainly be back again. The hotel is located in the centre of eat street but you still feel away from the crowds particularly when using the amazing rooftop pool. We went for a suite with a view located on 5th floor just under the pool level. Room size is great with a lovely spacious bathroom and a great shower. The bed is huge and very comfortable. Breakfast choice is fantastic and the service from everyone is perfect. Lots of hellos and everyone is happy to help. There are lots of couples and plenty of families with small children so it accommodates all needs. Room service is great and the bar service at the pool whether you’re having cocktails, beer or snacks is great. Plenty of sunloungers and the umbrellas offer shade when required. The whole bar area is also shaded if you want some time away from the sun. All in all I’d highly recommend this hotel. Also check our local restaurants such as Ginger Moon, Saladin & Bikini. Enjoy your stay, any questions let me know and I’ll be happy to try to help.",U Paasha Seminyak
1194,Wonderful Experience,50,March 2018,"The hotel's service, location and everything leaves me in awe and impressed.

The front officer manager, Chandra, took her time to gather our feedback before our departure and was genuine to make things even better.

We will be sure to stay with U Paasha should we visit Bali again.

Both my husband and I would like to thank you for your excellent service and please keep up the good work.",U Paasha Seminyak
1195,Fantastic luxury stay,50,March 2018,"U Paasha Hotel in Seminyak, Bali is an ideal destination for luxury travellers and is perfect for couples or solo adventurers. My experience with this hotel started as soon as I got off the plane. I had airport transfer arranged prior to my flight and this made the experience smooth and relaxful with no hassle.

After the short drive from the airport, I was greeted by very friendly and welcoming staff at the reception. My check-in was simple and fairly quick.As I opened the door to my room I knew U Paasha Hotel was a great choice - the room was very spacious, looked beautiful and also included the basic amenities along with super fast wifi. For my stay, I was on the 5th floor in room 519.

The location of this hotel is perfect, situated in Seminyak, the home of the most luxurious hotels and resorts, I had plenty on my doorstep - from restaurants to bars, to various shops, the local surroundings were great. Due to the perfect location, I was able to admire the 360 views of the city from the rooftop pool and bar.",U Paasha Seminyak
1196,Great location in Seminyak,50,March 2018,"I stayed here for just one night & I got lucky, it did not disappoint!!! Staff are friendly & a conveinent location with everything at walking distance. I can sometimes be a fussy eater but the breakfast buffet is superb. I will unquestionably book this hotel again.!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1197,Aweome,50,March 2018,Always a great stay here. Amazing location. Wonderful staff and awesome pool. Couldn’t ask for more on my birthday. Thank you so so much. Do yourself a favour and stay at this place. The staff remember you. Brilliant breakfast offering.,U Paasha Seminyak
1198,Great modern hotel and staff,50,March 2018,"I spent just one night here at the end of my trip, but I found the hotel to be absolutely perfect after several disappointments at other balinese establishments.

PROS:
- super clean! Only hotel in Bali where bedsheets and towels are white and not with yellow stains!
- very spacious, modern room with polished concrete floors
- super comfy mattress
- great custom made toiletries made with jasmine essential oil!
- welcome drink on the rooftop
- right in the heart of Seminyak shopping, walking distance to shops and restaurants
- super helpful staff (helped me negotiate a taxi ride to the airport at a cheap fixed price)

CONS:
- the floor in the shower is made of rough concrete, hurting my feet. I had to shower with flip flops. I don't understand why they didn't make it of polished concrete like the rest of the room.

All in all a great hotel and would definitely reccommend it for a stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1199,Dinner on the rooftop,50,March 2018,"The absolute best dinner, such a variety, fabulous smorgasbooard, beautiful sunset view, breezy, wonderful staff, thanks Gede for inviting us up, you're the best! Recommend to everyone. We'll be back Tracee, Greg, Janelle and Dean 😊",U Paasha Seminyak
1200,UPaasha has done it again! Another fantastic stay,50,March 2018,"We stayed at UPaasha for the second time and it was a great experience. The staff are wonderful and always happy to help. The food facilities are also great especially the buffet breakfast which includes a huge selection of options. We will definitely return, thanks UPaasha",U Paasha Seminyak
1201,Brilliant again,50,March 2018,"My third stay at Upaasha was brilliant as usual. I stayed for two nights over Nyepi on my way to Nusa Penida and the team at Upaasha looked after me so well. The rooftop pool was perfect on Nyepi Day and we were looked after with food, swimming, yoga and non stop movies. Room was great, food was great but the service brilliant. They made efforts to check what time boats were running the day after Nyepi and booked transport for me to the harbour in Sanur. Nothing is ever too much trouble. Can't wait to come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1202,Great place to stay in Seminyak,50,February 2018,"We found this great hotel accidentally as we spent some time having coffee in Seminyak. We were greeted very friendly by its staff, they even let us see the room. After that we booked 5 nights through agoda, since the price was cheaper as we booked directly there. Great location, exactly in the center of Seminyak, surrounded with caffees, restaurants, shops and boutiques. Breakfast was tasty and various. The staff was very friendly and gave lots of attentions. The swimming pool located in rooftop where you can see the area from above. Great location to see the sunset from the rooftop bar. The room was very spacey and comfortable. I would stay here again in the next visit to Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1203,Good and bad,30,March 2018,"The hotel at first sight was really nice. Grand lobby, friendly staff, very good breakfast and nice rooftop pool.

The first night room was really noisy becouse of the kitchen fans. In the room there was smell of food. From the pipes at first came this awfull sewage smell. That was ok after a couple of minutes water running. The bed was very comfortable.
On our second night we asked that they move us to another room. The friendly staff helped us and all went smoothly. The new room was good and quiet but very moist and smelly.
The rooms are also a bit worn down. In general this is a good hotel but its not such good value for the price.
Ok for a night or two.",U Paasha Seminyak
1204,Well Recommended!,50,May 2017,"Loved my first stay here! The hotel itself, the staff, the pool view, the cuisines, and the service, and.... too much to say - those were all perfect. I went solo but felt so much energized after going back to my hometown.",U Paasha Seminyak
1205,Great hotel,40,February 2018,"I love the interior decor of this hotel, very spacious and beautiful!! The room is clean, toilet very spacious, love the jasmine soap! The location of hotel is close to shops and cafes. Easy to take a quick stroll around the area. Overall very satisfied to have chosen this hotel during my holiday :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1206,Great location,40,March 2018,"This hotel is in the middle of everything so you can easily walk to restaurants and bars or take a short taxi to things a bit further afield.
It is a busy street but the rooftop pool provides a welcome relief from the heat and crowds.
The room is large as is the bathroom but the bathroom is looking a little worn and the drains definitely let you know you’re in Bali, maybe a drain freshener or some aroma reeds in the room could help to overcome this!
Breakfast was good with a range of Indonesian and western choices and the coffee was good too!
I’d recommend this hotel if you are in Bali for a few days and want to be close to everything.",U Paasha Seminyak
1207,Highly recommend!!,50,February 2018,We absolutely loved our 2 night stay at U Paasha. Our room was so comfortable and clean and the staff were so polite and friendly. The location was great and buffet breakfast was with the best I’ve had in Bali ever. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone we know!!,U Paasha Seminyak
1208,Wonderfull Place To Stay,40,February 2018,"We stayed here for 4 nights which was excellent. The room was excellent bigger than average plus it was clean as well the room was always arranged when we came bck either late morning or late evening which does not happen often. The friendly staff are willing to help you in anyway they assist you in.
The Breakfast has a great layout not the same everyday which we noticed.
The front security is there to guide you out and in which we noticed that was very helpfull plus they were very friendly.
Just a great plzce to stay been to BALI three times but this was my best stay in Saminyak.
Below are some pics from our Balcony.",U Paasha Seminyak
1209,Good location & comfortable bed,40,February 2018,"Good restaurants, massages & shops on door step. The bed is really comfortable. The hotel is well maintains with passion staff. You may book tour, bike, motor bike or car with the hotel, they will arrange every things for you.",U Paasha Seminyak
1210,Wonderful hotel,50,February 2018,Excellent hotel choice in the heart of Seminyak. I have stayed here a few times and the staff are genuine and always welcoming. Great management and would definitely recommend. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in the area,U Paasha Seminyak
1211,Excellent holiday,50,January 2018,"Excellent stay, accommodation very good, large rooms quiet and well serviced. (love the toiletries). Roof top pool , great after a long day shopping. Excellent menu, especially salads & breakfasts. Cant compliment the staff enough, aways a smile , well spoken & hard working. Good location base for exploring the island, close to numerous restaurants on the street.",U Paasha Seminyak
1212,Great hotel in a great location,40,August 2017,"Very good hotel, in the middle of all the action. Very nice rooftop pool, great breakfast, I felt a very good value for the price. The rooms are a bit dated but still very spacious and comfortable. Would recommend it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1213,"Very nice, just a few adjustments to make",40,February 2018,"We got upgraded to the 5th floor and the view is really nice!!
The room is very spacious and well decorated.
The pool was amazing. Quiet and away from the bush street.
A few adjustments to make:
- cleanliness of the bathroom
- A/C was quite noisy
- airport pickup: after flying from Europe it was a bit disappointing to wait for our driver. ( guess got the upgrade because of that)
However, the stay overall was lovely!
Thank you to the staff from the reception, breakfast restaurant, bbq restaurant.... each and every one of them where always so nice, smiling and ready to help out.",U Paasha Seminyak
1214,Perfec location for a weekend getaway,40,February 2018,"Stayed here for 3 nights - perfect location for a weekend in Seminyak. Right smack in the middle of the thoroughfare - shops, restaurants, bars etc. Very central. Our room was massive and clean and the staff was extremely helpful - every request was met promptly. The rooftop pool was also gorgeous and tranquil. We had some problems with the toilet flush and AC but those issues were rectified almost immediately. While the hotel is located in the middle of a busy location, it feels like you're in your own quiet area and away from the noise and craziness of Seminyak when you're in your tranquil an spacious room.",U Paasha Seminyak
1215,Best stay in Seminyak.,40,February 2018,"Good location. Smack in the middle of restaurants, bars, cafe. 10mins to beach. Good happy hour at rooftop bar. Wonderful and polite, friendly staff. Free Yoga on Mon and Wed. And the BBQ buffet is good value.",U Paasha Seminyak
1216,10/10,50,February 2018,Perfect stay in the best location. The rooms are incredibly comfy and spacious. The staff are very friendly and welcoming! The rooftop pool was a highlight with amazing views over Seminyak. Can't find a fault during our time here.,U Paasha Seminyak
1217,Value for money,50,February 2018,"This is one hotel we will most certainly go back to. Everything about the hotel was very good from day one. Staff very helpful and attentive Daniel runs a very good hotel. Pool area great, room great , breakfast great in fact everything was great",U Paasha Seminyak
1218,Amazing,50,September 2017,"Exceptional hotel for a very reasonable price! The staff go above and beyond to make sure you receive the experience of a luxurious hotel whilst not having to pay a fortune. Good location, great food, beautiful pool.

Would certainly recommend staying here!",U Paasha Seminyak
1219,A grown up hotel in the right location,50,February 2018,"Upaasha is in exactly the right part of Seminyak - close enough to get to the W and Potato Head Beach Club for drinks, but close enough to Mamasan and Bikini for awesome food.
The staff are amazing and the hotel is clean and modern.

Lovely rooftop pool area that is ideal for chilling.

The poolside food wasn't the best, but that'll teach us for not having local food on one day!

The breakfast is great - Lots of choice and a live egg station where you can preorder so no long egg queues! Spot on!

library coffee across the road is worth visiting for a tasty lunch as well

All in all a great visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1220,Perfect position and fabulous room,50,October 2017,"We loved our stay at U Paasha and would definitely stay again. The staff were very friendly and very helpful from the moment we arrived. Our room was huge, bed really comfy and had everything we needed except a bath. The rooftop pool was great with terrific bar service. So close to everything in Seminyak - perfect position.",U Paasha Seminyak
1221,The best location and an excellent modern hotel.,50,February 2018,"This is my second stay at U Paasha. Great for couples, families and friends. The facilities, rooms, dining area, pool, reception and basically every section of the hotel is modern, functional, clean, well maintained and excellent in every way. But I must say the best part of the hotel for us was the staff. Each staff member we dealt with was enthusiastic, attentive, friendly, happy and eager to please. I could tell that everyone working enjoyed their work and worked as a team.
The location is excellent - across the road to many fabulous restaurants, close to Seminyak Square and other shopping and nightlife.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back next time we are in Bali. Well done and thank you.",U Paasha Seminyak
1222,Excellent hotel,50,February 2018,Great hotel all round. Would recommend and stay again. Staff were extremely helpful and often went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. Rooftop pool is an absolutely amazing space that photos to do not do justice!,U Paasha Seminyak
1223,AMAZING !,50,February 2018,"Great hotel, great location, great breakfast, spacious and modern rooms. Check out at the same time as you check in. All day breakfast. Service is phenomenal. Rooftop pool! LOVE this place and will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1224,Great To Be Back To One Of The Bali Best,50,January 2018,"This was my 3rd visit to U Paasha. There are quite a few options for Seminyak. U Paasha does it for me. Service, Staff, and location make it a top choice. Appreciate their kindness and consideration as a loyal guest. Didn't have the opportunity to meet the new management team, but trust they're moving forward with making the hotel even better than before. The roof top pool is beautiful and one of the most relaxing ways to spend the day. Always plenty of lounge chairs and great service. The wait staff at breakfast is attentive and always willing to help. Nando? (hope the name is correct) is simply one of the best as are others on the team. Great options for food are right outside the door. Batik is a favorite and not to be missed. As well as Divine Earth just to the right of the hotel. Serving some of the best vegetarian food available. Looking forward to the next visit!",U Paasha Seminyak
1225,Peter,40,January 2018,Great place to stay in Bali with friendly staff and management. Awesome rooftop pool are with great views. Bar and food service on rooftop bar was second to none. Buffet breakfast was great with plenty of choices.,U Paasha Seminyak
1226,Great Hotel,40,February 2018,"Lovely hotel in excellent location walking distance to many shops & restaurants. Short drive to beach. Room was amazingly spacious and clean. Surprised by the lack of power points, only two in the corner of the room not near a table & no charging ability at the desk. Rooftop pool was very relaxing and staff attentive. Great hotel for a holiday or short break but not suitable for a working holiday due to power access issues. Plan to stay again for a weekend again soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
1227,Spacious rooms and excellent breakfast buffet!,50,January 2018,"Convenient location, right in the middle of ‘Eat Street’ amongst shops and restaurants and a close walk to the beach. Staff were attentive and polite and made the check-in/check-out process fast and simple. We LOVED the buffet breakfast as there was lots of variety and staff service was great (eggs, waffles and pancakes were cooked to order). Great experience overall - would stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1228,Great place,50,January 2018,"U Paasha hotel, you won't find a better location with friendly staff, clean rooms and making you feel welcome.
The rooftop pool and bar is amazing, great cocktails.
The location is very easy for restaurants",U Paasha Seminyak
1229,Wow ... very surprised and strongly recommend this hotel!,50,January 2018,"This was a short five day break to catch up with friends and having been a while since being in Bali - we were sceptical about the trip!

Bring on U Paasha hotel and bring on Seminyak - central location - tick - great roof top pool - tick - staff - absolutely amazing !!- the service tick , the room size is great ,massive bathroom - select your own toiletries from Four scents , all day breakfast - if you don’t want the buffet - have your breakfast anywhere anytime.
All staff superb and made time to speak with you and ask questions to make sure you were comfortable and looked after - but I am going to single out Mr Ronny at the rooftop pool, Mr Kaka at restaurant and Mr Dodi - our very entertaining transfer guy !! These guys went out of their way to make us particularly welcome and they should be commended - but all staff are a credit to the hotel management !!
Value for money absolutely exceptional - so much so we’ve booked to go back already!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1230,"Spacious and comfy room, center of Seminyak",40,April 2017,"The suite I stayed in did not have a view but it was spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet is decent. The rooftop pool and bar are great for chilling out. You could easily walk to shops, bars and restaurants from this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1231,Bad aircondition,20,January 2018,"The hotel needs a serious renovation, Doors don’t close.
Aircondition all over is not working, to save money or because it is old?
Staff does not speak English well enough.
It is a pitty because it has potention.",U Paasha Seminyak
1232,Best Hotel Stay EVER!,50,February 2017,"I always find booking a hotel such a stressful process because photos can be completely different when comparing them to real life however, I was so pleasantly surprised with U Paasha! My first impression of the hotel was simply 'wow'. It was clean, well presented and very modern. The room was incredibly spacious, very clean and hygienic. The beds were TO DIE FOR! Every night, I fell asleep without any trouble at all. They were so comfortable.

The pool area was gorgeous unfortunately however, we didn't spend as much time up there as we would've liked. The buffet breakfast was again, one of the best I've had. There was enough variety that I can guarantee there is something for everyone. My favourite part of U Paasha was the location. When stepping out of reception, you have an array of restaurants, shops, mini marts and you are also walking distance to La Favela and Motel Mexicola.

Great stay - Thank-you U Paasha!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1233,Another great stay at U Paasha Hotel,50,January 2018,"I have stayed at U Paasha three times and each time it is consistently good! The location is great, the rooms are modern & clean, and the staff are very helpful.

In particular, I was unwell during my stay and they would call my room to see if I was okay and if I needed my breakfast delivered instead of coming down to buffet.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a hotel that just 'gets it'.

Thanks to all the staff!",U Paasha Seminyak
1234,First Time at Paasha,40,January 2018,We had a relaxing week at U Paasha for our first stay in Seminyak eat Street . The staff were friendly and helpful although at times there were communication problems due to poor English speaking . Our room was towards the back of the hotel which made it quiet and a haven from the busyness of Seminyak. We did have problems with internet at times so it made it difficult to stay in touch with home. The pool area was well designed and offered plenty of seating. The pool bar area needed a bit of attention as it seemed to be a large mostly empty area and not very welcoming. The gym was ba good size and provided all that was needed.,U Paasha Seminyak
1235,"Great Location, Spacious comfortable room",40,January 2018,U Paasha is in a great location and walking distance to Seminyak square and the market and basically everything on Laksmana. So many great restaurants at your doorstep. We only stayed a night and paid $10 USD an hour for a late checkout.The Hotel was very busy at breakfast but it went smoothly with quite a varied choice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1236,Amazing location and superfriendly staff!,50,January 2018,"Swimming pool was beautiful
We could rent bicycles for free
Staff was the friendliest we experienced in all of Bali
Rooms are very spacious
Location is perfect if you want to have dinner in one of the many cozy restaurants around & 15-20min walk to the beach
Minor detail: towels did not always smell fresh but staff was very happy to bring new ones if asked",U Paasha Seminyak
1237,Great Hotel,50,January 2018,"Stayed at the U Paasha for 9 nights and I highly recommend this hotel.
Location - fantastic, in the heart of great cafes and restaurants
Room - Bed was comfy, large room, satisfactory finishes
Staff - brilliant, friendly
Breakfast - great variety, good quality
Pool - great retreat, nice view
Value - very good",U Paasha Seminyak
1238,Great Position and Rooftop Pool,40,January 2018,"This is my second stay at U-Paasha whilst in the Seminyak area. I chose U-Paasha again, due to the location and the rooftop pool. Breakfastis plentiful, and the young staff, although their English is not fantastic, they are more than helpful. Rooms are spacious with a small balcony - no chairs are provided to sit out there though, or a drying rack for wet bathers - would be handy",U Paasha Seminyak
1239,Great hotel with excellent staff,50,January 2018,"Great hotel, clean very large rooms, excellent staff. Very good breakfast.
Hotel is in the haert of seminyak, so very busy street.
But not far from beach
Compliments for the staff who made us feel very welcome",U Paasha Seminyak
1240,Beautiful place and people,40,January 2018,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and had a lovely time. The location is perfect in Seminyak. Walk out the door and you’re in the middle of a lively town. Tons of shops, bars and restaurants right there. Check out Cafe Bali across the street! Fast service and great food. Our room was incredibly spacious with a beautiful view. Although the hotel is located on a busy street, there was no noise in our room. The pool was nice and the rooftop staff was above and beyond! We really enjoyed relaxing at the rooftop bar with a few Bintang Radlers. Pretty good food and snack as well. The breakfast downstairs was delicious. The front desk staff was helpful and set us up with a wonderful driver, Rudi, whom we loved so much we hired him for 3 more additional days of sightseeing. On that note, you must make a day trip to Uluwatu! It is stunning! Only negative is that every once in awhile you can get an unsavory smell from the street while walking in the halls. The smell is however very normal in all parts of Bali especially after the rain. Overall, I highly recommend staying at U Paasha Seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak
1241,"Great position, awesome pool and lovely staff",50,January 2018,"We stayed at U Paasha last week and had a fabulous time. Room was perfect for two friends staying together - large rooms, comfy beds and loved the huge walk in shower.

The staff were amazing - very friendly the whole time and could not do enough for us. We were staying on level 5 and I mentioned to reception that in the mornings we were woken at 6am by the staff dragging the pool chairs across the roof. She assured it me wouldn't happen again - and it didn't! In fact I didn't hear it happen again for the rest of our stay.

Pool area is super relaxing - such a good vibe with great music and an awesome view over the rooftops of Seminyak right down to the ocean. My only comment is that guests should not be allowed to take glass into the pool. We saw lots of guests with drinks in the pool with wine glasses / beer bottles - they were glass not plastic.

Location - could not get better in terms of being central Seminyak. We walked everywhere.

I've stayed in lots of hotels in Bali and would not hesitate to go back to U Paasha.

Thanks for a fabulous week!",U Paasha Seminyak
1242,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,50,January 2018,"We stayed here for 3 days in January 2018.The Hotel is very clean, in a great location,walking distance to all top restaurants and shops.A short 10 minute walk from the hotel and your at the beach.The staff are most welcoming and cant do enough to make your stay a pleasurable one.We will definitely book our next stay here in the near future.Thank you Staff and management.",U Paasha Seminyak
1243,"Fantastic location, Spacious rooms, Delicious breakfasts and a great rooftop hangout",50,January 2018,"We stayed in a suite room on level 2 for 5 nights. We arrived late on our first night, we got to our room and noticed it was quite warm and the air conditioner didnt seem to be working. We called reception to let them know . We had workmen at our room within 15 minutes of us calling and they had it back up and running again within 10 minutes which was great! You cannot knock the location it is smack bang in the middle to eat street so walkable to everything. Rooms are huge, the only thing i would mention is they could do with a little more lighting which isnt a big thing. Rooftop pool is a great place to hang out during the day, and it was cool sitting up at the rooftop bar watching the storms roll during the afternoons. Breakfast was amazing both food and staff. Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1244,"large rooms, friendly staff and delicious breakfast. The full package",40,December 2017,We loved our stay here. The rooms were large and had everything we needed. Aircon worked well and the room was serviced regularly. The breakfast was a highlight for my boyfriend and we liked the rooftop pool and location. Overall I'd highly recommend for the price,U Paasha Seminyak
1245,"Very old and dated hotel, nothing like it’s shown on the website",20,January 2018,"We booked this hotel in advance because it was highly recommended by friend as being the best hotel in this area. The reviews were good and the pictures shown on the website were great too, but unfortunately in reality it has nothing to do with what is pictured. Rooms are very old and need a serious renovation, bathroom looks so dirty that i felt gross going in the shower. AC or whatever it is was so loud that we couldn’t fall asleep. Walls are paper thin so we could hear everything that was going on outside the room. Floor is very cold and slippery, I almost fell stepping out the shower. It’s not worth the money you pay for the service that is listed, so we had to move to a different hotel the next morning.",U Paasha Seminyak
1246,Highly recommend!!,50,January 2018,"This place was amazing, i honestly can not recommend it enough. Location is fabulous, so close to everything!!!! Rooms are quiet, big and really comfortable beds, and big shower to! Loved the roof top pool! I will definitely stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
1247,Excellent location and friendly vibe,50,December 2017,"The hotel staff made us feel extra special from the moment we arrived and catered to our every need. The hotel and it's rooms were comfortable and spacious and well decorated.
The only thing I feel this hotel would benefit from is to have a lounge / bar adjacent to its amazing and comfortable lobby. I often felt like a lounge / bar would have added to the already relaxing and sofisticated vibe of the place. Nothing rowdy but more on the classy side to match the hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1248,U Paasha is a great place to stay,50,December 2017,"We loved the hotel, it’s location and facilities, breakfast at the restaurant was good, wifi facilities were good, gym is quite functional, hotel is very conveniently located, staff are polite and willing to help, rooms are well maintained",U Paasha Seminyak
1249,Thanks U Paasha - A great 4 nightz,50,March 2017,"Thank you U Paasha for a fantastic four nights.

This is our second time back to the hotel and I must say that the hotel and the staff were excellent.

The Room was large enough for the three of us and our eight year old loved the buffet!",U Paasha Seminyak
1250,Can’t go wrong with this choice!,50,December 2017,"We deliberately chose to stay in Seminyak to experience the restaurants and shopping with ease without having to make our way there each day without going through traffic. We weren’t disappointed!

The rooms are a good size, bright and spacious.

The pool offers fantastic views of the ocean ( and Mt Agung) and is a great place to watch sunset.

Friendly efficient staff, always happy to help.

Upaasha met the brief and then some! Great staff, great rooms, great food!

Only ONE negative ( or feedback). There are NO umbrellas. None in room and none available in public areas. This doesn’t seem like a deal breaker but in the middle of the wet season when rain comes sideways- any protection is greatly appreciated! One night the receptionist lent me her own personal umbrella. Thankyou for the kindness, but as a hotel - this isn’t a big expense for guest comfort!!

All in all a great experience and we will return ( with our own umbrella!!)",U Paasha Seminyak
1251,Amazing location and friendly staff,40,December 2017,"Our stay at Upaasha was great! Which is what we wanted being first timers to Bali.

The location was amazing...so central to everything and the staff were always more than happy to help. We had breakfast included which was always fresh! The gym was good but could do with an extra bench and some barbells

We didn’t travel with the kids (3 of them under 6) this time but wouldn’t hesitate staying with them there in the future.

Would confidently recommend this hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
1252,Mr Carelse,50,December 2017,"Excellent location, beautiful spaces and well decorated rooms. Breakfast was a feast. The rooftop area was wonderful to relax and inter-act with friends and other guests - a real gem. All staff is very friendly and always willing to assist",U Paasha Seminyak
1253,SLICE OF HEAVEN,50,December 2017,"Treat yourself and stay a few nights here, hell stay the week if you can. You won’t regret it. From the superb breakfast, to the friendly staff and excellent service, U PAASHA continues to be my favourite hotel in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1254,Staff made us feel at home,50,December 2017,"Fantastic hotel located on a busy street walking distance to great restaurants and bars. Our room was top level at the back of the hotel so we couldnt hear anything from the road - Unfortunately all we did hear was the people in the gym above us dropping their weights.. but no big deal!
Beautiful room - actually couldnt believe how big it was!! very spacious and the bathroom was well laid out. My only fault would be the seating on the balcony.. there was none! i would have to take my pillow out on the balcony and sit on the ground. again no biggie but a chair would be nice!
The staff went above and beyond. Always smiling and greeting the guests. The staff who worked up at the pool were amazing. They enjoyed a good joke and conversation, it was nice to feel welcomed.
The pool on the top level had great views of the volcanos and mountains. Loved that the pool was on the roof as the sun was always out and never hiding behind the hotel!
impressive buffet breakfast and provide proper coffee, not instant!
Overall a great experience at the U Paasha. Thank you for making us feel welcomed!
- Also housekeeping did a fantastic job each day. A clean hotel room is very important to me and the sheets were always neat and clean! Beautiful!",U Paasha Seminyak
1255,Perfect Hotel Experience,50,December 2017,"This was our 3rd stay at UPaasha. Like the other times it was perfect, we cannot fault this Hotel. From the excellent service from all the staff to the large room (bigger than the average hotel room) and the location in as central as you can get. The roof top pool is tranquil and relaxing with a view to the ocean.

We loved it, can't wait to go back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1256,Great location and service,50,December 2017,"The location of the hotel is amazing. Close to all the food places I wanted to go to and La Favela just down the road .Easy cab ride to Bambu, Potato Head etc.Walking distance to Sisterfields and Mamasan .Busy street but you can’t hear anything from the room which is amazing .",U Paasha Seminyak
1257,Amazing,50,December 2017,"Went here with my dad. We had a room with twin beds. Everything worked as well one could wish for. Big TV, many channels, good WiFi, really nice pool at the top of the hotel, good location with many restaurants in walking distance. Breakfast buffet was extremely good. Staff was really nice and helpful.",U Paasha Seminyak
1258,Nice roof top pool,40,November 2017,"Stayed here for our last 4 nights on Bali. There were some construction ongoing so we had to go trough the garage to enter the hotel, a bit odd but manageable. We got a room on the first floor and we realized immediately that we could hear the construction work so we asked for a new room and it was given to us immediately. Overall it was a nice hotel, it shows some wear and tear but nothing to really react to. The roof top pool was great, xlnt service and there were always some sunbeds available. Breakfast over average and all staff really nice and helpful. Its situated right in the middle of basically everything so location is great.",U Paasha Seminyak
1259,Fantastic hotel,50,September 2017,"Staff were very helpful and nothing was any trouble. Rooms were spacious, clean and modern. Breakfast buffet was amazing. Location perfect! Would highly recommend. Pool and bar staff were definitely a stand out. Look forward to returning soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
1260,Very nice,50,November 2017,"Very nice place in the center of Seminyak.
My room was on 2nd floor, quite big with a very nice bathroom.
Clean and quite.
Amazing breakfast and swimming pool on the roof where you can relax and swimm during the sunset.
I will come back for sure",U Paasha Seminyak
1261,Excellent Hotel,50,November 2017,"Couldn’t fault the hotel! Our aircon stopped working once and we called reception and within 5 mins we had maintenance up fixing it, which took 5 mins. Everything from arrival to departure was great! Thanks for a great experience! We stayed in room 524, when people dropped their dumbbells in the gym it was loud but that was all.",U Paasha Seminyak
1262,Second visit,40,December 2017,"On my first visit I titled my review 'Perfect'. Three years later, the room - not unlike myself - has got a little worn with a few stains and and lack the wow-factor from last time.

Check in was smooth and friendly, the lobby looks great and the first floor corridor has a large exibition of street art.

The room is large, but floors, walls and mirrors have got a few stains. Good bed. Air con must be kept at full blast to keep temperature down and is quite noisy.

First night was a disaster - waking up at 3:45 from the sound of water hitting the floor. A leak from the ceiling had to be fixed in the middle of the night and ruined my sleep.

Breakfast is brilliant and the staff is amazing - remembering room number and coffee preferences from the day before.

The roof pool area is very nice kept, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. Great sunset view.

Even so - I am not sure I will return for a third time. U Paasha has a very high profile in soscial media - being very quick to respond, focusing on their intentional very high service standards. Because of that I honestly expected to be approached by someone from the managment saying something like ""We are sorry that your first night was not a good one, and we hope the rest of your stay will be better"", and I was very disappointed that it was not mentioned at any point afterwards.

In that perspective I feel the stay was worth three star, but breakfast, pool, and the great staff all around saved the fourth.",U Paasha Seminyak
1263,Must Stay in Seminyak,50,November 2017,"Great hotel for those that want a HUGE room, but not a HUGE hotel. This is modern decore hotel, roof top bar and pool and close to all the best restaurants that Seminyak has to offer. Not really suitable for young children or babies, older, mature demographic favoured by Australians that like a little luxury without it being over the top in price.",U Paasha Seminyak
1264,Relaxing and luxe,50,November 2017,"Wonderful stay! Huge rooms and bed! Great food at breakfast, rooftop bar and by the pool. We booked an early bird deal and it was so worth it!

So many awesome places to eat and shop right on the doorstep. Only a short walk to the beach and beach side bars.

We were delayed getting home due to the volcano and the hotel was amazing. We got daily updates on the airport closures and the ash cloud and were provided masks just in case. It allowed us to focus on the holiday and not stress about when we would get home.

Would definitely stay again. Thanks U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
1265,Second visit and not disappointed,40,November 2017,"The same sewer smell was in the ground floor room as my last visit and I kinda wonder if we just got used into it after a couple of days aside from that we love this hotel. The roof top pool, breakfast and rooms were great. The downstairs bar area is being renovated which was a shame. Location is good traffic a nightmare.. Coffee at breakfast great...",U Paasha Seminyak
1266,Delightful Stay at U Paasha,50,November 2017,"Management and staff are polite, friendly and accommodating. Location is excellent, close to shopping, restaurants and bars. Rooms are modern and clean. Roof top pool is great and provides good views. Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1267,huge room,50,December 2017,"the room is huuuuuuuugggeeeeeeeeee... i wasn't expect the room is so spacious, clean and well maintained. breakfast ok with local dish and international. close to seminyak night life. large pool at the roof top for the whole family is available to use. the only minor problem was on day one - i got second floor room - exactly at 5:43 in the morning i can smell the kitchen from my room, it was the smell of fried chicken i guess, or maybe sunny side up, it was ruin my morning tho. luckily on day two i didn't smell the food again. will stay again at this hotel",U Paasha Seminyak
1268,Great Location and Great Breakfast.,40,November 2017,Amazing breakfast and attentive breakfast staff. The variety and breadth of food was great value. Perhaps the only improvement could be to provide an option for fresh fruit juices as well as the sweetened orange juice mix.,U Paasha Seminyak
1269,"Beautiful modern designed hotel, exceptional management and fantastic service in the centre of Seminyak",50,November 2017,"The Upaasha has been a safe haven in Bali during our stay. With the volcano activity in Bali while we are here we are so happy that we booked into this calming place for our stay. The staff here are exceptional and Daniel the hotel manager has helped us extend our stay here a couple of times to accomodate us due to the volcanic activity. They have been very conscious of the volcanic activity and are completely prepared for any impacts that may occur. The breakfasts are great, the rooms are moder and exceptionally big and clean. Nothing is too much trouble here. You are in the middle of Seminyak surrounded by great restaurants and shopping.",U Paasha Seminyak
1270,U Paasha Seminyak,50,November 2017,"This was a last minute booking due to the airport being closed. It was close to where we were staying previously and the hotel is situated in a great part of Seminyak, close to everything if walking. Hotel room, clean spacious, staff lovely, maybe need more DVD players (ha). Could not fault this hotel at all.",U Paasha Seminyak
1271,When you want somewhere to not worry about,50,November 2017,"This is the hotel if you want great food, friendly staff, awesome pool and close proximity to everything. Happy hour is a must the drinks are of high quality and not watered down. Would go back to this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1272,Seriously Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,November 2017,"You can’t beat it! Everything is amazing!
Location perfect. Rooms are spacious. Decor Chic. Rooftop Pool is spectacular, huge and so far removed from the hustle and bustle. Breakfast is extensive and staff fabulous.",U Paasha Seminyak
1273,Fabulous location,50,November 2017,"Lovely entrance to hotel straight of eat street. Warm welcome by all staff in area and easy checkin. The rooms are large and bright. Beds very comfortable. Yes there was some tarnishing on the mirror but humidity does that along with some black marks on the shower however in saying that the room was meticulously clean and was maintained that way during whole stay. Also smell could be smelt in hallway occasionally however again o was not there to spend time in hallway and it is bali the same smell is evrywhere.
The best part. Wonderful friendly staff in all areas of the hotel. Buffett breakfast had a lot of variety and great coffee. Staff quickly remember you and great you warmly and remember your personal likes.
The rooftop pool is lovely and the temperature of the pool is great. Plenty of shade and the service there also impeccable. Had lunch there several times and enjoyed all choices. The bar staff are friendly and often enjoyed an evening cocktail.
Step out the door and you are spoilt for choice in regard to restaurants. The best restaurants In Seminyak all in walking distance so there no need to worry about the busy traffic.
I would recommend hotel to anyone who is going to Bali to relax and dine. It is not a resort style with lots of action and activities it is a very adult style hotel.
Had an awesome time thank you",U Paasha Seminyak
1274,24 hour check in/out and awesome location,50,November 2017,"24 hour check in/out, really made a difference, we had a place until it's time to go the airport in the afternoon (since we also had a late check in).

Location is awesome, right at the heart of Seminyak, walking distance to everywhere, we walked to Revolver Espresso, Mykonos, Warung Nia, Ku De Ta, Sisterfield, Titik Temu, Seminyak Square... taxis are plenty if you need them.

Our room was at the ground floor, I love it, it was big, comfortable bed, had a small private terrace (no view, just a wall and some plants), separate toilet & shower, double sink.

Staffs are great and friendly, breakfasts are included, rooftop pool was smaller than I thought it would be..

Overall I would definitely come back and recommend this place :)

During my stay on 21-23 Nov, they were renovating the lobby, so we had to come in from the basement, you couldn't hear any construction noise from the room anyway, so no biggie .. all good :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1275,Average- just like any other hotel stay.,30,November 2017,"Ok. Nothing special. Location traffic is terrible. Problem if you getting transport in and out of the area.
Average stay with minor problems here and there. Sewerage smell at the toilet. Service was just average- nothing to shout out!
Could not be bother. Just average, no complain.",U Paasha Seminyak
1276,Excellent location,50,November 2017,"The staff , location and buffet breakfast make this hotel one of our favorite places to stay .
Would highly recommend.
Shopping , great bars and restaurants just a stroll away .
Also my morning coffee delivered with a friendly smile every morning :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1277,AWESOME LOCATION!!!,50,November 2017,"Great hotel, food, staff, room! Definitely coming back to Upaasha! Nice big rooms with a double sink make all the difference when travelling with a friend. Food was wonderful and the service was spot on all the time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1278,Part 2 of our Honeymoon,30,November 2017,"Great entrance, nice tall ceiling which made it look very grand. Check in was quick, however they do ask for your credit card to hold 500,000 IDR per day you stay for expenses you may occur. We made our own way up to the room and we could notice a smell like sewage in the halls and our room this instantly made me dislike this hotel. Whilst the decor is nice, spacious and clean the smell for me was too unpleasant. It comes and goes. I did ring up and tell them this and they said they would 'treat our room' when housekeeping came. I don't know if they actually did this but nothing had changed. We also asked for our sheets to be changed, they did everything apart from the pillowcases which where clearly dirty! They did rectify this when I told them. This happened again though left dirty pillowcases, that time I didn't bother ringing up again for the same issue.
There are marks on the mirrors which look like rust, I don't know if this is ment to be contemporary but it's only on one side so looks odd and dirty. I like the honeybee mirrors and you have a coffee maker in your room however no instructions. Roof top pool is nice, staff our attentive. Water is overpriced though and shouldn't be more expensive than other soft drinks. Bathrooms are kept clean and well air conditioned however the doors are really hard to open as there is no handle! You have to pull it open from the top, or grasp the lock just be careful you don't slam your fingers in the door. We had a rooftop BBQ which was really good, lots of choice. I loved the wings although did come cold, maybe they should have BBQ to order like the wok station which was delious. Breakfast was also nice with alot of choice, waffle station and eggs made to order. Only criticisms would be there should be a pork option of sausage, I can't stand chicken or beef, I'm a typical Brit and love a pork sausage. Also I would recommend they change the knives, they are shaped so awkwardly and heavy plus they're not sharpe which was a right pain when you can't even cut through bread and eggs. Overall I gave this 3 stars as I felt it was a larger version of a Travelodge but worse smell and really nothing special.",U Paasha Seminyak
1279,"Large rooms, awesome location!",50,November 2017,"My husband and I stayed in U Paasha for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the large room (50m2) and the central Seminyak location. Our room was on the 5th floor with a distant view of the ocean from the narrow balcony. All rooms are the same configuration but a top level and ocean side is highly recommended. The rooftop pool is peaceful with attentive poolside food and beverage service from the adjoining bar and restaurant. The breeze from the ocean offers a very different ""feel"" from the warmish streets below. The buffet breakfast is highly recommended, especially the eggs made to order and the green health drink a must to start the day. As one steps out the door, Eat Street greets you- home to the restaurants, spas, boutuques and bars that Seminyak is famous for. The hotel staff are happy and nothing is too much trouble. The doorman greets guests as they arrive at the hotel, opens car doors; all part if the U Paasha experience. If you are looking for a hotel with great service and location, and do not wish to stay in a villa or large resort on the beach, U Paasha comes highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
1280,Great location for a fun holiday,50,November 2017,"Such a convenient location, close to restaurants & bars. Had delicious juices from the rooftop bar, enjoyed poolside. Lovely staff, clean rooms with plenty space. Didn’t get a chance to check out the gym or yoga, but liked the idea of the rooftop yoga.",U Paasha Seminyak
1281,♥️♥️♥️ U Passha,50,November 2017,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough, everything about it is fabulous.
I’m writing this whilst still in my room chilling on my amazingly comfy bed.
From our room to the staff to the rooftop pool to breakfast it is all amazing. The staff are all soo helpful and friendly.
They even kindly remembered my husbands 50th birthday and gave him a delicious cake. There is nowhere else in Seminyak that I will stay apart from U Passha, we love it.
It’s also perfectly placed in the centre of town.
Fabulous hotel will definitely be recommending it to all my friends and family.
Thanks U Passha for making our stay in Bali awesome 👏👏👏",U Paasha Seminyak
1282,Still a great choice!,50,November 2017,"I have stayed twice before at U Paasha a few years back and it is still great! Location is right in the middle of everything. Rooms are huge. The whole hotel is very clean and well maintained. Yes occasionally there is a sewerage smell on lower level hall but I have only noticed it twice and it wasn’t bad. No smell in my room. Aircon is a little noisy but not as bad as some reviews say, doesn’t affect sleeping, also I like that air on stats on e en when you take your key so room is always cold when you come back. Reception check in quick, they can give you iPod for music in room if you ask and room is 24 hour use which is great for late flights in and out of Bali. Bed is so comfortable. Plenty of lounges at rooftop pool. Complementary sunset yoga Monday’s and Wednesday’s. Breakfast buffet is great, lots of options. Great hotel - thank you I’m already looking forward to returning!",U Paasha Seminyak
1283,Awesome hotel,50,October 2017,"Booked this hotel due to ticking all the right boxes in reviews and was not disappointed.
The staff were all really lovely and helpful.
Loved going down for breakfast and seeing the staff who were welcoming and accommodating.
One of the largest bedrooms we have had lovingly decorated for our anniversary. Thank you. Bed was so encompassing & like a magnet.
The rooftop pool and lounge area was very relaxing.
All in all a beautiful hotel. Well recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
1284,"Central, spacious, enjoyable",40,November 2017,"The hotel is right in the main shopping and dining area of Seminyak. We booked a suite and were not disappointed with the room's size and amenities. The room was not quite ready when we arrived, though it was only a 10-15 minute wait until it was, so we were offered a free drink in the restaurant.
We loved the hotel's check-out time policy, whereby there is not a set time to check out for everyone, but rather it is dependant upon your check-in time, giving you a full 24 hours for each day stayed e.g. check in at 3pm, then check-out at 3pm.",U Paasha Seminyak
1285,Great location! Comfortable.,50,November 2017,"We are currently staying here and it’s very comfortable.

We got in very late on check in and the staff were very friendly and quick to get us to our room.

The pool is awesome as it’s on top of the hotel and offers such a different perspective of the area.

Staff are friendly

Rooms are very spacious.

The only thing the next door villas can be a bit noisy but must say they stopped at 12.

Will defiantly stay here again!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1286,Great for the most part,40,November 2017,"Always been a fave of mine. Awesome location, great rooms and fantastic rooftop pool area. Breakfast is awesome too. This trip sadly there were a few negatives. Just don't try and nap during the day: the staff keep the room doors open with the latch and they go in and out and the doors slam and the concrete corridors echo. There was a very large group of people in the hotel who did not respect other travellers and hogged the pool, and would not let people past them in the water. They hogged the chairs too. It was very hard to get a waiters attention due to this large group and it was no fault of the hotel at all. The staff were great in that they moved my room due to the large group being very noisy on my floor. I hate how some people have no respect for others. I would like to suggest some more umbrellas for the pool area by the round chairs. When all others are taken there is no shade at all. Overall a good experience but perhaps keep big groups to a minimum. Try not to get an adjoining room as you can hear others in room next to you.",U Paasha Seminyak
1287,Short last minute get away,50,October 2017,"Last minute decision to travel to seminyak and found U on line. Was very impressed, great value, big modern rooms, good location with everything I needed inc pool, bar, gym etc under one roof. Breakfast was great and staff very attentive and efficient.",U Paasha Seminyak
1288,Comfortable stay,40,November 2017,"In overall, my stay in U Paasha was great. I was welcomed with friendly staff during my arrival and was lead to my room with helpful staff too. I like the architecture of the hotel. The design was nice and awesome. However, I noticed there was stain on the mirror of the wardrobe, which I think it should be improved. Breakfast was fine. Food are good and tasty. I would prefer more healthy food options if there is any.
In overall, I enjoyed my stay in U Paasha with my sisters. It 's comfortable to stay in and feeling warm with great people around.",U Paasha Seminyak
1289,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,October 2017,"Was such a wonderful stay at this hotel! The staff we amazing, so friendly and helpful. The room was massive and so clean and well kept.

1290,Bali 2017,50,October 2017,"Wonderful resort. The breakfast was amazing. The room was very spacious, only thing was there was not very much room to go out onto the landing to enjoy an afternoon beverage. The staff all round were very professional and always smiling & would always say hello as you passed them by. The rooftop pool was lovely & also the free yoga on the grassed area of the roof top. Will definitely be back. Keep up the good work U paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
1291,Perfect hotel for your visit to Seminyak,50,October 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the the U Paasha hotel after noticing the beautiful entrance and reception area on a day trip to Seminyak.

The rooms are nice, the pool is nice and the breakfast was delicious! For the amount you pay you definitely get over and above your moneys worth.",U Paasha Seminyak
1294,Perfect place to stay in Seminyak,50,October 2017,"We LOVED our stay at U Paasha. It’s in a great central location in Seminyak, the room was huge and lovely, the breakfast is amazing and you can have it at any time of the day (or night). The gym was absolutely perfect and the rooftop pool is divine. We have nothing negative to say about the whole experience and we will certainly be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1295,Doesn't disappoint.,50,October 2017,"We have stayed at U Passha several times now and cannot fault the service or amenities.
Location is everything, and U Paasha is very well located in the heart of some of the best restaurants and shopping.
Breakfast is consistently good as is the room for cleanliness.
The rooftop pool is always a pleasure, offering plenty of full sun or shaded lounges.
There has only been one time that we had an issue with a leaking ceiling (air-con) and our concerns were quickly dealt with and we were moved and up-graded without hesitation.
The staff have always been helpful and obliging, and always very polite.
We will continue to stay with U Passha as we travel to Bali frequently.",U Paasha Seminyak
1296,Terrible staff,10,October 2017,"One of your staff in the desk gave me the room key but I didn’t work 3times. So I had to go and back from my room to front desk again and again. But she didnt even apologize to me and didnt try to go with me to my room. The only thing she did is to say that “try one more time”, or “you might put the keep with your phone” , sitting in front of desk.",U Paasha Seminyak
1297,Sami,10,November 2017,"Pricy considering the low lever of customer service they have, in the third day of our stay, we went out in the morning and came back afternoon found out the room as is !so we have had to call them to send someone to clean and replace towels, as usually they don’t replace towels.
In addition, there is sewerage smell in the room and what’s even more terrible is, the Maintanance work they do in the afternoon which is very noisy and can’t make you sleep. So don’t even think to sleep in the afternoon.
Overall it’s terrible wouldn’t recommended t anyone and will never come here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1298,Great holiday stay,50,October 2017,"Located in the heart of Seminyak, pool has all day sun and fantastic food/drinks service. The staff are always friendly and welcoming and always willing to accommodate your nees. Best thing about U Paasha is that the beds are so so comfortable",U Paasha Seminyak
1299,Another relaxing trip in Paradise,50,October 2017,"Whenever I stay in Seminyak I enjoy this hotel as the rooms are much bigger than others in the same area, service and hospitality is well above. Breakfast buffet is kinda boring but for what you pay for it is an excellent choice, even though you may walk to Sisterfield and pay more for healthy choices. Management is superb here and the room is always available even super early arrivals",U Paasha Seminyak
1300,"Location, location, location!",50,October 2017,"Some of the best eateries in Seminyak, right at your door step!

Fabulous hotel, great pool area and a lovely daily breakfast with plenty of choice. A special mention to the Hotel Manager, Daniel, who couldn't do enough for us.

Thank you, we will be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1301,Return visit - still producing outstanding value,50,October 2017,"Returning visit and doesn't disappoint... from the roof top pool to the great buffet breakfast to the central locality - highly recommend and at affordable rates. Staff are friendly and go out of there way to make your stay comfortable.

Central location makes it a breeze to travel where ever you want to get to. A Blue Bird is generally about 40,000 one way into Kuta.

Try go for a room in levels 3 or 5 towards to keep away from the front street noise - but you really don't notice it once indoors.

Very basic gym area - but has enough to get you by with cardio equipment, machine weights and various hex dumb bells.

No need to bring pool towels as the resort provides for you and then you return upon conclusion of your swim on the roof top.",U Paasha Seminyak
1302,Hope it can maintain like how it was before,30,October 2017,"Stayed here before and it has downgraded since the last time I stayed. The front office did not ask what soap we want to choose, or explained its checkout procedure which we already knew, so I asked if it was still the same. We were given room 314 which smelled like a sewer, and asked if we can move because despite bell boy wanting to put aromatherapy, it will take a while before it can smell normal since we checked in at 9:40 pm at night and ready to rest. The next room given, you can see the mirror is full of of wear and tear with marks all over as in picture. But for us better speckled mirror than a smelly room. Loved this place during first stay so decided to come back, but second time not as good as it was before. Too bad.....because we paid more compared to staying in Amadea or Ize which is just next door same location, but picked this place for its comfort and better quality.",U Paasha Seminyak
1303,Loved it,40,September 2017,"We really liked this hotel and believe its good value for money. The rooftop pool and bar have a good vibe. Good music playing whilst relaxing assisted with prompt service was a plus.
The rooms are large and well furnished and had no issues.
Breakfast was adequate.
Location was perfect for us.
I marked it down 1 purely due to the smell on the lower levels. We were lucky enough to be a little higher but as soon as you reached level 1 or the lift there was a sewerage smell. I wouldn't say this would turn me off returning on the provision I wasn't on the ground floor.",U Paasha Seminyak
1304,Loved this hotel! Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Seminyak after our visit!,50,August 2017,"We stayed at U Paasha for 10 nights and we could not fault this hotel in any way. Not only is the location perfect but the hotel staff are very friendly, the rooms are modern, clean, spacious and cosy and the pool area is unbelievable!
We spent many days by the pool, the atmosphere is lovely and the poolside food is also fantastic!

This hotel made our Bali experience extra special! We look forward to returning to U Paasha in the future! Thank you for a great stay!

Would also recommend Batik restaurant right across the road from U Paasha for anyone planning to visit, great restaurant!",U Paasha Seminyak
1305,Second visit - still good just some minor things,40,October 2017,"Second visit to this place in 1.5 years. It hasn’t changed and is how I remember it.

The good points are definitely the location in Seminyak, the roof top pool is fantastic and relaxed to be able to unwind each day. The view from the pool and the bar area is great of the entire area and sunset. Staff are very good and helpful. The breakfast is also very nice with variety for anyone’s tastes.

The room however is a bit outdated for what is a premium hotel. The room we were in had rust staining to the mirror and other stains on the couches. The air conditioning is a problem, it is ok and good enough but a separate wall mounted unit would also work better then the current option. Ours froze over and it was cooler outside than inside. To the staff credit at midnight when I called reception their maintenance did repair it and it was again repaired about 17 hours later. It’s a poor system for this priced hotel though.",U Paasha Seminyak
1306,Great location,40,October 2017,"Located in the heart of eat street, surrounded by bars and restaurants, you can’t beat this hotel for location.

Rooms are spacious and clean. Room is equipped with coffee and tea making facilities, hair dryer, dressing gown and slippers.

The second best thing about this hotel is the roof top skimming pool. Surrounding buildings never obstruct the sun so you can sun ale all day long. Service poolside is fast and friendly. Room service is good too.

Gym is small and has limited equipment which wouldn’t bother too many people, however you might need to look for an alternative gym if you want a good one.

Staff are friendly and happy to help with most requests.

I did however email prior to booking requesting a price without breakfast and unfortunately they could not do this.

Overall this hotel is good and location is fabulous.",U Paasha Seminyak
1307,Fantastic hotel in great location.,50,October 2017,"Absolutely can’t top this for location and service. Stayed with a friend for 10 days for a girls holiday and we couldn’t fault it.
Rooms are large even when set up as a twin configuration, and with two vanities and a huge wardrobe we were more than happy.
Food and beverage staff are always friendly and the front desk will always go out of their way to help with any queries and have great English.
Great breakfast selection with an egg station as well as pancakes, waffles, pastries and custom coffee to order (that tastes great!)
Plenty of space and loungers at the rooftop pool and the food and drinks menu is great. Allow a bit of time between drinks though as sometimes it can get busy.
Sunset view is great and the rooftop BBQ is awesome, especially the lobster which is small so very sweet.
Rooms are clean and housekeeping take pride in their work.
Shower has a rain head and is HUGE!
There is no door on the entry to the bathroom, just doors to the shower and toilet cubicles so this may bother some?
Good range of toiletries and the front desk will provide anything else you’re missing.
Room service menu and service are great too.
What more could you want...?!",U Paasha Seminyak
1308,Just perfect - especially after falling ill,50,October 2017,"My husband and I stayed here after leaving another hotel fairly unhappy during our honeymoon. On first arrival we were immediately impressed with the location, warmth and professionalism of the staff in every position. Our room was standard and MUCH bigger and better fitted out than the deluxe suite we had come from in another hotel.

The bathroom is open plan with a huge shower with two shower heads. The bed was incredibly big (European king I think) and extremely comfortable. AC was perfectly cold. TV stations were clear. Mini bar great.

The rooftop pool was lovely and relaxing with tunes playing all day. Lots of deck chairs and double beds. Wait staff on hand for drinks and food, reasonably priced (not super cheap but v good for not having to leave to get it!)

Breakfast brilliant, abundant serves and excellent barista coffee on demand as part of breakfast... this is very rare in Bali.

The thing that impressed us the most was nothing was too much trouble. I fell seriously ill with awful food poisoning (from food purchased elsewhere) and the GM of the hotel answered a FB message (in minutes) to assist heating a hot pack for my tummy in his own personal microwave (microwaves aren't common in Balinese kitchens etc) within minutes staff were attending the room to heat the pack and offer any help needed. This is truly exceptional service. Both my husband and myself fell very ill for days and were so comfortable in the hotel and felt valued and cared for. Thank you, We will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1309,"Nice hotel, good location",40,September 2017,"Modern hotel which was really nice, not far from Seminyak Square, Favela and the Seminyak shopping and restaurants. Good rooftop pool. Breakfast was decent, made to order eggs, fruit, cereal etc.
Bedrooms were large with a balcony, comfortable mattresses and clean. Free wifi. Good pick for Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1310,3 nights in seminyak,30,October 2017,"My partner and I stayed at u paasha for 3 nights at the end of 2 weeks in Bali recently and chose u paasha for our final nights.

First impressions: the foyer is very grand and impressive. Check in was easy and speedy. And the staff were nice.

As soon as you walk out of the spacious, airy hotel lobby you feel a bit like you are in a hospital or derelict building the corridor is low ceiling, low lit polished cement with very average street art for sale. It's like the hotel has 2 different personalities.

Our room was very nicely appointed. But it smelt like a mixture of chlorine and an open septic system. We couldn't open our window because directly outside was a building site which looked like a rubbish dump as well. So the curtain stayed closed. The air con was noisy.

The pool area was very cool with a great view. Though the pool is only about 3ft deep.

The breakfast was buffet and it was excellent. The location is very central to some nice shopping.

If they just fixed the bad smell (without doing a yuck air scent cover up), fixed the dodgy air con and spruce up the corridors a bit it would feel like it was worth the $150/ night.",U Paasha Seminyak
1311,Excellent location,50,October 2017,Enjoyed our stay. Great location on eat street. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast and huge rooms. No bath unfortunately. Will stay again. Only issue was very smelly toilet/shower on rooftop. Tip is to book directly through their website - we booked through Booking.com only to find it was nearly half the price on UPaasha website - this may have been due to how quiet Bali is due to Mt Agung threatening to explode!,U Paasha Seminyak
1312,"Nice hotel, but don't count on sleeping",30,October 2017,"The hotel is quite good, staff pleasant and facilities good. 24hr room booking period is great - your check out time is the time you checked in - as I arrived close to midnight and left on a late flight 4 days later, this worked out well for me.

I had a room on the 3rd floor. Room was large and comfortable, however the air conditioning noise is quite astonishing. I went to bed with ear plugs, but couldn't sleep. I ended up turning it off around 2am, but was awake again at 4 as it had gotten so hot and humid, plus I was being bitten by mosquitoes (the ac had kept them at bay). So on it went again. To give you an idea, I would compare it to a 2 stroke motorbike idling right outside your window - vibrating & oscillating in timbre.

I asked reception in the morning and they sent a service guy to the room who said it sounded normal, so they put me in a ground floor room. At first the air con sounded an improvement, but soon after, additional motors started up and it was just as loud. I only got 2-3 hours sleep the second night as well.

I didn't go back to reception as there was clearly nothing they could do and they weren't really that interested. All of the rooms seem to have the same ac unit - you can hear them all droning even when mine was off.

After three sleepless nights, I was a wreck. I managed to get a sleeping tablet from a friend & finally got a proper night's sleep.

I see from earlier posts that management claim to have fixed all noisy ac units and to have stoped the condensation dripping, but this is not the case. I travel a lot and stay in many hotels, so used to dealing with new rooms and noises, but this is definitely unacceptably loud.

I left feeling exhausted from the stay and extremely frustrated as I knew that my only alternative would have been to find another hotel, which would have just detracted further from the limited time I had to spend with my friends (staying in a villa nearby), celebrating a birthday.",U Paasha Seminyak
1313,Such a fun stay!,50,October 2017,"We recently got married in Bali and needed to pick a place to stay with friends and family during this time and before we moved to the wedding villa.

A few things were needed
1- Rooftop pool
2 - Central
3 - Nice yet affordable

This hotel delivered all of this and we are so glad we choose to stay here, we did however pay more than mots of our guest to get a special deluxe suite as it was for our wedding trip we were happy to splurge although ended up with identical rooms to the rest of our guests who paid less although it was a big room that was really clean and everything we needed.

I was in a great location, walking distance to shops and cafes.
The staff were amazing - Especially Gede, he made our stay so much better and all of our friends loved him too.
The view was terrible - just a big rubbish tip underneath to look at but we didn't really mind.

Thanks so much and can't wait till the next time we stay with you guys!",U Paasha Seminyak
1314,Great hotel,50,October 2017,"This hotel was great. Rooms are large & well appointed, but mirrors & shower could do with update, looking a bit worn & tired. Staff & location excellent. Rooftop pool & bar amazing. Great for couples",U Paasha Seminyak
1315,Wonderful staff and Service made me feel family,40,October 2017,"The service overall were great, staff were friendly made me feel like come back home. Yes, partly because I was like returning home. However, we found some other horrible guests who were unbelievable attitude, but that nothing to do with the service. The room was a bit over priced, but the service was great then we didn't mind to pay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1316,Great location to restaurants and shopping,50,October 2017,"This hotel was very central for restaurants, day trips and shopping. Breakfast was fresh and well kept. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooftop pool and bar was a great place to catch up with friends. There was occasional noise from neighbouring properties if you are a light sleeper.",U Paasha Seminyak
1317,Great find,50,October 2017,Love this hotel - have now stayed here 2/3 times when transiting through Bali. Staff are incredible and hotel is very well-priced for the size of the rooms. Great pool and great location right in the centre of seminyak!,U Paasha Seminyak
1318,Seminyak luxury on a budget,50,October 2017,We love this hotel in central Seminyak. Fantastic service and great food and little extras you don’t expect for such a reasonable price. Our twin room on the 5th floor was very spacious - plenty of room for two girls with copious luggage and two basins for putting on makeup. The bathroom was enormous. We spent a lot of time in the rooftop pool drinking cocktails under the umbrellas. Bliss,U Paasha Seminyak
1319,Great all rounder,50,September 2017,"We went on a girls weekend to Bali and stayed here for 3 nights with adjoining rooms. The rooms were well presents and spacious, the only negatives were the smell (I think from the air con) and view from the window but it did not affect our holiday. The breakfast was AMAZING - the chef made a special effort for one of our gluten intolerance friends and there was plenty of choice. the location was perfect for everything. The staff were very friendly and helpful.The pool was fabulous and really quiet with great views and good food and cocktails available. we will return :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1320,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, A Few Issues",30,September 2017,"The hotel is well located in central Seminyak close to many restaurants, shops and a short walk to the beach. Everything you may need was within easy reach. The staff were friendly and did their best to assist when you had any problems or needed something, they can't be faulted.

The rooftop pool was great and restaurant/bar near the pool was a great place to cool off as it had a cool breeze and a great view over Seminyak out to the sea. Breakfast was also excellent. A wide selection of food as well as an egg and pancake station that cooked eggs, pancakes and waffles to order.

Our room was a room with a view on the 5th floor. We arrived early afternoon and due to the ""check-out 24 hours after you arrive"" policy our room was not going to be ready for another hour. As compensation we were given a free lunch at the rooftop restaurant which was a nice touch.

The room itself was huge with a sort of open plan bathroom and good views across Seminyak. The bed was firm but comfortable and there was plenty of room to hang up clothes and store suitcases.

Now to the issues we had. The air-conditioning in our room was not working properly for the majority of our stay. We noticed the room wasn't cooling very well but it was cooler than outside so we didn't think much of it until the second morning when my wife almost slipped and broke her neck as the air conditioning had leaked water in the ceiling which had then dripped onto the polished concrete floor making it very dangerous.

We called reception and reported the issue and, as we were heading out for the day, said it was fine for them to come to our room and fix the issue. We returned that afternoon and the air conditioning was no longer leaking but still not very cool.

The next morning we woke up in a sauna. The air conditioning had shut down some time during the night and could not be turned back on. Again we called reception to ask them to send someone up to fix the problem. While we were out the air conditioning was fixed as it was running when we got back to the room but it was blowing out warm, humid air and it was 29 degrees Celsius in the room. We called reception again and the engineers came back and re-gassed the air conditioning unit on our balcony. The room then began to cool so we thought all was good. Later that evening we noticed that water was again leaking in the ceiling. We called reception the following morning to let them know and we were asked if we wanted to change rooms which we said we did as the leaking water was dangerous.

We were due to take a day trip up to the north of Bali that morning so we said we would be able to move rooms that evening when we returned from the day trip and the man at reception said that was fine. As it turns out the day trip we thought we had booked with a driver/guide was a day trip with a driver only which was the other issue I'll describe later.

We got back from our aborted day trip a lot earlier than expected so had to wait in our room until our new room was ready. Once we were given the OK to move rooms we were moved to a room further to the back on the 5th floor. We notice the new room was not particularly cool either and checked the air conditioning, it was not working properly either. So, another call to reception and the engineer was sent up to our new room to re-gas the air conditioning unit for this room also. The air conditioning then worked for our last night in Bali. The other problem with this room was that ot was underneath the rooftop bar/restaurant which had wooden decking. So, everytime someone moved a chair or table the noise from the dragging across the wooden decking was loudly heard in our room.

The other issue we had was with the day trip we booked through the hotel. We were wanting to book a day tour up to Lovina stopping at various places along the way with a driver/guide to show us around. The trip we booked was quite expensive but we booked last minute so it is what it is.

We went down to the reception area at 8am and our ""guide"" was sitting waiting for us in his jeans and t-shirt playing with his phone. He looked up and asked if I was the person going on the tour and when I said I was we went downstairs and he got his car from underneath the hotel. He didn't speak to us at all and all seemed a bit odd. We got into the car waiting for him to start explaining where we were going and well, nothing other than some bizarre offer to pick us up after dinner in Jimbaran? Alarm bells were starting to ring but we persevered. After 10 minutes of driving though Seminyak and not a word other than muttering at traffic I realised I had not locked the room safe so asked if we could go back to the hotel. After three attempts he understood what I was asking and we went back to the hotel. By now I was not getting a good vibe from the driver but I locked the safe and then we went back out of Seminyak and drove on and on in silence other than muttering and the occasional play with his phone and arrived at our first stop, Taman Ayun in Mengwi. We had been here before but thought it was easier to pretend we hadn't than explain we had seen it before. The driver gout out of the car, went and got out entry tickets then told us to call him on his phone in an hour when we were done. What? We didn't have a phone! He said he'd be ""over there"" and to come and get him in an hour. We looked at each other and decided that as this was not what we had asked for or thought we had paid for then we would rather just go back to the hotel.

I walked over to the driver as he was settling in for a cigarette and something to eat and asked that he take us back to the hotel as we were of the belief that were to have a driver/guide not just a taxi driver drop us off at each place. He offered to ""call a friend"" to show us around the temple but we insisted we go back to the hotel. We then spent about 45 minutes going back to the hotel in a car in which the driver decided to turn off the air conditioning and spend the entire time mutter to himself. We got back to the hotel and he made a quick exit.

The man at reception through whom we booked the trip came over to us asking what went wrong. The driver had called ahead. We explained that we wanted a trip with a driver/guide and that for the money we paid there was no way that simply having a taxi driver for the day was acceptable. We could have flagged a taxi down outside the hotel and paid less than half what we paid to have them drive us to where we wanted to go. The man from reception apologised and said that it was not common for tours in Bali to include a driver/guide or a separate guide. We pointed out that on our last visit to Bali we took a couple of day tours with a driver/guide that were cheaper than the trip we booked through the hotel. We were not charged for the tour which was great but it did ruin our day. The reason I have gone into this much detail about the tour is because the company it was booked though, Bali Ketut Adventures, doesn't seem to have a TripAdvisor page to review them. Perhaps the hotel can look for another preferred supplier as we found a couple of tours online that were cheaper and included and driver/guide for the same trip we had booked through the hotel and cheaper.

Overall, the hotel was good. If we did not have so many issues with the air conditioning then the rating would probably have been 4 or 5 but it impacted heavily on our stay so a rating of 3 given.",U Paasha Seminyak
1321,U Paasha Seminyak,40,September 2017,"If you're not on a tight $$ budget holiday, this would be a wonderful hotel to stay in.
There are plenty of eateries around U Paasha Hotel. A Great shopping experience.
There's nearby Padang food as well.",U Paasha Seminyak
1322,Luxury in the heart of Seminyak's Eat Street,50,September 2017,"We can't thank the staff at U-Paasha enough for everything they did for us in the first week of our stay with them. I won't go into detail, but if you find yourself falling ill, I can guarantee that you will get 5-star treatment at U-Paasha.

U-Paasha is located in the heart of 'Eat Street' (Jln Laksmana) and is well appointed with an incredible roof-top pool, bar and restaurant. The view from this floor is spectacular. If you don't make sunset drinks on the beach, this is the place to watch the sun slip into the horizon.

The pool is more of a plunge pool which makes it perfect for families with young children. It's long enough if you want to swim a few laps, but I would do this first thing in the morning before guests take up spots on the comfortable sun lounges. And for those, like me, who don't take too much sun, there are plenty of umbrellas.

The pool-side service is excellent (extra special mentions to Tania, Rini and Gede for taking care of us up on the roof).

There is a regular seafood banquet on the roof-top each Mon/Wed/Fri that you must indulge in - the food was delicious, served fresh to order. A strong contender for best meal on 'Eat Street'.

The 'Healthy Choice' option on the roof-top menu is worth ordering as well, with a selection of leaves, protein, condiments and dressings for you to choose to create a delicious and satisfying meal.

Another great meal at U-Paasha is the buffet breakfast. Clean and fresh with a great selection. (special mention, in particular, to wait-staff member Guna. His enthusiasm for life is infectious).

We all indulged in the free yoga lesson on the rooftop grassed area behind the pool. Pitched at an advanced beginners level, it is an atmospheric place to pratice yoga as the sun sets.

The room we were in was spacious and very comfortable (especially given we all spent a bit more time in the room than we had envisaged). Special mentions for the beds - one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on.

U-Paasha is within walking distance to a number of shops and restaurants (make sure you head down to Motel Mexicola then swing past Mad Pops for the coconut-based ice cream - there is a reason why there is a queue out the front of this shop all times of the day).

Will we return? Absolutely. U-Paasha is the home of Hospitality.",U Paasha Seminyak

Great location close to great restaurants and markets.,U Paasha Seminyak
1324,Location location location,50,September 2017,This hotel was very convenient in terms of location. A lot of restaurants such as mamasan and revolver espressowere walking distance and day trips to other places were very cheap and fast provided you left early enough during the day. The staff was very prompt and fixed our a/c twice. The room was clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend this hotel for first timers in bali.,U Paasha Seminyak

1327,Great Holiday,50,September 2017,"Best place to stay in Bali, great holiday hotel best pool on roof lovely views, great shopping nearby also great restaurants in hotel and nearby, the people who work at the hotel are always smiling and happy love to go back one day",U Paasha Seminyak
1328,Mother and Daughter Weekend,50,September 2017,"A great weekend away with my daughter to celebrate her birthday. The hotel was in a great location, the staff were very welcoming and the room was spacious and clean. Our daily breakfast (included in the room rate) had lots on offer.",U Paasha Seminyak
1329,"Nice hotel, steep prices",40,September 2017,"We arrived at the hotel in september '17. We were picked up at the airport by a driver as agreed beforehand. Rooftop pool was nice and the room was as well. Shower and toilet are separated, and the shower was a bit dirty. Breakfast was good, but I got food poisioning after our last breakfast here. The hotel also charge crazy prices for hiring drivers and other services, do that on your own and save up to 50%. Staff is friendly and servce-minded.",U Paasha Seminyak
1330,4 Day Stay,40,September 2017,"I booked a short stay based on Trip Advisor reviews.
My room wasn't ready on check in at 2pm. I waited at the pool with a complimentary drink to be contacted when the room was ready, approx 30 mins. After 1 hour I had to ask the staff to contact reception to see if the room was ready and it was.
I was in Room 104 which is the same level as reception and only 2 doors down from reception and the lift. I could hear breakfast being set up in the early hours of the morning, guests coming in late, street noise. I would not choose this room if you are a light sleeper.
The room itself was clean, spacious, no view. No bath.
The bed was soft (pillow top), super comfy. Pillows were also soft.
Minibar was not included.
Hairdryer was small so took a while to dry hair.
Safe in room and coat hangers.
Pool is rooftop so small. Not ideal for children other than it being shallow. All single deck chairs had umbrellas but the large day beds didn't, these were mostly unoccupied as it was too hot to sit in direct sun most of the day which wasted at least 6 places for couples or individuals.
The breakfast buffet is standard fare. The BBQ in the evening was ok but I would choose eating out over this. Quantity is not quality. The Nasi Goreng however was Delicious and I could have eaten that daily!!
The hotel staff are polite and courteous.
I didn't get to try the cooking class or massages. The hotel prices are more expensive than on the street.
The location is very central to Seminyak shopping, food and beaches. Easy walking distances.",U Paasha Seminyak
1331,Excellent Stay,40,September 2017,"Everything about the stay was first class , Reception , Dining , Hotel Room and swimming pool , if I return to Bali I would certainly use this Hotel again , and would have no problem recommending this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1332,U-Paasha wedding party,40,September 2017,"The hotel is a close distance to everything in Seminyak. We walked to Potato Head beach-club without any great trouble. Great staff, breakfasts and roof-top pool. Walking distance to Motel Mexicola, Rumours and many other great restaurants. Great ice-creameries including a vegan shop on the same street.",U Paasha Seminyak
1333,Amazing!,50,September 2017,"So overly happy with this hotel and the staff, they are amazing! The rooms were clean & so spacious, the staff were incredible, the food is so yummy, the pool was wonderful, certainly not a view of a dump site as mentioned by someone else! The view is the whole of Bali, it's amazing!! Rooms were made up every single day, buffet breakfast is included daily, and we would 150% recommend anybody stay here! When we return to Bali, this will definitely be our go to hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
1334,Great value,50,September 2017,"This is a lovely hotel, staff are super friendly and service great. Very clean rooms and prices which include breakfast is good value. They offer 24/7 time turn around when you book - for example if you check in at 2 in the morning, you can check out at 2 am the next day - so you truly get 24 hours for what you pay. Such a great idea and good value. You can also have breakfast within your 24 hour period, so if you miss breakfast - you can still get it whenever you want. Thank you to Chelsea who gave us a good deal - we have a great time here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1335,Will be coming back.,50,September 2017,"Great central location. Super clean, friendly staff. Big rooms, modern bathrooms. We loved the service at the Rooftop Bar.

1339,What a view.,40,September 2017,Lovely BBQ meal and bar on the rooftop. Possibly the best view is all of Bali. Definitely the best view in Seminak. Food is great and the singing / entertaining staff are a hoot. The rooftop pool is out of this world. One of the best kept secrets in the precinct. Loved it.,U Paasha Seminyak
1340,Semit J,40,September 2017,"Firstly , Thanks for the hospitality

And also ,for the floor,housekeeping and culinary team members who made the U brand what it is .

Breakfasts are a good place to watch the world go by .literally , as it's everyone from all corners of this planet .

100 meters when you turn left exiting the front of hotel is Revolver . Best Capps/lattes/juices and own product branding , and core business serving up scrumptious creations etc along with the best vibe and atmosphere and traditional decor and collectables on offer.

Cleanest unisex restroom I've ever seen .

1343,Great value for money!,50,September 2017,"Centrally located near Seminyak Square/Village, though surprisingly quiet given its close proximity to numerous bars, restaurants and cafes.

Sensational restaurants out the front of the hotel too!
Staff are always friendly and go out of the way for you.
Rooms are very modern clean and spacious I always have a great night sleep.",U Paasha Seminyak
1346,Great Location,40,October 2016,This hotel is located right in the middle of the seminyak strip. Was the perfect place to be when wanting to stay around seminyak. Service was great. Breakfast amazing. We did have a faulty toilet but the hotel fixed asap. No dramas.,U Paasha Seminyak

1349,Why stay anywhere else?,40,August 2017,"This is my 4th time staying at Upaasha and its all because of the location being in the middle of buzzing Seminyak, the friendly staff who are on call 24/7 and the amazing buffet breakfast... what more could you want?!",U Paasha Seminyak
1350,"Great location, amazing rooftop pool",40,August 2017,Perfect location for Seminyak. The rooftop pool is a highlight. Rooms were huge and spotlessly clean. Fantastic experience all round. Head to Revolver for excellent coffee and La Silcia for out of this world dinners.,U Paasha Seminyak

The stay were friendly and accommodating. A highlight is the quality of the breakfast, it was beautiful.",U Paasha Seminyak
1353,"Love U, U Paasha. 24 hour check-out, rooftop pool and free beer for the win!",50,September 2017,"Love U, U Paasha!
This was my second visit to U Paasha in Seminyak, Bali. It is now one of my favourite hotels for the following reasons:
• 24-hour room use: Meaning, whatever time you check-in, you also get to check-out. This is fantastic considering I often arrive in Bali around 11pm-Midnight and therefore get to check out whenever I want on the day that I’m leaving! Checking out at 11am-Noon sucks, especially when you have mega hangover from celebrating your last night in Bali, (or commiserating having to go home and back to work), and just need to sleep it off. It’s also good if you have a late flight and want to shower before going to the airport. Plus, it’s also a waste of money to only use the room for a couple of hours while awake. So yeah, love it!
• Excellent central location nears restaurants, bars and Seminyak Square, and yet still a quiet oasis.
• Great breakfast.
• Great rooftop pool with lots of chairs, and bar with 360 view.
• The rooms are always exceptionally clean.
• Huge bathrooms with your choice of scented amenities like soap, moisturiser and shower gel (love the Jasmine and Wild Orchid).
• Extra comfy and huge bed with choice of pillows.
• Super nice staff.
• And finally, one free beer (or juice) to have whenever you like.

Sitting by a rooftop pool with a free beer in Bali… what could be better?",U Paasha Seminyak
1354,Great Rooftop BBQ,40,August 2017,"Went here for dinner for the food top BBQ , food amazing and cooked fresh , grilled prawns , small lobster tails grilled , wok station , seafood kebabs ect , will definitely go again , book before you go..",U Paasha Seminyak
1355,Nice hotel and good location,40,September 2017,"Our room was really nice, spacious and clean. The hotel location is great, right in the middle of Seminyak so an easy walk to lots of places.
The gym is quite good. Dumbbells, bench, cardio machines and some fixed resistance machines. The pool is on the roof and is really nice.
Breakfast here was really, really good. Lots of choice and very tasty. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1356,Amazing rooftop BBQ,50,August 2017,"The BBQ which is held every Monday, Wednesday and Friday evening is fabulous! Such good value for delicious, quality food, with excellent service. Escape the noise and fumes of the streets and watch the sun go down with a fantastic view. The cocktails were also the best we had in Seminyak and you can get happy hour 241 up till 7pm. We went back a second time and were welcomed back warmly. Highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
1357,3rd stay,30,August 2017,"I love this place, which is why i keep returning however after 3 stays in less than 3 years I would by now expect that I am remembered as a returning customer. While the service is lovely by all, it is not as personal as you would hope. Also there was a funny sewer type smell outside of our room that house keepinig attempted to fix by spraying 'something' in our room, this didnt help,
Everything else about this place is great, location, breakfast, pool, rooms, beds etc",U Paasha Seminyak
1358,Prime Location in heart of Seminyak,40,August 2017,"When child free we always stay at Upaasha, due to its super friendly staff (Especially Hotel Manager Devi) and its Awesome location. across the road from Ginger Moon, Ultimo and Chandi which are some of our favourite restaurants. Earth cafe down the road and your on the shopping strip so can walk everywhere.

Hotel rooms are great! the only thing i miss is a bath. Roof top pool is Awesome and a great place to watch the sun rise then take an early swim.

Thanks again Upaasha see you again soon :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1359,Good value for money,40,August 2017,Nice location in Seminyak so you don't need to travel far. Rooms are spacious and have all the conveniences you need although getting slightly tired. Rooftop pool is perfect for lazing the day away with a cocktail from the rooftop bar. Excellent service from staff too.,U Paasha Seminyak
1360,Wonderful hotel,50,August 2017,"Stayed at the U Paasha, for 7 nights, this hotel is lovely, had a great experience, the staff were amazing, the room was clean and comfortable, as was the bed, breakfast, and all the other meals we had, were delicious, the rooftop pool, a nice oasis, from the busy Seminyak streets, great location, close to lots of nice restaurants, and shops, mini mart across the road, could not fault this hotel, would certainly return for another stay",U Paasha Seminyak
1361,One the best value and location,50,August 2017,"Stayed with my wife here twice. Great value and location. Good surrounding area, close to many hype places in seminyak area so pretty much can walk around the area. Room is very nice and spacious with cool design.",U Paasha Seminyak
1362,Fantastic Place,50,July 2017,"Great place to stay, extremely central, restaurants, shopping, bars & beach. Tastiest breakfast in Bali. Offer great value traditional Bali cooking classes with head chief Taskar MGuna which includes. Using fish from the market then back to UPaasha to cook and eat. staff understand service from Devi at reception to G'day at the roof top pool lots of laughter. Nothing beats having. Few cold beers watching the planes come in waiting for the grilled seafood BBQ and chatting to Daniel to Manager who has time for everyone. Going back in October counting the days.",U Paasha Seminyak
1363,You got to hit the buffet if you're in town,50,August 2017,"Upaasha buffet was like an oasis - a good priced restaurant in a sea of rip offs. Seriously, i went to Seminyak in 2008 and almost fell off my chair this time around. I didn't really go to Bali to spend $100 on bloody mexican food so when I passed a sign with all you can eat seafood and ribs buffet (including a free beer) for around $20 i though all my Christmas' had come at once. I was on a family trip and my snobby yet poor brother (i mean, come on dude) was already skeptical but my logical and poor other brother was all up for this buffet like I was. So off we all went (7 of us).

Everyone in my family rated this place - even my skeptical brother. Finally I could stuff my face without worrying about my hip pocket. The cocktails (half price from 5pm to 7pm) actually had a kick to them which was a nice change from everywhere else. The buffet had ribs which were falling off the bone, BBQ prawns, fish, calamari, a noodle stand, salads, etc all freshly cooked in front of you. I reckon i had a full pig's worth of ribs they were so good. And the seafood chowder - damn. Even my mum who likes the finer things in life couldn't shut up about the chowder. I reckon I had four bowls.

I lost 3kg in Bali which was unusual. If it wasn't for Upaasha i probably would have lost 5kg.

Don't miss this buffet!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1364,Excellent hotel,50,August 2017,Top hotel with open well laid out facilities which complemented the local environment. The room was very spacious and quiet whilst the large pool area was magnificent with great ocean views. The buffet breakfast was excellent. Highly recommended hotel!,U Paasha Seminyak
1365,Location is excellent,40,August 2017,"Amazing location right in the heart of 'Eat Street'. Within walking distance to a range of restaurants and bars. Beach is about a 15 min walk away. Fantastic rooftop pool with lots of loungers and day beds. Service at the pool is excellent, with food and drinks very reasonably priced.
There is a selection available for breakfast, but it's not the best I've tasted.
Room is serviced daily but I did notice that the floor is not swept, which is a basic I would have expected. There was also a slight issue with smell from the shower drain although his was rectified after 3 days of bleaching it.
Fantastic complimentary massage was included in our room rate which I cannot fault, although this is outsourced as there is no gym or spa facility on site. You can have this by the pool which is a nice treat in the afternoon as the sun is beginning to set.
Staff are very friendly and accommodating.
Had the BBQ one night which is available on the rooftop 3 nights per week. It was average. The food at the pool in the day is much better! But if you're looking for a cheap dinner and don't want to leave the hotel, then it's fine. Otherwise I would very much recommend going across the road to outside restaurants as they are so close. Would definitely go back as the location cannot be improved on!",U Paasha Seminyak
1366,In the midst of everything!,40,August 2017,"It was my friend's first time in Bali, and because we only had 4 days, we wanted to stay at central as possible, close to all the action and popular restaurants/bars. This is what led us to U Paasha Hotel.

Service was great during check-in, and was also quick. Rooms were massive for 2 people, and had double basins in the bathroom (win!). There is no door to seperate the bathroom from the bedroom, but the shower had a door and it was so big that you could get changed easily in the shower, if sharing with friends.

My friend and I shared a king size bed, which was so comfortable and could of easily fit 2 more people. Breakfast was included in our rate, which we had delivered to us each morning. It was okay. Lacked a lot of flavor, and most of the things came cold. Towards the end of our stay, we opted to eat out for breakfast. Sisterfields cafe is a definite must and only a 3 minute walk away. Besides the breakfast menu, everything else on the menu was really tasty and reasonably priced.

My favourite thing about the hotel was the rooftop pool. Spent many afternoons on the sun lounge listening to the music in the background (great music btw!). There were staff available if you wanted to order any drinks or food whilst you were relaxing. Also can't forget to mention the view. It really does deliver. You can see all the way out to the ocean. So beautiful.

Very minor things that I can comment on was we did notice small ants near the TV. They weren't an issue for us, but may bother others. Also, our room was on level 5 (room with a view), and every morning we could hear banging, directly above us, on the roof (where the pool/gym/bar is). Not sure if the staff are cleaning or moving stuff around, but fortunately my friend and I started our mornings early, so didn't mind too much.

One thing to keep in mind, although no fault of the hotel, is that because it is so central, there is really bad traffic on the street. I would not bother catching a taxi from the hotel, and walk up a bit where the traffic dies down, as you will find yourself sitting in the taxi, right next to the hotel for a good 5-10 minutes before going anywhere.

Looking forward to staying here again in the future! :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1367,awesome stay,40,September 2016,"this hotel was our second hotel in Bali, we had a lovely stay there, the room was very spacious, comfortable bed, very clean, like the design. rooftop swimming pool was cosy specially during sunset, in great location. overall, lovely stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1368,Perfect,40,August 2017,"We stayed her for a few nights for our anniversary. Hotel is modern (has elevator) and fairly clean for the most part. My only suggestion is for the staff to do a deep cleaning in the bathroom- the shower walls were a bit dirty.

The breakfast buffet was really good. Loved the Indonesian dishes. There were also breakfast pastries- I liked the chocolate croissants. There was also an egg station and you could request how you wanted your eggs which included eggs Benedict. There was a paper for you to mark how you wanted your eggs. Don't forget your coffee!! A lot of choices for coffee- I liked the iced latte. Oh and I loved that you could order breakfast any time anywhere in case you missed the breakfast buffet. It helped save some money from eating out.

The location is perfect- right on Eat Street. It felt very safe to walk in that area with lots of shops and restaurants/bars. Will def stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1369,Great Hotel,50,August 2017,"We enjoyed everything about our stay, room was fantastic and very spacious. The pool and sunbeds were fantastic, we watched the sunset each night. The location made our planning very easy as it was so central.",U Paasha Seminyak
1370,Great location & value thoroughly enjoyed it...our new place!,50,August 2017,"We thoroughly loved our stay at U Paasha...great location close to some fabulous restaurants many of which are favourites as well as proximate to all the major parts of Seminyak.
Great amenities, pool, gym, Alcove Restaurant and the Rooftop Bar with the sunsets make it a ""no-brainer' ...very easy stay.
Staff were extremely helpful and courteous...",U Paasha Seminyak
1371,Not worthed,20,August 2017,The service level was not expected as the price you pay. We arrived almost 5pm and the room was not ready and we had to wait 30-45 minutes to check in. We request the house keeping to clean/vacuum our room off sands from the beach they didnt clewn the room.,U Paasha Seminyak
1372,"Central, stylish and comfortable",40,August 2017,"We had a lovely twonight stay here, we had a room at the rear of the hotel (furthest away from main road). It has a grand entrance, contemporary Scandinavian style furnishings and hallways of original art for sale. Central location walk to cafe, bars, restaurants basically directly outside, cool rooftop pool and bar. Breakfast was amazing, they will make you a real coffee too!",U Paasha Seminyak
1373,Good,50,August 2017,"Good, i had a pleasant stay. The room is big and comfy, definitely will come back. Nice location, friendly and honest staff. I left my phone at the basement toilet and they keep it for me. Keep the good work.",U Paasha Seminyak
1374,Fantastic !,50,August 2017,"This is my third time at U-Paasha and every time it's an even better experience.
Espresso coffee anytime anywhere now!! Breakfast seems to have endless choice and is delicious. Service is exceptional and quick. Devi the Front Officer Manager is amazing and very professional!. She makes you feel at home from the moment you check in, assisting with any request related to your stay at the hotel and with Bali in general.
The staff are wonderful and always ready to assist with a smile. Today a staff member named Dodi drove me to an appointment and was very accomodating and attentative...not to mention very helpful.
Wifi is super fast and the pool + bar is fantastic. They also have free yoga classes on the grass area of the roof top. The BBQ buffet is quality with delicious dishes from shell fish, meats, Indonesian cuisine and yummy desserts!
Located in the heart of Seminyak: everything is at your door step!
Highly recommend staying at U-Paasha for its excellent service, to truly relax and be pampered in its beautiful decor.",U Paasha Seminyak
1375,AMAZING ACCOMMODATION IN AN AWESOME LOCATION,50,August 2017,This is my third stay here and as usual I am VERY impressed . All facilities are wonderful. The pool areas is attended by obliging and friendly staff. The rooms are spacious and well appointed . The rooftop bar has a great atmosphere for sunset view. I will be back 😊,U Paasha Seminyak
1376,Happy Holiday,50,July 2017,"A great place to stay, warm & friendly staff. The rooms were big & generous, especially the showers. The U Paasha is centrally located to lots of good eating places or a short Taxi ride to some of the top food places in & around Seminyak..",U Paasha Seminyak
1377,A couple of troubles but dealt with quickly and professionally.,50,August 2017,"We came back after our first stay 2 years earlier, and the hotel was as good as the first time. It didn't seem to go downhill like a lot of other hotels in Bali. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a visitor in our room via the interconnecting room one night to our surprise, the staff dealt with it immediately and professionally. Luckily the nieghbours were just a bit dopey and harmless.

Breakfast was plentiful and we were luky enough to get a massage included in our stay. Good central location in Seminyak for restaraunts and shops.",U Paasha Seminyak
1378,Great location,30,January 2017,"The location was an awesome spot, we had an issue with a smell and members of our group had to move rooms. If u want a spot by the pool get there early as u won't get a seat. Rooftop bar was ok needed more atmosphere. Room was clean and staff attentive. We had a lovely view of someone's garbage tip outside our window so can't rate that",U Paasha Seminyak
1379,Birthday Holiday,50,August 2017,"Excellent Stay at a beautiful resort with Beautiful & friendly staff. Close to all the action with plenty of restaurants & shops . Rooms are big, fresh & clean with a modern look . Food & drink was a reasonable price & good quality.",U Paasha Seminyak

Location is right in the center of town where you can walk to many nearby restaurants, bars and clubs while taxis are always available out front for quick trips to the beach",U Paasha Seminyak
1381,Definitely makes me want to go back there..,50,August 2017,"Firstly i was interest to stay there because of my friend's reccomendation. I also review the hotel interior from website, i just love the industrial minimalist interior.

Also when i stay in there, these are that satisfy me :
- The room quite big and very clean
- Alcove Restaurant that serve breakfast really serve various and tasty breakfast
- Very strategic location, sorrounding by my fave resto (ultimo, rumours, sisterfields, motel mexicola, revolver coffee). You can just take a walk, since seminyak traffic quite packed.

So definitely i would really love to go back there on next vacay..",U Paasha Seminyak
1382,Great location,40,August 2017,"The hotel is in a prime spot in Seminyak, if you like to walk to all the good restaurants, beach clubs and shops. However if you're after quiet, I'd suggest going to Canggu as the traffic in Seminyak is madness!

U Paasha is a lovely hotel though, with really friendly staff and an awesome rooftop pool. The view is great up there. The rooms are also huge which is cool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1383,"Right in the heart of Seminyak, Great Rooms and Roof Top!",40,July 2017,"Great location as close to all shops and amenities Seminyak has to offer. Good as traffic is nightmare. Great hotel, friendly staff, great spacious and light rooms and roof top pool and restaurant is very good. Highly recommend as right priced for what you get",U Paasha Seminyak
1384,LOVED THIS PLACE,50,July 2017,The room is giant and has a great aesthetic. The bed was the best of all that we slept on during our Bali vacation. Breakfast buffet is fantastic - be sure to wake up in time otherwise you get ala carte and it pales in comparison. The location is superb - check out Ginger Moon across the street for dinner and try Boss Burger nearby for some awesome burgers. It's an easy walk to the beach. The roof top pool is lovely. All around loved this spot.,U Paasha Seminyak
1385,Great location and price,40,July 2017,"Rooms great size, well priced and good location. Has 24 check in which is great for aussies as flights are late at night e.g. check in 9pm day of check out 9pm .Roof top pool not much atmosphere .Has a small gym, breakfast good. Staff at front desk need to improve English skills as many English speaking were staying there, as with my last visit also found poor communication skills also noted after last stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1386,Great Location Great Swimming Pool,50,July 2017,"Hotel is located in the heart of main street of Seminyak and there are a lot of nice restuarant around for your option. It is a design hotel with a large room space but the balcony is small without view. Swimming pool is located at the roof top and you can enjoy the sun shine all the time you want. Besides, you can see the sunset at roof top, excellent! Hotel buffet breakfast is also delicious with many choice. There is one thing for improvment is the cleaness of pillow case, we found there are some stain on it and ask for change by housekeeping but seems most of the pillow case are not white enough and some dirty stain on it. Anyways, overall the hotel is great to stay and you will enjoy this hotel during your stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1387,"Central, friendly, good breakfast, good value, large clean rooms",50,August 2017,"We were happy w our choice !
As first timers in Seminyak, it was very central, good breakfast, good rooms!
Breakfast had lots of options and fresh.
Rooms are large w large comfortable beds. Higher floor rooms at the back side has nice views. Ground floor room had few ants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1388,Amazing,50,July 2017,"My partner and I stayed here for 8 nights. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the breakfast was amazing! Gede the man who works by the pool was absolutely amazing! He played games with us, was prompt and professional. We really looked forward to going by the pool to see him. The bar by the pool was great. The kiwi fruit cocktail was to die for. My favourite part of this hotel was the bed! The bed was massive and so comfy. The only issue we had was the hotel smelt like sewerage but it wasn't until we later that we found out they had issues with the sewerage. After speaking to regulars we realised this was a once off technical issie. Thank you u paasha and a big thanks to Gede for the hospitality.",U Paasha Seminyak
1389,Fourth time - getting more expensive but still great,40,August 2017,"This was my fourth time at upaasha - it's central, reliable and spacious. The pool area is lovely, the staff are great and the rooms are outstanding. I'd stay here every time!
The only downside is it now costs almost double what it did a few years ago, so becoming less affordable.
Fantastic place to stay though 😃",U Paasha Seminyak
1390,Great stay in a great location,40,July 2017,"This hotel is great for couples or friends, I wouldn't suggest it to families though or anyone with young kids. I stayed here with a friend for 7 nights and a few highlights were the rooftop pool, the 24 hour check in/out policy and the lovely staff. We paid extra for a top level room however didn't find it worth it. Don't fuss about including breakfast, we only had the hotel buffet once during our stay as the hotel is so well located you are surrounded by brilliant cafe's that do a far better breakfast than the buffet.",U Paasha Seminyak
1391,Best location ever,50,July 2017,"We booked U Paasha just by chance after visiting Bali many times. Family had stayed here and we didn't even know. Best location with our favourite restaurants right across the road. Staff are amazing and FOM Devi looked after us and when our flight was cancelled and we had to come back for another night, she was arranged no problem! Breakfast option is one of the best we've experienced and a bonus here is check out is extended from the time you check in. We will definately be back!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1392,"Fab room, fab locatjon",50,August 2017,"We stayed here for 5 nights. The location is fantastic, it's right on ""Eat Street"" and only a 10-15 minute walk to the coast.

The hotel lobby is absolutely beautiful and made me smile every time I stepped into the hotel! Our room was really nice (very modern) and very spacious. The bed was huge and super comfortable. The walk in shower and the his and hers sinks were a particularly nice touch! The room was also lovely and quiet because we were on the 5th floor and facing away from the street. The rooftop pool area is gorgeous and the pool itself is super clean. The roof is a great place to watch the sunset.

In terms of service, all of the staff were very friendly and professional.

The only issues I had with our stay was that the wifi wouldn't work in our room or on the rooftop at times; and, as a vegan, I found the breakfast options a little limited (as with most places). If you're not a vegan though the breakfast would be amazing, loads of options including pancakes and various egg dishes made to order (my boyfriend says the eggs benedict is very good!).

All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
1393,Best Location,50,July 2017,"Rooms are huge and clean.The location is the best, just walk to shops and many restaurants. The plus point from this hotel is the check out time is the same as the check in time and we can have our breakfast wherever inside the hotel buidling. They will send your breakfast even to the swiiming pool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1394,U Paasha July 2017,50,July 2017,"The hotel is in the best location, right in the middle of eat street. Service was great, breakfast was amazing, over all a great stay. I wish they had a swim up bar though, there's plenty of room for one! I will be back though :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1395,"Good hotel, great location",40,July 2017,"Good hotel in a great location. In the heart of eat street, surrounded by lovely restaurants and good shopping. A short stroll to seminyak square where there are even more eating choices. Easy to get a taxi out the front if you want to go a bit further. Roof top pool is great. Plenty of sun and a nice vibe. Buffet breakfast is big and enjoyable. Coffee not great. Would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1396,"Great rooms, perfect location, excellent rooftop pool",50,July 2017,"Stayed at U Paasha for 8 nights and loved it. Rooms are huge, clean and comfortable with a very comfortable bed and pillows. Booked directly through hotel as prices were better than Trip Advisor so it pays to check this out. Didn't hear any noise at night from local bars and clubs despite other reviewers saying this was a problem (and I'm a fairly light sleeper). Room was on level 3 towards the back of of the hotel. Staff very friendly - whenever I requested anything to the room it came quickly and always with a smile. Rooftop pool is an excellent space for relaxing in the sun. Also has shaded options under trees or umbrellas. Poolside menu has very good healthy salad options and juices plus all regular menu items you'd expect - sandwiches, burgers, Indonesian food, cocktails and other alcohol. Buffet brekkie has everything you'd expect. Used U Paasha airport transfer service for convenience and reliability. Although twice the price of a taxi in Bali it guarantees pick up and drop off in air-conditioned comfort.

Highly recommend U Paasha and would love to stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1397,2nd stay,40,July 2017,"It was my second time stay in Upaasha Seminyak. Room quite big, the staffs were friendly, perfect location.. unfortunately for both stays when we first enter the room there was bad odors so we have to ask the staff to spray the room first",U Paasha Seminyak
1398,Short stay,40,July 2017,"We stayed two nights at U Paasha which was recommended by friends as last time we stayed at Ize Seminyak. The hotel and room was clean. The rooms are very big loved the shower. The roof top pool was lovely sometimes a bit windy. The service around the pool was slow. We tried the breakfast one morning which was okay. Yes, I would stay here again as the location is brilliant.",U Paasha Seminyak
1399,UPaasha - Amazing location and facillities/rooms,50,July 2017,"We had an amazing stay at U Paasha Seminyak. The staff were amazing and helpful, rooms are huge and modern, breakfast was great, and facilities such as the rooftop pool and gym were fabulous. And on top of all of this, you can't beat the location - right in the heart of Seminyak surrounded by great restaurants and bars. We were able to walk to most locations. Would highly recommend, and we will be returning.",U Paasha Seminyak
1400,Yet another great stay...,40,July 2017,"As with all my previous experiences at UPaasha, this visit didn't disappoint. In my previous review, I missed a few points that may be useful to add here.

This trip I travelled alone and while I booked to stay initially for six nights, I extended by two days as I feel safe and comfortable at this venue. There is minimal noise from adjoining rooms – most likely as the rooms are quite large and walls are solid, so I appreciate the good night's sleep. Although the double safety lock was missing on my door when I first arrived, a quick call to reception the following morning fixed that in no time.

One of the best parts of staying at Upaasha as a lone traveller (apart from 24 hour check-in/out policy), is the all day breakfast. Not only can you order breakfast to your room at any point from morning until 10pm free of charge, but you can also claim two 'breakfasts' per day. I am not really a breakfast person, so this means that I have my breakfast for lunch (usually on my lounger by the pool) and my second breakfast for dinner in the evening. When you consider that the breakfast menu is quite extensive, and includes dishes such as Nasi Goreng, it's a decent saving.

On this visit I noticed that the more scenic 5th floor (odd numbers) is no longer in the same price category as the other rooms – I guess too many Trip Advisor tipsters giving out key secrets put paid to that! If you don't want to pay the premium, request 3rd floor rooms (uneven numbers) instead... there is no 4th floor, so it is only one floor lower.

The gym is adequate – nice view and much better than a number of other hotels that I have stayed in, however as it is directly next to the kitchen, the air-con does tend to get a little smelly. Nothing that would turn you off majorly, just not 100% ideal when working out.

Finally, credit where credit's due – the hotel is clearly reinvesting year-on-year, which is nice to see. It was immediately apparent that my room had recently been repainted and the rooftop pool furniture was also new since my last visit. Brownie points for that!

As mentioned on my last review... the location is unbeatable if you are looking to be in amongst the action, but without being stuck in a party zone. Great restaurants and cool boutique shops are in abundance and all within seconds of the hotel reception.",U Paasha Seminyak
1401,Fantastic hotel fantastic service,40,July 2017,"Would highly recommend this hotel for the fab location firstly. The brilliant service, the rooftop pool, the breakfast and again the hotel service and staff. Really was a brilliant stay from the airport shuttle which was a little more expensive maybe £10 more than a taxi, but lovely having someone waiting to take you with a pre arranged price and cold water in the air conditioned car. The breakfast is to die for and the no set check out time is perfect for an evening flight!! Right across from some lovely restaurants and I would highly recommend here!
Worth the little extra money for this one",U Paasha Seminyak
1402,Fantastic stay!!! Love the location of the hotel,50,July 2017,"24hr reception & room being available to you 24 to 24 hrs was great, we checked in late & checked out late at no extra cost.
Loved the rooftop pool, 100 % sun ☀️ Fantastic management & staff. We will be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1403,Great location on 'Eat Street',50,July 2017,"I can highly recommend Upaasha, it is right on the best Street for food. The staff were very helpful, and constantly smiling, nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Great rooftop pool with views over Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1404,Great place,40,July 2017,"Well located hotel, staff were so amazing and friendly. Breakfast was really well equipped with variety.
The rooms were cleaned everyday, the gym is adequate
My only tip is that there needs to be more staff around the pool to take your food and drink orders
That's it, otherwise highly recommend",U Paasha Seminyak
1405,"Excellent stay at U Paasha hotel, Bali.",50,July 2017,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at U Paasha hotel in Seminyak, Bali. The staff were extremely efficient, helpful and friendly. Our room was very spacious, always clean, and a great view from the 5th floor. The location is excellent being right in the heart of the main street of Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1406,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic location, amazing staff",50,July 2017,"We stayed in the penthouse which was amazing. The hotel was great with huge luxury rooms, an awesome rooftop pool which gets all day sun, a good gym and located in a terrific location.. the staff were a dream, particularly the front of house manager. We had a really good time and would definitely return to U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1407,Fantastic stay - would highly recommend,50,July 2017,"Big room, and all in all a great stay. I was recommended the hotel by a friend and it certainly didn't disappoint. Shared pool on the fifth floor was excellent with a view of Seminyak. Helpful staff and extremely clean.",U Paasha Seminyak
1408,Yes please,50,July 2017,"Great place. Amazing breakfast. Pool a great escape and the buffet dinner option is brilliant.
Staff very accomodating and close to everything. Love this place its spacious and modern. I would be more than happy to return",U Paasha Seminyak
1409,Upaasha,50,July 2017,the location is great and right in the heart of seminyak. Staff are very friendly and made the stay that much more enjoyable. The fantastic rooftop pool and sunset bar are what tops off this great hotel. Along with the breakfast,U Paasha Seminyak
1410,"Great Hotel,Location and staff",50,July 2017,"Stayed here a few times now as we often travel to Bali. The location is great for all the best restaurants, shops and beach.
Rooms are very spacious and beds very comfortable. The roof top pool is a great place to chill during the day and has great views over Seminyak. Pool service is excellent, the staff are so attentive and friendly especially Geda and the food was great. We did the buffet night at the rooftop bar too and that was great, very reasonable with good food and again excellent service.
The 24 hour checkout is a great bonus too especially if you have an evening flight. I wish all hotels did this.
All the staff are so friendly and accommodating and always remember your name but in particular Devi, the front office manager was outstanding in helping us with bookings and making sure our stay was as pleasant as possible. She always made time to speak to us and other the guests. Look forward to staying here again on our next trip to this beautiful island",U Paasha Seminyak
1411,Amazing last minute stay,50,July 2017,"Amazing property. For the price paid it is exactly what I would expect (actually exceeded). Ideal location in hub in Seminyak, very close to beach and top cafes, restaurants, beauty / massage and shopping. Rooms are very clean, staff lovely. Really cannot fault my stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1412,"Friendly, well located and convenient",50,July 2017,"U Paasha is right in the middle of the busiest street in Seminyak, and for us this is one its greatest selling points. Must make it hard for the hotel to compete for food sales, massages etc, but so good for guests having it all metres away. Enjoyed the roof top pool and the big breakfast everyday and the friendly GM made an effort to talk to guests at breakfast each day. Some small annoyances, but overall it suited our teenaged kids and their parents who cant stand the isolation of resorts.",U Paasha Seminyak
1413,Great little hotel on Eat Street seminyak,50,July 2017,Had a great room but sadly view was to rubbish tip so don't have room 518. Food was great value especially barbecue night. Pool area lovely and views to ocean. Great roof top bar setting. Staff ver pleasant,U Paasha Seminyak
1414,Couple getaway,50,July 2017,Simply fantastic . Every aspect of our trip was stunning. Book this place on your next trip and you won't be disappointed. We highly recommend it and felt very well looked after. Every effort was made to make us feel at home.,U Paasha Seminyak
1415,Location!,50,July 2017,The service was great from check in to check out. The staff were welcoming and very helpful when we wanted to organize day trips. Our room was huge and our king bed was so comfortable! The location was excellent right in the middle of shops and restaurants. And the view from the rooftop bar and pool over Seminyak was beautiful. We will be stayed here again!,U Paasha Seminyak
1416,Best value for the money in the area?,40,July 2017,"Probably the best value for the money in the area. Great location, nice rooms and in general good service. Good breakfast!

U Paasha gave us a room with a broken aircondition (made extreme (!) noise), but managed to find a new room. Also highly recommended to not get a room on the first floor. The ""balcony"" is for example useless.

This is a very good choice when you need basic facilities with a great location.",U Paasha Seminyak
1417,Very good option and value for money,50,July 2017,"Right in the thick of the action yet provides a boutique style sanctuary from the street action, fabulous roof pool, large rooms, good breakfast, top restaurants & convenience stores a step away, and best of all the excellent assistant manager Dewi who attends every need and detail, and the smiling, kind attentive staff in her team. Rooms at the back and on higher floors best. Will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1418,Great hotel,50,July 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights with our 16 and 18 yr old daughters. We had rooms on the 5th floor. The location is right in the heart of Seminyak, close to the good restaurants and shopping. It is extremely busy in Seminyak at this time of year. The traffic is unbelievable. Our room rate inc breakfast which was a good selection of eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, toasts, fruits, pastries, cereals etc. our rooms were very cleaned and serviced daily. The rooms are a little worn but very spacious with comfortable beds. The rooms were very quiet with great air conditioning. The only complaint is the towels. They were really old and grey and needed replacing. Our daughters room also had an unpleasant sewerage smell. The staff at this hotel are fabulous. They r happy, friendly and so helpful. Nothing is too much trouble and I believe they genuinely want you to enjoy your stay. The young guy working in the pool area is so friendly and funny. He is a real asset to the hotel. The rooftop pool is clean and not too busy. The food and drinks at the pool are well priced and delicious. The rooftop bar is really enjoyable. I have stayed here twice and would stay here again. I can highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1419,"We loved this hotel! Great food, location and staff!",50,July 2017,"We have stayed at the U Paasha a number of times and have always enjoyed our stay!
We felt very welcome by the helpful staff and the food was great! We really like the location too!! We will be back soon....",U Paasha Seminyak
1420,Wonderful Hotel,50,July 2017,"We had a terrific stay at U Paasha - best location to shops and restaurants in Seminyak
Food at both breakfast and lunch by the pool was excellent
Rooftop pool clean and amazing spot to relax by day and sunset
Can recommend highly enough!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1421,Very clean comfortable hotel in great location.,50,July 2017,Very clean comfortable hotel in great location. Great staff that made our stay very comfortable and pleasurable. Staff went that extra mile to make our holiday special. Room was spacious with very comfortable beds.,U Paasha Seminyak
1422,Family Stay John From Dunsborough WA,40,July 2017,"Very Pleasant stay , rooms are sizey and the breakfast buffet is fantastic . Staff very helpful and make you feel welcome. They were quite happy to make a special dish for my wife and we had no problems with the return transfer to the Airport",U Paasha Seminyak
1423,Review,40,July 2017,"Nice, modern rooms, beautiful rooftop pool and view, good breakfast and easy location to get to great spots in seminyak. Overall was a great time with a big group of friends and would recommend others to use if they are looking for a good time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1424,Great Spot,50,June 2017,"This was our first stop in Bali to use as a base for adjusting to the time zone and climate. And to be honest I couldn't fault the hotel. Clean rooms, cracking location, great rooftop pool, sun beds and bar. We used the gym a couple of times nice and early and then enjoyed the generous breakfast buffet. The hotel is around 10-15 minutes walk to the beach and literally on the doorstep for plenty of shops, bars and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1425,"Location, location, location!",40,June 2017,"We had a nice stay at U Paasha in June 2017. The first thing I will say - and this is the hotel's biggest draw card - is that you can't beat the location. Plonked right in the middle of eat street, the hotel is situated right in the middle of restaurants, cafes, and shopping. Check-in was straight forward, we had a room on the 5th floor which was huge, clean, had modern decor and generally fairly quiet. The shower and toilet areas in the bathroom was enormous - we did think it a strange design choice to install a frosted glass toilet door that didn't go to the ceiling or the floor (perhaps not the ideal situation if you are sharing a room with someone other than a partner). Roof top pool is great and the hotel itself is nicely decorated - some areas could do with a little bit of love (eg. the towel on the floor, beneath the stairs to the pool, placed to catch dripping water? - this was there when we arrived, and still there when we checked out a week later). The buffet breakfast was quite good (maybe a 3.5 out of 5 stars) - the whole egg station / pancake station was good but a bit confusing, considering every time you ask for a simple poached egg, you ended up with eggs benedict 20 mins later and sometimes you would order pancakes that just never came.
All in all, a good stay - would we stay again, yes. It would come down to price for the location / comfort for us.",U Paasha Seminyak
1426,Great hotel but careful which room you get,40,June 2017,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times and love it's location. Situated in the centre hub for shopping and great restaurants close by. The roof top pool is my favourite place to chill if you don't want to go to the beach and constantly get haggled. Food at the rooftop bar is great also. We learnt after our first stay to ask to be put on higher floors so the music from the bar at front does not affect you.

However unfortunately my room is right beside the lift down the back 318 and these rooms are the ones that have the sewage smell coming through the air-conditioning, I had to get moved at 1am due to (like others on these reviews), it got so strong you could practically taste it :S and staff confirmed this happens alot in that section of the building.
So yes it's a beautiful hotel but please please fix the sewage leak problem as it shouldn't be still happening!",U Paasha Seminyak
1427,Great hotel but poor hospitality,40,June 2017,"This hotel actually is great. Strategically located near Seminyak Square and many famous restoran. Spacious bed room. Lot selection of breakfast menu which has good taste.
But somehow, all positive aspect mentioned above is not balanced with the service given from the receptionist staff, both morning or afternoon shift. I had bad experience with them. Their face was unpleasant. I didn't get requested bed. I ordered King size, they tried to give me Twin bed with have been positioned close to each other.
My wife also had a little accident with the bathroom door stop on the floor that made her toe bleeding. Also the towel hanger is very light and so unstable, she almost got hit by it when she grabbed a towel.
Overall my perception still positive but my suggestion for management, please put extra attention on your front staff. They are giving 1st impression to all guest both check in or check out.",U Paasha Seminyak
1428,Quite good,30,July 2017,"After staying in Ubud we came back to Seminyak to finish the last 3days of the holiday , it is hard to tell how big it is from the front . The breakfast is pretty good and right across from altimos ,that is handy and a short walk to Seminyak square . It has a nice pool on the top floor and a Nice view on sunset . Not overly expensive on special so overall quite good.",U Paasha Seminyak
1429,Best Value in Seminyak!,40,June 2017,"Excellent, great value hotel. Only slight detractor is that breakfast quality could be improved..probably a 7/10. Still good though and the benefits of the location & the 'overall' value for money outweigh this minor issue.",U Paasha Seminyak
1430,Bad attitude of bellboy,40,June 2017,"Was so pissed off with this lazy bellboy
I did report to one of the receptinist
Actually i wanted to meet the manager too bad she or he was in the rooftop
And i didnt have much time to wait.
This bellboy was super lazy , he was reluctant to carry the luggages from the room . He let me to do it by myself!
I check out on june 24th 2017",U Paasha Seminyak
1431,"Love our wide room, wide shower tub, and the honeybee mirror ... perfect",40,June 2017,"We stay for our holiday, my daughter very excited with the neigbourhood area .. love to walk for window shopping, Neraby the cafe she liked, find the cuttiest things near the hotel ... just perfect for leisure. But sometimes we smell not good in the corridor. Perhaps need more good maintenance for clean air from ""the smell"". Sorry but for a day, I smell every walk in to my room.",U Paasha Seminyak
1432,Great food and comfortable rooms.,50,June 2017,Fantastic food - especially the barbequeue nights - and very comfortable rooms. I was treated very well and great respect and service. Staff were accommodating and the only requests I had to make was for more milk in the minibar and the toilet blocked. Both issues were responded to within five minutes and resolved. A great all-rouder hotel.,U Paasha Seminyak
1433,Excellent stay,50,June 2017,"Staff were friendly, great location. Big variety for breakfast, also made good use of the gym and as you have to pay for sunbeds on the beach, we spent many days on the rooftop pool which was incredibly clean and well maintained...and great for tanning. Only flaw was the smell from the toilet/drains but would still recommend everyone to stay here!",U Paasha Seminyak
1434,Ideal Location. Great hotel.,50,July 2017,"Stayed at the U Pasha for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel is so central to all of the great restaurants (Ginger Moon,Batik...).The rooms are large and welcoming. Great king size beds.Rooftop pool is sensational.Staff are very friendly and the manager was extremely welcoming. Thanks Daniel, we'll be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1435,Awesome hotel,50,June 2017,"Loved staying at U Paasha, very friendly and helpful staff, great clean rooms, amazing pool, good breakfast, ideal location right in the heart of seminyak and all it has to offer. Would recommend staying here. 24 hr check out from arrival is helpful on fly out day!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1436,Execellent hotel,50,June 2017,"very good location hotel, the rooms are so big though i get some problems with the ants that come out from the flower in the room the employee resolve it very good. I reccomend to stay at 5th floor and i definitely will stay at this hotel again",U Paasha Seminyak
1437,Great location and amazing breakfast,40,June 2017,"U Paasha is located on the main ""eat street"" in Seminyak, which was exactly what we were seeking.

The rooms were spacious and the bed extremely large and comfortable. Large shower and toilet, however the flooring in the shower and toilet were a bit harsh underneath barefoot. The toilet sometimes smelt (even with the lid closed & when it hadn't just been used!!) this was not something you could smell in the room with the door to the toilet closed, it was mainly in the toilet itself. Not a huge deal.

The rooftop pool was a great spot to catch some sun, have a dip in the refreshing water and maybe indulge in a cocktail or two. We didn't find the pool area to ever be too overcrowded.

The breakfast was amazing, huge variety and great crispy bacon!

Would definitely stay again at U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1438,Wonderful place to stay,50,June 2017,Great location close to restaurants and shopping. Exceptional staff and amenities. Beautiful pool. Starting to get a little tire but otherwise couldn't fault it. Beds and rooms very comfortable and roomy.,U Paasha Seminyak
1439,Great service but average accommodation,30,June 2017,"Spent 7 days/6 nights at U Paasha with a friend & had our own rooms - Standard Balcony Suite (3rd floor). Unfortunately the view from each of the dark rooms was of neighbouring dirty backyards and walls of buildings with rotting weeds and plants growing on them. We asked to move to the other side of the hotel (still on Lvl 3 - rooms 315 & 323 - ask for a room on this side of the hotel) which was organised for the next day. Better view of villas next door, township and more light, as originally requested. Our request was organised by Front Desk Manager, ""Miss Devi"", who made sure we were happy with the new rooms and offered a complimentary massage (see below) for the inconvenience of moving rooms. Devi did a wonderful job in what would be a demanding role - she was always friendly and professional, and made daily contact with us to see how we were enjoying our holiday. In summary, here's what we thought generally about our stay at U Paasha:

YAYS:
* Prompt and friendly check-in and check-out
* Large room with plenty of space in both the bathroom and living/bedroom area
* Comfortable bed and pillows
* Excellent service by Rini in the rooftop/pool bar and restaurant - always smiling and happy to have a chat
* BBQ dinner at rooftop restaurant - approximately $25 AUD per person, including a complimentary drink. Enjoyed it so much we had it twice during our stay - highly recommended
* Breakfast was always fresh and tasty and the staff eager to assist with coffees, meal requests, etc.
* Staff very friendly and willing to help with any queries
* Spacious pool area (if a little dated) with plenty of sun lounges and attentive staff to bring drinks (loved the Mango Daiquiris) and food

NAYS:
* Despite management stating in previous responses that they are working with local authorities to fix the smell that wafts through the hotel, the smell STILL exists - for the 7 days we stayed at the hotel, the smell was very evident day and night, particularly when using the staircase, as well as in the rooms - it's a shame this is an issue as it may not be the fault of the hotel but it impacts the enjoyment of their guests
* Towels in the bathroom were dirty looking, with a tinge of grey and were not ""white"" - issue was raised with management on day 1 but appears all towelling is this colour as it was the same every day when Housekeeping replaced them - maybe not washed thoroughly in hot water?
* A quick glance at the rooms and they look modern and clean. However, attention to detail is lacking with mounds of dust on the lampshades and grime on the telephone. The bathroom had marks over the tiled walls (some concrete bits from recent renovations?) and glass partitions and doors needed a good wipe down. Toilet area also smelled of sewerage. Generally not the standard of housekeeping expected in a 4 star hotel.
* Complimentary in-room massage was the worst I've ever had in a hotel - unprofessional, late to arrive and finished 15 minutes before the agreed time of 60 minutes. Turns out the service is out-sourced as the hotel doesn't have its own onsite spa facilities (found this out after the massage!). Although I didn't pay for the massage (and thank heavens I didn't!), don't waste your $$$ on this service - you're better off going outside the hotel for a cheaper and more relaxing massage (we twice went to a place called ""Therapy"" which was wonderful - a short walk from the hotel). The hotel could do itself a favour by replacing current massage services with a more professional outfit.

Overall, U Paasha is a suitable hotel if you want to stay in the heart of Seminyak and ""Eat Street"". It's close to shops, spas, restaurants and bars. The staff and meals are great, as is the relaxed vibe of the place. However, if you're looking for a ""luxury resort"" or a resort-feel property, then U Paasha, in my experience, is not for you. Despite the excellent service of people like Miss Devi and Rini, I won't return to this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1440,8 days at U Paasha Seminyak Jun,40,June 2017,"The place is just as it is described, the staff as very friendly and always greet you with a hello and a smile and to be fair it does not feel like a fake one. There are always plenty of staff around to help you out and sort out an issues you may have, there roof top pool and bar are very comfortable as well. We aite on the roof one evening at there BBQ witch was purfeckt, rooms are well appointed and well serviced dayly.
As for the breakfast well what can I say it's excellent, there is plenty of choice, it's good quality and freshly cooked.
This is defenelty a hotel I'd recommend and stay in again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1441,Not a great experience...,30,July 2016,"We had 3 rooms, 2 of which we had to be moved because the rooms smelt like raw sewage. The staff laughed it off every time we complained and said they would 'treat' it...meaning spraying it with air freshener. The pool was so hot you felt like you were in a hot tub which wasn't pleasant. However, the cocktails were amazing and the location was great but I would not stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1442,Best Value Hotel in Seminyak,40,June 2017,"Good hotel on the best location in Seminyak, nearby very good resto's ... money changers, wine shops, bread stores, shopping mall, the swimming pool is very nice ... the double hamburger is the best on whole BALI !!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1443,Fabulous hotel!!,40,June 2017,"We stayed at U Paasha for 5 nights and it was fantastic.

Staff were super friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are huge, shower is great, bed is comfy and pillows are super soft.

The breakfast was great they had every option from bacon & eggs which the eggs came with hollandaise, vegetarian, cereals and traditional Balinese breakfasts, fresh juices and great lattes.

The rooftop pool was great, safe for small kids too with a good shallow area, we never had to wait for a sun bed.

The rooftop BBQ was fantastic and worth the $$.

You are right in amongst all the restaurants, short walk to kudeta, sea circus and motel Mexicola, great coffee at sisterfields and corner store.

Would def recommend to couples.",U Paasha Seminyak
1444,Spacious and Luxury,50,June 2017,This place was a hidden gem. You wouldn't know you were on the main street in Seminyak. I loved my stay here. The rooms were so big and made me feel like a queen. I would stay back here again for sure.,U Paasha Seminyak
1445,Greta hotel in Seminyak,50,June 2017,"We really enjoyed our stay here - the rooms were spacious, modern and clean. The rooftop pool was really nice, and we loved that the gym had more than just cardio machines (dumbbells up to 20+kg plus a couple weight machines and benches). The buffet breakfast was one of the best we've experienced in Bali, with fresh juices, lots of variation, and vegetarian options.",U Paasha Seminyak
1446,Great Hotel in Fabulous Location,50,June 2017,"So this Hotel was great! Cheap priced and in the best location.

Things to note, I saw soo many complaints about smells and sewerage smells so I pre emailed the hotel and wasn't put anywhere near the smelly areas.

The rooms are huge and spacious and the pillows are delightful BEST pillows in a hotel too ever.

The bed was super comfy too.

Few areas for improvement the towels can be a little stained and the gym could do with a tidy up.

The pool is great it's not deep though but a wonderful tanning pool you can dip in to cool down.

Breakfast is delicious it's a great buffet.
The staffs service was impeccable and I highly recommend.

If your worried about crossing the road the security will stop the traffic for you.
So close to so many amazing restaurants and quiet.

Your in the thick of it but you don't hear any noise.

Love the Flick lights to say make my room up or do not disturb.

FAB WIFI!!! And the shower is so huge it has a hanging area.

Worth a stay as it's soo reasonably priced!",U Paasha Seminyak
1447,Cristian Carvana,50,June 2017,The experience was amazing. There is only one but of criticism I could add. One night we left our room key in the room so we went to the concierge to let us in. She asked for our names & gave us another key. This process has poor security. We should have been asked to show photo ID at the very least as someone who knows another persons name and room number could rob a room easily. Thanks,U Paasha Seminyak
1448,24 hour concept is great!,40,May 2017,"We really loved the 24 hour room stay, as we had a late evening flight we checked in at 8pm so were able to swim, rest and change before catching our evening flight - great location, great room and breakfast, great value for money",U Paasha Seminyak
1449,A perfect base in seminyak,40,June 2017,"The room, the staff and the location makes this hotel a perfect base on the south coast. The breakfast was excellent and catered for all tastes. Finally, the staff on reception were extremely helpful . Highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
1450,U Paasha hotel,50,June 2017,"location was fantastic -close to everything shops,restaurants also small convenience store opposite hotel,king size bed was probably most comfortable i have slept in,excellent amenities,staff very helpful.
Breakfast excellent with wide range of choices

probably most surprising but excellent service was that I arrived around 2000hrs midweek and on checkout they advised me that I had a checkout time of 2000hrs as I arrived at that time - as I had a 2200hrs flight this was excellent and didn't have to waste time walking around around etc

I would recommend this hotel to stay at and will do again when I go back to Indonesia",U Paasha Seminyak
1451,Average experience,30,June 2017,Mosquitos in rooms and common areas. Unsure if this hotel pays for fogging to avoid large amounts of mosquitos. Pack repellant! Showers also moldy and large amoints of moisture constantly dripping from inefficient ac,U Paasha Seminyak
1452,Cozy and comfort,50,June 2017,"The hotel room is wide, nice design and so comfort. I will recommend you guys to stay here if you want to explore Seminyak. The hotel is near to cafes, restaurants, bar etc, beach by walking. I will be back, Upaasha",U Paasha Seminyak
1453,24 hr checking system is the best...,50,June 2017,"It was our first visit to Seminyak. The stay at U Paasha was very nice and comfortable. Their 24 hr checking system was very handy. We checked in at 6 pm and were allowed to stay till 6pm on day of check out. Helped to rest before late evening flight.
The buffet breakfast is lavish. So much variety and good quality food. The staff were friendly and would go out of way to help you. They will bring rquested food to our table instead of us waiting for it to be cooked.
Rooms are very spacious and good quality.
We used the rooftop swimming pool every morning.
So refreshing.
Free sunrise yoga on saturday morning was nice.
Location is very very nice . Top quality restaurants and bars are just at doorstep.
Overall a very pleasant experience. Highly recommended.
Will definitely stay there on our next visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1454,Good location and breakfast,40,June 2017,"U paasha is located on one of the busiest streets in seminyak, close to seminyak square and ku de ta.
On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing towel and drink.
The rooms are spacious and clean but had a smell of sewage in the room which was alot stronger on the corridor. The rooms are nice but attention to detail is needed to some of the fixtures and fitting.
The breakfast is buffet style and exactly what you need to fuel a day of exploring bali.
The roof top pool is nice and gets the sun all day long.
This would be a 5 star review if it wasnt for the smell that isnt very appealing.",U Paasha Seminyak
1455,"Excellent, can't fault anything",50,June 2017,"I've stayed at U Paasha twice now, I really can't fault anything.
The rooms are big and clean, the rooftop pool is lovely, the staff are friendly, the breakfast is amazing. Would recommend it & definitely my go to place when staying in Seminyak",U Paasha Seminyak
1456,Great priced hotel in a great location in Seminyak,40,June 2017,"I stayed her for 3 nights with my mum. Our room was awesome, twin beds and so much space, perfect when sharing with a friend or mum etc. Beds were comfy, had a small balcony but no view to look at though. This was not an issue though. The hotel is right in the main Eat Street of Seminyak so you walk out your door an everything you need is there. Brilliant location. There is a rooftop pool however we didn't use, we were too busy exploring. i would highly recommend this hotel. Its not your ""resort"" style like Padma, Mandira etc. but perfect for location, value for money and cleanliness, We also got the best rate by going direct. I would definitely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1457,Nice Hotel in Seminyak Area,50,December 2016,"The location is in the Seminyak Area. Close to the Seminyak Village, La Favela (1 of the famous night club in Bali), Rumours Resto, Char-Char Bar, Motel Mexicola, Sea Sircus, Revolver etc. The room is quite big and unique. There's bathtub inside the bathroom and good amenities quality:)",U Paasha Seminyak
1458,Great Experience always,50,June 2017,"I always have a great experience at U Paasha. Great location, Clean and big room with comfortable bed to rest. friendly staff always ready to help me. I love the pool very much, its relaxing and fun always. This is my 5th stay at U Paasha and its always better than before. Nice Job!",U Paasha Seminyak
1459,Central,50,June 2017,Sweet place that is very central and has all you wanted to have. Weirdly nobody really has dinner there but the breakfast spread (free) was bloody yummy. Would stay here again. Also the rooftop pool gave us 2 for 1 beers as there was some works being done.,U Paasha Seminyak
1460,Enjoyable stay at the Upasha.,50,June 2017,"We enjoyed our recent stay at the Upasha as it is an excellent hotel, where the staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are quite large and the beds very comfortable, so all in all we had a very relaxing visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1461,Location good but hotel has some issues.,30,June 2017,"My first time staying here and I have struggled not to compare it to my usual hotel when staying in Bali.

There are lots of good points to mention along with a few bad, I know the management take the time to reply so I thank you in advance for that and it will be received constructively.

Pro's: Great location close to many great restaurants, large rooms, clean with good level of housekeeping, surprisingly quite based on its location, friendly & helpful staff and lastly proper barista coffees for breakfast, this was a huge tick and I don't know many other hotels that do this.

Con's: air conditioner is noisey at night even when the fan speed is lowered, it is also not remote controlled so you have to get out of bed to adjust the settings which are by the door to the room - I'm sure I read in the information of the room that it was remote controlled, the air con also kept ""tripping"" this occurred 4 times in my 9 day stay each on separate occasions, the gym is small with limited weights & equipment, the room tends to smell of a combination of sewerage & a musty smell. I know other comments have stated this and responses have been to say it has been fixed or in the process of being fixed - suggest automated air fresheners may help in the meantime. You have to ask for a DVD player (which is old and noisey) as against them already being in the room as listed on numerous websites, the breakfast is minimal e.g. same each day with rice, noodles and one other local dish which seemed to be rotated, this was extremely disappointing, yes you have the egg station but limited other hot food choices, lastly, the balconies, these are no more than a place you can stand, no sitting room and the view is as per the photos! These are ones you don't get to see.

All said though I would consider staying again purely for the convenience of the location.",U Paasha Seminyak
1462,Great Hotel,40,May 2017,"Great location, easy to get around from. The hotel and rooms were very clean, there is a great rooftop pool :) Breakfast was great but could do with more variety. Just a shame the hotel doesnt have a spa.",U Paasha Seminyak
1463,TERRIBLE SEWAGE SMELL IN ROOM 😟,30,May 2017,"Great location, easy to walk out front and catch a taxi. Shops all around. Easy walk to the Seminyak markets. Sister fields for breakfast. Hotel provides a good buffet breakfast. We stayed for a week so was nice to try other places for breakfast on a couple of days.great massages across the road at Carla house & cheap.
Hotel pool was good, beautiful sunset. Staff helpful, but couldn't fix the smell of sewage in the room, which made us feel quite sick. We went out to buy some essential oils to help problem, but nothing worked.
If you can handle the smell, this is a good hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1464,Great location with friendly staff,50,May 2017,"This is the 3rd time I have stayed at this hotel and I will return again. The staff, location and amenities have always been exceptional. I had the misfortune of leaving my bag in a cab and the reception staff had the bag back to me within halve an hour. The breakfast is to die for. I was pleased the roof top bar had added more lounges and umbrellas since my last stay which has made this area a great place to relax. The toiletries are always of a high standard too. All in all could not fault my stay",U Paasha Seminyak
1465,Great hotel,50,June 2017,"We have loved our stay at this hotel. The location is perfect if you want to stay in the heart of Seminyak, right next to an abundance of shops, supermarkets, bars and restaurants.

The rooms were spacious, clean and equip with air con. Wifi was free and worked well around the hotel and in the rooms. The mini bar is chargeable but the bottled water in the rooms is free. The pool is on the rooftop and towels are provided so there is no need to bring your own. Check out can be extended if you have a later flight.

Staff around the hotel are attentive and helpful and the free breakfast had more than enough options to choose from. Please note that the hotel will hold a £100 deposit from you when you check in. This can be refunded to you on your last day or can be used to pay for food/drinks in the hotel. Most places in Bali add a tax and service charge onto your bills (normally between 15-20%).

We went on a day trip around Ubud and used the hotels driver. He took us around all day, stopping at many of the sights and letting us spend as much time as we wanted there for 1 million rp. It was definatley worth it!

Overall an amazing stay, the location I would say is the major selling point of this hotel! We would come back here without hesitation.",U Paasha Seminyak
1466,Center of Seminyak,30,May 2017,"Perfect hotel that's in close proximity to great restaurants and la favela. Recommend this place for tourists who enjoy walking instead of taking transportation. There is no beach in the hotel, but there is a pool and gym that's adequate.",U Paasha Seminyak
1467,Excellent,50,May 2017,"Hotel U Paasha has a very nice architecture. Interior of the hotel is very nice too.
The room is very spacious, food was delicious and if you're travelling with children this hotel is very recommended. Because it's located near shops and restourants also 10mn walk to the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
1468,Couldn't fault this property,50,May 2017,"I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to experience Seminyak. The location is brilliant, the staff are exceptional, the rooms are a great size and the roof top pool is sensational!
The 24 hour check-in concept is fabulous.
You will not be disappointed!",U Paasha Seminyak
1469,"Incredible views, location and staff",50,May 2017,"Every part of my experience at this hotel was fantastic. When you get to the location and see the location it is right in the middle of the action. Although about 15 minutes walk to the beach, the view from the roof top pool puts you right there. The rooms were great.",U Paasha Seminyak
1470,Amazing hotel with great facilities and Check in policy,40,May 2017,"Amazing hotel with great facilities and Check in policy, sadly room was poorly maintained and smelt of sewage. Breakfast was great as always, so was the pool and Gym (and rooftop bar) great location and wonderful room space",U Paasha Seminyak
1471,Best experience!,50,May 2017,"The location of the hotel is very central and close to popular spots. There are many excellent bars, pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Great location.

The best thing about this place is the staff and service. The staff showed us the Balinese hospitality and I cant wait to come back and stay again in this hotel.

The room was in excellent condition, clean , well maintained. The bed was really confortable as well. Trully wonderful experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
1472,Overrated and Overpriced,20,May 2017,"Room was dirty, bed linen wet on arrival, smell of garbage extremely strong at the far end of the hotel. Room is old and tired. Definitely in need of renovations.
Long black hairs in the shower and on the linen.
No water offered on arrival or on the transfer, which was more expensive then an average transfer from the W Hotel, which offers water and towels.
Welcome was less then friendly.

Definitely does not live up to the rating on Wotif and for a 5 night stay, incredibly expensive for what this hotel offers. Would not return and annoyed I stuck here for the next few days!",U Paasha Seminyak
1473,Wonderful place to stay!,50,May 2017,"Great location. Staff are attentive and helpful. The hotel is modern and clean. Awesome buffet breakfast with lots of variety, even pancakes! Pool area has a view of the beach and can watch the sunset. Loved it!",U Paasha Seminyak
1474,Good location but room is old and dirty,30,May 2017,"Good location, surrounded by a lot of restaurant and shops. Opposite of hotel has a 24 hours convenient shop. Yet, bed sheet is dirty when I check-in. Breakfast is not delicious. Is not worth the money. Will not recommend to others.",U Paasha Seminyak
1475,"Excellent location, comfortable and great breakfast.",40,May 2017,"Is a Great Hotel and your staff was very friendly and hospitality. The location is perfect, near the restaurants, shops and close the beach. The breakfast is a great selection of foods, very good selection of fruits.",U Paasha Seminyak
1476,Wonderful stay! Best hotel along the street!,50,February 2017,"We stayed one night at U Paasha before we moved to our villa. It was a wonderful 24 hour stay! I think check out time is based on the time you check in. Eg, 6 pm then you check out at 6pm instead of the usual 11 or 12 noon. Great idea!!! Wonder how they arrange the rooms though. But great!

Our room was on same level as the reception. Didn't like it that it was the same level. But after going in and out, we realised it's good cause we don't have to wait for the lift. :)

The hotel is located right smack along Jalan Kayu Aya,( or Eat street, Jalan Oberoi) Very very convenient. Minimarts, restaurants (try Batik, just 10 second right of the hotel. Very reasonable and beautiful restaurant) Kimberley Massage is very good, cheap and friendly. Better than the expensive spas that we went and which we felt were not as good as Kimberly)

The rooms were very large, clean and we liked it a lot. No complaints.

Swimming pool was surprisingly warm as we went at night. There wasn't anyone around. Couldn't find the gym though. There was no signage. Was told it's the same level as the outdoor roof top pool.

Breakfast was good. Eggs station, where u can order poached eggs ( nicely done!), omelette. Freshly made pancakes which were good! Asian, Indo and Western selection. The selection was good. Good spread.

Overall, wonderful stay at this hotel. Staff were friendly especially the guy at the entrance by the road. Always greeting us. We will definitely come back to this hotel. Great location and very good hotel, clean and prices are reasonable. After we left for our villa, which was poorly maintained not a very good stay. We missed U Paasha and hoped we were there instead.",U Paasha Seminyak
1477,Smelly room,30,May 2017,"The size of our room was great - so spacious & plenty of room! The staff were very friendly. The pool was great & the cocktails were amazing.

However, there was a strong constant sewerage smell in our room; it was foul & was unbearable our first night there. We advised the staff at reception & they came to our room & sprayed some air freshener spray! This was a bandaid solution as this only lasted a small amount of time. We ended up going to the local Mini Mart & bought the biggest can of air freshener (2 in 1) we could find as well as a few fragrance cubes to place around our room - this helped but we shouldn't have had to do that. We had to continually spray our room. For this, I'd probably not stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1478,Room smelt of sewerage,10,May 2017,In a good location but the whole place smelt of sewerage Our room smelt so bad we had to change rooms in the middle of the night. Breakfast was ordinary buffet style The pool area was large with plenty of deck chairs and was located on the roof. The pool is very shallow,U Paasha Seminyak
1479,nice hotel and very strategic location,40,May 2017,"there's lots of good coffee shops in neighbourhood, and hotel provides free bycycle for rent too..
the room was nice and large, especially the shower room, i love it!
breakfast was pretty nice, their coffee wasn't too good but it's not a problem, i could just walked about 2-3 min and had a good coffee anytime.
the staffs were polite and helpful.
i think we'll be back here in our next holiday to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1480,Great hotel in the centre of Seminyak,40,May 2017,"I stayed here for 2 nights with a friend. We were on a trip to bali and keen to shop, eat and relax. Its located smack bang in the middle of one of the best shopping streets in Seminyak and also surrounded by great cafes and restaurant options. Walking distance to motel mexicola, Mamasan and very well known to taxi drivers and motorcycle drivers. The rooms are very big and open. Good aircon, spacious shower and the rooftop pool is great. Its by no means luxurious but it does the job and its a great option if you are planning to shop, eat and just need a nice clean place to stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1481,First time to Bali and,50,May 2017,"This was my first time to Bali and my first solo trip so I decided to spend the first three nights here to get settled into Bali life.

The accommodation was great the rooms are massive and clean, breakfast is amazing and the pool is great and gets sun all day. I used the gym while I was here also and has all the basics and a great view.
The location is great your in the middle of everything and especially for me as it was my first time I could walk and get around everywhere very easily or jump in a taxi.
My one thing is watch out for ""taxi"" drivers at the airport...I ended up getting into a fake taxi and charged double! And feeling quite uncomfortable through the journey. Make sure you use the Blue Bird taxis that are on a meter.

But my stay was amazing :) and would definitely recommend and come again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1482,Lovely oasis in the middle of seminyak,50,May 2017,"Wonderful hotel in the middle of Seminyak. You can barely tell there's a lively Main Street outside. Honestly I came here for the rooftop pool and was not disappointed!! Watching the sun set from the pool bar was also quality.
Rooms are massive and super comfortable. Highly recommend! Easy to get everywhere from here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1483,A get away.,50,May 2017,"This is an exceptional place to stay, loved it and would highly recommend it. Staff are friendly and look after your every need. Close to restaurants and shops and walking distance to everything. Great restaurants in this area especially Chandi went there several times.",U Paasha Seminyak
1484,"Great Location, Lovely Breakfast",30,May 2017,"U Paasha is in a fabulous central location of Seminyak, it's staff are all very courteous and well trained. Unfortunately for us we our room was under the Pool Bar and we were woken most mornings by the Pool Lounges being dragged into position. The housekeeping definitely needs work and they also need to update their linen. However the rooms are large and well set out.",U Paasha Seminyak
1485,"Relaxing atmosphere,and a very pleasant stay.",50,May 2017,"This hotel was fabulous, from the time we checked in to checking out it had a fantastic feel. It was quiet and relaxing enabling us to get away from the bustle of the streets. The buffet breakfast was lovely with lots of variety and the Rooftop Bar was a great place to watch the sun set. Would definately recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1486,Lovely place to stay,40,April 2017,"Stayed here for 5 nights and had a great time, on check in at 5pm we were informed that you check out at the time you check in which was a brilliant touch as we wanted late check out as we had to leave for an evening flight, never experienced this at any other hotel so very impressive, the breakfast as others state was superb so much choice and all of a high standard, we stayed at 3 hotels on our trip and this was by far the best breakfast. The rooms were big and spacious my only downside and it may be just our room 106 there were red stains all over the mirror and the shower floor was very grotty, plus being open plan it's not the most private. The bed was really comfy and didn't hear any noise! The location was great, airport transfer a rip off tho we were quoted 400,000 by the staff and we got a bluebird for 80,000!!! The rooftop pool was beautiful and the standard of food at the bar was very high as well! All in all a great stay and would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1487,Great hotel in the heart of seminyak,50,May 2017,Awesome hotel located right in the heart of Seminyak. Big rooms with doors that open up onto balcony. The absolute buffet breakfast- best I've actually had in my 12 visits to Bali! Also loved the fact you could check out the equivalent timeyou checked in. ( 24hour time to use your room (check in 7pm check out 7pm)),U Paasha Seminyak
1488,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Location (Shame about the Wi-Fi)",40,May 2017,"I have stayed here before and was so impressed by the super large modern rooms, awesome staff , great location right on Eat Street in Seminyak and suburb breakfast buffet. Only issue this time was the crappy wi-fi reception, which meant I had to eat up my own data at considerable expense. This may be the deal breaker for when I come to Bali next time. Special mention to Guna and the breakfast team for their outstanding friendly and obliging service.",U Paasha Seminyak
1489,I would recommend this hotel.,50,April 2017,The staff and location of this hotel is great! Their gym and pool facilities were good too. The breakfast variety is great with a mix of Indonesian and western food. This hotel is close to amazing restaurants and lots of retail stores.,U Paasha Seminyak
1490,1 week stay at U Paasha,50,May 2017,"Brilliant hotel in a great location. I am currently staying here with my daughter and we both love it. Huge rooms that are well maintained and very clean. Beds are comfy and good quality bed linen. Fab views from 5th floor and very handy for the pool and bar. The staff are so lovely - their hospitality is genuine. Breakfast is brilliant, massive choice for all tastes. Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1491,Great quiet oasis in Seminyak,50,May 2017,"Stayed here for 2 nights recently with my hubby on our first nights of an 8 night child free holiday and it was a perfect choice! Great location! In the heart of everything yet so quiet in your room or at pool! Rooms are spacious, cool with the most comfy bed I've slept on in Bali! Breakfast was great with a large selection to choose from. Staff were excellent! So friendly and helpful! Could not recommend this place more!! Would come back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1492,Excellent hotel right in the heart,50,May 2017,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay, rooms had plenty space and very clean, amenities good, restaurant served good and reasonably priced food, staff lovely and very helpful.
I'd definitely stay again. Thanks guys",U Paasha Seminyak
1493,Average,20,May 2017,The service wasn't over friendly and the rooms were definitely not very clean. Just felt grotty. Would definitely not stay here again. It was disappointing as this was the last two days of our honeymoon and we felt very let down from all the good reviews this hotel has.,U Paasha Seminyak
1494,Business trip,30,April 2017,"Good hotel very well located nice breakfast large variety of food friendly and helpful staff, amazing rooftop pool, but the room on the 5 th floor was too noisy the bathroom was not neat otherwise everything was fine",U Paasha Seminyak
1495,"Great location, spacious rooms and flexible check-out times",40,April 2017,"The location of this hotel is perfect - just a short walk away from some of the major shopping attractions in Seminyak and excellent restaurants and bars. The rooms are really spacious and cool - a great relief from the heat outside. The all day breakfast and flexible check-out times were definitely a winner! There are some improvements that could make the experience even better - the wifi connection in the rooms could improve (it was very slow and would often disconnect completely), the towels need an upgrade - we had some that were stained and/or had holes in them. There is also a weird, sewage like smell in certain parts of the hotel. Overall though, a fairly good experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
1496,Great location but very loud,30,April 2017,"I booked this hotel for my parents when they went to Bali over Easter. They said that the location was great and rooms spacious and fairly comfortable, but it was extremely loud from the surrounds, not helped by the room acoustics and the sound of plumbing running through the night - they struggled to sleep the first couple of nights. A quick note that they're not particularly sensitive sleepers; both are snorers and have dealt with each others' snoring for many a years!",U Paasha Seminyak
1497,Poo Pasha II,30,May 2017,The hotel is great if you want to be in the middle of Seminyak high street. The breakfast is great and all staff are friendly.and very accommodating. The beds are very comfortable and large. One problem is the awful smell of sewage particularly in the 1st floor apartments and communal area. The rooftop pool has amazing views and very relaxing. All in all nice hotel shame about the smell.,U Paasha Seminyak
1498,What a BBQ,40,May 2017,"Mediterranean BBQ ALL you can eat seafood, ribs, chicken. Great sides and desserts 🍨
Fixed price for food and one wine our beer with this deal. Works out around $21 Australian.
Great view over the town and to the sea.
Enjoy this BBQ on 3 nights a week, another one not to be missed when you come to Bali.

Cheers 🍻",U Paasha Seminyak
1499,family holiday,50,May 2017,"what a wonderful hotel to have a holiday at, great position to get to anywhere we had to travel to and right in the centre of seminyak, the hotel had great buffet breakfasts, very large and very clean bedrooms and a wonderful pool area with ample lounges,the staff were very considerate and helpful and i have no hesitation on recommending the hotel to prospective visitors",U Paasha Seminyak
1500,Best value for money hotel on the main strip.,50,April 2017,"Awesome everything. Best hotel on the busy Seminyak strip. Our AC broke down and they had moved us to a new room in 15 minutes! They moved everything for us as the exact replica to where we had it in the previous room.
Amazing service!
Great breakfast 'anywhere anytime' and 24 check in turn around time.
Excellent. Highly recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
1501,Overnight,50,April 2017,"One night was just not enough. This hotel was gorgeous. Amazing rooftop pool and bar, room large and spotless, toiletries divine. Great location, in the heart of Seminyak Village yet rooms quiet. Pity we only had one night there, but will be back and highly recommend to friends and family.Thanks Daniel for the card and bday cake, lovely gesture.",U Paasha Seminyak
1502,Pu Paasha,40,April 2017,"For a 4 star hotel this is an excellent choice. The rooms are spacious and modern, the hotel is clean and the roof top pool area is a great place to spend your day and sunset. The breakfast Is very good and the staff are efficient and friendly. Good location on busy street. The only problems were, as we stayed on level 1, were the loud air conditioning noises through the night, and water landing outside our room from overflow pipes and the daily poo smell in the corridor. Either poo or eggs I'm not sure but not pleasant. Also lots of Ozi's at the hotel so nice and lively!! (See picture)",U Paasha Seminyak
1503,Great Seminyak Hotel!,50,April 2017,"I love staying at U Paasha! You can't beat the central Seminyak location and friendly service. The rooms are really big and super cool and minimalist in style. Their breakfast buffet is very high quality, with lots of Western and Asian choices. Love, love, love!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1504,Great holiday spot,50,April 2017,"I had a great time staying at the hotel and exploring the bars and restaurants near by, just the relaxing time I needed after a busy few months at work. The hotel was in a great location for me to do everything.",U Paasha Seminyak

1506,best place,50,April 2017,"love my stay here, very impressed with the 24hr idea, thank you for the complimentary drinks, had no complains about the place, if there was a downside, its not as convenient to the beach as i thought it would be. but lovesss!",U Paasha Seminyak

1508,Lovely hotel in perfect location,50,April 2017,"U Paasha is perfectly located in Seminyak, next to Seminyak square and all the action. Tons of cafe, bars and restaurant just along the street. Hotel is very nice and well priced for the location. Read a review on trip advisor about the lack of shade on the rooftop pool and I would agree. They need some more shade as it gets very very hot during the midday sun but you're in Bali go to the beach! Smooth check in and out. Friendly, attentive staff and a good selection at breakfast. Enjoyed my stay and would go back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1509,Overall very good,40,April 2017,This hotel is in a great location if you want to be close to shops and restaurants . The rooms were oversized and comfortable. Staff and breakfast all very good. I would recommend and will stay again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1510,"nice location, nice staffs",40,April 2017,"I do really like the flexibility, the time of stay at this hotel, which is 24 hours, from check in time.
Good location, in the centre of Seminyak, with various activities, restaurants, shops.
Very helpfull and hospitality staffs.",U Paasha Seminyak
1511,Great hotel,40,April 2017,"Loved it. Would recommend to all travellers. Great location, big rooms, good service from all staff. Rooftop pool was a gem. Breakfast was also good and the coffee was the best. Many great restaurants on the hotels doorstep also.",U Paasha Seminyak

Friendly staff and large selection available for breakfast. This hotel was recommended to me by a friend and I would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1513,Very good hotel in a great location..,40,May 2016,"Good roof top pool only downside was there needed to be more shade available..

Service from the staff was excellent and so was the food.. Rooms clean and tidy and a decent size..

Great breakfast..

Would stay again..",U Paasha Seminyak
1514,Lovely Smorgasboard,50,April 2017,"A beautiful variety of local seafood, pork ribs and curry. All set of the roof top. We randomly walked in and was surprised by the variety of food layed out beautifully. Customer service was great. Pricing was very reasonable too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1515,Great place in cracking location,50,April 2017,"We loved it here. Great place for singles, couples or families. Amazing hotel staff genuinely make you feel welcome and look after you, in every way. Breakfast staff are outstanding. Even security staff out the front are bright and friendly, they are so kind to the kids. They would rush to help you into and out of taxis, or cross the street. We found everyone at the u paasha to be so hospitable, friendly and happy.
The location is superb, you are literally within a 1500m radius of countless restaurant options. Some of which are world class. Enjoyed the roof top pool. A calm quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle. Beds were comfortable. Was quiet and safe. Nothing was too much trouble from the magnificent team of staff. We will be back. Highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1516,An excellent hotel in the middle of Seminyak,40,April 2017,Very convenient location and modern hotel.Breakfast was included with a large variety of asian and european dishes. The rooftop bar is great and there were very few children running around. The roximity to fine restaurants was a bonus.,U Paasha Seminyak
1517,A very good stay overall,40,April 2017,"Very nice hotel, in need of some renovation but in a great location. The pool is great, the breakfast is very good too. Only complaint is that there were some people, no in the hotel, in a house nearby that made a lot of noise so a couple of nights it was difficult to sleep.",U Paasha Seminyak
1518,Girls trip,40,April 2017,"We stayed here for 8 nights. The staff were grea, funny friendly and very accomodating.
After a few hiccups, once I explained to the staff what the issues were, I felt listened to and understood and U Paasha Hotel, Staff and Senior Management made sure we left feeling fantastic and satisfied and My friends and I will definitely return. Great Job guys",U Paasha Seminyak
1519,Relax and enjoy!,50,April 2017,"Great rooms, very spacious and beautiful modern decor. Very comfy beds! Staff and room service were very friendly and accommodating. Hotels location spot on, close to everything but still nice and quiet.",U Paasha Seminyak
1520,Great hotel in Seminyak,50,April 2017,"We had a great time at U Paasha during ur recent stay. The rooms were fantastic, so spacious, great amenities, comfy bed. The buffet breakfast was excellent, the omelettes and waffles and pancakes made to order were so yummy! The rooftop pool was great, we could always get a sun lounge and the juices by the pool were delicious. Would highly recommend U Paasha to anyone looking for accommodation in walking distance to all the great restaurants in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1521,Great experience at Upaasha.,50,March 2017,Had a wonderful experience staying 7 nights at Upaasha with my husband and 6-year old daughter. Every staff member at the hotel was friendly and pleasant. The service was fantastic - we had a prompt response to every one of our requests. The rooms were very large and furnished well with a modern look. The roof top pool was amazing and always maintained to an impeccably clean standard. We also had airport transfer included in the package which was a welcome relief. Really enjoyed the breakfast - a staff member would approach us and ask whether we wanted coffee or tea as soon as we entered the dining area (so lovely to sit down for breakfast without having to wait long for a coffee). The room was well stoked with water every day. The hotel is located in a very central area right in the heart of cafes and shops. Its about a 20 minute walk away from Potato Head and Ku De Ta beach clubs.,U Paasha Seminyak
1522,Best place to stay and Best of Bali,50,April 2017,"U Paasha is center in the middle of Seminyak. Which is good because you can go up and down the strip. Their is a 24hr mini mart across the hotel.The staff at the resort is nice and very friendly and pleasant. I had the pleasure to speak to a lot of them. They are beautiful inside and out. The room are big. You can see the sunset on the rooftop. The food and drinks is good at the hotel. We had breakfast included in which if you are a late sleeper you have till 11a to eat breakfast. The manager Devi surprise me by sending a piece of cake and placing balloons in my room for my birthday. I was so surprised when I enter my room. She is the best!!! We had a problem with our tour and without saying she gave us our money back. We didn't expect to get our money back but the level of service is amazing. They will do everything and anything to ensure you are satisfy. When we chilled at the pool we had the pleasure of speaking with Martina. She was training but was so adorable and sweet. They do have a gym, nothing big but has everything you need dor a quick workout. They also ofder free yoga sessions. I will definitely stay here again in my next visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1523,"Excellent location, great facilities and AMAZING staff!!",50,April 2017,"If you love Seminyak like we do, then I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is perfect - walking distance from all the popular restaurants, bars and Seminyak Square/Seminyak Village.
What really makes Upaasha great though are the staff and the service they provide. They can't do enough to make your stay as comfortable as possible and nothing is too hard, no request too much. We've stayed here twice now and this will now be our go to hotel every time we stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1524,Good value for money,40,April 2017,"The hotel exceeded our expectation. We tought being located at the main street it must be loud. Fortunately the rooms are located at the very back of the hotel.

ROOM:
Rooms are huge with modern style. Information for bathtub lover, no bath tub. For us it's not a problem. In the room there is a radio complete with iPod docking station. Breakfast has a good food selection.

FOOD & BEVERAGE:
Breakfast has a good selection and finish untul 11:00, great for long sleeper. Unfortunately the roof bar is closed at 10:00.

LOCATION:
Directly in the downtown at JL. Kayu Aya. Eateries are walking distance if not across the street.

STAFFS:
Friendly and helpful.

Over all we had a good stay in U Paasha. A good base for exploring Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1525,"Fantastic Hotel, Amazing rooftop pool",50,March 2017,"Started with a minor mishap (the car booked by the hotel to pick us up from the airport didn't turn up.) This was the one and only fault during our 3 night stay, and the hotel couldn't have done any more to make this up to us. We were upgraded to a suite, the replacement taxi was comped and we were given free drinks. The hotel room itself was clean, bed was comfortable and shower was hot and powerful, being able to order breakfast to the room for no fee is a nice touch.

The rooftop pool is simply a stunning place to chillout and enjoy the sunshine, the waiting staff around the pool are attentive and helpful. I really couldn't fault this hotel at all, It is on par with some of the other 5 star beach resorts in Seminyak at a fraction of the price.",U Paasha Seminyak
1526,Incredible location and oversized rooms,50,April 2017,"Thank you for a terrific trip! Friendly staff, amazing location, loved the accessibility to shops and restaurants! Rooftop pool was peaceful and had a view of the beach. Nice breakfast too! Would come back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1527,Went for a wedding,50,April 2017,"Amazing stay - 100% recommend. Room was spacious - king size bed, day bed and couch. Huge shower. Clean. Complimentary breakfast is a feast! Hotel rooftop bar and pool is luxurious and a cool escape. Aircon was awesome with strong blockout curtains for a relaxing sleep. Room safe provided. Restaurants were amazing in the area with a short taxi ride to Kuta. This is the best hotel in Seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak
1528,Short Weekend Trip,40,April 2017,"Spacious neat rooms, good bfast buffet, entrance under renovation (access ownly via garage), rooftop bar closes proir 10pm (Saturday) and room service menue doesnt cover (rooftop) bar selection, late check-out was possible",U Paasha Seminyak
1529,Girly visit,40,April 2017,Prefect stay if you're on a budget. Really big rooms fantastic breakfast and rooftop pool. Gede was our pool waiter and he is an asset to management very friendly and helpful he really loves his job. Thank you Daniel and staff for a wonderful experience.,U Paasha Seminyak
1530,"Love, love, love!",50,April 2017,"Beautiful rooms (especially the bathroom) and a stunning rooftop pool. I stayed here for the last 3 nights of my holiday. Such a fantastic location, right in the heart of Eat Street. Thank you U Paasha. I'll be back in September and I can't wait!",U Paasha Seminyak
1531,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Stay",50,March 2017,"If I go back to Bali, I will go back here.

Beautiful rooms. Amenities were awesome, breakfast was delicious, great location.

The pool area was having works done so a bit noisy, but they were offering half price food and drinks up there which is a fair deal.",U Paasha Seminyak
1532,Fantastic location,50,April 2017,"Stayed at UPaasha for last two nights on our trip and it has a sensational Seminyak location right on eat street. Lovely breakfast, large fresh modern rooms and the worlds most comfy beds and pillows. Great roof top pool bar, 5 min walk to beach and very attentive staff. 10 min walk to Motel Mexicola and try Batik restaurant over the road it's sensational food.",U Paasha Seminyak
1533,Nice hotel,50,March 2017,"We really liked the hotel at the first moment when we arrived...
The staff was very helpful and friendly!!
Our room was exactly the same as on the pictures,and the pool on the top was awsome!
We really liked the breakfast selection too.
Our honeymoon there was perfect!!!👍🏻",U Paasha Seminyak
1534,U Paasha Pleasure,50,April 2017,"As a first timer to Bali I didn't really know what to expect. Some well informed friends recommend U Paasha in Seminyak.
It didn't take long for me to see why.

A very warm and friendly welcome at reception really impressed me.
The rooms are clean and spacious. You'll enjoy a great breakfast with great variety. The rooftop pool and outdoor dinning area with Bar and BBQ is such a great place to spend quality time with family and friends, enjoying a drink working on that tan and watching the sunset.

I've given it 5 stars quite simply because of the staff at U Paasha. Attentive, efficient and just the most beautiful people.

Thoroughly enjoyed my experience there and will be going back with out a doubt.

Keep up the great work Devi and all the staff members there.

Cheers,
Bryan",U Paasha Seminyak
1535,Great experience,40,March 2017,"I had such a great experience during my stay in U paasha , the location is fab and the staff was so friendly 😀 I will definitely come back again and recommend it to everyone ... had to be there during the silent day and enjoyed the pool all day and the BBQ in the night , all was great and really thank you so much for making us happy there !",U Paasha Seminyak
1536,"Outstanding location,very modern",40,February 2017,"Location like non other, right in the heart of Seminyak. My friend and I stayed here the last 3 days of our trip. We hadn't booked our last 3 days of accomodation until we had arrived in Bali and it was such an easy decision to choose the U Paasha. It was the only hotel that we walked past every night when going out for dinner and had actually wished we had booked here for the bulk of the trip. The rooms were ultra modern and very spacious. The buffet breakfast was good and there was a selection of DVD's that you could borrow for the room which was good for nights in too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1537,Great location,40,March 2017,"We stayed here for 2 nights. We found it clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. I'll key point a few things and then go into more detail for those interested.

• The bed was amazing
• We had a balcony to stand on
• Shower was good
• Great for intimate couple but maybe not all friends (I've explained below)
• Aircon nice and cool
• Lots of toiletries provided (cotton buds, shower caps etc.)
• 2 mirrors to choose from for makeup and also double full length mirror on sliding wardrobe
• TV with movie channels
• Easy to use safe

This place really is in a prime location. Right in a busy spot so you leave the hotel and you have shops and restaurants at your doorstep. The room was quiet though which I found strange but I was very happy about it. The room is spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is open plan to the room and the toilet and shower doors are not enclosed so you can hear everything which didn't bother us at all but I imagine it could be uncomfortable for some. Free bottled water in the room. Free buffet breakfast included. The spread was plentiful but we found the food to be very average (free buffet though). Reception area was big and an interesting layout. It looks nicer than in the photos they have. Gym is good. Not amazing but it has the basics. Pool area is funky and the pool is really cool looking. The reason I gave this place a 4 was because we didn't find the staff personable at all and found it hard to communicate and ask question because of language barriers. I understand it's a different country but at least one staff member that can answer simple tourist questions would be nice. To be honest though we would come back because overall for the price it was still a really good stay and we left happy. I would recommend this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
1538,Amazing service,40,March 2017,"Nice rooms, rooftop pool and foods. This place is so flexible with checkout times etc. The manager went out her way to please the guests, and the service was absolutly amazing. its close to the beach, shops and restaurants",U Paasha Seminyak
1539,It's seen better days,30,March 2017,"We stayed here given the amazing location to the trendy seminyak area (right on eat street and all the best beach lounges). However this place really needs a facelift and updates to rooms. Our room was nice but the bathrooms smelled the whole time and the view was overlooking garbage and construction. The breakfast was meh average (alot of option just nothing great) although the staff were great.

For $100 a night this place wasn't worth it. I'd stay maybe for $50 a night given its very convenient location. The saving grace to this place is the wonderful and responsive staff and rooftop pool area which was very nice place to relax on a hot afternoon drinking a bintang.",U Paasha Seminyak
1540,Avoid this hotel,20,March 2017,"A once new and clean hotel has slipped, I have stayed here before but won't return after my last visit. Noisy air conditioning, leaking toilets and some sort of animal or pest running inside the roof all night long were just a few of the problems we encountered during our stay at U Pasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1541,A+ Location and Facilities,50,March 2017,"Having stayed at IZE next door previously, I knew this hotel would be in a great location. It's close to all boutiques and restaurants, and if you need your coffee hit, Revolver and Expat (next to Sisterfields) are just a short walk away.

The buffet breakfast was great and the rooftop pool is divine. Their 24 hour check in/check out is a massive plus as well.

All staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the security guards at the front who were quick to help with crossing the busy road or getting us a Blue Bird taxi.

Will definitely stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1542,Michael,50,March 2017,"Wonderful hotel- friendly staff- close to everything in a great area! Highly recommend!
We stayed for our honeymoon and could not be happier with the service provided.

Highly recommend the all you can eat baffet on the rooftop!",U Paasha Seminyak
1543,Great,50,March 2017,"What a lovely hotel.. right in the centre of everything. Walking distance to everything.
Room was clean and large. Buffet breakfast delicious and plentiful. All employees were lovely, and most importantly the rooftop pool is amazing.",U Paasha Seminyak
1544,The Best hotel in the street,50,March 2017,Everyone needs to stay at the Upaasha.Perfectly positioned in eat street and well priced. The staff are the most genuine I have met in Bali. I could not fault this amazing experience. All comments from an ex Hotel Inspector.,U Paasha Seminyak
1545,Top value hotel on Eat street in Seminyak,40,March 2017,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Seminyak Really big rooms, Breakfasts excellent, staff really friendly defo stay there again. You are within walking distance to all the resturants and shops and the bars.",U Paasha Seminyak
1546,Great value small hotel,50,March 2017,U Paasha has great large rooms in a great location in Seminyak. Roof top pool is lovely. Breakfast is ample. Location is on centre of Eats St and a short walk or cab ride to everything Seminyak has to offer.,U Paasha Seminyak
1547,Best price hotel of performance!,40,March 2017,"Because I stayed only for one night, I was looking for a hotel with an emphasis on cheapness. I found U Paasha Seminyak there. The hotel was clean and fashionable for cheapness. And the size and cleanliness of the room was also satisfactory. Also, if I have a chance to travel to Bali, I would like to use it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1548,Family Holiday to Bali,50,February 2017,This hotel is in an amazing location. A lot of great restaurants and an easy walk to the beach. Also the beds are extremely comfortable and the staff are lovely. Very happy with our overall experience.,U Paasha Seminyak
1549,Very Nice Indeed- Breakfast perfect,50,March 2017,"Hotel located on a busy street. The entrance is beautifully designed.
Rooms nice an big, same to the showers, the concrete/spiked floor didn't like though.
Bed - king size was so comfy! Room very big, clean and modern. Air/con noise, keeps dripping.

Breakfast is perfect as other reviewers say. A lot of selections!

Customer service is top notch, happy and smiling staff, well done.

Rooftop pool and bar was nice! Quiet and can relax, nice food too.

BBQ food wasn't the best, cold and not much variety.

Location is by Seminyak square (please don't bother going its crap)

Beach is under 10min walk. Restaurant and shops right there.

I wouldn't say this is the best location in Bali, perhaps Ubud as near to all attractions.

Overall hotel perfect and staff makes you feel welcomed.

If you have not been to Bali just remember ""BEEP BEEP"" you'll understand when your there lol",U Paasha Seminyak
1550,Fantastic location and hotel,50,March 2017,If you want be to in the heart of eat street and where the best restaurants and shops are then stay here . Hotel staff and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Well priced and huge rooms with big bathrooms- definitely stay again,U Paasha Seminyak
1551,The worst hotel I have ever stayed!!!,10,March 2017,"Let me just start by saying I have travelled to Bali every year for the last 4 years and for the first time decided to try something new.

The stay started with the check in staff attempting to charge me for 7 nights when we were staying for 4.

Then the first night there was a horrible ear piercing sound which seemed to subside only when one flushed the toilet...Unfortunately this cure was only found after enduring hours of being awake and finally one of us needing to go to the bathroom.

The second day the beds were covered in ants. The towels provided are a shade of grey... the robes I would even want to touch and the walls are so paper thin you can hear the TV next door and the comings and goings of everyone in the hotel. Always great when you can hear guests begging their drunk friend who has obviously passed out to let them in!

We paid extra to be on the fifth floor. Yes... the floor with the view, the best floor of the hotel. Don't be fooled... the view they speak of is a dump site. You can watch men load rubbish all morning to be taken away... only to be refilled by the afternoon. So why don't we add insult to injury... our room from day two smelt like a sewage plant. The maintenance team thankfully were on the ball to turn up with a spatula and a spray to administer blue loo in our air conditioning vents.

U Paasha... you left me underwhelmed, disappointed. Never again!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1552,Good location,30,March 2017,"Hotel has good location in seminayk. Walking distance to seminayak square mall. Lots of small clothes shops, massages and bars across the road. The hotel is value for money. We had a lil issue with the toilet drainage system as it didnt flush properly. The staff were very nice and helpful in resolving the problem quickly. Good value for money.",U Paasha Seminyak
1553,Relaxing,50,March 2017,"Excellent stay! We hope to return in the near future. Location is absolutely fantastic. Staff excellent.
Spacious cool rooms and very comfy bed. All food excellent. Loved it. Pool is fab on the rooftop. In such humidity the breeze you get is very cooling, not to mention the tranquility.",U Paasha Seminyak
1554,Great location,40,March 2017,"We enjoyed this hotel for one night having flown late into Bali from adelaide. Check in was easy and we appreciated the location to restaurants and Kwik-E-Mart even at midnight. Open plan bathroom meant you better get used to your better halves' noises! In a nutshell - huge room, lovely comfy bed, excellent breakfast. Recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
1555,Awesome!,50,March 2017,"Awesome stay! The staff was so friendly, attentive and helpful. They made sure all my needs were met. The hotel has an amazing lobby, clean and spacious rooms, the pool rooftop has awesome views and the food was delicious. The hotel is in a prime location - surrounded by bars, restaurants and shops. It is at a walking distance to Seminyak Square and Seminyak Village.",U Paasha Seminyak
1556,"Location, Location, Location!",40,March 2017,"U Paasha is a wonderful hotel, in the perfect location! The staff are very friendly and accommodating, your favorite shops & restaurants just steps away & the rooftop pool is perfectly designed ensuring sunshine all day long! Breakfast was so so, we ate out most days :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1557,"Stunning hotel, good location",50,March 2017,"We loved our short stay here. The hotel is clean and luxurious. The breakfast was amazing with lots of variety! The pool is lovely. When we were there there was work being done on part of the pool area but to compensate for this there was two for one cocktails all day! Very happy with that.

We would definitely stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1558,great!,50,March 2017,"love it here and have stayed over 5 times! great gym & roof top pool - walking distance to great cafes & bars
clean and tidy room
air conditioned
friendly service
rooms nice and spacious
walking distance to spring spa",U Paasha Seminyak
1559,"Huge rooms, great roof top pool",40,March 2017,This is my second stay at U Paasha. Staff are always friendly and helpful. The rooms are huge. This stay I was offered an upgrade on arrival to fifth floor ocean view which I was grateful for! Roof top pool is fantastic. Yes there are renovations happening but they weren't noisy when I was there and barely an inconvenience. Breakfast was beautiful. Slight wear and tear in the rooms but huge and clean and comfortable. Will be back to stay next week on my return trip home. Great hotel in the middle of the action.,U Paasha Seminyak
1560,"Lovely big rooms, amazing location!",40,March 2017,"You cannot beat the location ! You can walk to body works, ku de ta, la favela, motel mexicola, mama saan .. mostly all the restaurants in five mins. It was me and two girls in the one room, heaps of space, bathrooms need work they are old and need rennovated. Pity the pool is being renovated as well, noisy but still could use pool. Two for one drinks was the compensation which helped haha. Food was really good. Staff were amazing, so super friendly.",U Paasha Seminyak
1561,"Nice hotel, big rooms, nice pool and amazing breakfast",50,March 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights it was our first destination in Bali. We arrived late after a 16 hr flight for the U.K. And the check in was annoyingly slow !
However that was soon forgotten about, the rooms are lovely. They are really big and have a great shower. The rooftop pool is nice, there are plenty of sun loungers however there was some maintenance which meant part of it was cornered off and a bit noisy. It wasn't all day though and the drinks were half price to compensate for it.
The location is good for restaurants and bars, it's about a 20 /30min walk to the beach or taxis are cheap just make sure they have the meter on.
The breakfast really was good the choice was great and was different each day.
I'm not sure I would go back to seminyak as it's a bit western for my liking but if I did I would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1562,Girls getaway,40,March 2017,"There was not enough sunshades.
Initial problems with the air conditioner which was only sorted after the 3rd attempt. There was no offer of a room change.
Great location, good breakfast and pleasant interior throughout.
Rooms are very spacious.
Rooftop pool has a great view with attentive staff for ordering food and drink.",U Paasha Seminyak
1563,Great mid-range Seminyak base for those who like a swim,40,November 2016,"U Paasha is located centrally on a main st in Seminyak (away from the beach). Rates are mid-range and the rooms are a good size. The buffet breakfast has good variety, there's a OK gym and the staff are friendly. My highlight is the awesome rooftop pool for sunset and sunrise views!",U Paasha Seminyak
1564,"Fantastic modern, funky boutique hotel!",50,March 2017,"We stayed 5 nights at this great little hotel. Had a room with 2 king single beds in as I shared with a girlfriend. The hotel was very well priced considering it's modern styling and fantastic location near to everything. It was clean and well serviced. The pool had some minor decking maintenance taking place so their compensation was to offer 'buy 1 drink get the 2nd free'. A fabulous way to keep your poolside costs down! The only negative I could say was that some minor repairs were needed with some fixtures, ie. our toilet roll holder was partway from coming away from the wall - not a big deal but if I noticed then other people will too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1565,Wow,50,March 2017,"I was looking forward to this place so much after reading all the good reviews.
Everything about the hotel is awesome .
The location is first class staff are fantastic and rooftop pool bar awesome .
I love the fact you can escape the madness on the street just jump in the lift and your in paradise.
Food is also 1st class .in a nutshell this is the place to be i certainly won't be looking anywhere else .
Well done to the staff and management at u paasha",U Paasha Seminyak
1566,Amazing service and location,50,February 2017,"My partner and myself needed a quick getaway from Melbourne and work!!
So we headed to Bali for 6 nights.... U Paasha is centrally located in Seminyak ..... Close to all amazing restaurants and shopping..... large rooms and an amazing roof top pool.... Our original booking was the premium room, we arrived to ground floor room with a wall view!

Lucky for us we met the GM Daniel beside the pool and in no time they moved us to a brighter room with a view! Amazing customer service from Daniel... thank-you.

Huge rooms with amazing bathrooms!

The roof top is simple amazing! I couldn't help but put my events hat on and dream up the amazing roof top entertainment plan!! 😁

Honestly U Paasha is a fantastic choice if your seeking a great location.

Very friendly and very gay friendly..... I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends!",U Paasha Seminyak
1567,"Very friendly, Hotel needs maintenance.",30,February 2017,"Stayed here with my partner for a week or so. Staff were very friendly and helpful, room was nice and spacious and bed was a nice size. Only downfall was our A/C leaked everywhere so we wanted to change rooms. The management put us in a better room with a view of the city and ocean for no extra. But that rooms A/C was still very noisy through out the night and the bathroom had a few odours. Would stay again but only for a night or two. Pool was awesome.",U Paasha Seminyak
1568,"great location, great staff - but",40,February 2017,"As return guests we were treated like VIP's - including a room upgrade.
but really - the standard rooms are just great anyway - & maybe even better than the larger rooms as the A/C in this larger room did not quiet do the job for us at night. (but I realise this may be a positive for some people).
The room we had at the front of the hotel also suffered from some street noise at night (taxi's have an annoying habit of sitting on their horns). But this would not be a problem for most other rooms as they do not front the street.
I still love the modern feel of the rooms with concrete floors & wide airy corridors.
The rooms are big & the beds & pillows comfortable & have convenient lamps & power points.& the TV has a very good selection of channels.
Breakfast really is the best ever for a small boutique hotel (honestly - much larger hotels could learn from the variety & quality of U Paasha breakfasts).
I just love the big showers & the bathroom amenities were quality.
It was unfortunate that the roof top pool decking was being renovated while we were there. I understand the need for this work - but the lack of chill music (which we loved last time) & the noise & obstructed view from the work was really not pleasant. A 2 for 1 cocktail all day offer as compensation did not work for us when when the margaritas were weak, small & not even frosted with salt (???). On the other hand - the view from the roof top bar is brilliant. You can see the ocean from here & there was always a pleasant breeze. I suggest improving this bar area also & employing staff that can actually make a cocktail.
But you just can not beat the location of this hotel & for this reason alone I will keep coming back. But I hope that next time all work is finished at the rooftop pool - it was so nice last visit & really should be a huge selling point for U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1569,Great,40,January 2017,Stayed here for two nights before going to the gili islands. Checked in late at night very smoothly. Room was very large and spacious and clean. Rooftop pool was gorgeous. Location is ideal right outside is the main strip and walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants but not noisy in room at all. Reception were very helpful and booked our boat for the islands. Would stay here again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1570,"Great stay, awesome breakfast",50,February 2017,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at U Paasha. The room was very modern & comfortable, the staff were very friendly with good English speaking skills. They arranged a scooter for us with a local hire man & even swapped our older helmets with their own so that we felt safer. The 24 hour flexible check-in system they offer is such a great concept especially for when you are moving onto another hotel or catching a flight, if you time it right then you don't have to wait around to check into your next hotel. Hats off to them for doing it, it must be such a nightmare to organise with out knowing what time people will arrive but it was quick & very organised when we arrived. The breakfast here was really top notch, it was a highlight & the best part of every day! Each morning I woke up to the smell of bacon wafting along the hall way. Great selection of different foods, everything was super fresh & tasty. I wish we lived closer so I could go back for breakfast",U Paasha Seminyak
1571,Few days in seminyak - Bali,40,February 2017,"It's a nice hotel, the location is great!
They lend a bike for the guest , it's cool cause u can see around !
The beach isn't nice, so is better u make a trip around uluwatu or another beaches or places !
Around the hotel has a lot of stores and good restaurants!
The room is really good, big and the bed is comfortable!
The only thing against is because they are doing some renovations in the pool, so there was not sun guard, it's too bad cause here in Bali the sun is really strong !
The breakfast is fantastic !",U Paasha Seminyak
1572,Modern hotel with a great rooftop pool,40,September 2016,Partner and I stayed for 4 nights. Very modern hotel rooms with polished concrete throughout. The large balcony was awesome overlooking Seminyak. Huge sliding doors open up for the breeze. Be sure to request the west facing room towards the beach to enjoy the sunset from your room. Rooftop pool and bar are a great spot for a few beers or a cocktail in the afternoon.,U Paasha Seminyak
1573,Exceeded Expectations,50,February 2017,"Chose U Paasha for the location and was not disappointed. The great surprise were the excellent rooms, service and general facility. Work was going on around the pool, but for the inconvenience (of which there was really none) there were two for one drinks all day.

We've stayed in some great and far more expensive hotels in Bali but U Paasha will be a first on our must return list.

Ginger Moon across the road doesn't hurt either!",U Paasha Seminyak
1574,Superb sleep,40,February 2017,"24 hour stay from time of arrival. Great for midnight flights in and out.
Although they were renovating decking in sections at roof top pool, compensated with 2-4-1 all day drinks. Rooms are spacious, shower huge, towels huge, bed huge and great sleeps. Awesome restaurants within vicinity. Gym was basic, with free weights. The treadmill mat kept stopping me from running, be vigilant. Room service was great.
Caught a cab to hotel from airport for $200k, but from hotel was $80k on the meter. Up to you to bargain.

Not far to walk/ride to Ku De Ta, Potato head, W.
Surrounding restaurants - awesome
Seminyak square - 300 metres",U Paasha Seminyak
1575,Good location,40,February 2017,"The location is great if you want instant access to shops and restaurants being on the main ""Eat Street"" of Seminyak. The hotel is about 3 years old but already requires some maintenance and upgrades. Suite size is fabulous as is ensuite. Some urinal smells some times but clear up with use. We endured 3 nights at rear of hotel thinking it would be quiet, unfortunately it was not. A quick talk to reception and relocation with no fuss. The roof top pool at this time of year is hard to use much as the winds are very strong and shade is minimal. Poolside cafe and bar OK and do good espresso martinis. Breakfast OK with a reasonable selection. The staff are super friendly and efficient and must be commended. Overall I would recommend for location, price and service. Pool surrounds under maintenance which detracted from overall ambience but will look good when finished. To compensate all poolside drinks 1/2 price.... bonus.",U Paasha Seminyak
1576,Glamourous hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,January 2017,"I stayed at U Paasha for four nights with my partner in Jan 2017. I was anxious about coming here after reading so many mixed reviews, since I wanted our getaway to be romantic, but I loved it! Really good value!! We were in room 512, a huge suite with a king bed. It was so peaceful, lovely and clean; with great modern facilities including a very cool AC (so refreshing, and cleaners never turn it off, bless them) and rain shower head. I also loved the black out curtains.. we slept so well!

Breakfast was so impressive, we always over ate and didn't try any of the breakfast/brunch places we were told to go to, since it was so delicious (and complimentary) at the hotel.

The pool on the rooftop is pretty fantastic - quite big, too! We didn't realise they were replacing floor boards around the pool during our stay though. A section was walled off, and the occasional construction noise could be heard.. but they offered 2 for 1 cocktails as an apology, which was a great deal. The noise really didn't bother me. It's a big area, and it's not like they are constantly hammering. It's easy to get sun beds too - never any issues no matter the time of day. Really impressed they provide sunscreen too, for free. This area could only be improved with a swim up pool bar, rather than staff going back and fourth with orders. The bar is a great place to watch the sunset, by the way.

We forgot to try the basement bar, but I'm sure we'll be back.

I'm trying to think of some balanced feedback... mmmm... The wifi was sometimes intermittent in our room, but mainly fine. The amenities smell gorgeous... but I hate ""conditioning shampoo"" - it's never good enough as conditioner. But this is a minor issue as there is a mini supermarket right over the road. I'd also love a magnifying mirror, but that's just blind old me. That's all I have to complain about. Ha ha. I really was so thrilled with this hotel, and it was just the trip away we needed :-)

Will definitely return here if we come back to Seminyak. Hope this review was useful :-)",U Paasha Seminyak
1577,Overnight Stay,40,February 2017,"We ended up at U-Paasha for an overnight stay as the pouring rain wouldn't allow us to go back to Ubud that evening -

The hotel had amazing and truly intriguing art exhibition by Irene Hoff- a mix of collage, cartoonesque patch work mixing Balinese and modern European vision - a great setting -

We stayed at a basic room which unfortunately didn't provide shaving cream, shaver and or toothbrush and paste - the bed was comfortable and the price fitted the accommodations (1.3M Rupya)

The breakfast buffet was the best part of the hotel with the roof-top pool: staff was very friendly and provided us with the missing items with a simple phone-call.

The location is great as it's just 5-10mins away from all shops and the beach clubs.

Recommended for a budget trip :))",U Paasha Seminyak
1578,Birthday Getaway,30,February 2017,"Nicely located at the heart of Seminyak, about 15min drive to Kuta.

Pretty cozy however a couple of points we felt was lacking to complete the stay:

1. Swimming pool was closed;should have notify us when we booked. A gesture of buy 1 get 2 drinks at bar could not solve most of our pool cravings.

2. Not expecting a birthday cake but at least Birthday greeting since we stayed during actual day.

3. Suite is rather run down especially the toilet and bathroom

4. BBQ dinner was not good in taste but the service recovery is good

I will give a 6/10 in overall if you are expecting a warm environment to be in for 5 days.",U Paasha Seminyak
1579,Great stay,50,February 2017,"We stayed here for 2 nights and we were very impressed... Right in the middle of the restaurants and shopping, the breakfast was excellent and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The 24hr checkout is fantastic and something we'd not had at other hotels in Bali. Definitely recommend",U Paasha Seminyak
1580,Location!,50,December 2016,"Amazing location with a number of restaurants and bars right across the street. In the heart of Semniyak.
The breakfast spread was amazing!
The pool very private with a wonderful view on the rooftop. The staff were vigilant and even showed away some people who weren't staying at the hotel and trying to use the pool I believe.
Can't say enough about the customer service! The people were so lovely and always helpful and accommodating.",U Paasha Seminyak
1581,Great Location,40,January 2017,"Whilst this a great spot for everything - the restaurants nearby and shopping is awesome, this hotel had a distinct smell and some of our party couldnt stand it - i suggest getting a room near the front of the hotel seemed less smelly. The bar was nice and the pool was extremely hard to get a seat near, lots of people and i think you needed to get up there early to land a spot. The decor was lovely and typical bali style looks great but dont look too close but very liveable.",U Paasha Seminyak
1582,Very nice & great location,40,December 2016,"I spent 6 very comfortable nights at U Paasha. The room was both comfortable and spacious. Located in the heart of Seminyak, the array of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops are on your doorstep. The service was very good; the breakfast had a number of options; however the huge pull was the roof pool, which is spacious, and has good options for food and beverage. I would definitely stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
1583,Right bang smack in the centre of Eat Street,40,December 2016,"Stayed here several times for several reasons.

1. Location - you are opposite Ultimo/Chandi - Seminyak a Square is 5 min walk. I love being able to stroll out for dinner or cocktail and not have to take a taxi.

2. 24 hour room use - you get 24 hours from check-in. If you check-in at 10pm you get to check-out 10pm.

Room are big and spacious, beds comfy. You could easily have a roll up bed added and the room not feel cluttered. Small balcony allowing fresh air.

The bathrooms are open plan, so if you like privacy (glass frosted door on toilet) then it might be an issue. The towels need to be replaced as they are getting a bit rough.

The pool area is fab, lots of day beds and shade. There are lots of pool staff, so getting a beverage or food is easy.

Ate in the restaurant wasn't a fan - as a vegetarian it just didn't work for me - not an issue as you're surrounded by restaurants.

Breakfast was a buffet (or you can have in your room/anywhere all day after 11am). Huge selection, something for all tastes.

Despite being in the middle of town the rooms are nice and quiet. Price is good, I've always found the hotel website to be cheapest as they price match.",U Paasha Seminyak
1584,Great Location,40,January 2017,"What a great hotel. It is right in the heart of Seminyak across the road from Ultimos.
Big rooms with great facilities. Roof top pool and bar. Good breakfast selection and they collected and dropped us back to the airport all inclusive. And the best of all is the 24 hour check out policy. Would have to be the only one we have come across on our trips to Bali. Very friendly helpful staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
1585,Wonderful stay!,40,January 2017,If your looking for a luxurious place to stay in the heart of Seminyak stay here!! It's in a fantastic location with many of seminyak famous restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are extremely spacious and the beds are really comfortable. Breakfast has a huge selection and the staff are accommodating for vegetarians. They can make any dish for you without meat and/or egg.,U Paasha Seminyak
1586,Great Holiday Great Hotel With The Best Check Out Time Policy!,40,January 2017,Spent close to a week here. Very convenient location that saves a lot on taxi fare. From shopping to dining can't really go wrong in this great location in Seminyak. A fairly new hotel with a very nice room. Breakfast which was included in the rates is the usual fare one would expect at this price but with the freshly pressed cappuccino or latte together with the eggs and pancake action station thrown in the family was well pleased. The Pool on the rooftop has a very nice view of Seminyak. Its size was adequate as we never felt overcrowded even though the hotel was fully booked. A very shallow area at the edge of the pool acted as the kids pool and our 4 year old daughter was more then happy there. One thing that did pose problem to us was the hot water. it seems as though there is only tankful of it at any one time and if your other half used up too much of it earlier then you better be quick with your shower time. if not we noticed it takes a bit of time for it to get warmed up again! But then again we were on a relaxing holiday and the temperature wasn't that cold so it was manageable. another thing that we liked during our stay was the housekeeping services. it was one of the better ones as they took the time to properly clean the toilets make up the beds and vacuum the room. sounds simple enough but how many times have we stayed in hotels that falls short of this basic standards. And the best feature of this hotel that we really appreciate was the time for checking in and checking out of our rooms. The hotel policy is to check you in at the time you arrive and the check out time is dependant upon the earlier check in time so as to give you a full 24 hour experience at the hotel. How thoughtful is that? it certainly made our holiday so much more pleasant as our flight in was at 8 pm and our flight back was at a smilier time. We were allowed to check out by 8pm on our departure day. In a way it gave us another full day to explore Bali. Thanks U Pasha! That should be the industry standard!,U Paasha Seminyak
1587,Very well priced. Excellent location,50,March 2016,Great hotel. Very big rooms. Very well located. Nice area . Management are very friendly. Worth a visit. room service is very well priced. Great breakfast in the morning. Fresh water prawns at their restaurant is a must try. Took me to my childhood.,U Paasha Seminyak
1588,"Great hotel, Great price, Great location",50,January 2017,"This is the second time we have stayed at U Paasha and have loved it both times.
We came with two boys aged 10 and 15 and so had interconnecting rooms which were perfect. Hotel decor is modern and rooms are very large and spacious.

Food is excellent - can not fault breakfast in lobby area and several lunches and BBQ dinners we had at the rooftop pool bar. Staff are very attentive and amazingly quick to clear away plates at buffet.

Pool is good - not massive but big enough and the breeze on rooftop is welcome! Comfortable loungers, plenty of umbrellas and a great view across town.

The location is awesome right on Eat St in Seminyak - so many restaurants and shops so you dont feel trapped in hotel like at some resorts.

After U Paasha we went to a 5 star resort for 3 nights to end our trip but to be honest U Paasha was better and we wished we had stayed there and it was half the price!",U Paasha Seminyak
1589,Great View,30,January 2017,"This hotel very good rooftop view.
Big rooms but trouble with hot water,but this is not big problem.food is not too much variant but still ok.over all we enjoyed our holiday.it was strategic place,you can find many restaurant around the hotel,also close to the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
1590,U good.. real goooood,40,January 2017,"Spent a week @ U Paasha Seminyak fronting Jalan Ayu Kya or ""eats street"". If you want to be central to the Seminyak scene, close to shopping and restaurants this hotel offers location, value, comfortable rooms and wonderful staff. The suites ~ 50sqm are relatively large. We booked two interconnecting rooms providing more than enough space. Breakfast is good. Rooftop pool isn't large but worthy of relaxing around. The rooftop view is also useful. U Paasha was excellent value and combined with location I can't fault. Happy to recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1591,Luxury at its best,50,July 2016,"My partner and I stayed at U Paasha for 8 nights in total, after a very reliable recommendation.

Check in was a breeze, with friendly staff greeting you with a smile. Only downfall is reception area is open plan, so no air cons and was a bit stuffy after flight.
We were taken to our room, which was exactly like the photos, and the large bed didn't disappoint. Had issues with our sliding door shutting, which let all the heat in, but staff rectified issue immediately.
Wifi throughout the hotel was amazing, even at the pool. We did have to ask for our room to be made up one day, but the rest was fine. As we checked out and checked in we did get multiple rooms, which didn't have any nice view but didn't matter as we didn't spend much time in room. We found it was a little expensive to stay here, but definitely met all expectations.

The roof top pool was amazing, but little seating offered which meant you couldn't always swim and relax. They always offered fresh towels which was great.
Drinks and food were a little expensive by the pool though!

Breakfast was great, with lots of different options, but again no air con so be sure to sit near the fan. Staff always greet with a smile, and ask if you'd like coffee with your breakfast.

When crossing the road staff will always stop traffic for you, which was great for those busy times. Whenever you arrive or depart in a taxi, staff will always open the doors and check you haven't left anything behind.
That being said, I have to commend the staff on being so friendly the whole time, everyone spoke to you, asked how your day was and always made sure your stay was up to standard.

There was lots of great restaurants right at the door step, which were pretty reasonably priced. I'd definitely recommend Cafe Bali( right across the road) Motel Mexicola, Ultimo and even Nirvana( right next door) Lots of massage places to choose from, however I preferred Kimberley Spa which was just up the road.

Great hotel, would definitely return.",U Paasha Seminyak
1592,Amazing Value for money,50,July 2016,Rooms were huge and incredibly comfortable. The service was amazing and ever so helpful. The roof top pool shows off and incredible view while the location of the hotel itself is right in the mix of things. Can not wait to go stay here again on our next trip to Bali,U Paasha Seminyak
1593,"Amazing value, great location",50,January 2017,"Good size room, we got a extra bed in the room for our 8 year old and still had plenty of space. Right in the middle of Seminyak close to shops/restaurants etc provided excellent location. Very friendly and helpful staff. Roof top pool and gym are both worth a visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1594,Best Ever !,50,December 2016,"U Paasha has it covered ! Rooms are amazing .... huge and very practical ... beds are comfortable, shower is huge and theres heaps of space in the vanity area...rooms are well serviced each day, hotel rooms have lots of space between them so they were nice and quiet ....amenities are great quality... staff are wonderful, breakfast was really good.... perfect coffee too, food quality was great ! WIFI ..... great...
Pool area provides sun beds with shade ...I loved the location ! so convenient to everything....and checkout time depends on when you checkin ... great for late departures to the airport......will definitely return to U Paasha !!
Thanks to all the staff for providing a great hotel !",U Paasha Seminyak
1595,Nice rooms and services,50,January 2017,"We appreciate a lots for the 24 hours check out policy, which make our plan much more easier to go. The room is very nice, and also environmentally friendly services. Breakfast buffet is yummy; even if you miss the buffet time, you can alwats order from room service. But no shuttle provided to travel around. Highly recommended hotel in semiyak!",U Paasha Seminyak
1596,"Convenient, lovely ambience, good facilities",50,January 2017,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for 4 nights in January. We both loved our stay here!

1. Very convenient- amazing cafes, shopping and Seminyak square only minutes away
2. Loved the minimalistic & modern decor. Our room was spacious and clean
3. Facilities- Used the gym nearly every morning, never crowded and had a lovely view. Rooftop pool was a winner, did not want to leave it.
4. Buffet breakfast had a wonderful selection of food which was good quality
5. Staff were friendly and attentive at all times

Only thing I could say is that the decking near the rooftop pool needs a redo. Areas of the decking are starting to lift and could potentially be dangerous.

Absolutely loved my stay here and I would recommend this to friends! Wonderful 4 star hotel with lovely people. Thank you ❤️",U Paasha Seminyak
1597,Disappointing,20,January 2017,"We were looking forward to staying at U Passha as it came recommended by a friend who enjoyed their stay at U Paasha but we were plagued with problems from the start:
1. The bathroom was filthy with mould on the walls and floor - we had to get the cleaners in to wash it down.
2. There were bugs in our bed that bit us through the night that resulted in red spots for a few days.
3. The staff promised us a new room the next day but on 5 seperate occasions they advised us to come back after a second night in the same room and ask again.
4. When we got to our new room there was a muddy foot print on the toilet seat.
5. When we confirmed check out for 4.00pm, we received a letter later that day advising our check out was 12.00pm.

If it wasn't for the location and great breakfast it would have been 1 star.",U Paasha Seminyak
1598,"Clean, spacious, fantastic staff.",50,January 2017,"Stayed here from 2nd Jan 17 - 4th Jan 17.
Room was nice, king bed, good A/C, high ceilings, ensuite bathroom clean and I like the toilet and shower being separated.
Staff were nice, service very fast. Plenty of shade options by the nice long rooftop pool as all sets of lounge beds had a working umbrella. Buffet breakfast was good, plenty of choice and fast service. Gym is ok, plenty of free weights, a few treadmills & bike machines, the weight machines not so good.
Location is excellent - walk straight onto the main street, plenty of restaurants and shops.
Staff were fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. They gladly extended by checkout time free of charge and bubble wrapped a painting for me. I will definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1599,U Paasha Seminyak is Top class,50,December 2016,"Stayed at U Paasha for 5 nights in December 2016. Highly recommended! The breakfast is great, rooms massive and service excellent. Best thing of U Paasha is definitely its location. I would go back any day.",U Paasha Seminyak
1600,"Cool place, lots of reasons to stay here 👍🏻🙏🦄",30,January 2017,"We stayed for 4 nights and stayed in two interconnecting rooms. The rooms are huge and well equiped although there are signs of wear and tear and the bathrooms need a refit and modernisation (see photos).
The location is five star, close to all the restaurants and a 10 minute walk to the beach (which is grey sand and littered like you would not believe, disgusting).
Rooftop pool is superb with free sunscreen, great views. Food and beverage service staff on hand.
The breakfast is good with a chef ready to cook eggs, waffles and pancakes. Ready selection for all nationalities and super juices.
The service from check in to check out is excellent with well trained English speaking staff.
The only downside is the cleanliness/ upkeep of the room as the bathrooms are old and tired with mould on the floors and fittings poorly repaired and doors almost falling off. The tiles on the bedroom wall are poorly fitted and not at all stylish.
In summary, this is a well located hotel, good price, nice staff and facilities. With some investment in the bathrooms to bring this back to a modern level, it would get a 5 star rating from me.

1601,"Reasonably priced, perfect location in Seminyak",40,November 2016,"This is my go-to hotel in Seminyak especially if I'm on a short trip and travelling alone. Restaurants and cafes are all within walking distance and my favourite, Spring Spa at Seminyak Village is just a 5 minute walk away.

Another plus, is its 24 hour check-in/check-out policy which lets you check out 24 hours after your check in time instead of the fixed 12 noon check out.

The hotel is getting a bit old and could do with some sprucing up, breakfast quality could also be improved, but for its price and location, it's still one of my favorite places to stay in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1602,We will be back,50,December 2016,"We stayed five nights and U Pasha and loved it.

- The location is in the heart of Seminyak on the Main Street with restaurants, shops, pharmacists, spas, Seminyak village, etc all at your door step.

- While the hustle and bustle of Seminyak is outside the front entrance the rooms are very quiet and private.

- The room itself is massive, the bed very comfortable, it's very clean and well furnished. The decor is lovely as well.

- the air conditioning and wifi are both first class.

- The breakfast buffet is AMAZING, great way to start the day. The selection is broad and varied, and fresh every day. The waffles are especially good.

- The rooftop pool is really something. The pool is huge, there's fresh towels, it's clean and deep.

Finally, the staff and people at U Pasha are beautiful. They are so kind and made us feel welcome and safe the whole time we were there.

We will definitely be back to Seminyak and we will most definitely stay at U Pasha again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1603,Exceeded my expectations,50,December 2016,"First of all, this place is gorgeous. My room was massive, with double sinks and a walk-in shower. The lobby is lovely, and you can't beat the rooftop pool.

But the staff are the best. Always so friendly, always ready to help. The food was quite good too. Especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which has made-to-order options and enough different types of food to suit every taste.

The location is excellent as well, with tons of delicious places to eat and drink a stone's throw away -- I loved Chandi for dinner, Revolver for coffee and Bossman for amazing burgers.

I'm already planning a return trip to Bali and will be staying at U Paasha again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1604,Another Great Stay At The U Paasha,40,December 2016,"This was my second stay at U Paasha. Everything about it is on the mark for this category of a hotel. Service, location, and rooms are ideal. The staff is quite kind and always willing to help out. They pay attention to detail and offer high standard service. Devi, who is part of the management team does a fantastic job and is a great asset to this property. It's an employee like her that makes all the difference. The hotel has an amazing roof top pool and always has enough loungers available. Location is walkable to the beach, shopping, night-life, and endless amount of good restaurants. As a result, will gladly stay at the U Paasha again and again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1605,Best Rooftop Pool in Bali,50,March 2016,"Amazing venue with the best rooftop pool in Bali! Beautiful staff, clean rooms and just all round great hotel. Another good thing about U Paasha is the location - smack bang in the middle of eat street it simply doesn't get any better.",U Paasha Seminyak
1606,Great staff make the hotel,40,December 2016,"Great location together with awesome staff led by Devi at front of office.
Have to mention Gede, anyone who's met him knows what I mean, a truly genuine guy who's probably the face of the hotel. Huge rooms perhaps needing a little fine tuning with close up cleaning and maintenance. Rooftop pool is a winner!
Staff treat you like family almost.
My original stay was 4 nights and I ended up extending twice and staying 13 nights. Right Devi? 😊
Would definitely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1607,Great stay! We will be back,40,December 2016,"Best parts – great location (5 min walk to Seminyak beach and all of the cool beach bars etc), lots of outside restaurant choices for lunch dinner, included breakfast is great and lots of choices to cater for everyone. Rooftop pool is awesome and there were always available sun lounges. Rooms are huge – big perk - We didn’t feel like we were on holiday, it almost felt like home!! Our room was serviced every day and we were left with new toiletries and water each time. Great aircon. The service was OK, it depends on who you speak to on the day.

Not so great parts – shower and toilet could do with a big scrub and clean (the screens and walls looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in months!). Room service menu is limited and the food is not great at all. Hot water taps are REALLY HOT!! Be careful.

Tips – request a room on level 5. We got a room on level 1 where the aircons are installed on the balcony and it was very noisy.",U Paasha Seminyak
1608,Good stay.,40,December 2016,"Second time in U Paasha within six months.
It is such a lovely hotel that when we planned our trip,we knew where our accomodation will be.
Rooms are spacious and breakfast is still amazing!
I personally love their ""green slim"" juice and their waffles!

But after having spent our stay here,i came to conclude that U paasha posted all their best staffs to assist during the breakfast and also housekeeping. They are always with great smiles and so hospitable despite the morning breakfast mayhem.

However,their front staff lacks the hospitality that the rest of the departments posses.Thus im really glad i only have to interact with them during check in and check outs.

Other than that,great stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1609,U Paasha,30,December 2016,"I stayed at U Paasha for 3 nights recently on a solo trip to Bali. As far as location goes, this hotel is PERFECT- right in the middle of everywhere you need to be and everything you need to see in Seminyak. If you're in Seminyak to shop, eat or drink, definitely consider U Paasha.
The rooms are enormous and well positioned.
The breakfast was a great inclusion. The rooftop pool was fun. And given the location, it was really nice and quiet to get a relaxed sleep at night.
In saying that, I felt that U Paasha was a little bit like staying on an episode of ""The Block""- the rooms looked amazing with all the mod cons, but if you look too close you'll notice all the imperfections- my shower had mould all through it, the toilet glass door was coming off the wall, the balcony doors didn't fit together perfectly so when it rained and was a little windy they rattled and the fabric behead was filthy- I don't even want to think what was on there. And that was just the obvious things. Working in the travel industry I was so disappointed that a hotel in such a great location that seems to be quiet popular, put so little into maintaining their rooms. This place could be amazing- unfortunately it wasn't .",U Paasha Seminyak
1610,U paasha,40,August 2016,"i stayed at u paasha back in august for a week. It was my first time to bali, and whilst i was taken aback at how busy seminyak was - u paasha was like a sanctuary. The hotel looks quote small was in fact actually quite big. Despite being on 'eat' street the noise of seminyak was invisible from the hotel room and rooftop bar.
Breakfast is excellent, there is a huge choice of traditional western and eastern food. Pancakes and eggs are made to order, and specialist coffees are all included too. The service is also excellent.
The rooms are huge, and whilst our room had no view at all - that didnt detract fron the pleasantness of our stay. The bed was comfortable and allnareas were clean. The in room fridge was helpful too, along with the complimentary bottled water. The rooftop pool is heaven - you dont have to be there super early to get a bed but they do start filling up around 11 ish so probably worth keeping that in mind. The pool service is great and happy happy hour for cocktails is good value too. We also attended one of the hotels bbq nights i'm always slightly dubious about these sorts of events but i have to say the food was amazing! Its far too easy to overindulge!
All in all this is a great, raxing place to explore bali from! Would definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1611,Great stay,40,December 2016,"Loved this hotel, great rooms, clean and in the heart of Seminyak with great restaurants and shops at your doorstep
The rooftop pool was great and the staff were fabulous. Recommend it for families young and old",U Paasha Seminyak
1612,"Uncomplicated, high service, high quality",50,December 2016,"The Upaasha hotel is one of those gems within the wide range of hotels in Seminyak.
The staff is genuine friendly and their service level is outstanding.
The rooms are spacious and well designed with a perfect rooftop pool and bar.
What makes the hotel even more special is the All day breakfast arrangement.
Late night in the club, take your breakfast at 13:00 anywhere you want in the hotel....",U Paasha Seminyak
1613,Disappointing,20,October 2016,"The noise from an exhaust fan outside our room was so bad that we asked to move rooms (if they hadn't been able to move us we'd have left it had kept us awake for some time), when we spoke to reception regarding it they had clearly heard this complaint before. On the 5th floor it was much quieter and bearable.

The cleanliness of rooms was questionable and we didn't even get given hand towels after moving rooms. They don't even provide conditioner with the toiletries which for $200 AUD a night is poor.

Pool is in a good location but there aren't enough umbrellas round the pool given the number of people using the pool.

Breakfast was quite good and they provided a good gluten free breakfast for my girlfriend.

Location of hotel is good if you want to be in heart of Seminyak but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and won't be going back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1614,Awesome location,50,December 2016,"We loved our stay here. The staff were great, it's in a perfect location, right in the heart of seminyak, walking distance to all the good spots. The rooftop pool is the main draw, it's gorgeous and so peaceful up there, you can't hear any of the hustle and bustle from below.",U Paasha Seminyak
1615,Loved this hotel!,50,November 2016,"Had a great stay here! Best location for us as our favourite restaurants are on this street. Room was exactly how it looked in pictures. Very spacious room. Newish hotel that has been well looked, everything looks new & nice. Housekeeping was fantastic. Came back to the room everyday, and it looked like we just checked in. Always spotless, the floors were sparkling everyday. Reception staff were always very helpful and friendly. Nice breakfast spread every morning.",U Paasha Seminyak
1616,Week stay with my sister,40,December 2016,"We had a very good stay at this hotel. The location is in the middle of Seminyak. We were on the second floor and did not hear anything from the huddle and bussle outside. The room was super spacious. Friendly staff and a good breakfast buffet with fresh juices, our favorite was the green juice! The concierge can organize custom made tours.

Definitely a good choice if you'd like to rewind and enjoy Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1617,Very central hotel,30,November 2016,"Stayed for one night. We arrived in the early hours. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and check in was efficient. It was good that breakfast went on until 11am and a 24 hour room stay is a good idea. There was not a lot of choice at breakfast.

The room was large with everything we needed for our stay. The room did have a damp smell and was in need of a little freshening up. We were woken up by quite a bit of noise from outside but I suppose this is because the hotel is very central.",U Paasha Seminyak
1618,Upaasha has it all!,50,November 2016,"Great location with all Seminyaks bars and restaurants within walking distance, and awesome rooftop pool with happy hour cocktails and great value for money. Service was terrific and were always happy to help out with anything we wanted, will be back for sure😍",U Paasha Seminyak
1619,good hotel. bit expensive,40,October 2016,"very central seminyak. good if u like shopping and restaurant. I have stayed there for a long stay. good staff. breakfast is good. roof top pool is great. rooms are clean, spacious. Only big problem, noise inside (corridor very noisy at 5th floor) and outside (next door is a resort with villa and pools, and you have to wait for them to sleep to able to sleep you turn).",U Paasha Seminyak
1620,Great location!,40,November 2016,"Located literally in the heart of seminyak it is of walkable distance to several cafes! Ultimo was just across the road, sister fields was just 10 min walk and the ice cream factory as well.
Hotel has a modern feel including the rooms. Space was huge in the room.
However the breakfast was average. There wasn't a wide variety and the bacon was overly cooked. Maybe also as they are a boutique hotel hence the variety for food was lesser.
Interesting though they had cold press juices. Tasted not bad.
Overall if you are looking to stay in the heart of seminyak here's definitely the place even the pricing was reasonable!",U Paasha Seminyak
1621,Great Location,50,November 2016,"Great location easy to access walking distance to so many beautiful restaurants and close to some great bars that you can listen to live music or just relax, have a drink and people watch. The breakfasts are well catered for in a relaxed setting. And so nice at the rooftop pool and bar.",U Paasha Seminyak
1622,Great location & value,40,November 2016,The U Paasha is definitely great value and close to everything you need. The rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. The bathroom while large could do with an upgrade. Other than that no complaints. Rooftop pool nice and included breakfast very good. If you are after a 3-4 star in the thick of things then the U Paasha is it!!,U Paasha Seminyak
1623,Ideal,50,November 2016,A great oasis in a perfect location! Rooftop bar and pool area is stunning. Rooms are very big and comfortable. Definitely staying here again 👌🏽 So close to everything we needed. Staff were amazing. The check in/out process was so easy.,U Paasha Seminyak
1624,Great stay at UPaasha!,40,November 2016,"UPaasha is absolutely beautiful - the design and decor really is breathtaking.

We thought the location was fantastic - on the same road as lots of restaurants, bars and shops. Taxis are very reasonable if you don't fancy walking further afield to the beach bars.

The room itself was huge as well as the bed! Really comfortable as well!

The view from the window wasn't great and the bathroom was showing signs of wear and tear but that didn't bother us.

One of the best things about the hotel was the fact you could have breakfast up until 10am in the restaurant, or 24hours a day in you room - there's lots of choice and you get loads of food!

The rooftop pool is great - we never had trouble getting a sunbed.

The only thing we didn't really rate was the food at the pool bar - I didn't enjoy the two meals I had and it was quite expensive.

Overall we had a great stay here!",U Paasha Seminyak
1625,Great location with friendly staff,40,September 2016,"Love staying here as it is close to everything. Food was wonderful, service was excellent and the staff were very helpful. My only complaints would be the lack of umbrella's by the pool, the fact I asked for a room with a view on the 5th floor and did not get one and the deposit I paid for incidentals for food etc in September has still not been refunded. After several emails back and forth I have been told it is in the hands of the accounts department. Find it hard to believe it takes over 2 months to do this.",U Paasha Seminyak
1626,Great ambience but bad service/maintenance,20,November 2016,"I was stay at room #112 with my friends. When i arrived i loved this hotel since they have big room with lovely interior.
It was raining in the afternoon then I borrow 2 umbrellas from the reception. After 30 minutes used the umbrella I just realize that the umbrella was broken, can't be closed. I keep going on but unfortunately I have to take a taxi and the umbrella can't be close! Horrible. Then I left it since there's a long queuing. I explain to the reception that the umbrella was in bad condition and can't be closed but the reception still charged for the umbrella and said they still charge me since I left it. Even the girl in reception said that some of their umbrella in bad condition. I think you guys need to check your equipment properly before you handed to your guest.",U Paasha Seminyak
1627,Perfect,50,November 2016,WOW what a location and hotel. Everything was perfect and nothing was too much trouble. Devi the manager is sensational and always smiling joking and happy to assist in anything to make the stay more enjoyable and ALL staff are friendly. I would definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the heart beat of Bali.,U Paasha Seminyak
1628,Great location clean hotel,50,November 2016,"Stayed here for a weekend trip away with a friend. Great location. Glad we upgraded so we were on the top floor - so didn't get any noise. Free transfers were great too. The pool was nice but I can imagine if the hotel was full, there might not be enough sunbeds.",U Paasha Seminyak
1629,Pretty cool hotel,40,October 2016,"The location was perfect for us as it was only a short walk to beach clubs, and numerous shops and restaurants and bars were right on our doorstep. The staff were friendly and we're happy to help us book when we decided to go white water rafting, calling around to find us find the best deal. The buffet breakfast was awesome and had lots of healthy options as well as green smoothies. They also provided take-away boxes when we left to go rafting so that we could eat breakfast during the drive out to the river. Rooftop bar and pool were nice, and food & drinks were tasty - the cold rolls and espresso martinis were especially good. Overall a great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
1630,"Great location, great hotel",50,November 2016,"We stayed here 9 nights, it was fantastic. Rooms are quiet spacious, massive bed that is comfy. Soft pillows which I enjoyed. Buffet breakfast has a wide range to choose from. Great rooftop pool and bar and the best thing that shocked me is that you check out the same time you check in so for us that was 4pm. Having a late night flight it worked fantastic. The location also is amazing. Massage parlour right across the road. Many amazing resturaunts within walking distance.",U Paasha Seminyak
1631,Exciting and lovely hotel,50,November 2016,"Lovely interior and the room quite fascinating. The values for this hotel is awesome. Worth it every penny. Probably one of the best hotel i ever visited.

The breakfast is the combination between asian cuisine and western cuisine.

The room is spacious also, and the best thing is whether you check in late, let's say 10pm, and you can check out 10pm in the next day.",U Paasha Seminyak
1632,Location Location Location!,40,November 2016,"U Paasha is in a perfect location on Eat St in Seminyak. Everything you could want is within short walking distance - world class restaurants, cafe's, bars, spas, gorgeous boutiques, mini marts and money changers.
The hotel staff were lovely and very accommodating. Rooms were huge and well maintained, although our room did have an intermittent sewage smell at times.
The bed was so comfortable I woke up one night and thought I was at home!
The pool area is on the rooftop and there are always staff around to take your food and beverage orders. The only negatives for me was that there is limited shade in the pool area which can get quite hot, and the pool itself was too shallow for my liking.
We loved the ""breakfast anywhere anytime"" concept. It was nice to have a leisurely sleep-in and then have breakfast by the pool for lunch :)
It was also very easy to arrange a complimentary late check out on the day we left.",U Paasha Seminyak
1633,we love the location,40,October 2016,"Yes, indeed, u paasha is strategically located in eat street. walking distance to the famous cafes in kayu aya. the room is spacious, breakfast is nice. even though you can find lot of very good cafe for breakfast near the hotel. great option to enjoy the hype of kayu aya.",U Paasha Seminyak
1634,Right in the middle of the Jungle,40,November 2016,"Nice room on the 5th floor - bit more expensive than others, but there are free cocktails available each day and there is a view as promised. Couldn't fault anything. Breakfast was perfectly reasonable and the place has a nice decor.",U Paasha Seminyak
1635,Location,40,November 2016,"We got there at 1.30am and chose this because of 24hr room stay, we stayed 2 nights. Liked the foyer very interesting. The room was spacious, the twin beds were comfy. Breakfast had a good variety. Located right in the middle of eat st. Liked the roof top pool.
Way overpriced at $155/night. Would stay again if rates were cheaper",U Paasha Seminyak
1636,U ... middle of most happening area !!,50,October 2016,"I along with my nephew visited U Pasha, Bali from 27th Oct to 1st Nov for a small break, and trust me it was one of the finest short break we could have !!
The U resort is in the middle of most happening area in Seminyak and as usual U is the place where you feel at home with wonderful ambience, comfort & friendly staff.
GM - Mr. Gindo was just outstanding and was always taking personal interest in looking after our comfort not only in the resort but also for helping us daily to plan our daily site seeing & advising us to go to best of places, temples, pubs & clubs in Bali. His other staff was equally helpful, special thanks to Mr. Gusti, Ms. Tia and our friendly driver - Mr. Guun.....
rooms are really big with attached balcony, roof top with infinite pool & restaurant is a great place to relax !!
Thanks & wish U all a very best !!",U Paasha Seminyak
1637,Lovely hotel in the middle of shoppers paradise,40,October 2016,"Recently spent 2 night at U Pasha and thoroughly enjoyed it. Rooms were large and airy. Only small balcony that you couldn't even sit on, but otherwise all good.
Great pool area on the roof, with plenty of sun loungers and bar. Staff were great and breakfast was amazing. Thumbs up",U Paasha Seminyak
1638,Great place to unwind,40,October 2016,"In a last minute decision to take a quick weekend trip over to Bali , I could not think of s better place to go to relax. Everything about this hotel was relaxing...Very friendly and helpful staff, roof top pool and bar and in room massages available. Would highly recommend !!",U Paasha Seminyak
1639,Great location,30,November 2016,Location was right in the heart of Seminyak. Service and breakfast was great. But the room was a little rundown. Bathroom was a bit moldy and the fabric of the bed head gave out a slight smell. Would be so much better if they could upkeep the maintenance.,U Paasha Seminyak
1640,Average hotel but overpriced,20,November 2016,"Arrived at U paasha and check in was a breeze. Room was ready on arrival and staff were very accommodating. Breakfast is amazing and the staff are very friendly.

The room was unfortunate disappointing, there were stains on the upholstery, stains on the bathroom floor, chips in the wooden furniture and the curtains were mouldy.
I advised reception and was offered another room. The room wasn't ready until later that night so had use for the original room for the day. The new room also had stains on the bathroom floor, stains on the upholstery and mouldy curtains. There was also a strange smell and the air con rattled.
I advised Agoda who made arrangements for reception to contact me and I was offered to have the smell checked and the air con fixed. I refused and asked for an upgrade. Fortunately this was granted and was offered a much better room.
The U paasha is tired and overpriced. Whilst the location is good and the service is good, there are between prices places not far.
This was the second time I've stayed at U paasha but will not return until the rooms are refurbished.",U Paasha Seminyak
1641,Great position,40,October 2016,"Just had an overnight stay here. Beautiful fresh large room in central position. Breakfast included standard of Bali buffet, nothing special.

Roof top pool/bar looks fun but too stifling hot all that concrete & minimal lush plants or umbrellas.

Fabulous place for last minute shop, close walk or taxi to the best restuarants.

Wouldnt like to stay here more than 1 or 2 nights.",U Paasha Seminyak
1642,Lovely hotel with roof top pool,50,September 2016,"The hotel is in a good location, short walks to restaurants, beach & markets. Room was clean & very roomy. The roof top pool views are fabulous. The pool was lovely, clean & the water a nice temperature. It would be good to have some more umbrellas up there for shade. Breakfasts were very nice & staff made us cappucinos, lattes which was great. Staff were friendly & helpful. After check out we were getting into a van to leave & the security guard out the front got a call that I had left a dress in room so that was great they let us know before we had left. Highly recommended place to stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1643,Plesant stay in the heart of Eat St!,50,September 2016,"This hotel is modern and spacious. The house staff were super friendly and helpful. The room we had, no word of a lie was about the same size of the house we live in in NZ! The room was massive! The rooms were clean but I did note the waterproofing issues in the shower, this is only due to how the hotel was constructed. The roof top pool and bar was amazing and relatively cheap. What I loved the most was that you would walk off the busy street and all of a sudden felt secluded, which is nice feeling after spending the entire day in the hustle and bustle of Bali. It is also very conveniently located with a authorised money changer in the mini mart across the street. Very good rates too! I would definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1644,Great location and AMAZING breakfast!,40,October 2016,"U-passha is on one of the main streets in Seminyak with many places to eat and get drinks a close walk away.
The beach is about a 10/15min walk and it is wonderful to watch people surfing and stroll along the long sandy beach.
The bed and pillows were comfortable, large bathroom and the staff was very friendly. The included breakfast is amazing (lovely made to order cappuccinos, iced coffee, latte) with a huge selection of Indonesia and ""western"" food.
Front desk was attentive and efficient while calling us a taxi. FYI- blue bird taxi is the best (we found it the most affordable and least scary as many drivers in Bali are terrifying).
The only cons of this hotel are the small pool which is only open until 8pm and the wifi was poor in the rooms (but ok in the lobby)",U Paasha Seminyak
1645,Nice hotel,40,October 2016,"Nice little hotel with a really great roof top pool.

The cocktail are good.. pool snacks are tasty, but the food for bfast and the BBQ on the rooftop just seem like missed opportunities.

I have stayed at this hotel 5 times and still really like it.

Gede and the other pool waiting staff are a credit to the U brand.",U Paasha Seminyak
1646,Great pool,40,October 2016,"Upaasha has a great pool on the roof and is one of the best locations on the strip.

I love this place because there are no kids to be seen anywhere!

Gede, the pool boy is awesome and really looked after us well.",U Paasha Seminyak
1647,Would Never come back or recommend to anyone,10,October 2016,"This is probably the only frustrating experiences we had throughout our Bali. We pre booked this hotel as was purely because it was recommended by one of our friends and we did not even do any researches just booked it. Upon our arrival, we realized the lobby was a open-to-public one and does not have air-con, which was bit weird for weather like Bali. The check-in process was great as I believe we were served by the reception manager. Shortly After we settled in our room, hubby found we could not even lock our front door, which was the first time I've experienced among all our trips. Could not understand how did the management team check the room before serving customers. Then after our dinner back from Seminyak, hubby found another ""surprise"", which is a cockroach on the floor and it is really made us both feel really uncomfortable !! And then my hubby woke up at 3am in the mid night as the terrible noise caused by the room air-con and he went downstairs to the lobby trying to find a solution and the answer from the night-shift staff was ""Sorry, nothing can be done and we will have to wait until next morning to see if they can help us change room"". So it left my husband the whole night unable to sleep. We were so frustrated of all we've experienced from the beginning we checked in and The next morning we decided to check out and find another better hotel. When we were trying to check out and was advised that they had to charge one more night as Cancellation fee ($180 roughly) simply because we were booked via a hotel-booking website not directly through them. Ridiculous!!!! We paid and left as we didn't want to stay any longer with this hotel , which was hopeless from head to toe!!! And one more thing, if you want to enjoy the rooftop pool at about 7pm for abut of relaxation, sorry, the answer is no as NO beach towel is offered and no staff is there on duty. Didn't trying to be negative but just want to let all the travelers know you have to take the risks of choosing this hotel if you choose to!! Blacklisted and Never Gonna recommend this hotel to anyone!! !!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1648,Awesome location,40,October 2016,"Amazing experience, enjoyed the stay. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Love the spacious bedroom.

But housekeepers didn't keep the teaspoons clean enough, not ready to use

Other than that it was great. Location was superb for those who enjoy to shop and dine..... just walking distance to popular restaurants in Seminyak",U Paasha Seminyak
1649,Great location and pool,50,September 2016,"This is the second time i have stayed here, and i would stay again. The rooms are big and modern and the staff and lovely. The highlight is the rooftop pool! It has 24hour checkout which is good if you have a late flight.
The hotel is close to lots of cafes and shops.",U Paasha Seminyak
1650,Amazing pool,50,September 2016,This is the second time my partner and I have stayed at this hotel. Its modern and close to cafes and shops. The staff are lovely and they have a rooftop pool that is amazing. Its great for couples or friends.,U Paasha Seminyak
1651,Great location and view,50,September 2016,Stayed here for only one night and wish it was more. Hotel is great and the location spectacular. The view from the pool is amazing and great sunset view. Do yourself a favor and stay in the floor with the happy hour included. They do not skimp on the drinks and it's great to sip cocktails while watching the sunset from the pool!! Breakfast was also very good,U Paasha Seminyak
1652,Good location,40,October 2016,"The price of this hotel is more for its location and 24 hour check in service which is great for those who can time their check ins for late flights. The rooms were very big. The only gripe would be the open toilet concept which was a bit unhygienic in my opinion. Also the glass doors were a bit stiff and wasn't sure how to open/close them. Only bath towels were available when we checked in. Maybe housekeeping was in a rush ? The next day the full set of towels were provided. Not the kind of service i was expecting for this class of hotel. Only the plus side: extensive breakfast selection (go for the signature green juice) , nice rooftop pool where we had our welcome drinks served during sunset, free bicycles for guests ( 5 in total), a selection of handmade soaps & great location in the midst of shops and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1653,Love it,40,September 2016,"Fantastic location , beautiful rooftop pool
Excellent staff
Super comfy bed and pillows
Only criticism the shower and toilet area needs some renovating they are a bit tired .Fantastic breakfast
overall just loved our stay and will most definitely be returning ❤️",U Paasha Seminyak
1654,Average,30,October 2016,"Convenient location but that's about it. Overpriced for what it is. We felt the need to get out and about every day, to leave the room! Bathroom average. Rooftop pool looked cloudy not clear. Housekeeping was cursory at best. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star hotel",U Paasha Seminyak
1655,Great roof top pool,40,October 2016,"We spent 9 nights here. Although it's not by the beach (probably about a 15 walk through the great streets of Seminyak) you wouldn't be staying for the beach in Seminyak anyway - is more of a shopping and eating district. The good news is that this hotel is right in the thick of the action. Great restaurants bars and shops all within metres.

The staff were so friendly and attentive. They quickly got to learn my coffee order at breakfast, they offered upgrades, they took the time to talk when you needed but also when to leave you alone.

The rooms were big, clean and modern - like a boutique hotel - with brushed concrete floors, King bed and double sink bathroom - for such a cheap price.

The best feature however would be the roof top pool and bar (also gym). Looks out over all of Seminyak. Lots of lounges.

Will definitely be coming back here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1656,Very nice hotel,50,September 2016,Stayed here for 5 nights. The rooms are enourmas! Staff are very friendly and has a great roof top pool. No kids to be seen if thats the type of hoilday your are looking for. Highly recommend staying here.,U Paasha Seminyak
1657,Great,40,September 2016,"Really great hotel - ticks all the basics. Rooms are great and very large (as per usual in bali), clean and modern. Staff is very polite and attentive. Rooftop pool is pretty nice too.

Location wise, its pretty perfect, right in the hustle and bustle of seminyak",U Paasha Seminyak
1658,"Very well located, spacious rooms, nice rooftop pool",50,September 2016,"We stayed in this place for 3 nights. While it is located in the heart of Seminyak village, it is very calm. It is walking distance from the best restaurants and shops in the area and also from the beach.
Breakfast was delicious, varied, with local and international meals.
The rooms are very spacious, clean, offering new equipment.
The hotel has also a roof top pool and bar in case you want to switch from the beach.

That was money well spent.",U Paasha Seminyak
1659,Great hotel,50,September 2016,"We loved U Paasha- every room is the same design from floors one to four clean and modern with good air conditioning and large showers.

The BBQ on a Friday Night was delicious and fresh.

The pool gets pretty packed in peak season but we were there with friends so was fun to hang out together.

The breakfast buffet is pretty extensive too with eggs cooked to order and gluten free options available.

Would stay again the staff are all friendly and service is great",U Paasha Seminyak
1660,Luxury,50,September 2016,"We booked 3 nights here through Agoda. We had a toddler with us. Arrived just befoe midnight and had a prompt check in. We were placed on the third floor at th front corner of the buildng. This suite is massive, the bed is comfortable and lovely to wake up to the view of he street. You gt noise from the road and the lobby, but that never bothered us as you are staying in a prime position to the markets and restaurants. They have 4 choices of soaps which smell amazing! All the necessary bathroom items, water, tea and coffee. Breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from. Egg station, pancakes, waffle and crepe station and all the other norms of a buffet. The view from the rooftop is gorgeous an a nice place to sit back with a cold drink. Highly recommend this place for a few nights to explore Seminyak and all its great eateries. Also this is a 24 hour hotel so that means we don't have to check out till midnight on our last day.",U Paasha Seminyak
1661,Great stay,40,September 2016,"We have stayed at U Paasha before but was underwhelmed by the welcome and service. We thought we would give them another try.
The checkin was excellent. Fast and friendly.
Our room was as expected. Very large, extremely comfy king size bed, large flat screen tv, spacious walk in shower, open bathroom area. There is a slight musty smell but I have found that in a country that can have prolonged rainy seasons and also a very large walk in shower, it may be difficult to avoid excess moisture. The aircon worked well and kept the room cool. However the rooms are quite tired now and in need of a refurb in my opinion. The layout could be better designed as I feel there is a lot of wasted space for such a large room. Could do with more drawer and shelf space for clothing etc. I do feel there was enough hanging space in the wardrobe.
You have the option to choose to have your towels and bedding changed but found this was done automatically, daily for the towels and half way through our 5 day stay for the sheets.
We didn't use the rooftop bar area or eat dinner in the restaurant so no comments for that.
The roof top pool was excellent. Clean and tidy. Plenty of sun loungers and seating areas. Could do with more sun umbrellas as the people arriving later had to sit in direct sunshine.
Breakfast was buffet style with everything you could possibly want. From bacon to dim sum. Coffee available any way you like. Eggs also which ever way you want and freshly cooked. Breakfast is available anytime of day and wherever you want to eat it.
The hotel offers a spa service. Looking at all the literature it would appear to be an onsite spa. Not so as we found out. You have to book in advance and a young girl was sent to our room from a nearby place. Not sure where from and to what extent she was trained. No information was offered as to where they get the spa staff from. I had a 30 minute back and shoulder massage. The girl arrived and I had to lay on the bed which made it a little difficult especially with position of my head and neck. I was not asked if I had any ailments that could be affected by massage, nor was I asked if I had any allergies to the oils she was using. I won't be using that service again.
The Wifi was questionable. It works perfectly in the reception and nearby areas, even up by the pool. However not in our room. We complained a few times but was told there wasn't a problem. We were in the furthest room away from reception and feel it was too far from the modem/router. The people in the room next to us had the same problem. It was a case of stepping out into the corridor to get a good signal. We didn't let it spoil our stay though
Overall I would recommend this hotel and would re visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
1662,Excellent hotel,50,August 2016,"I loved this hotel. The location was excellent. The design of the hotel was cool and calm, yet with a Balinese feel. The rooftop bar and pool area was lovely - perfect to relax with a drink after a long flight.

My room was clean and comfortable. I was on the fifth floor with a balcony, and had a nice view over Seminyak to the beach. An oasis of calm from the bustling streets of Seminyak.

The service I experienced from all of the staff at reception, the rooftop bar, and for breakfast was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There was a really good selection of western and asian items for breakfast.

I would certainly stay here again and highle recommend U Paasha.

I",U Paasha Seminyak
1663,"Ok hotel, great service.",30,August 2016,"First room we were taken to was on ground floor and had food crumbs on the floor and sort of had a moldy smell.
The boyfriend went out and requested for an upgrade and was given a better room on the top floor.
Room itself is ok although I did not like how the bathroom didnt have a proper door so sound proof was out the window.
The breakfast was great with a wide variety of dishes and they had an egg station, and pancakes, crepe and waffle station.
The fresh juices were amazing. Must try the green juice. Although it doesnt look appealing it is the best.

The staff were always very helpful and tried to accommodate as much as possible.
Location is great as it is very central and close to seminyak square.
There is a money exchange right next door which was recommended by hotel staff. Rates were good. Just always be cautious when exchanging money and count it.

Rooftop pool is great as you can relax on the sunbeds and enjoy cocktails during happy hour and escape the humidity",U Paasha Seminyak
1664,Very nice hotel and service,50,September 2016,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and we liked it very much.

The service was excellent and the staff very nice, they were so nice that sometimes it made us feel uncomfortable (it's a good thing though).

The breakfast was included and the food was excellent, we had a large choice and everything was tasty.

The room was clean with air conditioner, the bed was so comfortable that it was hard to get up !!

The hotel has a rooftop pool and it has a really nice view.

The WIFI works fine, I didn't have any problem with it during my stay.

Moreover, the hotel is in the center of Seminyak, everything was close.

I strongly recommend this hotel in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1665,Huge space slam bang in the middle of Seminyak,40,September 2016,"This is a really well positioned boutique hotel on the main stretch of Seminyak. On arrival it has a great feel, staff were friendly and it had a cool vibe. I was on the first floor and I loved the art that lined the walls which was all for sale. The hotel room was one of the biggest I'd ever seen - the decor didn't wow me and the balcony doors opened on to some festy trees but space wise, I was very happy. The bathroom was also huge so plenty of space for everything and everyone. While I didn't use the pool, I did check it out and don't know that it looked that inviting. I sort of figured this hotel was great for a business visit or a few days if you are young and want to be in the thick of it all. It isn't really a family hotel. Breakfast was good and also worth a mention and I have to say, I loved the fact that there is no check out time which meant I could stay in my room till I left at 4.30pm and that for me who was there for work was fabulous.",U Paasha Seminyak
1666,Would return!,40,September 2016,"Arrived around 11pm and check in was so simple. The lovely gentleman on the desk could see how tired we were and sped things up and offered to call in food for us. Service here is fantastic. Any requests are completed with a smile. They made us feel like any request was possible

Rooms- massive space, best bed I've ever slept in and equipped with everything you need. Only niggle about the room were the showers. A cool idea but doesn't work. Floor was slimy and too big that you get cold!

Location- couldn't ask for any better. Fantastic!!!!! Every restaurant is amazing and the atmosphere buzzes every night!

Breakfast- extensive choice. All food in the hotel is high standard. We loved everything about it.

I would return here and would be happy staying 1 week. It's not 4 star Australian standard but you're in Bali!! It's a third world country!! Book here and you won't regret it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1667,Lots of Pros but areas to be improved!,30,September 2016,"U Paasha has the potential to be a really great hotel however there are a few things I felt let it down.

Starting with the positives: 24 hour check in, great location the main street in Seminyak close to a number of bars and restaurants and 15 mins walk to the beach, all the staff are very friendly and helpful as all balinese people are, the rooftop pool easily the best thing about the hotel - very relaxing and great views.

Negatives: The rooms - We paid for a room with a view which I don't think was worth the money, the view was looking at another hotel. The rooms are very spacious but in our opinion poorly designed. There is very little space to put your clothes, and the space isn't utilised well at all. The worst thing was the bathroom, it was almost like they gave up when it came to doing this part of the room. The toilet was pretty much in the bedroom so offered no privacy and was a little unhygienic. The shower was useless both for water pressure and temperature and felt like you were in a public swimming baths and there was an awful smell of drains. You also had to opt in to have your towels and bedsheets cleaned which I thought was poor for a supposed 4 star hotel, this should be done anyway.

All in all an ok stay here, but there is certainly better hotels available. For me this is a middle of the road 3 star hotel, only made individual by the rooftop pool!",U Paasha Seminyak
1668,Luxury in the Heart of Seminyak,50,September 2016,"Loved this hotel. OR more importantly, LOVED the rooftop and pool.
Breakfasts were great, including green smoothies!
The bar was a bit blah, but we were out in the evenings anyway.
Beds were large (we were two friends, twin share) and comfy.
Great location, set back from busy street.
All in all a great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
1669,Hotel stay in Seminyak,40,September 2016,"Great rooftop pool with 1 complimentary drink upon check-in; breakfast was great (fresh and plenty of choices, staffs was very attentive). This is the only hotel that allow check out anytime within 24hrs from check-in time. Hotel is centrally located, on the same street plenty of bars/restaurants, next to hotel is the spa 100IDP for 60min massage called Nirvana.",U Paasha Seminyak
1670,Lovely end of holiday stay,40,September 2016,"I stayed here for one night with my partner and our 18 month old child. Great location and surprisingly quiet considering the Hotel is in the heart of Seminyak. The breakfast was awesome and our ground floor room was very spacious with a huge, comfortable bed. The pool area is large and there was no fighting for sun loungers, plus there is a shallow end for children. Staff happily organised a car to take us to the airport the next day. Really good value for money, I would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1671,"Great location, lovely hotel.",50,September 2016,"If you want a luxury stay in the heart of Seminyak this hotel fits the bill.
Great location- right in the main streets and hustle and bustle of Seminyak. 10 minute walk to the beach.
Great roof top pool, with food and drinks. helpful staff.
Lovely clean and big rooms.
The hotel is big and does not have the local happiness and charm of some smaller resorts, but it is comfortable, clean and spacious.
Lovely breakfast too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1672,Enjoyed our stay :),40,September 2016,"Nice hotel in a great location on one of the main strips in Seminyak. Rooftop pool was amazing, rooms were nice and big however slightly outdated. Staff were friendly and enjoyed the buffet breakfast every morning which has great selection of foods. Would definitely recommend",U Paasha Seminyak
1673,"Lovely hotel, perfect location!",50,September 2016,"We found this hotel perfect for our stay in Seminyak. It is in a great location on the main street through Seminyak, with a number of really good restaurants and shops within a 30 second walk (we recommend Chandi for dinner). It is also a 10 minute walk away from the beach and nice spots to view the sunset (Ku De Ta, Potato Head etc). It also has great facilities if you want to relax and enjoy the sun. The pool area on the roof is beautiful and quiet and the poolside service is also really good. The rooms are spacious and clean with a nice big bed but prob could do with a bit of a refresh of upholstery. We were staying B&B and found the breakfast really good, with a big selection.",U Paasha Seminyak
1674,Fabulous location with large rooms,40,September 2016,"Perfectly situated for those who want to be amongst it. Close to lots of restaurants and shopping. The hotel itself is quite new and the rooms are a generous size.

The hotel has a small restaurant, fabulous rooftop pool and bar which has wonderful views of Seminyak. Food is good and the service although slow staff were always friendly.

The hotel itself is built terribly and for a reasonably newish looking hotel the finishes were disappointing. Our front door had a gap so big that from the corridor you could see inside. Our aircon wasn't working on the first night but that was fixed promptly. The large glass toilet door felt like it was going to fall off its hinges. The workmanship is terrible for a hotel of this calibre with large gaps in the plaster on the roof throughout the room and bathrooms. The floors in the shower and bathroom look dirty but I think it's the materials that were used and the dodgy workmanship.

One of the great things about this hotel is that check out time depends on check in time. If you check in at 5pm you don't have to check out until 5pm so was perfect for us having late night flights home and not having to pay for a whole additional room night.

Breakfast is also served anywhere anytime. The restaurant is small and very hot but there is a good selection of things to choose from.

There use to be a bar on the ground floor which we had visited last time we were in Seminyak however for some reason that was closed during this stay.

If you aren't fussy and are able to look past the building defects this hotel offers value for money, great location and a good room size. We were a family of four and had plenty of room.

We would definitely consider staying again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1675,Good location and spacious interior,40,September 2016,"It's a great location just opp the restaurant Ultimo. Interior is spacious and comfortable, but my only complaint would be that there's a weird smell whenever I turn on the shower and there was a leak in the ceiling where the toilet is situated. Would be good to do some form of maintenance but otherwise, it's one of the better hotels that's priced decently.",U Paasha Seminyak
1676,Comfortable and relaxing,40,September 2016,"Hotel is well positioned for a range of local and international cuisine.The room was spacious with comfortable beds and lounge. Toilet and shower facilities were seperate with double basin and workable bench space. However the shower was too big with pebble base not to my liking.
The room was serviced daily with complimentary bottle of water each day.
Breakfast staff were very attentive and selection for breakfast dishes was wide ranging. Fruit was fresh and delicious and strong latte met with my approwal.
The swimming pool was located on the 5th floor- open air. With a number of people using that pool the number of umbrellas/ canopies were not sufficient.
On two occasions we could not find a lounge with a shade. It was also noted that some people reserved the lounges for more than an hour. Complimentary fresh fruit on skewer was a lovely treat. Overall we had a very pleasant stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1677,Relaxing Stay,40,September 2016,"The U Paasha is a centrally located, spacious hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. My husband and I stayed here for 12 nights and found our stay very enjoyable, nothing was too much trouble for the staff, everyone greeted you with a smile.

The hotel is located in the heart of Seminyak's busiest streets, lined with fantastic restaurants, shopping and night spots, and is a 10 min walk to the beach. Modern facilities, with a great view from the rooftop pool and bar.

My only criticism would be the unstable wifi (only on occasions) and the bathrooms drainage could do with a bit of an upgrade / clean up.

Overall a great stay, I would highly recommend the U Paasha for a relaxing stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1678,excellent stay!,50,August 2016,"Stayed here on our last night in Bali.
Great spacious room with balcony and view over the city. There is a roof top restaurant, pool and bar with great views.
The hotel is right in the main street and there is amazing colonial restaurants and cafes across the road.
Great hotel and highly recommended. Would definitely go back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1679,Seminyak,40,September 2016,"This hotel is very nice with great staff. The breakfast that comes with the room is great with many options to pick from. This hotel is in a nice location in Seminyak to eat, party or relax. This is close to the beach and all of the great bars and restaurants are either walking distance or a 5 to 10 minutes drive. The beach is also a 10 minute walk.",U Paasha Seminyak
1680,Friendly and Relaxing,40,August 2016,"U Paasha was an incredibly, well located spacious hotel with all the amenities you could need. We had a Suite with View, which included free cocktails between 6 - 7.30 (which we made very good use of), as well as return airport transfers.

Breakfast was excellent, lots of variety and flexibility as to where and when you have it.

The pool was amazing, with a really lovely view, made you feel like you were in your own secluded area, not in the middle of thriving Seminyak. Location amazing - we were able to walk to all of our restaurant bookings, and really cheap taxis to Potato Head and Finn's.

All the staff were really friendly and helpful.
Our only problem was that two days into our six day stay our wifi didnt work in our room, only by the pool or in reception.",U Paasha Seminyak
1681,Centrally located,40,August 2016,"U Paasha is located smack bang on the main strip of Seminyak where all the restaurants, shops and entertainment are. The pluses:
- Great location if you want to get close to the action in Seminyak ie: variety of restaurants, bars, shops, beach clubs etc are all within walking distance or short taxi ride
- The rooms are all suites, spacious and very minimalistic with comfortable bed.
- Rooftop bar / pool has a fantastic view of sunset and surrounding areas
- They offer 24 hours room, which means you will have the room 24 hours from the moment you check in to the moment you check out without incurring a late check out fee.
- DVD player in the room
- Breakfast in room after hours

The not so great aspects:
- It's not close to the beach. You have to walk about 15-20 minutes to nearest public beach entrance
- The rooftop pool is quite small for the size of the hotel and always busy specially during the day, we went there 3 days in a row and have to wait up to an hour to get deck chairs
- Service is a little of a mix bag. Some staff seems to be friendly and welcoming. Some are indifferent.
- Breakfast options can be varied a little bit
- Reception asked for full payment at check in as well as cash deposits for incidentals.
- Depending wether you like the hustle bustle or quiet and tranquility. The street in front can be a chaos with traffic jam and touts offering you all sorts of things.
- Lack of resort atmosphere and Balinese touch of some of the other hotels

Overall it was a good stay. We chose the location and the hotel because we wanted to stay somewhere different.",U Paasha Seminyak
1682,Location makes it,40,August 2016,"Right in the heart of Seminak this is the perfect place to be based! The room itself was starting to look a bit tired, and we he no view from our room- this was our last stop for our trip and perhaps we had been spoiled at our previous hotels! The bed was massive and very indulgent. Favourite part of the stay was the buffet breakfast, the best we'd had on our trip!",U Paasha Seminyak
1683,Perfect hotel right in the middle of everything,50,August 2016,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon .. We wanted to be close to all the good restaurants and bars .. And this place fits the bill.. So many great places just across the road .. Less than a few minutes in either direction, so many wonderful options. No wonder they call it ""eat street"". Only a 5 minute stroll to Seminyak square, 7 min walk to Ku de Ta .. Everything is so close. Super friendly staff, free bicycle hire, awesome roof top pool and bar area. SUPER COMFORTABLE BED and pillows!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1684,Loved our stay!,50,August 2016,"Loved our stay here! Fantastic location in central Seminyak meant everything was walking distance. Loved the peace of the rooftop bar and pool, the rooms were so luxurious with a huge comfy bed and the breakfast buffet was incredible",U Paasha Seminyak
1685,Recommended,50,August 2016,"This is a lovely modern hotel. The rooftop pool is great. Amazing views and polite and helpful staff.

1686,Ideal Seminyak hotel - love this place!,50,November 2015,"I've stayed at U Paasha twice now & loved it both times. Great location in the heart of Seminyak. Large rooms with super comfy beds! Roof top pool is fantastic ( unless it's a windy day) as well as the free morning yoga classes. Norman at the front desk is amazing & so helpful as are all the staff. Breakfasts are also extremely good - so much variety!
Highly recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
1687,Bali service at its best,40,August 2016,"This is a veryp nice hotel. Centrally located, rooms typically large, clean and well serviced. My bed (huge) was very comfortable.
Service from check-in through to check-out was faultless and always delivered with typical Balinese charm.
The buffet breakfast was very good. Hot food was always fresh and hot and included a selection of Balinese dishes which were rotated daily. There was a good selection of cold meats, including splendid pickled white fleshed fish. Contrary to moans I had heard from Australian guests, I enjoyed the freshly brewed coffee, which the staff was happy to serve to my desired wish.
The rooftop pool is a nice size and its surrounds are well serviced and maintained. My criterion for assessing a tropical hotel bar is the quality of its mojitos. I scored the rooftop bar's 9/10.",U Paasha Seminyak
1688,Location Location,40,August 2016,"Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Eats Street Seminyak great size bedrooms walking distance to many of Bali's most popular restaurants.
Good helpful staff, great roof top bar.
Breakfast can be had at the dinning room, your bedroom, or the pool area at any time you like up to 10pm",U Paasha Seminyak
1689,Great location and spacious rooms - value for money!!,50,August 2016,"We stayed at U Paasha hotel for three nights. The hotel has excellent location in the center of Seminyak next to all the bars and shops. The rooms are very spacious and the staff very friendly. The first night we had a problem with the lock of our balcony door and after informing the reception the problem was fixed in 15 minutes. If you visit Seminyak, U Paasha hotel is the best choice.",U Paasha Seminyak
1690,Spacious rooms,50,April 2016,I stayed at this hotel with a couple of friends for my birthday. The rooms are very spacious and clean. Hotel receptionis open and has views of the street. Great roof top pool for tannng and relaxing. Good location with a heap of choices for eating right at your door step.,U Paasha Seminyak
1691,Good location and Spacious Room,40,August 2016,"Good location and spacious room. We check in for 2 nights. Breakfast is good with international food, should have more choices of local food as well. Towel in room a bit yellowish and internet speed is not stable. We check in on fifth floor.",U Paasha Seminyak
1692,Excellent hotel in VERY central Seminyak location,50,August 2016,"My wife and I stayed at U Paasha for 5 nights during a recent 2 week stay in Bali.

We usually stay at the neighboring Amadea Resort but decided to try somewhere different for a change.

U Paasha ticked all of the boxes for us and what we were looking for.

The rooms are MASSIVE and I mean seriously MASSIVE considering what you're paying. The bed was big and comfortable and the air conditioning worked really well. The bathroom is huge with double vanity. A few reviews we read said that the bathrooms were filthy. They aren't filthy they just ""look"" a little bit worn through the hotel not being brand new.

The rooftop pool is excellent and if you love full sun then this is the pool for you. You can get shade from umbrellas if you like but its super sunny up there. Rooftop bar is pleasant and a nice spot to have a drink for sunset.

Breakfast is nice and the staff are very friendly also. The gym is cool also and everything you need to work off a few Bintang calories.

The location is the real deal sealer here. If you've been to Seminyak before and want to stay central OR if you haven't been to Seminyak and aren't sure where to stay, you won't be disappointed here. You are walking distance to some great spots (La Favela, Sisterfields, Boss Man, Grocer and Grind, Revolver, La Sicilia, Corner House ... you name it). You can ""taksi"" it to any of the hot clubs and bars on the beach also for 30k rupiah.

In conclusion we would definitely stay here again however, we do still love Amadea but the pool here just edges it!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1693,Loved it!,50,August 2016,"My friend and I both enjoyed our stay at U Paasha and would definately stay again. One of my favorite part about U Paasha was the lobby, it is just so beautiful! Breakfast was great and the room was huge! The pool was a decent size but you can't really expect to do laps because it is quite shallow. The hotel is exceptionally located in the heart of Seminyak.. everything is a walkable distance. I was also worried because I read reviews saying that its a little loud, but that was not the case, we were on the 2nd floor and didn't have a problem with noise. Overall, it was a good hotel and I would recommend it to other people.",U Paasha Seminyak
1694,"Fabulous hotel, great location",50,July 2016,"This hotel was recommended to me and it didn't disappoint. The location is fabulous, walk to everything. Our room was huge, the rooftop pool sensational, everything about it was terrific, I would definitely stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
1695,Great spot wicked roof top pool,40,September 2015,We stayed here last year with our family. Great hotel awesome food. Amazing roof top bar and the happy hour in the afternoon was a perfect way to sip cheap cocktails while watching the sunset in the distance. Only down side not really made for family's as we had two little ones wouldn't recommend it. How ever our stay was still amazing would return again when the kids are a bit older,U Paasha Seminyak
1696,Purely the rooftop bar,40,July 2016,"We have never stayed at U Paasha - but the rooftop bar is open to the public and it is well worth the visit.
There is food and drink available and regularly a themed night with buffet (that is also super cheap).

The star attraction however is the view. Being one of the taller buildings in the area, you can see out to the coast and have a about 200 degrees of view. Great for afternoons to watch the sun go down or even a light dabble of rain.

Note that the pool is reserved for hotel guests only.",U Paasha Seminyak
1697,Love the 24 hour room reservation,50,July 2016,"Location, tick (Main Street of Seminyak). Rooftop pool, tick. Good brekkie, tick (local and western selection and great fresh juices). Cocktail bar, tick. Your room is reserved for 24 hours from time of check in. It was great to checkin at 11pm and have the room till 11pm on the night of check out, especially when all flights in/out Sydney arrive/leave late in evening. Hotel is clean, great staff and rooms are huge ( we paid for 5th/top floor). I don't think I'd stay anywhere else next time I visit Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1698,Great hotel!,50,July 2016,"This hotel is great. This was my 9th time to Bali, having stayed in different areas and different hotel and villa's. U paasha is by far the best I have experienced! Excellent location with Seminyak square been only 100 metres down the street! You can literally walk out the front of the hotel and your are spoiled with choice of amazing restaurants and cafes. The breakfast at the hotel is great with some many different options, including bacon and eggs, fresh pastries, they can make you omelettes or pancakes. Make you coffee of any kind for you. Staff at hotel were very pleasant and accommodating to any of our needs. Hotel security always out the front and makes you feel very safe! Rooftop pool is great plenty of room and day beds for everyone.

I will definitely be coming back to stay at U paasha again!

Only negative thing I would say is that the shower smelt but as soon as we called reception to advise them they had us in a new room within just minutes!

Thanks for having us!",U Paasha Seminyak
1699,Very nice rooftop bbq dining,40,July 2016,Three days a week they is a bbq dining on the rooftop with nice vieuws over seminyak. The total cost is about 240.000 Idr/person (nett) and you can eat without limit. There is a large choice of meat and side dishes. You receive 1 complementary welcome drink.,U Paasha Seminyak
1700,Want Shopping Seminyak is the Place in Bali,50,May 2016,"The last three nights in Bali we stayed at U Paasha right in the heart of Seminyak. A good point if returning to the airport or if you just want good shopping. Lots of modern spacious shopping centres.

The hotel was very modern, most welcoming and very clean. The rooms are huge and they all have a balcony.

The best part which just put the icing on our holiday was the roof top pool which overlooked Seminyak. You can lay around the pool and the staff are very attentive. You could drink cocktails all day if you wanted to or order a meal to be brought to you pool side.

The hotel is a few blocks from the beach but a taxi ride is cheap if you want to go to the beach.

The rooms are cool and every day fresh bottled water is brought to your room. The breakfast is outstanding.

Would recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1701,The heaven of hideouts,40,July 2016,"If you're a frequent traveler, there are some common issues that usually leaves you biting the bullet because ""it is what it is"" with most hotels.

Not U Paasha.

Breakfast - It sucks when you have to drag yourself out of bed to make it for the breakfast buffet that's usually included in your room package. In U Paasha, if you miss the buffet, you have until 10pm (yes, 10pm) to order from the all-day breakfast menu with no charge. Amazing.

Checkout time - They have a 24hr policy. Basically, if you checked in at 4pm, that will be your check out time. How great is that! Isn't it only fair that you get the full 24 hrs if you're paying the full price per night? It's annoying how other hotels are pretty anal with their checkout times.

Apart from these traveler issues, I was also quite pleased with what they offered.

Yoga - Sunrise yoga from 6-7am on Saturdays. Oh, it's free.

Bicycles - You can rent bicycles from the hotel itself. Oh, free again.

Soap - The rooms are stocked with jasmine scented soaps but you get to pick a different bar during check-in. Bamboo, lemongrass, and... Well I can't remember, but I know I've never been to a hotel where they let you choose your soap.

Room - The rooms are huge - a sofa, a lounge chair, a desk, comfortable bed with great pillows, two whole separate sinks, a shower that's separated from the toilet, and a balcony. Great to just sink in the mattress, watch some tv, junk out on that free breakfast room service, and just feel guilty about being so pampered.

If all these don't appeal to you, I don't know what will.

There are a couple of things that can be improved. Ants. Small cracks on the sliding glass door to the balcony. Hot water seems to be limited. Just some maintenance issues that should be addressed.

Overall, if you're the sort who needs some quiet, some Ommm, some space to shut out the world, U Paasha is the perfect choice.",U Paasha Seminyak
1702,great rooftop sunset cocktail!!!,50,June 2016,"We stayed here for 5 nights in June for a friends birthday. We really liked the hotel and the kitchen and wait staff were lovely! very accomodating and friendly. The bed in our room was super comfy so was fold out bed our son had, not your normal fold out bed it was like a proper single bed.
Location is excellent you are right on ""eat street"" but at the pool on the roof its so quiet you could be a million miles away from everywhere.
The only down side is the Bintangs were soooooo not cold enough, but the lovely staff did find us some ice buckets :))))",U Paasha Seminyak
1703,Great hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,July 2016,"We really liked this hotel as its on the smaller scale with 5 floors with around 100 rooms I would say.
Our room was very spacious & on the first floor so easy just to walk out for buffet breakfast & access to the street.
It is located across the road from Bali Cafe & Ultimo.
The pool is really nice & located on the roof top so there are some really nice views from up there.
Staff are very friendly. There is a restaurant on the first floor where you have buffet breakfast & a roof top bar (you can purchase food by the pool or in the bar area)
Great place & location",U Paasha Seminyak
1704,Highly recommend!!!!!!,50,July 2016,"This place was amazing value for money! We paid for the room + breakfast included. This is a must! The breakfast was to die for. The food was so good & just kept going back for more with the buffet. Fresh eggs made to order, fresh pancakes. Pastries & everything else you could want in a breaky.
But by purchasing the included breaky, what I didn't realise, is it includes free drinks (whatever you want) from the roof top bar from 6-7:30pm! This was a bargain, started up there every night before heading out with delicious cocktails & beer. You also get a complimentary drink on arrival. Seriously best deal ever. We even got some free tapas whilst up there one night, the service is endless!
I also highly recommend you do their bbq nights. We did it Friday, only 190 rupi for all you can eat local produce which included lobster! We went back for endless plates along with our free drinks! THIS WAS THE BEST!
Service was amazing. Rooms cleaned everyday. Giant king bed!
Hotel right on main strip so everything is walking distance!
Loved everything about this hotel. A must visit <3",U Paasha Seminyak
1705,Great 4*,50,July 2016,"This is a great hotel, one the best U's that we've stayed in. It is centrally located, making everything that you need from Seminyak walking distance. Rooms are huge and have everything that you need. Bathrooms are beginning to look a bit tired. Good selection of breakfast. Staff are friendly and helpful. Pool is great but can get busy in the mornings. Definitely recommend staying here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1706,"Great location, Very good value for money",50,July 2016,"The hotel is super fresh, with big spacious rooms, in the middle of the main shopping street. The area is very busy (almost a bit too busy), BUT right next to all the good restaurant, so if you want to be close to everything, you won't get a better location.

The breakfast is probably the best hotel breakfast we have ever had !

We paid around €100 a night, and that was very good value for money.
No need to pay a lot to stay right on the beach in semi yak, since the beach there is not that nice after all.",U Paasha Seminyak
1707,Dirty hotel with 4 stars pricing,10,March 2016,"Some of the front staff were rude, I am not sure was it because they don't speak English or they're purely rude. The reception area is nicely designed. Stayed there for 3 nights, and like what others say, they serve same food everyday.
Shower is covered with mold and smelled molding too. Towels were awfully dirty or they rather wash it in organic way because I am sure they didn't use any bleach. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.
I hope the management would really do something about their cleanliness and the stained furniture and don't simply apologize on all negative comments.",U Paasha Seminyak
1708,Friendly hotel great location,50,July 2016,"Friendly staff, great location.large room.Very pleasant around roof top pool with staff very engaging. Great for evening cocktails while watching the sunset. Breakfast was a highlight esp. for our daughter.",U Paasha Seminyak
1709,Fantastic place to stay,50,July 2016,"U Paasha is right in the middle of one of the busiest parts of Seminyak but it was still very quiet and comfortable (I stayed on the 3rd floor, 5th is the highest floor). The room was extremely spacious, clean and modern. Highly recommended!

It is also right opposite Ultimo, a beautiful Italian restaurant that is definitely worth checking out. A live band performs there in the evenings and the food and drinks are super affordable compared to many other places in the area.",U Paasha Seminyak
1710,To Many Better hotels in Seminyak,30,July 2016,"After reading my friends review timbo -penny I would like to add a few remarks.
I have never been treated so badly as I was in Upaasha .until we had a meeting with Devey ( the reservations manger ) and she made sure we were well looked after but to have to get so angry about ALL our rooms. No never again.
Also they didn't stop phoning us for our money But told them I wasn't paying until I had spoken to the manager .we were told they have a lot of fraud on cards BUT I Was paying with cash.
As for your rooms very nice but showers filthy you need a power jet to clean them then they need to be SEALED so that the dirt doesn't build up we had 3 rooms and they were all filthy.( not the pattern as we were told)
Well Devey we told you all our complaints so yes now it is up to you to resolve the issues.",U Paasha Seminyak
1711,Has potential but very dirty,20,July 2016,"My partner and I stayed 3 nights at this hotel as part of a 3 week trip to Indonesia. We booked the hotel because we had heard good things about the hotel and the reviews on here looked promising. The hotel is located in a excellent spot in Seminyak, close to lots of cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs. The hotel appeared beautiful and modern from the outside and the lobby was open and spacious. The staff were friendly and welcoming and the check in process was quick & easy. First impressions of our room (121) were great, the room was huge with a super king bed, and two seperate couches/day beds. Upon closer inspection, both couches were covered in stains, most white stains (I'll leave it to you to make an assumption as to what they could have been). Safe to say we didn't sit on those couches at all. The bathroom, too appeared amazing on first appearance. It had a seperate toilet and huge shower with double sinks and toiletries provided however the shower was absolutely filthy. It was covered in mould and was so bad that we both wore thongs in the shower. Happy to deal with the couch and shower issues, we settled in for our first night, only to discover additional white and red stains on the sheets in the bed! Due to flying in late and it being 1.00am, we decided to leave it and slept on the top of the covers for the duration of our stay. The bed head was a blue cotton material but was covered in black marks, almost like an oil resin and/or make up. The towels in the bathroom were also filthy, with big chunks of foundation and make up residue on them. It's a horrible feeling having a shower, only to get out and dry with a dirty towel! Aside from the disappointment of the room, the hotel rooftop was beautiful. The pool was a good size, with plenty of seating around it. The pool beds were comfortable and the service was excellent. There was also a gym that had good quality equipment including free weights. Having travelled to Bali a combined total of 15 times varying in luxury, we are aware of the Bali standards and the service that should be delivered. Having payed over $160 AUD per night for the accommodation, we expected better and left feeling very disappointed. The staff and the facilities are great but the cleanliness and hygiene standards need to be reviewed immediately.",U Paasha Seminyak
1712,Amazing holiday,40,June 2016,"Arrived here as a couple in June all the way from England, we arrived at the hotel around 8:30pm and after travelling for over 20 hours we was tired and just wanted to get to our room. Check in was simple and straight forward and we was given a larger room as we was staying for a while. We had help bringing our suitcases to the room and was very happy with how modern the room was.
The only downsize to the room is the bathroom and bedroom are open plan which does not give you much privacy.
The room was cleaned to a good standard every day and water was put into the room every day complimentary which was nice.
The breakfast every morning was very good with a lot of different varieties and plenty for everything.
The rooftop bar and pool was lovely although you had to get there really early if you wanted a sun lounger and there was not enough umbrellas to go around which you need in the intense heat. Therefore we spent most time at the beach which is only a 10 minute walk away.
We had massages at the hotel which was nice but extremely over priced to what you can get if you go outside the hotel onto the strip.
The hotel is in the middle of all the bars and restaurants, plently of places to eat and drink. We also went to the beach a few times at the evening where there was more places to eat and drink. Lots of bean bags on the beach to sit at night and drink and listen to the live music.
If coming back to Seminyak I would 100% stay here again we had a fantastic time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1713,Very nice!,40,July 2016,"We had an unfortunate start to our stay at U Pasha. I had emailed and phoned the hotel from Perth prior to our visit with a couple of questions. I had no reply to my email and the phone was put down on me from the reservations - not impressed! My friend had visited the hotel a few weeks prior to our stay to make sure where the rooms were and to request twin bed rooms. We arrived at the hotel at 4p.m. to be told our rooms would not be ready for about another hour as they have a 24 hr. policy which allows guests to book out at the time they book in! Our booking was with Booking.com which stated booking in time was 2p.m. No twin rooms available so we had to have one night in a queen room. [We are four ladies travelling by the way] Not much we could do so had to accept we would move to twin rooms the next day. Moved late afternoon to a room with a lovely view over the rubbish tip! At this stage we were more than fed up! Another room move!! This time all o.k.
We had a meeting with the manager to tell her of our problems. We were offered an upgrade to a better room but after 2 moves and 3 rooms we stayed put. Devey [manager] handled the situation well and listened to our grievances which I hope she will act on. She should do well in her chosen profession as she is very good at her job [on the P.R. side at least] and saw us each day to check all was well. We accepted her offer of a complimentary B.B.Q. dinner with drinks for all 4 of us.
The rooms are spacious. Unfortunately no drawers in the room at all. Shower floors need a good clean with a pressure hose as stains are ingrained now. Not acceptable in a hotel of this standard. Everything else was fine. Staff are lovely in all areas. Breakfast buffet perfect. Pool area nice. Location is perfect for shopping and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1714,Great place to enjoy Bali restaurants.,40,July 2016,"U-Paasha is a really good location to enjoy the main parts of Seminyak and all its flashy restaurants. The accommodation is clean, spacious and quite, so all things you need and would expect. Going for a swim can be a little dull, as there may not be enough chairs and there is now where to hide from the heat on the roof top pool. Also the pool isn't deep enough if you want to enjoy a good swim, its really just for the bobbing drinker with fake RayBan's. All in all this is a nice place to stay for you next holiday..",U Paasha Seminyak
1715,Doesn't get much better than this !,50,July 2016,"We were extremely impressed with the quality of this hotel. The staff are very friendly and will go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your stay. The hotel is beautifully presented and clean. Our room was also quite spacious, clean and comfortable. The pool on the roof is a great place to spend a few hours, and the hotel cocktails are delicious. The breakfast buffet was extremely extensive, with a wide variety of options to suit both western and Asian tastes. Would definitely recommend the BBQ buffets this hotel has every Monday, Wednesday and Friday night- for about $20AUD a person you get an all you can eat feed, with the hotel chefs cooking the meat and seafood fresh in front of you! The hotel is also in a great location, walking distance to good restaurants and bars. All in all, an amazing stay. Will definitely be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1716,Will stay here everytime - no doubt!,50,June 2016,"We originally stayed in Kuta for 4 days but found our selves in Seminyak every night. We extended our trip and decided we wanted to move to Seminyak for the remainder of our trip. We walked by Paasha and thought it looked neat so we went into the lobby to see if they had available rooms for our stay. Someone walked us around the hotel to show us all they had to offer.
The rooms are awesome - they are modern and big. We loved it. There isn't furniture to put your clothes in but there is a huge closets that fit everything. The rooms were clean and kept clean. We were impressed when we walked in.
On the roof is the pool, fitness room and bar/restaurant area. The views are spectacular from the roof. The drinks are delicious. I can tell you that if you go to the pool.... make sure to get there early. It fills up quickly. We ended up putting our towels on the ground and laying there - which was no bid deal to us. The staff found us chairs as people got up but we were in the pool almost the whole time.
The staff is really amazing - all through out the hotel. They are super friendly and helpful.
The gym is decent... they have cardio and some strength machines and free weights. It is located on the roof as well - so the view is beautiful. I think you can use is 24 hours - which is great. It's kept clean with towels and water cooler.
The breakfast is AWESOME!! You can have it in the lobby or have it as room service if you like - and you can get room service to 10:30 - that includes your breakfast that is included. We did both.
The location is PERFECT. We loved it - it's in the mix. There are great restaurants, bars and shopping right outside. We wouldn't even consider staying somewhere else. You could walk to Ku De Ta beach club for the beach and if you wanted a massage (there is no spa) - there are several walking distance.
The price was great, location great, hotel great and service amazing.",U Paasha Seminyak
1717,"Location, service and unreal breakfast!",50,July 2016,"Amazing location, walking distance to everything. The staff in the hotel are so friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet that's included is delicious, was not expecting the huge selection of food!

Rooms are really big and spacious, lots of ac and comfortable beds!

Such great value, would definitely come back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1718,We loved it here!,50,July 2016,"We booked last minute and we are so glad we did! Our room was huge with a kingsize bed, clean bathroom and very good aircon. The buffet breakfast was great and the rooftop pool was amazing!!! It didn't even feel like we were in the middle of Seminyak. There were stacks of cocktails to choose from (which were delicious) and the traditional Bali food we ordered via room service was fresh and yum! We only wished they had a gym. I've stayed at many places in Seminyak (including IZE, Sense, Bali Sani etc) and this is by far my favourite!",U Paasha Seminyak
1719,I'm a Happy Customer !,50,July 2016,"Just left the hotel this morning. Feeling great about everything in U Paasha. The service is excellent, the choice of buffet and the taste is great. Love the location of this hotel, right in front of Oberoi street, where thousands of restaurant and coffee shop just within reach (the famous Rumors, Tattoria, Ginger Moon, The Library Coffee, The Revolver, and many).

The room is huge with super king size bed, which is a plus point for family with kids. The pool is on the roof with a great view. Not only provide towel, they provide sunblock too. The staff is extremely helpfull and friendly, with great services too.

Another plus point, if you missed bfast time, you still able to order ala carte menu free of charge.

It's definitely kind of hotel I will keep for future reference when I come back to Bali :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1720,Excellent Hotel,50,June 2016,"Stayed for six nights during June and really liked our stay.

Nice hotel, nice reception, friendly staff, fab roof bar and pool.

Location on eat street, easy to get cabs (aim for bluebird metered taxis) and between other popular areas in Seminyak.

I would love to come back and stay longer!

No complaints whatsoever, except for the rain!",U Paasha Seminyak
1721,Great central Seminyak hotel!,40,June 2016,"We stayed 7 nights and were very comfortable. The room was large, the bed was soft and comfortable as were the pillows. The shower was good and having 2 hand basins was also good although the lighting over the basins could have been brighter. The little lounge in the room was good but the cushions could do with a wash as they smelt of sweat. Otherwise the room was very clean and the air conditioning was good. The buffet breakfast was extensive and if you couldn't find anything you like then you must be very fussy. The staff at breakfast were very friendly and efficient and very eager to help. The gym was good too. We didn't use the pool as much as we would have liked because of the lack of shade but swimming on dusk was very enjoyable. The wifi on our first 2 days wasn't so good but after that we had no problems at all. We really liked the check in system they have where your check in time is also your check out time. This worked out very well for us with a late evening departure flight as we were able to return to our room after a day out, shower, pack up and then leave with a 8pm check out. For our check in we arrived late afternoon and were able to store our luggage at the hotel, head out for a walk and dinner before returning to check in at 8pm. It's a very good and convenient concept and was definitely a factor for us in choosing this hotel. The hotel is also in a great location for restaurants and easy walking distance to the beach.",U Paasha Seminyak
1722,"Gorgeous, faultless",50,January 2016,"Absolutely stunning hotel in the heart of seminyak would definitely recommend.
Stunning rooftop pool which is really large with towels on hand to borrow free of charge.
Service at your sun bed for drink & food etc.
Loved the breakfast buffet literally endless options to choose from even if you are a fussy eater or have specific dietary requirements.
Room was very spacious and bathroom which was kind of open plan like you see on the pictures. lost of toiletries provided free of charge and a nice stocked mini fridge with some snacks aswell.
Lost of spas restaurants and bars on the doorstep and if you need to hire a scooter reception are so lovely and its not bother for them to help you with anything at all.",U Paasha Seminyak
1723,Lovely hotel!,50,June 2016,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic facilities. I stayed at the U Paasha for 4 days in June 2016 with my partner for a holiday in the sun, away from the doom and gloom of Melbourne winter. U Paasha in Seminyak was our first stop on our holiday and we loved it. After walking round central seminyak for a few days, I feel like it's the only hotel on the main turbo-tourist-y mega strip, that stacks up to all the things a 4 star hotel should be, as well as being accommodating enough for a new traveler feel welcome and relaxed straight away.
All facilities are really great- rooftop pool is amazing and super fun/relaxing. Beautiful view, plenty of daybeds, and drinks prices are fine. Gym is all it needs to be, with enough bikes and treadmills for everyone.
Breakfast (free of charge for all bookings) was great. Eggs any way you like, waffles, condiments, fruit, coffee tea, pastries etc...
The hotel rooms themselves are big, with heaps of natural light, the beds are great... like sinking into a giant cloud (this is good)... And the bathroom/showers are spacious.
The crowd and patrons staying at the hotel, are as you would expect- lots of Australians, couples and some families. Always felt comfortable and never confronted with ""boys weekend"" bogans or any other people that have the potential to derail a nice time.
Location is spot on. Right in the middle of central Seminyak, walking to all the cafes, beaches, and shops that you probably have on your list. Short taxi to Potatohead and W hotel etc.
Had a great stay. Staff were always very nice and helpful, we checked out at 4pm which was a huge bonus for us, would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1724,Great location friendly service,40,June 2016,"My hotel stay was awesome, I asked for a west facing room, no smoking, twin bed, with airport pick up and they delivered everything with a smile. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Seminyak.
The room was very peaceful and quiet on the third floor. Cocktails are not that great but the pool area was lovely with drinks service to you whilst swimming in the pool. Breakfast was always Delish with Indonesian and western options.",U Paasha Seminyak
1725,Top notch,50,June 2016,The service was great in this hotel. Felt very luxurious. Easy to locate/known by drivers. Staff assisted with any enquiries. Roof top pool area is great with a good view of Seminyak. Smack bang in the middle of Seminyak. Included breakfast has plenty of options to start the day off.,U Paasha Seminyak
1726,Great location and good value,50,June 2016,"Great location, in the central Seminyak area, few mins walk to the Seminyak square and short ride to Potato head club, plenty of decent restaurants nearby, we've tried a few and all good!

The room is very spacious with a small balcony, the only problem was probably the air conditioning, it was quite unstable even the technician couldn't fix it ....

Buffet breakfast with many options, staff are extremely friendly and accommodating! Very decent and good value hotel overall !",U Paasha Seminyak
1727,"Bang on, in the middle of Seminyak!",40,March 2016,"This is a perfect place if you want to experience the nightlife of Bali. Close to the famous Ku De Ta and a short drive to Potato Beach club and Woo Bar this hotel has a lot many restaurants at a walk able distance offering a variety of cuisines. Hotel's got a rooftop pool which is good for relaxing and unwinding in the evening. Breakfast spread is good, though the menu is repeated but it tastes quite good, they've got some live counters too. One can hire taxi's to Kuta and Legian. Big rooms and well arranged.",U Paasha Seminyak
1728,Very nice hotel,50,June 2016,"Very surprised on the size of the rooms here they were huge! So spacious, modern and clean!
Hotel in a great location from bars and shops.
Staff here made it for us they couldn't do enough for you and at breakfast they even helped plan our day's activities by recommending places to go!
We booked a driver for the day which was great we got to see many places like the waterfalls, elephant ride, tried Bali coffee, and went to Tanah Lot for sunset!
Lovely stay would definitely recommend & would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1729,Good hotel just noisy air cond,40,June 2016,"The room was very big and spacious, toilets seperated from the shower, 2 sinks, big large bed. The reception and crew were very nice, the swimming pool on the top floor is a very good place to relax (just the swimming pool is not very deep, but quite big). The drinks , smoothies were tasty, good ambience. The breakfast was good but never changed so much throughtout our 5 day stay. The location of the hotel is very good, right in the center of seminyak, good for shopping /:boutiques, excelent restaurants around, not so far from Ku De Ta, Potatoe head, W retreat. The hotel also has a very good driver 'Pande' who was very nice with us, and greatly enhanced our Bali travel experience, we recommend him.

The down part was the very noisy air conditionning. We tried to have it fixed but each time the technician came the problem wasnt sloved. Plus a bit of paint on the wardrobe mirror in our room, i dont know for the other rooms concerning the air cond and the paint.",U Paasha Seminyak
1730,Prefect location,40,June 2016,"Our first trip to Bali we stayed at Upaasha in the main strip of Seminyak. It's a good location as it's just a 5min stroll down to markets, shopping centre, spa, bars, cafes & restaurants.
We had a suit room with king bed. Room had all the essentials safe,shower,toilet,tea coffee station, mini bar, bath robes, slippers etc. the rooms are pretty much like pictures besides wear and tear as you would expect being a hotel but rooms were clean and styled very practical lots of room and space for your things, enough power points. Showers were good with okay pressure.The staff were amazing really helpful friendly and welcoming.
The breakfast was really good I don't know what people in other reviews are complaining about there was something there for everyone. Egg stations, crape & waffle stations, western food, Asian food, barista, toast with all the spreads imaginable, fresh fruit & salad Everything!!!
They have a shuttle service if required alittle more expensive compared to taxis i thought but
Theres always someone there if you need fast transport which is handy.
Rooftop pool was bliss!! So good plenty of sunbeds to go around complimentary fruit and towels up there also. The staff make sure you have everything you need.
I recommend the cafe across the road ""cafe Bali"" really cheap and amazing food styled beautifully. The spa Down the road ""Kimberly's spa"" really good we were there every day getting a treatment.",U Paasha Seminyak
1731,"Great Hotel, Amazing Value, Perfect Location",50,June 2016,"Stayed here for 2 nights after a 5 night stay at Club Villas on our 5th trip to Seminyak and will definitely be returning. Even with an upgrade to the 5th floor rooms the price is great value. The rooftop pool is an absolute winner. The service from the team up there is great, especially Rika. Breakfast is included and has a fantastic range of options to set you up for the day. We arranged a driver for a half day tour through the hotel at a great price. Checkin / Checkout was very professional and the location in the middle of all the bars and restaurants is perfect with no noise or disturbances at all. Definitely check this place out if you're coming to Seminyak. I hope you enjoy it as much as we have!",U Paasha Seminyak
1732,"Average hotel, great location",30,June 2016,"For a hotel that is only 5 years old it is VERY aged. Great location everything at your door step but the hotel needs updating/refurbishing it looks pretty average!

First we got a room on the 5th floor and were kept up all night by a very loud noise, we thought there was something wrong with the aircon, turns out it was the pool pump as the pool is on the next floor, therefore we changed rooms to a ""quiet room"".
which was on the 3rd floor, it was next to private large villas which kept us up with parties most nights. If you want to get some sleep this isn't the right hotel as it is in the heart of everything.

The corridors and stairways always had spare beds and empty bottles and mess left in them and when the room was made up im pretty sure the bed was just made never felt really clean as it does when you stay at a hotel and it gets made up. It was a 3 star hotel good for value, defiantly not luxury!

The pool area was nice though.",U Paasha Seminyak
1733,Lovely Hotel,50,May 2016,"Only spent 1 night in this hotel on my way to Gilli T. Lovely hotel, presentation is awesome, room was huge and everything was clean. Has a roof top pool which does get a bit windy but has lovely views. Close to a lot of restaurants. Star bucks is just a short walk down the end of the street and around the corner for the coffee lovers. Buffet breakfast was very nice. All round my friend and I had a lovely but short time at this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1734,Stayed a little over a week,50,June 2016,"We decided to stay at U Paasha because we liked the city feel and the ability to walk to nearby restaurants and shops. Front desk staff were helpful with tourism info, transport, and provided an electrical converter to borrow. Very modern and spacious. Rooftop deck is also nice. Hard to get a spot mid afternoon to evening. We found people saving spots early morning and not returning until later in the day. Breakfast was good. Walking distance to hot spots such as Motel Mexicola and Potato Head Beach Club. Would recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1735,Love the U Paasha,40,May 2016,"Had 3 glorious nights at this fabulous hotel. Rooms were large with big comfy bed. Bathroom also large. Double basins ,separate toilet. Tea and coffee facilities in room. Breakfast buffet very good also. The rooftop pool is great with plenty of lounges. Rooftop bar fantastic. Lovely cocktails. The location is the best. Right in the middle of best restaurants, boutique shopping and great bars. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1736,Excellent hotel with good service and close to everything but still peaceful and quiet,50,June 2016,"I've just stayed in the U Pasha for the last week and I loved the hotel. I stayed in a suite on the 5th floor and it was nice, very comfortable and good sized. Breakfast was included and very good, if you missed it in the restaurant you could order it Upto the room all day. Free cocktails every night on the rooftop bar ngext to the pool was a nice touch. The service at the pool was excellent and I was fortunate to be served by Prima Dana who was excellent, such a friendly and hardworking person who did everything possible to make our time at the hotel as good as possible and an absolute credit to the hotel. Lovely hotel and will stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1737,"Modern, clean, perfect location!",50,May 2016,"If you are looking for a modern, clean but also quiet hotel in the middle of busy Seminyak - this is it! Couldn't get a better location on the main strip and surrounded by the best restaurants and bars but is also quiet enough to get a great night sleep. The rooms are large with a great rooftop pool, breakfast is delicious and the service is impeccable while still being very afforable. This is the second time I have stayed, last time with my mum and sister and this time with a group of 6 (fussy!) friends who all agreed they would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1738,Our number one choice in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"This is our second stay this year at U Paasha, such a great hotel we had to come back for more! This time we brought family with us (who were visiting Bali for the first time) and they were equally impressed.

We love the location, right in the heart of the Seminyak dining and boutique retail scene, check in is always seamless, rooms are luxe with comfortable pillowy beds and oversized bathrooms. We always go for the sunset cocktail package which includes airport transfers, rooms on the top floor with balcony views to the beach and 1 1/2 hours of sunset cocktail drinking by the rooftop pool. So much value.

This is the best hotel to choose if you have late flights as they have the 24hr check in policy (the time you check in is the time you check out). Makes for a stress free and comfortable departure.

Buffet breakfast is of a high quality, with an egg and pancake station and lots of choices to keep everyone happy.

The rooftop pool is their crowning glory, and you can waste many hours away sitting up there soaking up the sun, ordering from the poolside menu and feeling totally pampered.

Staff are attentive and are always around when you need them. They really make you feel like a part of their big family and that's why we will always return! Can't wait to be back there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1739,BIG room!,40,May 2016,"Loved the size of the room - we were given one of the largest rooms in the hotel (as advised by the staff member who registered us on arrival). Bed was Californian King size and quite firm, and we had a abundance of pillows. Pool was big with lots sun loungers, and rooftop bar was great. Located on Eat Street and boutique shopping at your doorstep. Only minuses - the bar fridge in the room never worked, and the aircon struggled to cool the room effectively in the 35 degree heat of the day. We encountered the 'sewer' smell from the shower one morning - but turning the shower on and running the water for a couple of minutes fixed it quickly (didn't happen again during our 10 day stay). Overall recommended for staff service, convenience of location and size of room.",U Paasha Seminyak
1740,What a GREAT place!!,50,May 2016,"Hotel is in a great location (right in the middle of Eat Street!). Great staff (we spoke to a few of them and they actually love working there!) Breakfast was great - lots of variety, real coffee and went to 11am and if you catch Gunar (one of the staff) smile it will make your day! Great size room and the late check out (4pm in our case) at no extra charge. The roof top pool was great, they even think of the little things such as providing sunblock and fruit kebabs delivered to you while you relax on your sun lounger every day! We will definitely be back!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1741,Right in the middle of seminyak!,40,May 2016,"Check in and out was fast. Many restaurants, bars and mini marts around. So the location is superb.

This hotel practice 24 hrs policy which I appreciate. We checked in at 9pm and as our departure flight was 850pm and we could check out late without any charges.

Breakfast was good. No complains.

Room wise. It was big and could accommodate 4 pax I think. But there's no bathtub. I wonder why since there isn't space constrain. I didn't quite like the bathroom and toilet cos I thought it wasn't very clean. It could be better.

The aircon had some issues on the 3rd night but was fixed in 30 mins. Great job.",U Paasha Seminyak
1742,Best location in Seminyak!,40,May 2016,"The staffs are very friendly. They genuinely greet you. There is one free drink for each guest at the roof TOP bar. The room is spacious but you are not allow to smoke inside the room! The staff advise us to smoke in the balcony instead. :( There is no ash tray in the room so I cut a bottle to use as an ash tray. The room service staff was very kind to wash the bottle. On the 4th day, he gave me an ash tray and threw the bottle away! Thank you!

Breakfast: We love the breakfast! The fried rice is always nice for Asian standard but the noodle is badly done. It is always overcooked and hard.

Roof TOP bar and Swimming pool: Love the scenery from the bar. Nice place to chill out.

To all the service crew, thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!",U Paasha Seminyak
1743,"Great location, huge rooms",50,April 2016,"We loved U Paasha, location is excellent right on Eat Street, but no noise once inside the hotel, we had a room towards the back. So many great restaurants close by. The rooms are modern and very spacious, that was one of our deciding factors when we booked, the rooms are much bigger than other hotels. The roof top pool is huge and we never had an issue with sunbeds,. The breakfast was awesome and included waffles and pancakes. I will stay again,",U Paasha Seminyak
1744,LOVE THIS HOTEL,50,December 2015,"We loved this hotel. The rooms are very modern with enough space. The infinity pool is amazing. When we were there they had buy 1 get 1 free cocktails which was awesome. We loved the location as there are so many great restaurants around.
I highly recommend staying at the U Paasha :).",U Paasha Seminyak
1745,U paasha seminyak,50,March 2016,Excellent all round. Value for money...for those food lovers ..its in the heart of 'eat street'. 2 big bonuses were that you could eat breakfast anytime which I did most of my stay in the afternoon by the pool. 2nd was that checkout time was checkin time. Rooms were huge ..we were 3 girls sharing and it was still quite spacious. I stayed 6 months earlier at hard rock hotel in kuta and u paasha rooms were cleaner bigger and so much nicer.,U Paasha Seminyak
1746,Great spot!,40,May 2016,"We have been to Bali many times but I really enjoyed my stay at UPaasha.
It is in a great location close to some terrific restaurants. The staff were really friendly, the rooftop pool lovely and the rooms spacious and clean. Our room was located at the back of the hotel so no view and a little noisy from generators but it wouldn't stop me from recommending this hotel. Breakfast was delicious too.",U Paasha Seminyak
1747,Center of Seminyak,30,May 2016,"The location in the center of Seminyak. If looking for a place to feel festivity of night life in Bali this is a perfect place to stay. This is not a new hotel, compare with my first time stay, the room is still ok, only tthey need small refurbishment.

The lobby interior is nice and warm. The staff are ok.

I like the spacious corridor. The room is big with minimilsm interior. The bed is big and comfort.

The breakfast is average

Price is fair",U Paasha Seminyak
1748,Nice hotel &mince staff!,40,June 2015,"Lovely big room, clean and very comfortable!! Breakfast was good for Bali with lots of options daily!

Pool area could do with a mini refurbish but all in all a nice place to relax and great service for drinks/food!

Would definitely stay again! :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1749,"Great location, great hotel",40,April 2016,"We had a 8 night getaway without the kids. When we arrived we found our room had been upgraded, the room was massive. The next morning we then understood why we were upgraded. Fabulous room but its location is at the front of the hotel so you hear all the road/traffic noise during the night. The design of the hotel also meant while you could walk out of your room and look down into the reception area, it meant the noise from reception could be heard in our room. 6am the phones started ringing. The hotel was great about it an offered to move our room but we loved the room so much we went out an bought ear plugs and that helped.
Everything else about the hotel was great, the roof top pool area was lovely, although on one occasion there wasn't enough deck chairs available, but that was fine we chilled on the couches at the bar instead and just wondered over to the pool; when we needed to cool off. There needed to be a few more umbrella's by the pool tho. The breakfast was great, and was nice to have a real coffee made to order at no extra charge.
The location was the winner, you could just walk out your door and had all the great restaurant at your door step.
I've stayed at a few different places in Bali over my 10+ visits and would recommend U Passha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1750,Huge rooms great location,40,April 2016,"I stayed at UPaasha for 3 nights and was really impressed. The location is fantastic it is right in the heart of Seminyak restaurants, lots of great restaurants are on your doorstep. It is about a 10 minute walk to the beach. The rooftop pool was clean and plenty of service for drinks and food with a great view to the beach. I was not so impressed with the food, it was a little different for your standard poolside menu, the club sandwich was curried chicken and surprisingly there was no me goreng,Nasi goreng or sate on the menu. A really good cocktail list and you could definitely taste the alcohol.
The rooms were huge, and modern decor. The beds were really comfy. Just a few little things, the bathrooms are open so if you are travelling with someone who is not your partner you may want to know this and the iPod docking station is the old long iPod/iPhone connection if you have an iPhone 5 or above you are not able to use it in the room.
As I said these were just little things and I would definitely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1751,Very comfortable in happening part of town,40,May 2016,"This property is extremely comfortable in every respect. Bed was great, amenities and space outstanding and the rooftop pool quite nice. Staff are weak in English skills but everyone is willing to help. It's on a busy thoroughfare in Seminyak but my room facing the other part of town was quiet. Highly recommended if this is where you want to be in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1752,Could be better,30,May 2016,"I was looking forward to my stay at UPaasha, unfortunately, it has not met my expectation. Pictures look so much better online. Staff were great, location was great, pool area could have more shaded areas, and drinks prices were too expensive given its below par quality. Breakfast was average, typical buffet. Not sure if this hotel warrants a four star rating???",U Paasha Seminyak
1753,"Central location, good service, spacious room",40,May 2016,"The hotel location is very convenient as it's within walking distance from the restaurants, cafes and fashion boutiques.
The hotel room is spacious, but my husband and I are disappointed as the balcony is very small and does not have a view of Seminyak (we are on Level 2). Also, the bathroom is showing signs of wear and tear. However, the bathroom is spacious as it has two basins. Would be nicer if there was a bathtub too.
We love the large mirror wardrobe in the hotel room.
Breakfast is disappointing because the variety is limited and everyday serves exactly the same dishes. I did enjoy the waffles very much though. You can request for hard boiled eggs or scrambled eggs.
Overall, we are pleased with the service by the hotel staff. They are nice, attentive and friendly. If you are looking for a hotel in central location and easy to get around, this hotel is definitely a great choice for you.
Lastly, I've to mention that one plus point about this hotel is that they allow you to check-out at the same time as the day that you check-in. For our case, we check-in at around 8pm on our first day of stay, and we didn't check out until 4pm on our last day of stay (we could have checked out at 8pm instead if we wanted to).",U Paasha Seminyak
1754,Great Spot,40,April 2016,"Big rooms , very friendly staff . Great breakfast . Rooms are showing there age , worn fixtures , tiles and grout , mirrors all patchy . The bathrooms could do with a tidy up. The roof top pool is very chilled and quiet , not so kid friendly .The hotel is in a fantastic spot right in the middle of Eats St , you can walk to all the great restaurants. Great place for younger people.",U Paasha Seminyak
1755,Great service,40,April 2016,"I only got to spend one night here and while it got off to a disruptive start due to a room issue, the staff were more then accommodating and couldn't do enough for me. One male staff member who's name starts with a D (Sorry) was professional friendly and polite .
Rooms are very clean and spacious. The roof top pool is beautiful, and the cocktails were the best I had in Bali. Breakfast was also a real treat in the morning. I had the pleasure of meeting the general manger who was welcoming, interactive, friendly and certainly professional. I have no hesitation in recommending this lovely, perfectly positioned hotel in the heart of Seminyak.🙋🏼",U Paasha Seminyak
1756,Loved our stay,50,May 2016,"Loved our stay here, room is very large, nice modern bathroom, bed and pillows super comfy. Loved spending our mornings by the rooftop pool. Location is perfect you are right in the middle of a lot of the restaurants. Breakfast buffet was nice and offered a lot of selection and free coffee and they have soy milk!!! Something I struggled to get at other hotels. We wish we had booked our last 4 days in Seminyak here. Only thing that caught us off guard was we booked through bookings.com and thought we had paid for the room but on arrival was told it wasn't paid for, my mistake but it was a bit confusing. Other than that little mix up absolutely loved staying here and will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1757,Absolutely recommended,50,May 2016,"Great hotel: big rooms, very good service, location is perfect as at the center of seminyak and allows you to walk both to the beach, or shopping or to bars and restaurants. Exceptional pool at the roof top, just the restaurant is not at the same level in terms of location , but we didn't try the food .Amazing breakfast. We were 2 girls and we absolutely loved it !",U Paasha Seminyak
1758,Great location in the heart of Seminyak,40,April 2016,"Have visited Seminyak and U Paasha a number of times now. What we love about this hotel over many others is the service, the pool and the great location. The pool is rooftop (no mosquitos, plenty of sun and shade and views of the ocean. Gets a nice little breeze in the afternoon as well. The rooms a re spacious, clean and all the rooms we have stayed in very quiet. Have the best King Koil pillows that we have ever experienced, so much we tried to buy the, at the hotel.

Central to eat street, Mamasan, Sarong, Bumbu and close to coffee havens in Revolver, Coffee Library and Sisterfields.

Very happy also with the Buffett breakfast which never disaapoints.",U Paasha Seminyak
1759,"Modern rooms, great pool.",40,April 2016,"The hotel features modern rooms, a great rooftop pool, a good breakfast with complimentary specialty coffees, and a central location. A bit far from the beach, but all in all a good property. The staff were friendly as well, and check-in and check-out were quick and easy.",U Paasha Seminyak
1760,Perfect for solo travel,50,March 2016,"The hotel is right in the heart of Seminyak, minutes walk from Seminyak square. I stayed at the hotel on my own for 8 days and always felt safe! The hotel itself is beautiful, the only critique is that there is no elevator to get to the lobby, and my suitcase was very heavy! I would have liked some help to hoist it up the 20 stairs.

Rooms were lovely, rustic style but very spacious. Open bathroom with frosted glass to separate the toilet and shower. Bed was large and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious with a wide range to choose from.

And the best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool!! Amazing view of seminyak and the Seminyak beach. Staff are friendly and there are plenty of beds for guests. I would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1761,Room is yours for 24-hours!,40,April 2016,"Best thing about U Paasha is its 24 hour room occupancy offering - no matter what time you arrive, you have the room for 24hrs from the time of check-in, which means check-out is at your leisure. Great way to save money (and hassle) if you are on your way to somewhere else or have a late flight. Recently stayed here overnight on my way to other accommodation in Bali. Arrived late from the airport (10pm) but was only a short taxi from Denpasar and a quick check-in process had me in my room in no time. The room itself looked exactly like the pictures, very spacious and with all the amenities you need (shower products were divine) and great air-conditioning. Agree with some of the other comments about the cleanliness of the shower but wasn't noticeable enough to complain about. The hotel is on a Main Street but as I was towards the back of the hotel, noise was not an issue and you quite literally have great restaurants, boutiques, markets and convenience stores on your doorstep (don't stay here if you want to be away from the hustle & bustle of Seminyak) . Rooftop pool is excellent and peaceful, the pool itself is so large you have the space to enjoy it alongside other guests. Strong Wi-Fi available throughout the hotel but a bit patchy at the pool. Would be happy to stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1762,Lovely hotel!,40,April 2016,"We stayed here for 6 nights in total.
We arrived at 12ish at night and got checked into room easily and quickly. The room was great.... It was on the 5th floor and was huge, spacious clean! We loved it.
We hadn't had anything to eat on the flight and was hoping to get room service of some sort but nothing was operating at this time so we nipped across to the minimart to get a few snacks to sort our hunger out. Which wasn't a problem.
We hadn't realised when we booked the hotel that it was on such a busy street. I knew there was lots going on in Seminyak but really hadn't realised our hotel was in the middle of it all. Our room was on the very front of the hotel so we got no sleep that night because of the taxis beep at everything and you could just hear general traffic noise and people out and about.
In the morning I asked at reception if they could move us (we still asked to be on the 5th floor but at the back). The lady on the desk was extremely helpful and said that she would have me in a new room by 3pm so I was happy with that.
We got our new room way before 3pm and it was a great room (not quite as big as our first room) there was no noise! You wouldn't believe we were in the same place!!
Once we were moved here we had a fantastic time in the hotel!
I even had room service one evening! (Which arrived so quickly!)
The breakfast was great and with my fiancée being gluten free, they always had gluten free bread for him in the morning.
The rooftop pool is a little bit of luxury and calm out the way of the madness of the street down below... The staff were great at looking after us and food and drink (cocktails!! ) were delicious!
I used the gym a few times and this also had good facilities!
Overall I think this hotel is a fantastic base to be in Seminyak.. Right in the heart of restaurants and bars (all the restaurants we ate in were amazing) but maybe just a little further to the beach than I realised when I booked. (I'd say 2 mins in a taxi and maybe 10-15 mins walking) but I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants to be close to the action but who can also escape from it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1763,Better hotels available,30,April 2016,"I should first point out that whilst I enjoyed staying at this hotel I had some major gripes with it as well.

I was given a room located next to an air conditioning exhaust which made sleeping akin to lying next to a aeroplane at night. In their defence the noise came from a neighbouring property. Thankfully, upon complaint I was given a new room. Noise generally is a common problem at U Pashaa. Getting a peaceful, undisturbed sleep here is unlikely. The air-conditioning for one is extremely noisy, I'm not sure how more guests haven't complained about this as it's common in every room.

Whilst the rooms and bathrooms are spacious, they look and feel kind of grotty. Shower grime on the glass and stains present on the floor, tiles and walls. These make the hotel feel more indicative of a 3-star hotel rather than a 4-star. The same is true of the pool and the general look of the hotel, it feels very 'used' and in need of a vigorous cosmetic clean. The staff are on the whole friendly and courteous, however they're missing the charm and politeness of more premium Balinese hotels.

On the positive side; the location is awesome, very close to Seminyak square, popular restaurants and the ocean. The hotel offers an abundant breakfast and the facilities are generally good.",U Paasha Seminyak
1764,"ROOFTOP BBQ & POOL - central location on "" eat street """,50,April 2016,"Room 501. convenient to rooftop pool and lift. Recommend rooftop BBQ many different types of food and theme nights , great executive chef , hotel in central location , wifi , free pickup / drop to airport , all day anywhere breakfast and a really big plus ( ALTHOUGH NOT VERY WELL ADVERTISED ) is the 24 hour checkout - it can save u a nights accommodation !!",U Paasha Seminyak
1765,Amazing hotel and very central,50,October 2015,"I've stayed in U Paasha on a number of occasions and am sure I will stay again soon. The hotel is great for lone travellers as it is very central in the heart of Eat Street with boutiques and shops all round. The rooms are huge, modern and comfortable. The 24-hour check-in and all-day breakfast policy is a life saver, especially when travelling in from Dubai on a night flight and landing in the early hours then flying out at midnight. The rooftop pool is amazing and the waiter (forgotten his name, but always seems to be the same guy) is great!

The only thing I can fault is that I had an allergic reaction while staying at the hotel (no idea what caused it and obviously not their fault), however on their price list they charge holidaymakers a lot more than locals for the same service. When I informed the hotel manager they said they would look into this and get the policy amended.

So overall I would say I've had a few great stays here and will be back.

TIP: book a room on a higher floor and away from the road and facing the sunset (floor 3 or 5 - there is not a 4th floor, and the higher odd numbers)",U Paasha Seminyak
1766,A little haven in the heart of Seminyak,40,April 2016,"My family and I stayed in U Paasha for 3 nights. What i find most beneficial is their 24-hr room usage policy. I believe that this makes U Paasha truly unique. We were upgraded to a bigger suite upon arrival and we were truly pleased that the room was really delightful and immaculate. Room was huge and i really appreciated the soft lightings in the room, creating a relaxing ambience after a tiring day out venturing the endless streets..
Breakfast was superb! I am a frequent traveller to Bali and in all the hotels i've stayed with, U Paasha's breakfast is the best and most satisfying i've had! There was a good selection of food - and most importantly, the food was delicious. No point having a massive variety but compromising on taste. There is a pancake/crepe counter where the staff makes a fresh batch upon order. The coffee was also good. U could order any type of coffee and the servers will always have a smile on their faces while serving you.
The rooftop pool - superb! My 4 year old girl had the best time there. The pool staff and the guys at the rooftop bar were very polite and gracious.
After checking out of the hotel, we spent some time at the rooftop bar again while killing time waiting for our night flight. We were very delighted to have been acquainted with Pak Ode from the bar. He was very soft-spoken and made us feel very welcomed.
We will definitely stay with U Paasha again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1767,Awesome Breakfast & Service,50,May 2015,"We loved our stay at U Paasha although definitely also recommend spending a few nights at a beach front resort somewhere, we stayed near Legian for a few nights in a cheaper beach front resort and then U Paasha for a few. Good to experience both sides of Seminyak. The beach/legian/kuta area and then the more upmarket area which is where U Paasha was.

U Paasha was luxury. Amazing breakfast (best I have had!) and really nice rooms. Great pool and service around the pool. Excellent location for shopping and all the main Seminyak bars and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1768,Highly recommended!,50,April 2016,"Perfect location. Stayed at room 101 (right next to the reception and dining area), but there's no noise at all. Big room, nicely decorated. Flexible hour of check-in and check-out. Great swimming pool at the rooftop. Friendly staff. Totally worth it!",U Paasha Seminyak
1769,"Convenient location, Large bedroom, Lovely staff!",50,April 2016,"We (mum, dad and 8 y.o) stayed at U Paasha for 8 nights.
Location: Great. 24/7 mini mart right in the front of the hotel. Many nice restaurants on the same street. Various types of shops (both Boutiques and cheap market style) and Seminyak Village walking distance.

Room: Very spacious and clean. Good view from where we stayed (5th floor)

Extra: We arrived at the hotel about 2am in the morning on the first day, and we left the hotel about midnight on the last day. They offer flexible check-in and check-out time so that saved us $$$.

Breakfast: Great range - both Western and Asian styles food available. Loved daily fresh juice.

Rooftop bar: Range of cocktails available. View was lovely. If you upgrade your room to 5th floor, you will be invited to 6-7:30 cocktail hours (we tried to go through all cocktails but unsuccessful). They also have lovely buffet dinner on some nights.

Staff: Absolutely lovely staff. Nothing was impossible if you ask. Everyone was happy to assist us with any queries - with always BIG SMILES on their face.

Thank you for helping us to make our holiday a lovely one. You have very nice staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
1770,"Did the job, great location",40,April 2016,"Adequate hotel for what we needed.
Positives- big rooms, great air con, included breakfast(waffles/pancakes/omelettes to order, hot/ cold western and Indonesian food, pastries, coffee), roof top pool, good value overall. Perfect location for eat street (Seminyak square).
Negatives- dated bathrooms that due to age just seemed a bit unclean- cracked tiles etc. During the stay one of the lifts broke down and guests got stuck in there- in the hotels defence, the staff moved as quick as they could to get them out.
Overall would be happy to stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1771,Great location and Big Size rooms,40,April 2016,"The location in Seminyak is perfect, directly in the middle of Jl Kayu Ayu where all the hype is happening. Just accros is a Mini Mart, very convinient. and around us are many cool shops and restaurants. We liked the room, it was big and modern, although the view isn't really jaw dropping. We rented a car and thought the basement was spacious and would accomodate plenty of cars. the only thing that we didn't like about the hotel was the breakfast. The taste was really off. the cereal had 2 jugs of milk and were both empty. The eggs at the egg station were dissapointing. I think they must consider a revolution with the kitchen team. But if you are planning to stay here you might get the room without breakfast and just walk 5 mins down the street to Sisterfields. There you will be very happy with the breakfast!",U Paasha Seminyak
1772,Great!,40,April 2016,"Love this hotel! Staff are friendly and nice, the rooms are huge and allow you to feel really relaxed and if you were at home. Rooftop pool is absolutely lovely! Especially if you looking to get a good tan. Breakfast is what you would expect , a good variety with some dishes changing daily. Perfectly centred in seminyak and yet no noise issues in our bedroom ( stayed on the 3rd floor). Would definitely come back again. Only wished they had a bath!",U Paasha Seminyak
1773,Exallent Hotel,50,March 2016,"Loved this hotel, it is central near all the bars and restaurants and very close to Seminyak Village shopping centre. The staff are very friendly and the roof top pool was lovely, the staff bring complimentary nibbles throughout the day which I think is a nice touch. Very good cocktails, especially at happy hour! Breakfast is very good at this hotel, I was quite impressed. My room was on the first floor and it was huge and very clean, although I could hear people coming in from their nights out. Loved U-Paasha I would definitely recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1774,This place is GREAT,50,March 2016,Loved the location... Right on eat street and a walk to all the must eats. Loved the roof top pool and loved the roof top staff so helpful and happy. The room was huge had the odd smell that an opened style bathroom in Bali will attract. Great Barista at breakfast who makes takeaway coffees. The views from the pool and the sunsets were super. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,U Paasha Seminyak
1775,Great boutique hotel,50,April 2016,"Loved the U Paasha hotel. The rooms are huge, the decor is splendid. Breakfast is diversified.
Service is very friendly very helpful in booking tours with drivers. Great location in the middle of the action but very quiet. Pool on rooftop is very nice. Bed are very comfortable.",U Paasha Seminyak
1776,Awesome place!,50,March 2016,"Great facilites, nice and clean room and yummy breakfast. We stayed here for a couple of days in march and loved it! Spacious rooms with everything you need. Breakfast was included in the morning with very attentive staff. Would stay here again and recommend it to my friends",U Paasha Seminyak
1777,Rooftop radiance,50,March 2016,"The U Paasha hotel was a fantastic hotel with a wonderful rooftop pool. Many lounge beds and couches with a view of the ocean, palm trees and existing buildings. The calmness and relaxation I experienced from this pool was priceless. The position of the hotel was smack bang right across the road of restaurants, bars, cafes, massages and shopping. What a treat so close to everything and you just have to cross the road and your back home again. Fantastic hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
1778,Pleasantly Surprised,40,March 2016,Staying here right now and it's been a great experience from the start. Check in easy and pain free. Welcome drinks on arrival at the rooftop bar. The pool is amazing. The gym is better than average in this price range. Staff very helpful. The location is perfect. Located across the street and just between Chandi's and Cafe Bali. Rooms actually look like the photos on the website.,U Paasha Seminyak
1779,"Central location on Seminyak's Eat Street, with huge rooms",30,March 2016,"The main draw of this property for us was the location. We wanted to be in the center of it all so we are able to walk anywhere in Seminyak. With its reasonable price point, U Paasha fit the bill. The rooms are very spacious, by any standard, and delightfully furnished, although it's the wear is starting to be visible. The central pool is a decent size and you can catch a clear view of Seminyak's famous sunsets. The lobby is located on a higher level, and there is one central stairs, but the elevator from the lower level is located clear around the back so access is a bit of an issue for diffable travelers. The staff was helpful, however, always ask if something costs extra, just to avoid misunderstandings. Just down the street is another similar property called IZE Seminyak, but I believe the rooms are much smaller there. Overall, recommended for mid-range travelers looking for a no-frills accommodation in central Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1780,Lively location and great Foody Area,50,March 2016,"I could not take staying in the atmosphere of Kuta or Legion once more! One last attempt at peace in Bali central and U Paasha, Seminyak hit the spot. The hotel rooms are light, spacious and very comfortable (although next time I will upgrade to a Bath - and that would be perfect). The bed and pillows are a dream (I pleaded to buy their
Goose Down pillow and I appreciate the effort find two for me to purchase). The staff are helpful and cheerful. The Rooftop pool was breathtaking, although a lot of guests standing around drinking in the pool - so it's really difficult to get a decent lap swim, at the time I was there end of March.
The Breakfast was great and I especially appreciated the freshly juiced herbs, greens, ginger etc. for a really healthy shot in the morning.
I would returnto the U Paasha again as the position is so convenient to really good cafes and restaurants, we loved Char Char over the road upstairs - it was memorable.",U Paasha Seminyak
1781,Ok on sale but not worth full price!,20,March 2016,I would not stay here again. Great location and pool and whilst the hotel is modern and the foyer beautiful the rooms are not cleaned to a very high standard. There was quite a bit of mould in the shower and toilet area and stains on the bed head and couch. The same staff member who checked us in and and out was not very friendly and welcoming. Our friends travelling with us had to request housekeeping upon arrival as their room was visibly filthy and no alternate rooms were available. Next time we will definately stay elsewhere.,U Paasha Seminyak
1782,Great location to explore Seminyak,40,March 2016,"This was our first trip to Seminyak and we were really pleased and surprised when we arrived at U Paasha. We got a great deal for our room - it was huge, quiet and on the top floor so had nice views. The shower/toilet area in the room was a little strange but that was the only thing that let the place down. The rooftop pool is a great place to spend an afternoon. Location wise it's in the middle of plenty of restaurants, bars and shops and only a short walk to the beach. We would definitely return!",U Paasha Seminyak
1783,Convenient location,50,March 2016,"This hotel ticked every box. Rooms were spacious and clean. Supplies were topped every day. Rooftop pool and bar absolutely beautiful looking 360degrees over Seminyak. Breakfast was plentiful and had a huge selection that even the fussiest of people could choose from. This hotel
Is in the heart of all restaurants and bars and a 10 minute walk to the beach. The staff were very helpful and friendly. There is absolutely nothing negative about this place. A special thank you to Deta, our host for looking after us. We will definitely stay here again. Thanks for everything.",U Paasha Seminyak
1784,All a tourist needs in reasonable price,40,March 2016,"In a very good location with warm and friendly lobby , the room was large and clean and all needs were available in the room but with simple decoration .
Staffs were really friendly and helpful in introducing area ,beaches , and what we needed .
Nice breakfast were served 7 to 11 .
Memorable pool area with great cocktails in roof top , specially at sunset time .",U Paasha Seminyak
1785,Needs Maintenance,20,March 2016,"Stayed here for 9 nights, slow check in. Rooms are large but unfortunately it smelt like mould. Bed was comfy, poor shower pressure. Wore thongs in shower. The Buffet breakfast was average, not a large variety and didn't change much from day to day. The pool deck had loose and protruding nails, one lady actually fell through the deck. The pool water was like a warm bath. The service at the pool was very slow, 25 min wait for a cocktail. Great central location close to restaurants and Bars.",U Paasha Seminyak
1786,Perfect location,40,March 2016,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the UPaasha recently. The location is perfect if you want to walk to many good restaurants in Seminyak area. No hassle with waiting in taxis. The hotel is modern and the rooms are plus sizes. Breakfast was very fulfilling. We were on the 5th floor, unfortunately the free wifi was non existent. The staff were very welcoming and efficient, I would not hesitate to stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1787,Very disappointed,20,March 2016,"Dirty room, mouldy shower, leaking aircon, balcony overlooking rubbish dump, bath water cloudy pool, poor service, basic breakfast, smelly hotel.
Much nicer places to stay in Seminyak. I wanted to change hotels after one night, I wish I had",U Paasha Seminyak
1788,Such a delight place to spend a vacay,50,March 2016,"We wanted a hotel right at the heart of Seminyak yet walking distance to the beach. This hotel perfectly fits our criteria.
U Paasha Seminyak has very good costumer service, staffs are attentive and sensitive to our needs. They always find ways on how to cater our requests. They even made an extra effort to put rose petals on our bed on our 1st night and a very nice ""towel art"" on the next night. Such a simple gesture but for us it matters esp coming from a whole sunny day tour.
Earlier today on our way to the airport, we failed to notice that we left our camera bag at the lobby. We got worried coz we might have lost it. We called the front office and thank goodness, our bag is still there. They suggested to bring it to the airport for us but we politely refused coz our friendly and reliable tour driver Putu volunteered to get it for us. Such a great relief! THANK YOU U PAASHA.

Room is basic but huge for 2 pax - ours is 1 king bed and 2 sofas with lots of pillows. The Rest Room and shower room is also big, you can literally put another bed on it. :-)
Buffet breakfast is served, with unlimited guormet coffee(drink all you want cappuccino, macchiatto, mocha, etc.. --prepared according to your liking). Breakfast is more on western and a lil bit of indonesian. Sooo yummmy 😍😍😍.
Rooftop pool is amazing.

You can also use their bicycle for FREE.",U Paasha Seminyak
1789,Best villa/hotel I've ever stayed in,50,March 2016,"Seminyak Icon is hands down the best hotel/villa that either of us have ever stopped in. We spent 5 nights here for a romantic getaway and to celebrate my birthday. The villa was exactly like the photos on the website. Absolutely stunning and everything was so clean. The staff came in several times a day to tidy and replace towels, they also replenished and relit mosquito coils and sprayed the rooms, each room had air con and the bed was the nicest i’ve slept in! The staff were amazing too. They brought in a cake for me on my Birthday (they would only have known from my DOB on the booking). They had a car which dropped us into Seminyak Square whenever we asked, took us to restaurants when we asked, arranged taxis whenever we needed to go anywhere else, made restaurant bookings for us when asked. The restaurant and room service available was fantastic, wonderful food. Free breakfast delivered to our villa everyday and also free afternoon tea everyday. They also had a wonderful spa. Our whole bill for the 5 nights (this is extra stuff only that we requested) totalled $120. About $80 of that was spa treatments and the rest was a couple of dinners we had in the room.

I really highly recommend it. If we had to pick a fault then the only thing we can think of is that there wasn’t an iron and ironing board however they had a cheap full laundry service anyway. It was truly wonderful.",U Paasha Seminyak
1790,9 days trip in bali,40,March 2016,"Bali is the island and this hotel is a very nice place, here everything is really done to please you. The location is full of nice place around like Urchin restaurant, la favelas, cafe Bali etc ... Lots of shop and club where u can have drinks and peace. Balinese are probably not far than the best welcoming people in this worls",U Paasha Seminyak
1791,What a gem!,50,March 2016,"Fabulous hotel from start to finish!
Suite with view incl free transport to/from airport and breakfast(which you can request as room service for free). Massive room.
Room was located on 5th floor near the rooftop pool. Can't speak highly enough of the pool - plenty of beach chairs / umbrellas, attentive staff and views to the ocean. Sunset drinks at the bar there are a must.
The 24hr checkin / out policy is awesome.

Fantastic experience - we're already planning the next trip back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1792,Amazing,50,March 2016,"Deffintly a most hotel to stay in at Seminyak. Right on the street with all the best restaurants and shops! Service was perfect! Breakfast good and the pool was amazing especially to sit up at night! Recommend to families, couples and friends.",U Paasha Seminyak
1793,Perfect Seminyak location,40,February 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights in February. The staff are super lovely, and brekki was delicious with espresso coffee included. Win! The rooms are lovely and spacious, however ask for a room facing west. Our room facing east looked over somewhat of a rubbish tip. Wifi was quick and easy. U Passha's location is great; a quick walk to all of the amazing restaurants nearby. The rooftop pool area can get busy so snag a spot early, or head there in the evening for the beautiful sunset.

Have booked to stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1794,Delightful,50,March 2016,"The staff are lovely and very helpful. Our room was attended to twice daily, bottled water always topped up and free wifi. You can spend hours on the rooftop pool and room service was great. Excellent location in the heart of Seminyak. We will be coming here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1795,Great Stay,50,March 2016,"We stayed here for a week over the Nyepi period. Huge hotel room with great aircon and friendly staff. A very slight odour in the bathroom however it didn't really bother me and the rooms were cleaned thoroughly each day... most likely and indonesian plumbing issue.

Great rooftop pool and strong cocktails. Also had a well-equipped gym and cardio room. The massages we got were good but a bit overpriced.

Amazing bed... it is so good!",U Paasha Seminyak
1796,Amazing value for money and spacious hotel,50,March 2016,"This hotel was perfect for us and we only chanced upon it by needing to stay one more night in Seminyak due to the national 'quiet day'. It was incredible from start to finish and despite being cheaper than the previous hotel we booked (The L Hotel) was a superior stay hands down. The roof top pool was amazing, the location for shopping was great, the buffet breakfast was out of this world and the check in were kind, courteous and generous. It was a 5 out of 5 stay from start to finish and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. You can tend to think that the more you pay the better the quality of your hotel but as evidenced here, that's not always the case. The hotel gym was fabulous too. Thanks very much, we'll be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1797,"Good location, nice and huge room and clean",40,July 2015,"3rd time staying in this hotel.. Good location, huge and clean room. But the water is too small.. And sometimes the air con is not cool enough even we already set the lowest temperature with high fan. The hotel need to fix these 2 problems.. Other than that is perfect",U Paasha Seminyak
1798,Everything you could wish for,50,March 2016,"We moved to this hotel from a villa in Seminyak as the villa was quite isolated with not much to do around there (especially during 'silent day' in Bali). Couldn't have been happier with the outcome.

Super friendly and respectful staff. Amazing rooftop pool and bar. Everything you could possibly want in the room. Spacious, clean, quiet and modern. Great location, next to lots of shops and amenities. They even supplied an adaptor to fit the plug for appliances that don't use the local plug. The only possible area for improvement would be to get darker/longer curtains that doesn't let so much light in.",U Paasha Seminyak
1799,2nd time,50,March 2016,"Love U Paasha! 2nd year staying here. Great staff and facilities, good bang for buck. People who complain obviously don't understand a tropical country. With humidity comes smell and moisture! Always recommend! Good breakfast buffet and great roof top meals. Also very accommodating for Nyepi, the hindu new year where they celebrate a day of absolute silence.",U Paasha Seminyak
1800,Good location. Huge room,40,April 2015,"Located in the heart of Seminyak, where all the cool shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars.
Big spacious designy room with nice amenities.
Good variety of breakfast buffet. There's a medium size gym with good equipments, not many people most of the time. Decent size swimming pool on the roof top.
Very interesting small art collection in the hallway.",U Paasha Seminyak
1801,great cheap place,40,February 2016,really friendly staff made our family feel welcome. Great roof top pool with cheap drinks for happy hour. Nice size rooms for a great price. really comfy bed and pillows which is a bonus. Food was pretty average but your so central you could walk across the road for some awesome eats,U Paasha Seminyak
1802,Beautiful rooms!,40,February 2016,"Only positive comments can be told about this place.

The staff are super friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable, the roof top pool is an awesome place to chill and the location is perfect, restaurants and shops at your doorstep.

The rooms are beautifully designed, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. If you stay in a standard room like we did, the bathroom is open and the toilet ""door"" will surely take your relationship to the next level. The buffet breakfast will satisfy everyone, from fresh fruit to noodles, fresh juices and barista coffee.

We organised airport pick up through the hotel and they were waiting for us after a long delayed flight. Check in and check out was a smooth process. The best thing about this place is their 24hr rooms, which means your check out time is the same as your check in.

We will definitely stay here again :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1803,Amazing from beginning to end,50,December 2015,"What a fantastic hotel.

We stayed here for 9 nights with a bug group of family.

Pool was the hot spot. We went every day to chill out with a cocktail.

The staff went above and beyond with 2 stand outs who made time to chat to us all the time and bring our empty hands a drink.

We stayed in the penthouse over Christmas and new years. Incredible room with a luxury feel.

BEST location - you can step out of the hotel to rows of shops, markets and food.

Will be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1804,Exceeded expectations,50,February 2016,"Considering the price of the room, this was a five star experience. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the area was very spacious. The service was also fast and attentive.

The most impressive part of our experience was when we missed breakfast and ordered room service instead. At check out they told us that if you miss breakfast you can just send it to your room and it's included in the price of the room.

I have never heard of this happening in any hotel in the world. We were so impressed that we downloaded trip advisor app just to talk about it.

Also, transportation from and to the airport was included in the price.

I'll come back for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
1805,Good hotel for the price you pay,40,February 2016,I usually stay in a villa or have stayed in the Alila or Kayana so it's hard to compare a 3 star with 5 stars. For the price you are paying here it is quite good. A few bad points were that our room on the western side (room 107) was right next door to a villa which apparently gets used by Korean agents. The ladies/girls screeched and screamed at night until around 2am like little school girls which kept us awake. We spoke to reception in the morning and they told us we should have called them as this is apparently an ongoing problem and they said they usually phone them and tell them to keep the noise down. We were then moved to another room on the opposite side of the hotel (room 516) and while it was a much nicer light filled room we completely lost wifi. So for 3 days I have been sitting out in the corridor to check emails or do anything on the net. They said they fixed it but it hasn't worked. A bit annoying. However for the price and location I would definitely stay here again.,U Paasha Seminyak
1806,Christmas New Year getaway,50,December 2015,"We booked from Christmas Day to New Years day.
Great place to stay and we had a ball.
This was our second time and the staff were great as usual.
The poolside bar staff are so accommodating and friendly and remembered us as soon as we walked into the poolside bar area.
Close to good restaurants and bars, short walk to the beach and no hassle what so ever.
Going back this year in May and will definitely be staying there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1807,Good hotel Great Location,40,February 2016,"We stayed here in February in a second floor room. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable, the only let down being the lack of detail focused housekeeping.

This hotel features a roof top swimming pool, which is great in so many ways, but, it needs some shade, sure there are lots of sun loungers and umbrellas, but the Umbrellas are not that good before about 11:00 AM and after 2:30 PM, some nice Cantilevered Umbrellas of at least ones that have a tilt facility would be much better. Some shade sails over the pool area would also be useful, just so that it is possible to sit in the pool and have some shade.

The Hotel has a great Gym and this has a view to the East.

The Pool bar is great and has a wonderful view over Seminyak to the sea, so perfect for watching the sunset. Drinks prices are reasonable as is food; I do recommend the Barbecue which is on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Breakfast is very good; my wife believes this to be the best breakfast we have ever had in Bali. That is true praise indeed. Pretty well all tastes and nationalities are catered for.

Staff. In Bali most places have smiling happy helpful staff, so we just begin to expect it, however the staff at U Paasha for the most part are a cut above, I am sorry that I cannot recall names as I should mention specific people. from the security guard on the front carpark to Raca in the pool bar not forgetting reception, breakfast and all the other pool bar staff thank you for making our holiday great. I will be back and this time I will make a note of names (honest).

Location, location, location; step out on to the street and whatever you desire to eat is there within a very short walk and if the poser venues of KDT and Potato Head are your thing well they are not very far away, walkable or a cheap taxi ride.

What could make this an even better experience, a small drying rack for the balcony would be very nice and maybe take the south end of the pool bar and but some comfortable seating, this would give guests somewhere to sit that is in the shade and would encourage them to stay just a little bit longer, so I am sure that would pay for itself very quickly.",U Paasha Seminyak
1808,Bookings come with a price!,20,February 2016,"Everything with the hotel to begin with was nice, despite the not so new spotty mirror and dripping air conditioner..
Until we checked out - on check out we asked the hotel to book us a boat to Gili T - which they happily did. They got us the 'price' to which we agreed - on the buss we discovered that others booking from other agents had ALL paid around 1/3 the price. We raised the issue with the booking company who said they would do the price depending on our 'agent' - we replied the hotel booked - the only conclusion that can be drawn was that the hotel made commission from the transaction. In any event it left a very sour taste in our mouth, and I believe it's certainly the hotels responsibility to ensure when sourcing activities that their guest is not stupidly ripped off.",U Paasha Seminyak
1809,smelly room and bad service,20,February 2016,"Nothing special here, staff didn't seem like they care and were rude. Our room was on the first floor and it smelt bad. Furniture in room was old and not very clean. Won't be staying here again ... breakfast was nothing special either.",U Paasha Seminyak
1810,"Clean, modern and fantastic location!",50,February 2016,"Stayed at U Paasha for 5 nights. Accomodation overall was supberb. My friend and I really appreciated the clean, simple style of the hotel and how friendly and helpful the staff were.

- The room had awesome A/C, cleaning service everyday was great, loved the spacious shower, basin area and room. Felt very open and was refreshing to walk into after the heat of Bali outside.

- Cannot fault the rooftop pool. Stunning views, easy access to towels, bathrooms, sunbeds.

- Buffet Breakfast. My friend and I really enjoyed the variety of options. Safe to say we were well fed every morning! Loved the option to order coffee / eggs any way / pancakes / crepes etc..

- Staff were so welcoming. Always had an umbrella available for when it was raining. Always able to answer any questions we had. Always smiling when you say hi!

Thank you U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
1811,Modern luxury in the heart of Seminyak,50,February 2016,"This hotel came highly recommended by a dear friend. Located smack bang in the midst of Jalan Laksmana, U Paasha Hotel is within walking distance to the shopping strips, restaurants and bars the area has to offer.

The architecture is uniquely modern and the rooms are expansive; spacious. If you prefer a quieter room, request to be assigned a room on the higher floors and away from the bustling main road. We were absolutely satisfied with room 322.

The rooftop pool is huge and offers unobstructed views out to the sea on one side and as far as the eyes can see on the other. Perfect for panoramic photographic opportunities. Be sure to pack your sunscreen as it gets quite hot lazing poolside.

The buffet breakfast caters to every tastebud whether your preference is for western or Asian fare.

You won't be disappointed with this establishment.",U Paasha Seminyak
1812,Absolutely Amazing Experience,50,February 2016,"I stayed at Upaasha with my fiancé for 5 nights and could not fault anything. The service we received was first class. The rooms are beautiful, light and airy with a beautiful design. The food was delicious and not expensive at all. Would recommend to anyone@",U Paasha Seminyak
1813,Great location,40,February 2016,"overall pretty good, except there was a slight smell from the bathroom which I see is mentioned in prior reviews. Also, on the last night I was woken by a disturbing noise to then realise there were rats or the likes running around in the ceiling...? I mean I have no doubt that this would be a problem amongst many places of accommodation but it certainly is reason to lower down to a 4 star experience (the two mentioned issues). Lovely roof top pool, great air con in the room - really refreshing and the buffet breakfast was great (service impeccable). Overall, thank you for our stay... just a couple of things which were taking us off guard a little.",U Paasha Seminyak
1814,A great location !,40,January 2016,"This was a excellent hotel to stay at in Seminyak. A very central location that was not loud or noisy once in the hotel.
Moreover, the rooms were very modern in their decorations.
Finally - the breakfast was unreal. Everything you could think of.
And did i mention the staff - very kind, helpful and generous with their time. I will definitely be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1815,Xmas in Bali,50,December 2015,"This hotel is amazing.. the staff are attentive , the rooms are large and the location is right in the centre of Seminyak.
The rooms were cleaned everyday to a high standard and they have a great choice of breakfast options, the pool bars has a great selection of food and cocktails and is the perfect place to relax .
I would highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1816,A little worn out but overall a very good choice for busy Seminyak,40,July 2015,"We stayed in Seminyak for three nights as another stop in our journey through Indonesia. We chose Seminyak as it appeared to be a more tranquil option to nearby Kuta and it didn't disappoint us.

The U Paasha was a good choice, a few hundred meters away from the beach and right in Kayu Aya St, where most of the nicest restaurants (thumbs up for Cafe Bali just across the street) and shops of Seminyak are located.

Our room was BIG, with furniture a little worn out I must say, but overall in good shape. Breakfast was pretty good as was the service. The rooftop pool was just amazing, although a little crowded for my taste.

We were a little concerned about some comments we had read about the rooms having a sewer smell and they turned out to be true, it wasn't really that bad though and it completely went off once we turned the A/C on. Later on we read on the internet that the city has a problem with its sewage system, as it apparently has not developed at the same pace as the city.",U Paasha Seminyak
1817,No 4-stars hotel,10,February 2016,"I honestly don't recommend this place, because of the point of hygiene .It's not normal for 4stars hotel to smell like this in the room...Staff is friendly and nice, the location is good, but the rooms are horrible..I stay 1night instead of 2..I couldn't get more..",U Paasha Seminyak
1818,Location location location,40,January 2016,"One of the highlights of this hotel is definitely the location, right in the middle of everything from restaurants, to shops and the beach. Loved the rooftop pool and the great poolside food and drinks. Very friendly and helpful staff who were always happy to help and very impressed with the size of the room, extremely spacious and comfortable.

Our only negative was our toilet which kept blocking and had to get fixed 3 times which did start to become very frustrating. However, the staff were very helpful with the issue and offered to move our room. Apart from this small mishap a great stay and would definitely stay in this lovely hotel again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1819,3rd time here and im coming back again!,50,February 2016,"I just love this place.
I tried to book a room for my 2 kids (5 and 8) and my partner and I online but it kept coming up as exceeding room limit. After calling the hotel direct for $120 us we got the room with an extra bed and breaky included....fantastic!
Once again the staff are exceptional.. always polite and helpful and thanking us for choosing to stay with them...the security out the front is friendly and help you across the road.
The location is fantastic. Smack bang in seminyaks heart...2 mins down the road from seminyak square, almost directly across from some fantastic restaurants and in amongst fantastic shops.
The rooftop pool is fantastic, the mocktails are delicious! The food is really pretty great for a hotel of mid range.
The rooms are spacious and the bed is so comfortable! I didnt want to leave and will definately be coming back in may for my fourth stay!
Thanks U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
1820,Absolute perfection,50,January 2016,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was absolute perfection. There is not one thing we could fault about the hotel. It is so beautiful and the rooms are so large and amazing!
The buffet breakfast is the best in Bali and staff are incredibly kind and helpful",U Paasha Seminyak
1821,Very good hotel,40,December 2015,"Very good hotel location and amenities - it is amazing to see such places exist at such a low cost. However, other facilities are basic and not much on offer. SO be aware of pitfalls as well, but great overall experience",U Paasha Seminyak
1822,So glad we stayed here!!,50,October 2015,"We couldn't rate Upaasha too highly, we had such a wonderful experience. Staff were courteous and attentive, the hotel room was so wonderfully comfortable. A little wear and tear in the bathroom/toilet tiling but it didn't bother us. The rooftop pool really made the difference and the hotel vibe was just beautiful. I'm already dreaming of returning! We loved the breakfast every day and the location was incredible, we discovered that being in the heart of everything can take so much stress out of the day, what with the traffic and the heat. The beds were huge and bedding so comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend!",U Paasha Seminyak
1823,Incredible hotel in the centre of Seminyak,50,January 2016,"I loved everything about U Paasha. The rooms were large, beautiful and clean. The breakfast in the morning offered extensive choice and was delicious. The staff were very friendly. The location is right near Seminyak Square and offers easy access (by foot or taxi) to all the main attractions and restaurants in Seminyak. Even though the hotel is in the heart of Seminyak, it is extremely quiet and peaceful inside. A small sanctuary.
The rooftop pool is lovely, but my only complaint there is that not enough shade was provided (by way of umbrellas or cabanas), so it was very hot during the day in the sun.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
1824,"The little things, which mean a lot.",50,January 2016,"Dear Devi and Staff,

Thank you for your hospitality and kindness during our stay at U Paasha for our honeymoon.

As mentioned, I do wish we did not have to leave so soon and would have loved to extend our stay.

Your warmth and customer service are world class- and a testament to you and your staff.

We look forward to seeing you all at U Paasha, including Mia and yourself, next time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1825,Great Location and Helpful Staff,40,January 2016,"The hotel is close to restaurants, the beach and tourist destinations such as Motel Mexicola, W Hotel, Potato Head Beach Club. You can walk your way to the mall, the restos and the beach. The staff are very helpful and responsive to the needs of guests. The rooftop pool was not that clean, though. Buffet breakfast gives you choices of both Indonesian cuisine and Western breakfast. Its better to book airport transfer and transport services outside the hotel to avoid extra charges.",U Paasha Seminyak
1826,"Well located, well staffed hotel",50,December 2015,"I stayed here in December with a friend for 3 nights and we shared a room that had two double beds. The room was really nice and on the ground floor. Firstly, the pillows in this hotel are amazing! I had the best sleep in this hotel that I've had in a long time.

The staff are very attentive and always provided quick service.

The rooftop pool was lovely and had enough lounges around for everyone.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, the location is also really good.",U Paasha Seminyak
1827,Holiday Hotel,50,January 2016,"Superb hotel. Highlight of my trip. In the midst of the heat and humidity roaming the busy streets of Seminyak, returning to the cool air conditioned room was a bliss.
Big spacious room, modern and very clean. Every little detail made it all the more pleasant.
Very helpful, very friendly and wonderful staff! Will definitely return and will definitely recommend this place. Loved it!",U Paasha Seminyak
1828,Great Time At The U Paasha.,50,January 2016,"One of the things that ALL hotels should embrace is U Paasha's policy of letting you check out based on the time you check in. So if you check in late, you can check out late. It's based on a 24 hour clock. Hotel was centrally located in Seminyak. Among many restaurants and shops. Yet wasn't overwhelming once you stepped off the property. Not on a beach but a walk to Ku Da Ta- Seminyak beach was just under 15 minutes. Something I did twice during my stay. Even thought it was hard to leave their amazing roof top pool. Had the penthouse room and it was quite large. Wish it was my apartment. Well furnished. Large bathroom, shower, and dressing area. Bath products were quite good as well. Wifi worked fast. Service was beyond excellent in all areas. Could have been a bit more approachable during breakfast. This is the only area where the staff seemed indifferent. Food at breakfast was fantastic and had a large assortment. Was never disappointed. I also liked how pool side they'd occasionally come around with a complimentary snack. Considerate and goes to show the hotel isn't ""cheap"" about certain things. Staff at the pool was always kind and attentive. Would get crowded but there was always an available lounge chair. A hotel knows it was successful when a guest would gladly return. Which is something I would do. Between the rate offered and what I received, felt it worked out well. Devi, the front office manager was my first encounter checking in and so glad for it. She's quite good at her job and represents the quality, professional, and kind service the Balinese are known for. Yes, there's some wear and tear that could be better maintained. Wasn't to pleased with my first room and this was quickly resolved. This care to make the guest happy is a highlight to their service and attention.",U Paasha Seminyak
1829,Fabulous hotel!,50,December 2015,"Hotel is beautiful. Rooms are huge. Staff is great. Food and drinks are all totally fabulous! Restaurants everywhere you look. Try Ultimo across the street and Teatro Gastroteque around the corner. Busy street, but quiet rooms. Mini market across the street. Super rooftop pool, but would benefit from having more loungers and parasols. Close to beach, about a 10 minute walk. Try to get at least one massage treatment: heaven!! And for those of you who want to stay ""connected"", the wi-fi is excellent everywhere, regardless of the number of devices used.",U Paasha Seminyak
1830,Ruined by this terrible terrible smell of sewage which would seep into the back of your throat in the middle of the nigh,10,January 2016,"The moment we arrived in the room I smelt something that smelt like terrible farts. It was pretty awful. Nice and romantic - not!

Anyway we left our room pretty quickly to go check out the pool, which was lovely, have some lunch and then go off exploring. When we came back later the night the smell wasn't so bad, although it was still there.

That night I woke up to a god awful taste in my mouth. The smell had gotten stronger in the night and I could almost taste the faeces smell leaking out of the sewage pipe in the shower. It was disgusting. We called up customer service in the morning and they advised that they would implement a ""treatment"". A guy came into the room and started opening up the vents and sprayed a ton of air freshener inside. He then did something with the shower pipes and asked us to wait. At that point I realised this wasn't a new problem - it's been going on for a while. I checked back on previous TripAdvisor reviews and found that other people have experienced the same issue - appalling. We went out for the day and when we returned the smell was mostly gone - the air fresheners had done a decent job, although the smell of air freshener was EXTREMELY strong.

That night I woke up in the middle of the night again with the taste of faeces in the back of my throat. Honestly it is possibly one of the most awful ways to wake up, especially when you're on holiday. I was upset - we not only paid for a decent hotel room, but we were paying a premium as we were staying over New Years Eve. Regular price rooms are normally around $900 HKD, but for NYE it was around $1,600. So it wasn't exactly cheap.

I went down to reception and complained again. They said they would do another treatment. I want to add that at no stage did anyone actually genuinely seem to care, and in fact I felt as if my complaining was making them feel irritated. I asked several times what they planned to do - that a treatment was simply not good enough. I was advised that there were no available rooms at the time and we wouldn't be able to switch until later that night (New Years Eve itself). I explained that simply moving rooms wasn't exactly making up for the fact I woke up to the taste of faeces in my throat, and eventually they agreed to give us one hour of a free massage treatment as compensation. I still wasn't exactly happy - and it's up to you whether you think that compensation is enough. What made me angry is that they knowingly put us into a room that smelt like sewage, despite other guests complaining. In fact when I was talking about this the receptionist ended up not even facing me, and when I asked him if he would be satisfied with a room like this if he waited all year to go on holiday, worked hard to be able to travel overseas and save up cash for a nice room over new years eve - he just turned away and mumbled. I ended up emailing the reservations manager later that day to express my disbelief and disgust with the service - though all I got was a ""Sorry for your inconvenience"" in reply.

Anyway - we moved rooms at 9PM on New Years Eve, which was a total pain as we needed to repack everything, but at least the other room smelt totally normal, so we were overjoyed to say the least. We had the buffet dinner on the rooftop which was decent, nothing too incredible but not bad either. As we arrived every member of staff knew who we were, which room we were in and it felt as if we were the ones in the wrong for complaining about the smell of sewage / faeces in our bedroom. But oh well. The reservations manager eventually came to apologise in person, which was a nice touch, but words don't really mean much when actions don't follow up.

Honestly I would have expected at least a refund on at least one of the nights (we stayed in sewage room for 2) as well as a complimentary massage, or at least an upgrade in our room for the remaining 2 nights - but anyway it would be up to you if you think an hour long massage is compensation enough for your hotel room smelling worse than a uncleaned public toilet in a busy Asian city.

Outside of the sewage crisis, here is my rating for everything else

Massage service: 2/5 - we booked our complimentary massage for 12pm. No one arrived at 12. At 12.10, I called to see what was happening. They had entirely forgotten our booking. Fifteen minutes later, a man came in to bring in two massage tables and by 12.40pm the two ladies had arrived for our massage. I was pretty peeved off as it was our last full day, and we lost almost an hour of daylight waiting for these guys to turn up. The ladies were nice enough, and it clearly wasn't their fault, so we held no grudge against them. They pulled out a few oils to choose from and we lay down. The massage was nice, but I must admit the massage place across the road (Kimberly, if I remember correctly) was a million times better, and about a fraction of the cost. If you go there - try the Shiatsu massage - hands down one of the best massages of my life, and I go often!

Breakfast: 2.5/5 - a great selection of breakfast items, and the flexibility here is great as if you miss breakfast you can order it any time in the day - perfect for people who love to lie in. My biggest gripe with breakfast is that they immediately ask you if you'd like a coffee - but the coffee consistently took 25 minutes to arrive. This means your coffee would arrive after you finished your meal entirely- pretty ridiculous...

The food itself was decent in taste, though the eggs benedict was the best by far. On the last day however, we had breakfast by the pool, and the chef over cooked our eggs and forgot to put any hollandaise on top - a rather crucial element of eggs Benedict. When we pointed this out and asked for the hollandaise, it took about 10 minutes to arrive (still 20 minutes before our coffees did) and the breakfast was cold.

The pool: 3/5 - the pictures look amazing. In reality, the pool is a bit gross. The pool is really really shallow and because of the dark green tiles, the water looks (or is) extremely murky. The water stung our eyes pretty badly when going in as well. On the bright side it was a refreshing dip. Pool staff were very friendly, but the speed of getting any drinks was ridiculous. It seems they would collate the orders of everyone at the pool and then bring them out together, so if you have 30 people and 20 drinks, you'll be waiting a good long time to get your drink. It was however gorgeous to sit by the pool & you can see the sea in the distance. So that makes up for the more negative aspects.

The room- 3.5/5, discounting the smell: The room was nice though quite standard - warehouse conversion type of style, high ceilings, modern and simple decor. The bathroom was quite large and unlike many hotels used frosted glass and had a separate shower and toilet which was nice for privacy. The clock radio provided was a bit useless as it only accepted an iPhone 4, but it would have been a nice touch had they any converter adaptors (they didn't). The basic rooms have a balcony, though the balconies are so narrow there aren't even chairs out on them, which was a bit of a shame, as it would have been nice to sit out there. The light switches in the room are all over the place, so going to bed each night was a fun trial and error process of figuring out which light was connected to which switch.

The location - 4/5 - U Paasha is right in the middle of everything. It's about a 10 minute walk to Seminyak beach and is right inbetween a ton of restaurants. If you like staying somewhere central and hectic, it's a good place for you. There's a 24 hour convenience store right across the hotel and plenty of clothing type shops very close by.

The restaurant food - 2.5/5. We ordered off the menu twice and had the buffet dinner by the pool one night. On the menu it sounded delicious, but in reality it was never incredible, though nor was it bad, but there are plenty of other places to eat nearby, so this wasn't a huge issue. Also all the cocktails we ordered were extremely sweet - though this is Asia, so most places are like that. That included a bloody mary though, and a sweet bloody mary tastes like spicy ketchup with a few teaspoons of sugar. Odd indeed.

The Internet 1/5 - extremely slow majority of the time and didn't work at all by the pool. I ended up just using roaming as half the time I couldn't connect to the wifi.

Overall the hotel ambiance was really nice. Huge high ceilings in the lobby and nice decor and an interesting feel. It's let down by the pool itself, as well as the food and service. It was an extremely busy time for them, so perhaps staff were more stretched over this time, though looking back through other reviews many other people state they had to wait ages for drinks / food.

Would I stay here again? I might actually - but I'd probably try and find somewhere with a nicer pool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1831,Brilliant comfy,50,January 2016,"Central location in busy Seminyak, but quiet inside. Everything is in walking distance, the beach, the restaurants, the market, the shops.Spacious, well designed room ( i stayed in a suite) kept very clean and comfortable. Wifi was speedy, the aircondition is turbo, the only sound a bit annoying was the permanent mechanical air circulation, felt slightly like in an airplane. The staff is very kind, attentive and prompt in communication as well as fullfilling suitable wishes and concerns. The rooftop pool is with salt water, accompanied with great rooftop bar, pure magical view on sunset.the breakfast offered fresh variations of choices on daily basis.i have enjoyed and loved my stay there, and can highly recommend, as it is great value for the price, and am certainly looking forward to come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1832,Luxury hotel in the centre of Seminyak,40,January 2016,"A beautiful hotel on the main strip in Seminyak. Our room was on the third floor. It was large and spacious, but the bathroom was just average. The incredible pool on the rooftop however is what you would stay here for. Breakfast buffet is great, with a range of food. Free yoga is also provided.",U Paasha Seminyak
1833,Amazing!,50,December 2015,"Me and a friend stayed in this hotel for 6 nights over Christmas. We had a fantastic time, the hotel is located in the middle of Seminyak by Seminyak Square and is a 5 minute taxi ride to the beach.

The rooms were large and very comfortable, buffet breakfast was great.

The hotel has a fabulous pool on the rooftop with 360 views, a bar and fabulous views for sunset drinks.

We really enjoyed our stay here!",U Paasha Seminyak
1834,Phenomenal Hotel,50,November 2015,"I loved everything about this hotel. The look, the vibe, the service and the staff were outstanding.
This hotel has a great roof top pool and gym.
The coolest aspect about this place was that breakfast was included but you could choose to either eat it at the buffet or get it to your room any time of day. Check out wasn't restricted to midday either. They let you stay until your flight so I stayed until 6pm, no extra charge.
I can't wait to get back here. Just the best and so worth the price which I think is great for what you get. Thanks for a fantastic stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
1835,Seminyak in style,50,October 2015,"We stayed on the top floor (level 5) at the rear of the hotel. So no road noise at all. I can understand some travelers if at the front of the hotel on a low floor would get some traffic noise. But then this is Bali so that is to be expected.The web sites ask for view preference. All views are of the back yards of other properties. Garden view does not exist. The rooms are huge and beds and showers are amazing. Breakfast is great with a variety of foods to satisfy every taste bud. As everyone mentions the pool and pool staff are exceptional but get there early as it tends to fill up by 10am.
We would definitely recommend this hotel.

1836,Gem of a hotel in Seminyak,50,December 2015,"Amazing location, huge rooms, great service and awesome perks. My husband and I stayed here for our 10th anniversary from 15th to 18th Dec, 2015 and couldn't be happier. We moved to another, more expensive hotel nearby for 2 nights to try it out but we're so disappointed that we came back to U Paasha for our last 2 days in Bali!
Perfect location to explore Seminyak, right in the middle of Seminyak square. You can walk to all the great spots like Ku De Ta (10 mins) and Potato Head (15-20 mins) or just rent a motorbike from any one of the rental places right outside the hotel. Ultimo, Red Carpet, La Favella, Soho (24 hrs diner) are all across and down the street from the hotel.
The Suite was large and spacious and had all the basic amenities one would need. Open design of the bath sink but privacy frosted doors for the toilet and shower. They have a 24 hr check out rule so if you check in late, say 6 pm, your checkout time is 6 pm too. The best part is that if you miss breakfast they will serve it to you anywhere in the hotel till any time. Great linens and super comfortable bed. Room service was very prompt with all requests. Breakfast was excellent with Indonesian and American breakfast options. Excellent selection of American channels if it's a rainy day. Front desk was very helpful in making spa bookings or airline reservations. The pool is gorgeous with a great view.
This hotel can't be beat for the price, location, service and room quality. We will be back for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
1837,Beautiful rooms and facilities,40,December 2015,"First off, location = amazing. You have a street full of shops and restaurant right where the resort is located. Incredibly convenient. There is also a 24 hour mini mart right opposite the hotel. Places like Potato Head and the beach can be a little walk away, but walkable nonetheless.

The suite was incredibly spacious to say the least. Lots of light streaming in, beautiful bathroom and a little mini bar (not complimentary). The bed was really comfy too! Cable TV channels and reliable in-room wifi was available.

Food wise, all I had was the breakfast buffet spread. It's a pretty decent spread, featuring indonesian breakfast dishes as well as international ones. You will not be spoilt for choice, but the variety is more than enough to satisfy you.

Staff is friendly, although not everyone can communicate well in English. This can be a little tricky as I've also encountered front desk staff who had trouble communicating in English. Although no doubt, simple exchanges will not be problem. Otherwise, service is fairly lovely.

The pool at the rooftop is such a gem. You get a view of the rooftops across the town which I'm sure if you stayed around for sunset or sunrise, it should be a delightful experience. Pool and sun beds are well maintained. They also provided sunblock for guest use by the pool which was a really thoughtful amenity.

I would return to U Paasha when I am in Bali again :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1838,Amazing Place,50,November 2015,"The room was clean and airy, choice for breakfast was good, but by far the most amazing thing about this hotel is the 24-hour policy which allows you to checkout (on your departure day) at the same time you checked in. Nice rooftop pool and great location with lots of places to eat nearby",U Paasha Seminyak
1839,A-Mazing!!!,50,December 2015,"My 14 year old daughter & I booked in here very last minute - literally walking in off the street - after the hotel we originally booked was just awful.
From the minute we arrived we found the staff so friendly and helpful.
The rooms are huge and the bathroom area is too. Except 14 year old girls like a little more privacy than the open bathroom style at the U Paasha.
The location is outstanding. Right in the heart of Seminyak & all the fabulous restaurants and shopping.
The pool area is awesome with fabulous staff up there too - particularly the girls but unfortunately I can't remember their names - but they were just delightful & looked after us very well.
Breakfast was great & really appreciated the freshly made green smoothies every morning.
Particularly wonderful for us - we checked in at 7.30 pm and we didn't have to check out until 7.30pm on our day of checkout.
Really loved this hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
1840,"Average, not worth the money",30,December 2015,"We had realistic expectations of this hotel, 4* booked thru booking site $125 per night inc brekky. Room was spacious, although needing some maintenance (shower tap faulty, handle falling off door to balcony) staff very unfriendly to the point of being rude, program called ""u choose"" where you choose the scent of amenities ect, selections were not in room so a waste of time even filling in selections. Welcome note in room, for another guest. Good location, close to restaurants and shopping. Coffee machine provided, but no coffee for machine, curtains with several obvious brown stains.

1842,Cozy spacious and modern style,40,July 2015,"U paasha is a nice hotel in the heart of seminyak. They have a cozy spacious and great design...they have no great view..but they have a natural hand made soap...which smells so good..the staffs are helpful and friendly.

The strenght if this hotel is you can check out precisely 24 hours after you check in. So if you checked in at 5 o clock in the afternoon...you can check out at 5 o clock in the next day. No need to check out in hurry right?

The breakfast is OK. The weakness is..to get to lobby you must take the stairs cos the lift access is from the basement in the back part of the hotel. But still its worthed when you come to your room for rest.",U Paasha Seminyak
1843,Fantastic Accomodation and services,50,December 2015,"This hotel really prioritize on customer's satisfaction.

1844,My Family Vaccation,40,December 2015,"We chose U Paasha for our first part of our one week vacation in Bali. Our Stay with U Paasha was highly satisfying and was worth the cost. Amazing property and good food. Great roof top pool and the staff was amazing too!

Location is the highlight and we have a 24/7 grocery store and 24/7 restaurant (Soho) close by as well as a 24/7 emergency clinic few blocks away with a physician and a dentist on duty with ambulance service. There was also a good pharmacy close by. Its a happening street and colorful. Alibi bar was huge and spacious and very good staff. Provided us with complimentary airport transfers.

Highly recommend this property who is willing to stay within the city!

U Paasha is a vibrant hotel and will recommend my friends and family.

Thank you for looking after us!

The room itself was large but rather basic but large, with a bit of a damp smell though. The best feature of this hotel is the rooftop pool - seriously appreciated during hot afternoons and well maintained.",U Paasha Seminyak
1850,"Great location, friendly service",40,November 2015,"First stay in Seminyak and of course the U Paashar. Not a beach location, probably 10 min walk away but that was OK for us. The rooftop pool was great. The hotel had a relaxed vibe and modern construction. Staff were really helpful. They offered welcome drink vouchers when we arrived.

One night we had the rooftop BBQ. Probably a little pricey but most hotel dinners like this are. They did give us 2 drink vouchers again which compensated a bit. But watch the expiry date on the vouchers. We went to use them the next afternboon and discovered they were actually for the nigh of our dinner only. But when I spoke with the staff about this they replaced those with 2 other vouchers that were valid for the remainder of our stay.

In the middle of many good restaurants but try the authentic warung's rather than only those catering for foreign tourists.

Would definitely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak

1856,Rooftop Pool!!,50,November 2015,"This hotel has a location to rival many Seminyak hotels. You walk out the front and literally have Seminyak at your feet. We loved the rooftop pool with stunning views and sunsets. Now the best part of this hotel is that your check in time is your check out time....I am not kidding you, you check in at 10pm and you check out at 10pm. But it gets better....you get breakfast until 10:30pm. It doesn't matter if you have already been out for breakfast, you can then order it for lunch or dinner...and that still isn't the best of it, you can have your food delivered to your room, the pool, or wherever you want it!

1857,3 plus,30,October 2015,"I firstly like to state that seminyak is not my favourite place in Bali, but was staying with a large group of family and friends. The check in was smooth and eventho several rooms were not ready I do like the 24 hour rolling checkin and out as it work to our advantage when leaving. The rooms are quite large and comfortable with a good hot strong shower. This hotel as a room top pool with bar, the breakfast was just ok but snack meals from the bar were very good. on the ground floor there is another bar where you can watch the ever lasting traffic jams. The staff were pleasant and accomodating. OUr room was on the upper floor as we had already be told that lower rooms suffered from road noice, our view was over a last rubbish dump. Its a bit of a mixed bag.",U Paasha Seminyak
1858,Very average hotel experience - definitely not 4 star,20,October 2015,"Hotel was very average - definitely not 4 star. Bed linen was ready to be thrown out - was frayed at the edges and pillow case had holes in it. Bath towels were no longer white and fresh, but were grey and worn. Limited hot water in room - it would only last long enough for one person to have a hot shower. Reported problem several times to hotel staff, and were told that the hotel has limited hot water capacity. There was often an unpleasant smell pumping into the room through the vents - hotel staff 'solved' problem by spraying room with air freshener. The toilet continuously leaked. The mirrors in the room were rusty - probably a result of humidity, but a problem I've never come across at any other hotel in Bali. The room never felt overly clean - so much so that when we first checked in I had the pleasure of having to dispose of the previous guests toe nail clippings which were still on the floor! The view from the room was awful - so much so that you would avoid spending time on the so called balcony and would prefer to keep the curtains in the room closed.
The rooftop pool is quite warm- not overly refreshing to swim in. It's not really a pool for swimming (not very big or deep) - it's more a pool for standing around and drinking in. Guests are allowed to drink out of glass bottles and smoke in the pool - which I was quite shocked by and found very disappointing.
Some guests may love the location - but it's right in the middle of a very busy area, so it doesn't offer much escape. Breakfast is great (especially the omelettes), but the setting is right next to the very busy street - not overly peaceful.
The service is quite average compared to the usual Bali standards - especially that of management. I've visited Bali on numerous occasions and stayed in a number of different hotels, and overall have had very positive experiences. I can't say this for U Paasha - the overall experience was very disappointing - I would never stay there again, and would not recommend the hotel to others.",U Paasha Seminyak
1859,Holiday,40,September 2015,"This was our first hotel we stayed at on our two week holiday as we had opted for villas, upon arrival we were welcomed by the friendly staff at reception who told us our room was not ready as check out time is 24hrs, as me and my partner had done a lot of sightseeing that day we were not to happy to hear that as we were exhausted and just wanted a shower.They put us in a temporary room which allowed us to rest and wash up, we left to go out for dinner and when we returned we were told our room was ready.U Paasha Hotel is beautiful and clean and the staff are so friendly and so efficient which made your stay in the busy streets of semniyak an enjoyable one.breakfast is yummy with so many different options available.The roof top pool and bar service is relaxing after a long day of site seeing and shopping.",U Paasha Seminyak

1861,Tainted Love,40,April 2015,"So much to like about this place regardless of the foul odour emitting from the drain , I suspect in the bathroom . Would we risk this again by returning & I would have to admit ''yes'' . As the overall experience was brilliant & great value for money .

Location is fantastic if you have come to shop in the designer stores , dine in the multitude of restaurants and just a slow stroll of 10 minutes to Ku De Ta and Seminyak beach .

Rooms were large & spacious with nice amenities , excellent air conditioning . We found our room relatively quiet & well sound proofed but nothing will ever prevent the sound of some other inconsiderate guest slamming the door .

Everyone looks forward to a nice breakfast when on holiday & U Paasha does not disappoint . Fabulous really .

Roof top pool area is condensed , the pool shallow but long , and if you want for sun from sunrise to sunset then it will deliver . The roof top is a great place to catch the sunset or a glimpse of Seminyak beach . The staff are sensational as are there reasonably priced drinks & cocktails . Great value happy hour if you like a cocktail or two .

Sadly there were only 2 bicycles to use at the time of our visit & both had seen better days .

So I reckon the better rooms would be higher up & facing west towards the sea .

Hopefully by the time we return the drainage issue will be sorted .",U Paasha Seminyak

1863,LOCATION!!,50,November 2015,If you want to be in the heart of the vibe that is Seminyak here is your hotel. Very much a cool urban feel I loved staying here. Rooftop Pool makes it less suitable for families but as a single traveller I loved it. Rooms are enormous and well fitted. Not close to the beach but a morning run fixed that. Right on Eat St and down the road from Revolver coffee (the best). great breakfast and having your room 24hr from check in is THE BEST IDEA EVER!! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Thank you Upaasha. I will definitely see you next time I am in Seminyak. Try the Saturday morning Yoga too and the rooftop gym.,U Paasha Seminyak
1864,"Cool, Trendy Hotel in Bali",40,November 2015,"Me and my wife got stuck in Bali due to Volcano. We booked this place last minute from the airport and stayed there for a night.

GOOD:
This is one of the coolest looking hotel lobby with less than USD160 a night.

The overall design of the hotel is very trendy, artistic, and contemporary. I love it.

The room is very spacious and all the furniture look and feel great.

The breakfast is quite good for this price range.

The location is unbeatable if you are into night life. Right in the middle of everything, restaurants, bars, cafes, shops...

BAD:
I killed 3 mosquitoes in the room...

There is NO view and you have to close your curtain if you don't want the local neighbor to look into your room.

UGLY:
I heard there is rate(or something)running inside the AC vent at night, but it was like 2 seconds, it ran away and nothing happened. Maybe it's cos I stayed on the 1st floor with the restaurant/bar.

I would only recommend the budget traveler to stay here and pick the higher floor.",U Paasha Seminyak
1865,amazing Breakfast!!!,40,August 2015,"Firstly arriving at the hotel it captures me as a very well thought out modern hotel cleverly packed into a crowded Seminyak to give the feeling of height with a relaxing feel as soon you step off the hustle of Seminyak main street. Once I entered the bedroom, I was impressed with the spaciousness, massive shower rooms and toilet, double sink (no bath - but I didn't miss it).
They even provided DVDs and adaptors. So we children went back to our room to watch several DVDs while our parents enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop and the bar below.
The rooftop pool also takes you away from the pollution of the town and watched the numerous hot air balloons and kites floating but the downside was the windiness(nippy).
Breakfast - what can I say there was everything! pancakes waffles and eggs Benedict made to order, Balinese, Japanese, chinese but everything was fresh and not overwhelmed with too much choice either.
There is a water container from breakfast available for water anytime.
Staff were extremely helpful and all request was fulfilled promptly!!
Beds- slept like a baby. Even mys sisters extra bed was the same as ours not like other hotels!",U Paasha Seminyak
1866,Consistently great!,50,October 2015,"My daughter and I stayed for 6 nights at U Paasha, it was a return trip for me. This hotel is in a great vantage point, close to restaurants, shopping, nightlife and easy access to tours. The 24 hour check in and out service is amazing and something I wish more hotels offered. The hotel staff are very accommodating and friendly, some remembering me from my last visit which was nice. The room is spacious and has everything you need.. The rooftop pool is amazing, a place we visited twice each day. I may have spoilt my daughter because she now wants to return to U Paasha when she comes back to Bali, she loved it so much, not sure her beer budget allowance would cope though.",U Paasha Seminyak
1867,Don't bother!,10,November 2015,"We arrived to our room to find that it smelt like sewage coming from the toilet which filled the entire room and made you want to throw up, asked for another room to only open up the curtains on the balcony to see around 15 Bali men sitting around it was a scooter hire parking area they were noisy and staring right into our room, asked for another room that smelt fine and no googly eyes could see us thought we were onto a winner when soon after the power went out every 3-5 minutes for around 10 seconds the entire time. The rooftop pool felt dirty and wasn't clear. The breakfast food was not great the cafe Bali across the road was a million times better. The cocktails were good but that's about it. After staying in Bali all over legian/ubud/nusa lembongan/uluwatu ect for two weeks and almost an extra week stuck due to the volcano U pasasha was the only downside to our trip.",U Paasha Seminyak
1868,"Room very clean, flexible timing, great spot!",50,August 2015,"First of all, I'm very impressed with their flexibility for timing and reservation. Staffs are great and super friendly - super helpful in handling my difficult situations. Rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is located at the hot spot but the hotel itself has a nice overall space with great outdoor light and airflow. This is a super good hotel if you are staying around seminyak! Two thumbs up guys.",U Paasha Seminyak
1869,Great Hotel in a great spot,50,October 2015,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights end of October. It was an amazing place! the moment you walk arrive at this hotel you feel the warm welcome from the staff. The check in was simple and smooth and we were in our room in no time...

Room:
It was a simple and clean room with an fantastic king bed it was a very comfortable bed and the best pillows as well.

Breakfast:
Buffet breakfast that you can have at the hotels restaurant or you can have it in your room or by the pool at any time of the day.

Staff:
The staff is what made this hotel. Every time you walk pat someone they will greet you with the biggest smile ever.

The most memorable thing about this hotel is the roof top pool. The views are absolutely amazing. No need to go anywhere for the famous Bali sunset as you an just relax by the pool and watch the amazing sunset!

All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family.

Thank you for a fantastic stay and we will see you again...",U Paasha Seminyak
1870,An Oasis away from all the Bali Craziness,50,September 2015,"U Paasha is a lovely hotel located on the main strip of Seminyak. I was pushing my friend to stay at another hotel however I am glad they stood their ground as I really enjoyed my stay at U Paasha.

The foyer on arrival is striking and beautifully decorated. It is quite dimly lit to set the ambiance however is more than adequate. There is plenty of places to sit and wait. Check In is easy and the staff were all friendly.

The rooms are quite modern and most importantly spacious. I travelled with a friend and we were stayed in the same room in single beds. The room was big enough for us to comfortably share the space. I have read a few comments about the showers and toilet having frosted glass and their concerns about privacy. I have to say this was NOT an issue and the frosted glass gives more than enough privacy.

The water pressure was good and we had plenty of storage space for hanging clothes.

We only ever ate breakfast at the hotel and this was reasonable quality. There was plenty of variety and the quality of the food was more than acceptable. Being located on the main restaurant strip there are plenty of great dining options to get out and explore.

The pool is located on the roof of the hotel and is drenched in beautiful sunlight for most of the day. The pool is a decent size and the pool side service for drinks and food is great and made even better by the super attentive and friendly staff.

The gym is a decent size and has good quality equipment and enough to keep you in shape whilst on you holiday.

One of the reasons we chose this hotel was the fact that it does not have a kids club so it is not as geared towards families as some of the resorts. It meant there were a lot less screaming kids running around.

The other great thing about this place is the 24 hours check in check out. If you check in at 9pm then you don’t need to check out until 9pm the next day this is great especially if you are on late flight which we were.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will most certainly stay here again next trip.",U Paasha Seminyak
1871,"Check out early, won't be back.",20,October 2015,"We booked a 10 night stay after reading the great reviews on TA. We checked out early after only 4 nights and changed hotels. We may have been unlucky and just gotten a bad room, but I can't see how our experience was so vastly different from others as reviewed. The hotel should probably advertise the extra special in room features - mystery stains of varying colours on fabric furniture including bedhead, mould and soap scum stained shower, bathroom fans falling out of ceiling and the water feature off the unusable balcony (we called reception re: this issue and were told it was runoff from the gardeners watering from the rooftop and that it would stop within 5 mins. 24 hours later it was still going.). The 'shower' on the balcony had far better water pressure than the shower in the bathroom. The pool area was quite nice to look at, but the pool itself is shallow (1.1m deep) and the temperature of tepid bath water. Breakfast was average, coffee was terrible, breakfast tables were covered in ants and uncomfortable. Hotel staff were friendly, particularly the security guards out front. Not the worst hotel I've experienced, but bad enough that we didn't want to stay, and certainly won't be going back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1872,"Great service, very nice rooms, nice terrace pool",50,October 2015,"We enjoyed the hotel very much. The room was large, modern and clean. The location of the hotel was very convenient for us as it was near all the shops and restaurants. A bit far from the beach if that is what you are looking for.",U Paasha Seminyak
1873,What a fantastic location!,50,September 2015,"We stayed at U Paasha for the first week of our holiday in Bali. Our flight arrived late at night and our transfer was ready waiting for us, he was a very lovely smiley man and really made us feel welcome in Bali. Our first day we woke up too late for buffet breakfast but with U Paasha's breakfast anytime anywhere policy we enjoyed a spot of brunch in our room before heading to the pool. I really thought that was a nice touch as when you're on holiday you don't want to be setting alarms for breakfast everyday so that did really help us out!
The pool was lovely! A very picture perfect roof top pool, it has a deep(ish) area for swimming and then a shallow area that you can sunbathe half in and half our the water which is much needed in the heat! There were two very lovely young men working up at the pool that I noticed really went out of their way for everyone, they made us feel so very welcome and would assist us with our every need.
U Paasha's location could not be faulted... My dream Seminyak hotel would have been the W retreat but we went there for brunch and actually I much preferred the location of U paasha and for a fraction of the price! There are some amazing restaurants less than a 5 minute walk away and enough shops to keep you going for at least a week, not to mention Seminyak square is opening soon that looks to be a very lovely shopping centre In the heart of Seminyak.
The room is also wonderful, we were on the top floor and had views of the sea.
All in all you can not go wrong with this hotel, the staff are fantastic, food is great and location is perfect. Will be returning on our next visit to Seminyak!",U Paasha Seminyak
1874,Good location if you prefer to be close by restaurants but fails on some issues,30,October 2015,"In my opinion, there are many things that determine whether a property is 4 stars or lower and having good sized rooms in not by itself the only factor. Staff, restaurant, bars, level of maintenance and the care of finishing the rooms all should be considered. At U Paash, the staff are fine, always pleasant; restaurant – well as far as I could tell there was only where breakfast was served and it did not appear to be set for any other service. There is a rooftop b-b-q and bar which I did not attend so I cannot comment on that. There is a bar downstairs which is OK and serves light snacks. The level of maintenance could be improved. The exterior handle of the balcony door in my room was missing and the runners need cleaning as they resist the door from being properly closed. The quality of the trades is not overly high. The light switch in the bathroom for example, had almost as much paint on it as did the walls! Now it is not hard to cut in around a light switch and if you are too lazy to do that, then it is equally not hard to clean up the mess you created. This is where the property falls down. It is incumbent on management to inspect this or have a system in place that does and have it rectified. Hotel guests are by enlarge apathetic to these issues, especially in holiday destinations as their mindsets are such that they are there for fun and generally ignore these oversights. U Paasha’s rates are high and for that money, I would expect the property to be well maintained.
My air conditioning was blowing hot air and to maintenances' credit, they appeared soon after I reported it and fixed the issue. I have read in previous postings that this air conditioning does appear to be a recurring issue. Whist they were there, I pointed out other issues; balcony door squeaking and not locking properly along with having a good laugh at the painting mess. The issue of having a sewerage smell in my room was evident on a number of occasions. I also note that previous guest experienced this same issue. It did not appear to be constant in my room so either I got used to it, or it was intermittent, so I did not report it (again apathy). In either case, it should not occur and the source of this unpleasant odour should be localised and fixed.
I did however make one mistake. As I was flying in from KL with golf clubs, I emailed the hotel to provide an airport transfer. They came back with a fee of IDR350K – outrageous I know but having left it too late and being lazy and not want even more hassle at the airport, I agreed to it. When I inquired on check-in regarding complimentary airport transfers (I was booked in for 5 nights), I was told that as I did not booked directly through the Hotel (I booked through Expedia) that there was no way they were going to provide transfers. That certainly started us off on a good footing as I note on their web site that they have a deal whereby you book for three nights and receive transfers. I do not mind paying a fair price but this is > 100% mark-up, irrespective of what management may come back with in their response. It was not a hotel car, the driver and car were freelance (I asked the driver) so the Hotel has no overheads that they need to cover; only a phone call at the bare minimum. My transfer to the airport when I left (as I said I had golf clubs) was IDR150K in a van I acquired myself (Bluebird taxi would be cheaper). I could have negotiated a cheaper rate but I was not too concerned about a dollar or two. So the take away from this is do not book any transfers through the Hotel, they will rip you off. Everyone in Bali knows someone with a van (be it brother, cousin etc) so they are not hard to acquire. You still have to bargain but you will save a fortune through not using any Hotel provided transport. I did ask to speak to management three time on three different days at different time to discuss this transfer imbalance and I was told on each occasion that they were in meetings; busy people. Hopefully they are reviewing their maintenance and room inspection policies!
Reading through other reviews where customers have noted issues, management love to use the word ‘alleged’ which implies that the customer is reporting inaccurate or unproven facts. I do not see this aggressive attitude from management too often so it did surprise me. U Paasha must hire their management team from the Russian school of hotel management :). So if management want to imply that I too am reporting inaccurate facts, please do so but at least allow me the right of reply. My facts are accurate and not a figment of my imagination.
Bottom line – property is OK - after all you are on holidays. It depends on your holiday requirements – sure you are right on Eat Street but that is only for dinner! If you want proximity to the beach, there are plenty to choose from. If you want to splurge and immerse yourself in luxury and a highly maintained property, they are also available. Shop around.",U Paasha Seminyak
1875,Outstanding staff,40,October 2015,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel on 8th October 15. Our room was spacious, clean and very well set out. The pool area on the roof has outstanding views, and the staff were exceptionally friendly.
The breakfast area downstairs is fantastic, and open from 7 until 11. We had an early breakfast, went to the shops and came back and had another coffee - no problems
Another great feature is that the checkout time is 24 hours after you book in (we only stayed 1 night), so if you check in at 3 pm, you don't need to be out until 3pm the next day, none of this 10am or noon checkout. Very handy. Thoroughly recommend it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1876,"Convenient, big room",40,April 2015,"Situated in the busiest street in Seminyak you get everything you need within walking distance. Cafe, restaurants and everything else are just so easily accessible to you.
I was expecting the premises to be bigger as what I see in the internet picture however in reality it is not as big as i thought. No big deal i still get pretty pleseant experience with my stay
Breakfast was great, cleaniness is tip top and room is really spacious and comfy",U Paasha Seminyak
1877,"Not Good, never again!",10,October 2015,"Stayed in this hotel in Seminyak, Bali for the first and last time! The rooms smell of sewerage as do the hallways and other parts of the hotel. Friends had to move from their room as the smell was overwhelming! Out flight was delayed and when we tried to book an additional night we were told the hotel was booked out. We went on Expedia and there was space which we booked, when this was pointed out to the hotel they just said 'sorry'!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1878,Great boutique hotel - best location in Seminyak!,50,September 2015,We stayed here for four nights and our stay was tip-top from arrival to departure. Spacious rooms with the appropriate amount of amenities considering the rate. Extremely friendly staff and very good food options available in the hotel. Plenty of nightlight and shopping opportunities nearby. We would choose to come back for our next Bali trip.,U Paasha Seminyak
1879,Stand out service provided/great location,50,October 2015,"Very impressed with U Paasha. Service was outstanding. Management (Devi) ensured all my needs were met, and that I had a wonderful stay.
My name was remembered from the first day.
Couldnt have asked for a better location, everything you need is at your fingertips.
Will most definitely be returning! hopefully soon!",U Paasha Seminyak
1880,24 hour booking feature,50,November 2014,"We had a ground floor room which was close to the reception but not noisy.
The main reason I booked this hotel was the 24 hour booking, so whatever time you check in, you have the entire 24 hours. No early check out! Brilliant. I've stayed here twice now and would definitely return. It's on the same street as all the best restaurants in Seminyak. Wifi was pretty terrible the last time I stayed, that would be the only let-down.",U Paasha Seminyak
1881,Will be back.,50,October 2015,"U Paasha is perfectly located in Seminyak, close to everything.
The staff are very helpful and the facilities were amazing.
We stayed on the ground floor, room 103. It was large and very clean. There was not much of a view, but that did not bother us at all.
The breakfast had a very wide variety different foods which was a bonus.
I only wish we stayed a few more days to experience it all.",U Paasha Seminyak
1882,Great Value for Money,50,October 2015,"I just spent two nights at Paasha together with my 14 year old son. Escaping from the haze in Singapore, we arrived late Thursday night. Check in was smooth - all my requests were meet; high floor and twin beds! Staff were very friendly and sweet. Room was clean and room service was good. The best thing about Paasha is the location; in the center of a good shopping street, lots of nice restaurants and only 800 meters from the beach and Ku de Ta. In addition Paasha have a 24 hour policy, this means that if you check in late, you can also check out late. It is great to be able to keep the room for the whole day when you have a late departure. I will not hesitate to stay at paasha again! Thanks.",U Paasha Seminyak
1883,Position and staff. Amazing.,50,September 2015,"My family recently stayed at Upaasha. This hotel exceeded our expectations on every level. The staff are so friendly and constantly went out of their way to assist us in anything we needed.

The hotel is very modern and rooms extremely large. The roof top pool has great views and the roof top bar is a sure winner

It is located in the perfect position amongst great restaurants and boutiques.

Will definitely be staying again. Can't recommend highly enough

Thank you Mia and all the wonderful staff who made our stay exceptional!

Lisa",U Paasha Seminyak
1884,Love the 24 hour check-out policy,40,September 2015,"This hotel has a great location right in the middle of the main street of Seminyak. The exterior and lobby design and architecture is super chic and modern, though the hallways and rooms themselves don't quite live up to the grand entrance. The rooms are very large and the bed was very comfortable. The rooftop pool and deck is indeed a wonderful place to relax away the day. Staff was friendly and very helpful and we enjoyed the drinks at the bars. I was disappointed that there were only 2 thin and aging shower towels in the room and no face cloths or hand towels. Flipping over the rubber bathmat was a mistake as it was obvious the underside hadn't been cleaned in a year when we found a multi-colored mildew party under there. We also found the air in the room to be a bit damp. These faults aside I would still stay here again as I really appreciate the 24 hour check-out policy. This means that because we checked in at 19:00 we had until 19:00 the next day to check-out. So as our flight was not until 18:00 we didn't need to bother packing up before noon as would be usual at another hotel and instead we could enjoy the afternoon by the rooftop pool. Kudos to the management for this check-out policy and I wish this was the standard worldwide!",U Paasha Seminyak
1885,Great location,40,September 2015,"What a great spot.. Everything you need is at your door step. Great restaurants, shopping, spas etc.
This is a lovely boutique hotel. I stayed with my two teenage daughters. They both loved this hotel. The room is spacious and clean. The roof top pool is great for tanning and has great views. Breakfast was nice but the coffee is terrible. Luckily Revolver is just down the road.
The only thing I wasn't keen on is the open bathroom. I'd love to stay here again with a friend however there is no real privacy if you need to use the bathroom. The shower and toilet door are obscure glass but not totally private. We would need to get separate rooms which makes it dearer and not as much fun.",U Paasha Seminyak
1886,Beautiful property and incredible roof top pool!,40,September 2015,"We arrived at U-Paasha quite late in the afternoon (circa 7:30 pm) and were impressed with the look of the property and the central location. It is right in the heart of Seminyak, walking distance to Seminyak Square and the restaurant strip (Trattoria, Ultimo, Khaima, etc). The room we were assigned to was plenty for 2 people and our friends were allocated the room on the top level and it was extremely huge! It could have been their ""penthouse"" but I cannot be sure of that.
The interior was beautiful and everything was close to brand new, we were very impressed.

A few issues, checking in and out were slow. Staff seemed new and were a little flustered with people lining up and seemed quite nervous. Upon checking in we were not asked to leave our credit card for any back charges so we were told that we had to pay for our food and drinks whilst spending the time at the pool area as no back charging available. Luckily we had a couple of friends who could pay for the bill right there and then.

Other than that our stay was pleasant overall and we will return!",U Paasha Seminyak
1887,It's nice and central,40,September 2015,"We were recommended this hotel by a friend who always stays at U Paasha the location is so good, it is close to everything and the price was reasonable as well. The front of the hotel is so pretty inside is nice. The hotel room is a nice layout. The bed is comfy I think it's 2 double beds pushed together. Bathroom is nice but the shower looks a bit plain and dirty looking in the corners. If you like a hot shower like
Myself you will not like it. I turned on the hot water and didn't need any cold water and the shower was just bearable.
Would I stay here again? I would.",U Paasha Seminyak
1888,Great hotel in a great location,40,September 2015,"Service at his hotel was great , staff very friendly. Our overall experience is that we are completely satisfied and we will definitely stay here again as it is centrally located to shops , bars and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
1889,"Nice Location, Great Hotel..Disappointing Staff",30,September 2015,"The location of this hotel is SO good! Close to all the main attractions and walking distance to Seminyak Square. The rooms were also really big, clean and well decorated.. pool area also nice but perhaps could use a few more trees as its a little bit bare.. Food was also good and we were pleased with the breakfast buffet which had lots of choice.

However we would most likely never return to this hotel due to the service at the front counter. We spent three nights here and our next stop was to the gili islands... we tried to organise our transfer to the island with the staff and were really jerked around. We were given different prices each time we spoke to someone new.. and the prices differences were miles apart.. it was very obvious that they were working for the different companies on commission.. or at least thats how we felt as they were not putting our needs first more so taking the sides of these transfer companies which seemed to just try their luck with overcharging. We were really disappointed with the lack of help as we usually expect honestly and genuine help from hotel staff especially when it comes to negotiating prices but we felt that we were really getting ripped off and ended up going with a recommendation from our driver... 500,000 lkr per person to Gili Trawang return ($50.00)",U Paasha Seminyak
1890,First Timers,40,August 2015,This was my first trip to Bali so was pleased with the location of the hotel to shops and restaurants. The rooms were spacious and staff were friendly. The rooms themselves were nice however even with the air con on it always felt a bit hotter in the room than it should of been. There was also a bit of a let down with the shower which had been fixed... sort of. But had water spurting out everywhere and mouldy areas within the shower. The overall hotel was good however I think it was quite expensive what was on offer and next time would probably find a different hotel.,U Paasha Seminyak
1891,24 hour checkin checkout policy ~ unique,30,September 2015,"Room is okay, clean. Toilet is quite dirty (yellow stains on the floors in the shower - room 314), but we didn't mind since it was just for a night. Shower jet has small power, might want to look into that. When we checked in, air con was producing hot air (LG Air-con), called front desk and addressed the problem. Took the technician 20 min to come and another 20 min to fix the problem (cleaning the filter solved the problem).

Apart from that, hotel is convenient to anywhere in seminyak. many restaurants and spas available. There is a pool on top of the hotel.

Will come back again in the future, but hopefully shower jet (lack of power) problem, air con problem (maybe just this room? Spoke with the technician and he mentioned LG AC has a lot of problems) will be fixed by then. Great for those whose flights are at night and they could rest till the night before heading to the airport.

overall stay; 3.5/5.0 (5.0 if no AC problem and clean floors at the shower area in the room)",U Paasha Seminyak
1892,Right where the restaurants are,40,February 2015,"Rooms were clean and tidy, Daily room service and nice layout of the room and hotel. The pool could be deeper has its shallow from end to end but location is good and close to shops and restaurants in Seminyak. Nice view from the bar overlooking the town and good food to match. I would however recommend a scooter in terms of getting around to see what Seminyak/Kuta has to offer.",U Paasha Seminyak
1893,Great location up market hotel,40,June 2015,My wife and I stayed at the U Paasha hotel on a recent holiday to Bali. The hotel is extremely well situated within the shopping and dining area of Seminyak. It is a large modern multi storey hotel that provides everything a traveler could ask for. The rooms are very large with all the amenities expected of a hotel of this quality. The service is exemplary from the front desk to the room and dining area. However if your vision of a holiday in Bali is of low rise accommodation with extensive green landscaped gardens and the sound of water then this is not for you. This hotel is modern in decor and amenity and as it is multistorey the views are extensive and amazing but not a Balinese garden. The rooftop pool provides a welcome place to relax away from the activity of the street below although it is not very deep and it has limitations for serious swimming. We enjoyed our stay immensely but on a personal level longed for the traditional low rise garden accommodation.,U Paasha Seminyak
1894,"Clean, modern hotel in a great location",40,September 2015,"This hotel is right in the middle of 'Eat Street' in Seminyak and has some of the areas best restaurants right on it's door step. We couldn't fault the service and the rooms were big, clean and well appointed.

1. A little bit pricey
2. Limited seat on breakfast

The plus :
1. Nice looking design

4. Have a bar and dj on alibi
5. Parking service

1896,What you need to know about U Paasha,40,September 2015,"This hotel is located on Jl Oberio (Eat Street) the location is excellent. 5 min walk from Seminyak Square and you’re surrounded by restaurants, bars and shops. The hotel has four floors with a roof top bar. You can access the lift or open plan stairs to move around hotel.

Check-in – this hotel offers a unique 24 hour room usage (basically if you check-in at 11pm you have the room until 11pm the following day. Our check-in wasn’t particularly fast and our room wasn’t ready which was a bit disappointing given I’d advised our arrival time. We only waited about 20 mins for the room. You aren’t provided a welcome drink during check-in rather a voucher to use in the bar from 4pm onwards.

Issues – we did have some issues with our room. I have to say however that the GM and front office manager Ms Devi went out of their way to resolve our issues. Problems happen at all hotels, what matters is how they are resolved. The GM is committed to ensuring that customers leave happy.

Room – the room was exactly like the picture on the website. The bed is super comfortable and each room has a standing balcony. All the usual amenities TV, IPod dock, safe, bathrobes, tea/coffee making facilities and mini bar. Large glass wardrobe with plenty of handing space and shelves (no other drawers). The room is serviced twice daily.

All rooms aren’t equal in this hotel unfortunately. During our stay we had several rooms. In the first room we could hear traffic noise, so I asked to be moved immediately before we’d unpacked. The next room was on the first floor, the room didn’t smell particularly pleasant (oil smell – apparently this was from air conditioning repairs). This room was very quiet the first night, unfortunately we had to move the second night as the noise from the villa next door made it impossible for us to sleep (this of course was not the hotel’s fault). After negotiating we were moved to the penthouse suite for the night and then reallocated the next day (if you want to know about penthouse msg me). Our final room was perfect – quiet, smelled beautifully - very happy..

Bathroom – people have complained about water pressure on TA – we didn’t have any issues in any of the rooms. The bathrooms are minimalistic. Large walk in shower, double basins and toilet. Hair dryer (low wattage). If privacy is a concern it’s worth noting that the bathroom is open plan. The toiletries were very nice.
Breakfast – again a unique concept - breakfast anywhere anytime (up until 10pm at night). We choose to eat in the restaurant. The buffet was extensive. I’m pretty fussy and really enjoyed the breakfast menu. Fresh juices were made each morning, healthy options, hot & cold selections, egg station, crepe/waffle station and pastry options. Buffet avail from 6.30 to 11am.

Pool – pool is really well appointed. Lots of loungers and a couple of cabanas. Massages are available by the pool for very reasonable price. Pool bar open pretty much all day. Special events at the pool bar some evenings (BBQ etc).

Other – there wasn’t a gym or spa (however many spas within walking distance). Hotel has a basement bar with outdoor (street access) sitting area. Hotel offers airport transfer service.",U Paasha Seminyak
1897,Heart of the action,40,August 2015,"U Paasha is the perfect hotel if you want to be on the main street in Seminyak and sample the many great restaurants in the area. The roof top pool is very pleasant with attentive staff. As is the amazing breakfast. The rooms are quite spacious. Only thing is the grey polished concrete floor makes the room a bit cold and spartan. Good wifi, underground parking, reasonable tariffs and well situated makes this hotel a strong contender in the Laksmana Seminyak area.",U Paasha Seminyak
1898,"Checked in at 11.30am today. Right now, I'm already feeling disappointed...",30,September 2015,"To the manager of U Paasha,

If you are reading this, I'm writing this review hopefully it will bring the below issues to your attention. Hopefully it will be better in the near future.

This is not my first time in Bali. We past by U Paasha many times and we love everything about it. From the hotel lobby to the spacious room to the beautiful rooftop pool. It's amazing! It's the service culture that was rather disappointing.

1. I made my booking thru hotel.com for 2 nights (15th to 17th Sept) initially but later on, I decide to book 1 more night to enjoy this beautiful property. I made a separate booking. So a total of 3 nights (15th to 18th September). Upon checking in, I've notified the front desk that we have two bookings for 3 nights in total. She confirmed my both bookings but for the last night. I will still need to proceed to counter on 17th to register again. So this is the part I don't understand. Is this necessary when i have already notify the front desk? If it is necessary, to make it seamless and hassle-free for the customer, the hotel should arrange for the agent to come into my room to settle registration.

2. I've requested for hight floor but was given the 1st floor instead. The lady from the front desk clearly mentioned that such request is subjected to availability and as of now, they do not have any other rooms available. As my preference is any room other than 1st floor, so I asked 'how about later in the afternoon? Will there be rooms available?' Immediately, she checked and there is a room available right now other than 1st floor.

3. The toiletries in the room was incomplete. We received two shower gels but no shampoos

4. As for the gymnasium, I was looking for around for small towel but there are none. I went ahead to approach the pool attendant for assistance. The pool attendant mentioned they do not have towels for the gym but only tissue papers available. But the pool attendant was nice enough to offer me beach towel instead. Tissue papers? I think some towels for the gym will be nice.

To sum it all up, everything is perfect from location to the architecture of this hotel. It is only the service culture that needs some work.

Today is the first day of my stay. Over the next few nights, I hope my opinions will change.

Thank you",U Paasha Seminyak
1899,Definitely one of the best stays!,50,September 2015,"Good location,state of Art rooftop pool,nice disco bar on basement,rooms and service was top notch!definitely will come here again!Service staffs very attentive and nice!Can't help but to tip them! Didn't try their food thought cause we had more options on the streets!",U Paasha Seminyak
1900,Stunning large rooms with a great rooftop pool,50,September 2015,"I am not a big fan of crowds or noise especially when I'm on holidays and Bali can get pretty hectic. I generally stay out of the centre and just visit the craziness for a day of shopping or a night out and then go back to the quieter sides. But this trip I needed to be closer to town and booked this the night before and I was pleasantly surprised.
Although this is right in the middle of all the action - which most would think is awesome and I guess it was, I was concerned it would be noisy but it wasn't. The rooms are amazing - super large with beautiful modern decor and gorgeous big lounge chairs. The bathrooms are incredible and just the set up is great. Sound proof glass and the rooms were super quiet once the door was closed. The roof top pool was great and also not to crazy busy or noisy. Buffett breakfast was also really good with great coffee ( massive bonus ). Overall I had a great stay and highly recommend. Price was reasonable for what you get. I would definitely go back if I want dot stay in the area for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
1901,All around excellent hotel,50,August 2015,"Great service from check-in, beautiful room, good location in town (though about a 15 min walk to the beach), and an outstanding pool on the roof. I was stunned there weren't more people at the rooftop bar at sunset! Aside from the beach places, the rooftop bar has the best view of the sunset in Seminyak because it's the only building tall enough!",U Paasha Seminyak
1902,A nice boutique hotel,40,September 2015,We stayed at the UPaasha hotel in Seminyak for 2 nights during our stay in Seminyak and we really enjoyed our time there. The rooms are large and very modern. The pool on the rooftop was fantastic and the hotel is very central. The hotel offers 24 hour room usage which is refreshing and means you don't have to ask for a late checkout. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel. The hotel is best suited to couples - we have a young child and chose the hotel as it wasn't a big family resort rather it provides more of a boutique hotel experience and we definitely feel thats the experience we received.,U Paasha Seminyak
1903,Don't bother with this place!,10,August 2015,"We were booked into the hotel for the 24.8.2015. We were to have an interconnecting Suite. Arrived at the hotel at 1.50pm only to be told that we could not have the suite as guests were still in the said suite. After protracted negotiations we were eventually given rooms, 1 was ready at 5pm and the other room for my wife and I was not ready until 6.40pm. At no stage was there any offer to compensate us.",U Paasha Seminyak
1904,U Paasha Hotel Seminyak,30,September 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for one week in September. It is in the centre of Seminyak and near to shops and restaurants. The hotel has three floors and is starting to look 'tired' as far as the bedrooms and bathrooms are concerned.

Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The bedrooms are very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. There is a rooftop swimming pool which is excellent with bar and restaurant on same level. Staff at the swimming pool are very attentive and efficient.
Hotel is about 10/15 minutes walk from Seminyak Beach.
Breakfast selection is excellent and this can be ordered at any time during the day to be served in bedroom.

The bedrooms do have a balcony which is not furnished. There are no views as it is in a built up area.
Our reception upon arrival at the hotel was poor. Staff appeared to be inexperienced and not well organised. It took 45 minutes to process our documents and credit card for payments and we were asked several to confirm details.
There was no welcome cold drink at reception although we had arrived mid morning. This would have been a nice gesture as we were kept waiting in reception on a very warm day after the journey from the airport.
For visitors with walking difficulties the swimming pool access is by stairs from the lift which stops at the third floor. This could prove to be a problem.",U Paasha Seminyak
1905,BEST HOTEL!,50,May 2015,"We stayed at the U Paasha at the start of May for 9 nights. We absolutely loved it and could not fault it. We had a room facing west so we got the sunset! BEAUTIFUL! Rooms were massive, bed was amazing, bathroom had nothing to complain over. The rooftop pool was great. Beautiful breeze and sun all the time, a nice break from the hot, sweaty and sandy beach. The staff at the pool were extremely friendly and chatty. Buffet breakfast was nice, as you would expect in Bali. The position of the hotel was amazing, right in the middle of the bars, restaurants, shopping and only a short scooter ride to basically everything. We stayed at a 5 star hotel on the beach for 2 nights which was over double the price at the end of our trip after staying at U Paasha and both my boyfriend and I would have preferred to have not stayed at the 5 star hotel. We are going back in November and we wont be staying anywhere else in the future.",U Paasha Seminyak
1906,Amazing amazing amazing,50,August 2015,"Can definitely recommend this hotel. The rooms are gorgeous, service is superior and location is central to shopping and restaurants. Devi the front office manager is a total credit to the hotel. I left my passport in my last hotels safe... She rang them and sorted it all out for me as I was in such a panic. She went that extra mile for me. Thank you Devi and all the staff. I'll be back in February.",U Paasha Seminyak
1907,Great location on eat street,40,October 2014,"A good hotel if you want to be in the middle of it all ! Probably better suited to couples with the frosted shower and toilet walls and open bathroom set up , but nicely done. Towels were a little 'grey' but overall a good place to stay. Aircon in the rooms can be a bit noisy.",U Paasha Seminyak
1908,Expected better.,30,August 2015,"Judging by the swaths of positive reviews I read before our arrival, I expected a lot from our stay at U Paasha. Unfortunately I left feeling a little deflated.

Things got off to a bad start when the staff at the desk accidentally managed to block our credit card. Some mix up with the pin apparently. Partly our fault, partly theirs. Not the end of the world, but it certainly set the tone.

We were then greeted by the intoxicating aroma of sewage as we were lead down the first floor corridor to our room. A problem that other guests have mentioned previously on trip advisor and is yet to be addressed.

The room itself was spacious and basic. Which was absolutely fine. We weren't expecting the ritz. It wasn't until we opened the curtains to find a building site staring back at us and a badly stained shower area producing luke warm water that we thought 'are we in the right hotel!?'.

All this was then compounded by our wifi not working, a pretty poor breakfast and our rooms not being made over until five in the evening.

Now we made have just been really unlucky and judging by the rest of the reviews on here we might have been, but i still thought it was worth flagging that based on our experience there's no way this is a four star hotel. The location is great, pool is nice and staff are friendly but that alone doesn't warrant a four star rating and a big dent in your bank account.",U Paasha Seminyak
1909,Great value in a perfect location!,50,August 2015,"My family and I (a group of 9 adults) were all very pleasantly surprised and impressed with this property. I cannot speak highly enough of the level of service we received, the quality of food served and the fantastic location. The rooms are very large & clean with decent balconies and well furnished. Plenty of sunbeds and cabanas around the pool with great views. The bar downstairs does function as a nightclub on some evenings so request a room away from the street if you are a light sleeper, but I wasn't bothered by it at all. (Incidentally it is a very cool club for a drink)
A multitude of fabulous restaurants within a 1-10 minute walk, and about a 25 min stroll to the beachfront. I would highly recommend this property and will likely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1910,LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION,40,August 2015,"I would highly recommend this hotel.
The rooms are huge and clean,
The roof top pool is awesome with amazing views
The restaurant near the pool is great
The drinks are cold and well priced
The staff are friendly and always willing to help
The location doesn't get any better
The breakfast could use a spruce up
but overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
1911,Good spot in middle of action,40,August 2015,"Nice user friendly hotel in busy area of Seminyak with lovely Rooftop pool with great views out to Ocean & surrounds. Roofs are good size & comfy with breakfast available at any time
Good value for money",U Paasha Seminyak
1912,Spacious!,50,April 2015,"I loved how spacious this hotel is. The rooms are so generous! My partner and I stayed here at the end of a two week trip, and after some fairly small rooms and 24/7 together, it was nice to have a bit of space. The rooms are very nicely decorated and very modern. The bed is amazing. I never wanted to leave. The room has absolutely everything you would need for a short or long stay. The breakfast is unreal, huge selection and delicious food.

The location is fabulous. Right in the middle of eat street with amazing night restaurants and shopping right at your door. This property is not near the beach... Maybe a 10 min walk but to be honest, who goes to bali to go to Kuta/Seminyak beach???

My tip would be to ask for a room above ground floor. I just found it could be a bit noisey from people who were not courteous to other guests by keeping quiet when going to and from their rooms. Being the main walk way to the rest of the hotel, quite a few people go through here.

I would absolutely stay here again and have recommended it to many friends and family.",U Paasha Seminyak
1913,The best hotel in seminyay,50,August 2015,"For the second time in 2 years U Paasha has been our home for two weeks and it is the BEST! Great staff so friendly, great pool on the roof. Breakfast was always amazing and the hotel is in the so central to all the restaurants and bars. We have had so much fun! Thank you U Paasha, we will be back, third times a charm!! 😍",U Paasha Seminyak
1914,"great location, great pool, great room",50,August 2015,"Loved everything about this place, location is perfect, room was spacious, modern and clean. Staff were always smiling and willing to help. Breakfast had more than enough variety. Rooftop pool was incredible. Highly recommend this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
1915,Spacious!,40,November 2014,"Last time I stayed there was 1 year ago, and I am very satisfied!
The room is very clean, nice ambiance, good location and nice service.
Looking forward to go back and staying there for another holiday this month.",U Paasha Seminyak
1916,Great room better suited as a business hotel,30,August 2015,"On my recent to trip to Bali I stayed at two different hotels, this one was over 3 times the price of the 2nd hotel I stayed at and I enjoyed the other one more.

Pros:
Fantastic large modern room with lovely bathroom, great location in the middle of eat street, very comfortable bed and pillows, bathrobe

Cons:
No balcony (it’s a lanai so there is no furniture and you can’t sit outside), rooftop pool was very cold & windy, very few lounges by the pool so on most days I couldn’t get one so had to go to a Beach Club to use their pool and get a lounge (totally unacceptable I think), buffet breakfast (I don’t like buffets much really unless they are very high quality and this wasn’t. Everything sounded ok until you lifted the lid – over promised and under delivered – better to have a small menu of well-produced items, tea at breakfast was not self-serve so I had to wait until all the skinny caps and lattes had been made to get my bag in a cup (usually I was finished eating and ready to leave), Pool bar had a lot of staff but they seemed to be standing around and not doing anything (menus were not even put next to the lounges, you had to go and get them yourself, pretty sloppy for $200 a night), pre-programmed music in the room didn’t exist

Overall I just didn’t think U Paasha was good value for money and when I go to Bali I want to spend time reading and relaxing by the pool and I couldn’t do that.",U Paasha Seminyak
1917,"Great rooftop, clean new rooms",40,June 2015,"Great hotel on main drag of Seminyak. Easy walk to great restaurants / bars.
New big hotel, nice clean well styled big rooms. The winner with this hotel is the rooftop pool. Amazing views, beautiful pool, great communal area.
Pros: all above. nice buffet brekkie.
Cons: Our particular room looked onto a building site next door- so kept blinds shut the whole time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1918,comfortable modern hotel,40,August 2015,"This hotel in the centre of Seminyak has all you need for a relaxing holiday.The rooms are very spacious but could be serviced better.The option of pillows,Tea and soap that you select on check in do not happen if you are not in your room when the staff come around the following day.

The breakfast could not be faulted, every thing possible to eat and drink is available.The staff are pleasant and helpful.If you are looking for a Balinese style hotel this is not for you.There are no lush gardens or balconys to sit out side, so you have to sit round the pool or in your room to relax.",U Paasha Seminyak
1919,Great stay,50,August 2015,"We stayed for 3 nights in a 1 bdrm room.... No complaints at all

Room was really nice, facilities great including gym, rooftop pool with poolside service and views, there was a delicious breakfast buffet with many healthy options (as well as house-made cronuts!), central location, lovely staff......

All spot on!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1920,Large room but average stay,30,July 2015,"Room quality wise - Room was very spacious. However, bathroom floor tiles, glass doors and walls looks fairly old with stains. No bathtub available for room. Bed was comfortable. Wifi was slow and practically non existent.
Location - Convenient with many restaurant choices and convenient stores around the area. Beside a busy street with no issues to get a taxi.
Service - Service was average but was not able to check in earlier for the 24hr check in/out as mentioned by other travellers. You might need to check with the hotel in advance if you are able to do so.
Others - Breakfast is good with a wide variety.",U Paasha Seminyak
1921,"Value for money! Pool, breakfast, location, beds & people are all great!",50,July 2015,"Stayed 8 nights at the end of July and loved our stay. Location is perfect - near great bars and restaurants and a ten minute walk to the beach or a cheap scooter/cab. Roof top pool is awesome and the rooms are massive with great beds. Buffet breakfast is good, fresh fruit, nice coffee, eggs however you want them bacon, pancakes, everything!

Hotel staff are very nice and I must especially thank Devi for the surprise birthday cake and the wonderful hospitality. Would definitely stay again. Great value for money.",U Paasha Seminyak
1922,Greed and bad faith from hotel management,20,August 2015,"Alter an 18 hours flight arrived exhausted with my family of 4 at 11 pm for check in. Our request, large room on upper floor with view and 1 extra bed. Called 3 days before arrival, hotel confirmed everything OK according to my request. After half an hour wait (sole client at reception) we were shown to room with no extra bed and view on a brick wall. After insisting were given decent room with extra bed.
Next morning (while in the middle of our sleep) and following day received phone calls from reception asking for full payment of my stay despite them securing payment through credit card references. To stop being harassed I paid in advance my 4 days stay cash (insisted on not having card debited which hotel said he wouldn't) only to find out they debited 1st night and overcharged extra bed and final night stay without my consent when still in reservation process.
But the worst part yet to come : all these annoyances + jet lag made me check out by mistake one day earlier than expected. At reception desk upon check out, the same person insisting on full payment during my stay did not bother telling me I was leaving before date and that following night already paid for.
Hotel check in at next destination made me realize my mistake. When contacting U Paacha hotel manageress asking them to refund me for night I did not spend, I had an unconcerned, cold voiced person on the line who not only denied my demand of refund but again overcharged this final night I did not spend. People from booking.com had to get involved, but she still wouldn't refund.
My advice, if you're looking for service with a personnal touch and balinese style, avoid this hotel, as it is understaffed with most employees and management showing the way truly behave in an unfriendly, unpersonnal manner that is a disgrace to balinese hospitality and sense of service.
By the way for the night my card was debited despite cash payment and the overcharge for night I did not spend and they would not refund, I am yet to be reimbursed.
I will naturally keep tripadvisor, booking.com and hôtel.com readers updated on course of events...",U Paasha Seminyak
1923,LOVED my stay. Every hotel should have their check in/out policy,50,August 2015,"Having received a flight delay notice I had to find somewhere quickly to stay another night and given my flight was leaving late at night the next day I wanted a late checkout. Found via another review that U Paasha offer a 24 hour stay, so if I check in at 8pm I can leave at 8pm the next day. Awesome! Why doesn't every hotel do this?
Not only that the included breakfast is all day, whenever you want it! No more having to get up early to rush to breakfast. And the breakfast is seriously good, a massive choice and coffee, eggs, pancakes all made to order.
Great rooftop pool with a view over the Seminyak to the beach, food menu was a little average though. The room was fully sick, I felt like a rockstar. The bed was like a cloud!
I paid $130USD a night which I thought was great value given the calibre of this hotel. Downside, wifi a bit dodgy in the rooms. I'd definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1924,Decent hotel in heart of Seminyak,40,August 2015,"I recently stayed here for 7 nights.

Positives:
- rooftop pool always gets the sun which many other hotels don't have the luxury of.
- pool service is awesome.
- rooms are very spacious.
- pool side food and cocktails are good.
- location is good, close to shopping and many restaurants.
- buffet breakfast is great.
- the staff that aren't on reception were all extremely friendly.

Negatives:
- drains in toilet and shower smelt badly of sewerage and despite complaining twice, nothing was done. As the rooms are open plan, can become quite smelly.
- housekeeping often didn't provide hand towels and floor mats. Towels were very old and stained.
-Rooms have a balcony but not one that can really be utilised as no chairs that can be put on it and it's very small.
- Shower pressure was low and shower only ever luke warm. Despite complaining, again nothing done to fix.
- mouldy cushions on couch in room.

Hope this helps!",U Paasha Seminyak
1925,2nd time here and would come back a third!!,50,June 2015,"U paasha is a really great value hotel.
Buffet is good. Location in seminyak is great (just across from ultimo ..the best italian resstaurant).
Love.love love the rooftop pool for chilling out after walking around shops in the heat! If you need a driver like we were looking for ...we found a great one outside u paasha called putu who was so reasonable and friendly!!...he can take you from u paasha to wherever your heart desires..putubalitransport@gmail.com/+6287861162363. I highly recommend upaasha and the staff are great!",U Paasha Seminyak
1926,"Location, Location, Location",40,July 2015,"Now let's be fair, my wife & I had just been treated to two days of bliss at a 5 star resort in Jimbaran so it was always going to be hard to compete, however once we jumped that mental hurdle, we settled into what U- Paasha has to offer...a funky inner city type pad smack bang in the middle of Seminyak. The entrance foyer architecture is hip with a polished concrete corridor of commissioned artwork to pave your way to your room.
Rooms are spacious & we were lucky enough to secure a room further away from the entrance & attracting minimal street noise, if any. Rooms are large & bathrooms spacious however a good bleaching of the pebblecrete floors wouldn't hurt to remove the brown staining.
Breakfasts are above average with a generous selection & not your standard eggs & bacon, however I wish someone would show the Balinese how to not make bacon into last nights burnt food offering.
Rooftop pool captures the sun that many ground floor villa's miss, a relaxing breakout area from the hustle & bustle five floors below.",U Paasha Seminyak
1927,Great location,30,August 2015,"Great location if wanting to be in the heart of Seminyak.
Rooms very large and spacious. Room did have a smell of sewage which is off putting and hard to sleep.
Beds are very comfortable - the best I have slept on.
Bathroom does need some attention however minor issue. The pool does need more lounges as no where near enough and had to lie in the deck.",U Paasha Seminyak
1928,"Fantastic place to stay, luxurious and comfortable...great service and staff",50,July 2015,"My boyfriend and I visited Bali on the 15th of July until the 25th of July. We stayed at the U Paasha for the duration of our trip. The hotel is in a fantastic location making getting around to restaurants, the beach, great shops and quality (Melbourne style) coffee incredibly easy. The hotel staff were lovely and friendly at every stop. From the moment we were picked up from the airport to be taken to our hotel, to the very end of our stay and drop off back at the airport. The food we ordered through room service was tasty and fresh and competitively priced. The rooms are attractive, modern and have the BEST king size beds. We were on the 5th for facing away from the beach which meant we woke up to a beautiful breeze.

The pool is fantastic, located on the rooftop with bar and food service from very friendly staff. you can see all the way to the beach from beside it.

I want to make special mention of one staff member in particular - Gede who worked at the rooftop bar. He was an absolute delight, so friendly and helpful. He even taught us some Indonesian and Balinese. He was really fantastic!

I highly recommend the U Paasha in Seminyak for affordable luxury with great amenities, location, staff and quality rooms and facilities.

Thank you for looking after us!!! We will be referring our friends!! :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1929,"Great location, Could be cleaner",30,July 2015,"We found U Paasha to be in a great location with beautiful restaurants and boutique shopping right outside our front door! Was a little disappointed with cleanliness of room. Moldy, cushioned furniture, dirty hand prints on walls, sheets had a few marks on them. Bamboo Matt on floor was torn, tripped on this at least 5 times, very dangerous. Water pressure in shower was very poor which is dissapointing as shower is so big could be really luxurious! Breakfast was very good & rooftop pool.",U Paasha Seminyak
1930,Brilliant service & perfect location!,50,July 2015,"This was our first trip to Bali and after a lot of research found U Paasha on trip advisor. Can't speak highly enough of this place - service was amazing, all staff were friendly and helpful from assisting us with restaurant reservations to organizing a doctor call out. Rooftop was amazing but gets busy around 10:30-11am through until around 2-3pm. Right on eat street and $1.50 meter cab to Potato Head, Sarong, Barbacoa etc... Room was clean, didn't smell. Good buffet breakfast with a wide variety of food. Recommend walking down the street to Revolver For a coffee though. On par with some of the best Melbourne coffee we've had.",U Paasha Seminyak
1931,"Modern, comfortable and great location.",50,February 2015,"I've stayed at U Paasha twice now and never wanted to leave.
Located right in the middle of Seminyak's eat street you won't have to go far for amazing food and shopping.
Staff are extremely helpful and courteous.
24 hour check-in (if you check in at 2PM you can check out at 2PM the following day) -what a luxury!
Beds are the comfiest I've ever slept in, rooms are clean, modern and feature black out curtains.
Upon arrival you get to select which soap you'd like - a nice touch!",U Paasha Seminyak
1932,Wonderful hotel and location,50,July 2015,"U Paasha resort was a modern, very spacious and clean resort with the most accommodating staff. It is in the Heart of Seminyak so it was so easy to get around. The food was beautiful especially the breakfast! We loved the rooftop pool. The whole place was beautiful, Perfect place to stay in Seminyak would definitely go back.",U Paasha Seminyak
1933,best location... great service,50,July 2015,"Stayed in this hotel for 10 nights and was very impressed. The rooftop pool was awesome and although it doesn't have a swim up bar they have at least two staff walking around so ordering food and drink is quick. Prices from room service are very good and the rooms are big and modern. We had a super king bed which was very comfortable and were on the non ocean side so got a great breeze throughout the day. The location was perfect being in the middle of 'eat street' and all the major venues were a quick walk away. Everything right through the hotel was great and I would recommend it to everyone. A special mention to a staff member upstairs also... his name was Gede and he was the best. Great service, really lovey guy and made the stay perfect.",U Paasha Seminyak
1934,24hr Check in/ Check out Hotel,30,July 2015,"Great location for food and shopping. Rooms are a good size with a roof top pool with views of the sea from a distance. Breakfast are served opposite the lobby, not really practical as lots of passerby going past the food.
First hotel I've come across with a 24hr check in and check out system. Ideal if you have a late night flight.",U Paasha Seminyak
1935,"Optimal location, superb food",40,July 2015,"After a great stay at U Paasha Seminyak in 2014 we decided to return for one night at the end of our 2015 visit to Bali.

This check in was rather stressful when we discovered my mother's credit card was charged unexpectedly a few days prior to our arrival for two nights' accommodation. While the junior desk staff were a bit clueless, fortunately the new Front Office Manager Devi arrived and (along with General Manager Gindo) did all she possibly could to help us get to the bottom of the issue (turns out my aunt arranged her own separate booking to be charged to my mothers' card and this occurred without our authorisation).

After resolving this initial hiccup we had a pleasant stay, beginning with drinks and a very tasty meal at the Alibi Bar at street level (and if you like your chili hot, try a mouthful of the birds eye chili side dish but don't mistake them for snake bean salad!) The sate campur is excellent.

Our room was once again very clean and comfortable and we slept very well. The hotel's convenient position in the heart of Seminyak made shopping outings quick and easy.

They had scheduled a well-priced special banquet dinner for Idul Fitri, which we unfortunately missed as we had to return home that evening ... However, the food in general has gone from strength to strength since 2014 under Executive Chef Taskara. The breakfast buffet was as great as we remembered and it is easy to spend a couple of hours there enjoying a few coffees and sampling the wide variety of cuisine available.

Aircon was cool and no outdoorsy smells came into our room. Wifi was pretty good.

Staff service ranged from average to good in the Rooftop Bar, excellent in other areas of the hotel. Special credit for professionalism to Ms Devi in Front Office, talented Chef Taskara and his breakfast team and a young lad Raka who was brand new in 2014 and has come a very long way since then and makes the guests feel very welcome.

The hotel was able to arrange our transportation to the airport and we appreciate the late check out, although we would very much have liked to stay on at U Paasha for a few more days!",U Paasha Seminyak
1936,"Fantastic service, great location, huge and comfortable room!",50,July 2015,"Great experience started from when we checked in. We can choose soap, teas, pillow etc. It was different and fun things to do. The room is very spacious and super clean, large bathroom space with his & her sink. It's very good to have large bathroom!
The hotel locates on the main street with lots of shops and restaurant, walking distance to everywhere in Seminyak or a short taxi ride.
Good thing is your check in time is check out time, we checked in at 5pm and were allowed to use the room till 7pm on departure day. This is a huge advantage when you have late night flight.
We will definitely stay U Paasha again! Thanks for the great stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1937,Most helpfull staff ever!! Awesome breakfast,50,June 2015,"This is the second time I have stayed there, it is a fantastic hotel. The location is perfect in Seminyak close to everything, the rooftop pool is amazing with an awesome view of Seminyak.

Excellent sized rooms, great facilities, Amazing buffett breakfast, but wait it gets better

THE STAFF!!!
The team at Upaasha are amazing, they genuinely care about you and want to make sure you are looked after.
From Devi the front of house Manager to Gede, Rini and Rika serving up at the rooftop pool bar even the security will STOP traffic to make sure you are safe to leave.
I highly recommend this hotel and I will definatley be coming back to stay here.",U Paasha Seminyak
1938,Excellent hotel in great location,50,July 2015,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights at the start of July. We chose this hotel after a lot of research on TA. From start to finish this hotel was excellent and I would not hesitate to recommend it. The staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay, including helping us to phone drivers and book the boat to gili islands.

The rooms were of a high standard and very clean. I had read previously reviews about stains on the sheets, we did not experience this and found them to be very clean and fresh. If picking any fault it would be there were many chips on the wardrobe mirror, this was not an issue for us though. We stayed in room 305 and I would definitely recommend this room. It overlooks a villa complex and was therefore very quiet and also one floor down from the roof top pool.

The roof top pool was a major positive for this hotel. Really peaceful and chilled atmosphere away from the hussle and bustle of the streets below. Clean towels were provided and the loungers were comfortable and not too close together. We spent a full day up here (we also got our breakfast delivered to our pool loungers for no extra charge as we had missed the buffet breakfast but the hotel offers anytime anywhere breakfast policy which was great.)

Buffet breakfast and the breakfast we got by the pool were delicious. Loads of choices and really high quality. Although buffet style, the food was fresh and replaced regularly. There was also an eggs and pancake station where you could get omlettes, egg benedict, pancakes etc made to order.

Location is great, the main eat street is right outside the door. I would recommend Ultimo restaurant across the street which is a beautiful restaurant.

Originally I really wanted to stay in a private villa but I did not want to be too far from the main area which influenced our choice of U Paasha. I'm so glad we didnt get a villa and stayed in u Paasha instead!

Thanks to all the staff for a great trip!",U Paasha Seminyak
1939,total value for money,50,July 2015,"Excellent location! the hotel is centrally located in Seminyak area where good restaurants and shops are just door step away. The best things about this place: attentive staff, 24 hours checkout policy and the delicious breakfast.",U Paasha Seminyak
1940,Felt like a 5 star - Awesome place to stay,50,July 2015,"Right in the heart of the action of seminyak across from cafe bali. Walking distance to most great places to eat. We stayed in the penthouse room at the front of the building 3rd floor. The room was huge, big superking bed, bottle of chilled moet to greet us, huge ensuite, huge walk in robe, we felt very spoilt! The only downside to the room, it was a little noisy being at the front, as there is a full wall of glass sliding doors which lets in the noise a bit at night especially. Also a little warm in the room no matter how cold you made the aircon due to the sun beating through the glass doors. Odd there was no balcony though. Room tip: There are penthouse rooms that look out to the side so if you like things more quiet i would ask to get one of those. Most of the lower category rooms look to the side and they are also big in size compated to std hotel rooms and much quieter.

So back to the hotel. Buffet breakfast was awesome, cafe lattes incl, eggs benedict cooked to order, we again felt very spoilt, kids loved the waffle pancake section, we loved the local food on offer also.

Rooftop pool was a great place to chill, relaxing tunes played, great happy hours drink specials. Pool had some great shallow areas so suitable for kids and adults alike.

Little touches were really thoughful, choice of soap, 24 hour hotel options, and the most friendly professional staff we encountered in the whole 4 weeks we were in bali.

This hotel felt more 5 star than the actual 5 star we stayed in!",U Paasha Seminyak
1941,"Amazing room, great location, courteous service",50,April 2015,"The room I stayed in was immaculate -it was LARGE, wonderfully decorated and had its own balcony. The upstairs pool was a great place to relax. I only had 4 short days in Bali and was I ever glad I stayed here, you're smack dab in the centre of Seminyak with plenty of places right at the foot of the door.
The hotel staff were also all very nice and made me feel very welcome. I definitely recommend this place!",U Paasha Seminyak
1942,"Location, location and great staff",50,July 2015,"Great location in Seminyak's most popular area. Really good value for the money. You pay for a large room, great staff and the prime location. The pool is nothing worth mentioning, however the beach and beach clubs is not far away.

If you want a resort feeling with an awesome pool and beach: this is not it. Expect to pay 3-5 times more in this area.",U Paasha Seminyak
1943,Awesome,50,July 2015,"We have stayed in this hotel about 5 times now and it is our home in Bali. This last trip a few days ago was amazing. The hotel manager - Ms Devi made our stay a lot more enjoyable and effortless than ever before. She went over and above our expectations as she helped me with a stolen passport. We were extremely impressed with her initiative to help us resolve this problem. She is an asset to the U Passha group and I am sure all the guests think this when they encounter her hospitality. Thank you Devi once again. You are a shining light in that hotel. Sincerely, Vanessa & Tony",U Paasha Seminyak
1944,Good value for money in the heart of Seminyak,40,July 2015,"We enjoyed our stay: 1. Loved the 24 hour check-in check-out policy! We checked in at 6pm and could have checked out at 6pm (we checked out at 4 to catch our flight). Really easy going. 2. Loved the rooftop pool. Nice and peaceful getaway from the hustle and bustle down on the street when you need it. 3. Descent breakfast selection and service - extra nice that they offer breakfast any time any where.
Minor negatives: 1. Room is large but not so cozy - it's more industrial with cement floor everywhere. 2. Shower and bathroom tiles need a good scrub and missing the good water pressure necessary for a good shower.",U Paasha Seminyak
1945,Frustrating,20,April 2015,"I stay at U PAASHA around 4-5 times a year & have continually suggested U PAASHA to friends & family.

The reason for writing a review this time, is at I have emailed U PAASHA, which no response.

Our last stay there, I was less than impressed with the issues we had:

-Every single day, we had to request more towels in our room, we were only given bath towels- no face towel, towel matt, medium sized towel & our rooms were never cleaned until late afternoon night, when we were back for the day after working.
-Every single time we went to the pool, they had run out of towels to offer us & we had to wait for more towels to arrive.
-There were also a couple of times we tried to order food, which was sold out for lunch.
-The shower smelt horrible & also the glass door is SO dangerous, the way it drags on the pebbled floor & also the air con is very very loud- these things have been an issue the last few stays, however as generally everything else is ok, we haven't complained.
-The hotel also had a constant horrible sewage smell each time we left out room.

At this stage, I will be relocating hotels for future stays, as for the price that is charged, we can get the same rate & better service for half the price at hotels close by.

To top it off, we were charged for an extra night upon checking out.",U Paasha Seminyak
1946,Wonderful,50,July 2015,"Stayed at U Paasha in February 2015.......
What wonderful, clean, rooms, beds SO comfy, divine, AND the pillows!
The room was SO big, bathroom area fantastic.
AC worked well.
Breakfast was wonderful every day, what ever you asked for you could have.

The rooftop pool was just perfect, thoroughly enjoyed every minute.
Staff were friendly, accommodating and helpful throughout my week long stay.

Discovered the Nirvana Bar two doors away, the most divine, professional massage upstairs, and fantastic prices.

Kuta far enough away, but not expensive by taxi.
Would definitely stay if ever in Bali again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1947,Great hotel but bad check-in experience,40,May 2015,"This hotel is centrally located in Seminyak area, with lots of restaurant and bars nearby. But this hotel is not a beach front hotel, since it is quite far to get to the beach. The room is spacious yet very comfy with a very nice interior. The rooftop pool is also amazing, either for swimming or just tanning. The food is also very good with various choices. The hotel also provides parking space for the guest's vehicle. But unfortunately I had a bad check-in experience in the hotel. I have made a group reservation prior to my arrival, but when I arrived in the hotel (on the normal check-in time) the rooms were not ready yet. I have to wait in the lobby without any certainty on when my room is ready. After waiting for around 2 hours at the lobby, I finally got my room. This was really ruining my plans.",U Paasha Seminyak
1948,Better options arouns,20,July 2015,"We booked our trip 4 months ago and booked the penthouse. We wanted to splurge as its been years since we've had a holiday....

Turned up on day one and get told ""we apologise but your room has been given to someone else""... After much frustration the only answer I got when asking why those people couldn't have been offered a normal room was ""they wanted to stay in the penthouse, they asked us before you turned up""....But we turned up at 1pm as per our booked check in time, booked it 4 months ago, and it turns out the folks that asked for the room the day before got priority?! Bad start. With 96 rooms and 4 penthouses... Why did they allow them one of the 4... Which was not available!

The most frustrating thing about it was the poor service. Apology was not sincere, no other options given?..Pretty much just wanted to sweep us under the carpet.

Very disappointing service which is rare in Bali. We had been in Ubud and Nusa Lembongan prior and were spoilt with the standard amazing service from the Balinese... Then to finish our trip with this was really upsetting.

The smell in the hallways and coming from the shower drain is sickening, very hard to live with. Be warned If you are sensitive to smells, this is not the place for you!

The penthouse sits above the nightclub that's open until 2am so also prepare yourself for some tunes in your sleep. Being in the front of the hotel also we had the street noise and a lift attached next to our room... The reception music also was quite clear in our room... So not ideal for a light sleeper.

Just a tip for those interested in a penthouse, there's no extras compared to the standard room.... Only space. It's very generous in space indeed but almost a waste because there's no extras... No spa etc etc. lots of potential they could have used the space so well. Oh, except you get a coffee machine - but ours isn't working.

On the plus side (a big plus)... The rooftop pool is incredible.... AMazing sunset drinks! (But you can enjoy this without being a guest) and the brekky is really good with a huge range of options.",U Paasha Seminyak
1949,Good Customer service but housekeeping can be improved,40,July 2015,"This hotel has a very good potential. Decor and customer service is nice. Location is great too. However, maintenance is lacking as we can see there are lots of scratches and stains here and there. They should do a major cleanup for the overall place. Nevertheless , there e lots of extra and personalised benefits when u stay here like complimentary yoga on Sat morning, welcome drink, late checkout, and other small details :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1950,Disappointing,20,June 2015,"We stayed at the U Paasha as we wanted to be close to the beach. Disappointing is the only word we can think of. We had issues with the air conditioning - it didn't work for two days, and even after reporting it, we still had to follow up. There was a constant bad smell coming from the drains in the shower and toilet which made it very unpleasant to sleep. We reported it several times, but it never got fixed. The door access card kept locking us out and on several occasions we had to get it re-programmed.

On the positive, the breakfast and the roof top BBQ was amazing.

Not really worth the money paid for a 4 star hotel, and we will go elsewhere next time.",U Paasha Seminyak
1951,Fantastic hotel - stay here!,50,July 2015,"Our room was huge with two sinks for myself and my partner. All very clean and in good condition. The staff are wonderful - very hospitable and nothing too much to ask.

The rooftop pool is lovely and worth a day to hang out by. The staff frequently come round offering drinks. There aren't a huge amount of sunloungers but we didn't have any trouble getting two but I did see other guests waiting for some to become available.

When you arrive, the reception staff offer you coupons (one free drink and 20% off) for welcome drinks in the attached bar which was good as our room wasn't ready despite us arriving early evening. When we did finally get into our room there weren't any towels and it took a while to get these but we didn't bother waiting for these we just headed out for dinner!

The hotel is lovely and centrally located, would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
1952,Design hotel in fantastic location,50,July 2015,"First time staying at this hotel. I usually stay at W retreat right on the beach but decided to try this hotel out for its location and great rates! This hotel is located right smack in the middle of the Seminyak with heaps of classy restaurants and bars right at its doorstep. Huge room, comfortable beds, clean and smart. Super value for money. A very gracious hotel that's gives out little things such as a welcome beer, water and snacks in the lobby, chilled fruit by the pool etc. Friendly and fast service. Had a hiccup with airport pick up but I was extremely impressed by how the Front Office Manager, Devi and her team recovered so well and made me feel very well taken care of following that incident. Food was awesome. Priced competitively compared to the many restaurants along that street just outside the hotel. Amazing food! Rooftop pool was also well equipped with the best sunset views ever. Lovely service all round making this a very enjoyable trip. Will definitely return!",U Paasha Seminyak
1953,Visually beautiful great location super large rooms,40,June 2015,"The rooms are super sized
and really comfortable. We did have some bathroom drainage odour. It is the Main Street of the Bali riviera (Seminyak) so you need to take that into account. It is a developing nation and they still don't have all the infrastructure in place to deal with massive growth in tourism and the resources drain. Location amazing!! Staff so lovely and helpful. Overall my stay was fantastic and I usually only stay in villas so that is a big tick for me. Will definitely stay here again when the villa I stay in isn't available.",U Paasha Seminyak
1954,"Good location in Seminyak, but..",40,July 2015,"Stayed in U Paasha for 3 nights before moving to another resort. It was a great location if you are a foodie, because it's just right smack in the middle of Eat Street. You'll get great eateries within a few steps away like Ultimo, The Bistrot, Corner House, etc.

Room was big and spacious, I loved the decor. Free wifi provided but it was rather slow.

Rooftop pool's great! But it can get crowded around 11am onwards.

We didn't make it for buffet breakfast downstairs cos there are alot more cafes nearby (plus breakfast venue was small and crowded).

One thing this place lacks is it's service. Sometimes they don't seem to understand what we were talking about even though we were already speaking in simple english.. The front desk also didn't look very friendly and were in fact quite annoyed when we asked them to call us when someone delivered something to the hotel.. Not a major problem but usually the service experienced in Bali is good.. Oh well. Overall not a bad stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
1955,"Not great, better options in Seminyak",20,July 2015,"We stayed 1 night here after our flight was cancelled. After staying at the Vasanti in Seminyak and 4 nights in Ubud, U Paascha was not a great way to end our wonderful trip.

There was an awful smell in our room and the hallways which was a bit like the smell of bore water. The rooms were very basic for the price but probably the worst part was the service.

There was one lady who seemed to be the manager that was helpful but other than her the staff seemed undertrained and unhelpful. We had difficulty in making an international call which ended up costing $72.00. At the other hotel we stayed at they did not charge anything.

For the service, cleanliness, and value we would definitely choose Vasanti over U Paascha.",U Paasha Seminyak
1956,Good hotel and great location,40,June 2015,"We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Best buffet breakfast that we had in Bali. The rooms are quite large and spacious.

We had a few mainly minor issues including:
- The rooms were nice yet the design means that the toilets are not very separated from the room.
- There was also a bit of a funky smell in some of the common areas.
- The rooftop pool is nice yet not enough sun bed.
- Rooms on the 2nd floor don't have a great view.",U Paasha Seminyak
1957,Alibi Bar,50,June 2015,"We randomly stopped at Alibi Bar (attached to this hotel) and then returned the following night. THe staff were friendly and kept the drinks and food coming. Mojitos were buy 2 get one free which we learned after the second ones when the waitress said we were each entitled to a free drink. The bar food was yummy - recommend the sliders. The staff remembered us when we returned (and it wasn't because we were badly behaved). There is a nice area to sit, eat & drink outside as you watch the world bustle by in Seminyak. The inside of the bar was empty and looked rather dodgy - don't let this put you off :)",U Paasha Seminyak
1958,Average,30,June 2015,"We choose to stay with UPaasha because of their 24hr service concept .

Pros :
- Allow late check out with no charges , our flight is at 7pm and U Paasha approved us to check out at 5pm. So that we can have a quick shower before flying back home.
- Rooftop pool
- Room is very spacious
- location , sitting in the center of seminyak , walking distance to the beach and restaurants.
- free welcome drinks at hotel's bar

Cons :
- Poor wifi
- cleanliness of the room :

Wardrobe sliding doors mirrors were damaged , not sure if this is the design to make it more industrial look but i don't feel comfortable with it.

Funny smells from shower and toilet bowl area . Multiple stains were found in the towels , bathrobes and bed linens , that are look old and tired , greyish and yellowish. Face and hand towels were missing . This is so not acceptable despite we are staying in a 4 stars luxury hotel. Even a 2 stars standard will be better than this.

House keeping is very poor , they don't tidy up the room even though we already turned on the cleaning service light during our check out day. Requested to have a fresh towel but were told that they are run out of linens. How can this possible ?

In overall , our stay with UPaasha were below average and we will not choose to stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1959,Would recommend to all!,50,May 2015,"I love this hotel. I have stayed at lots of different hotels in Bali, different star ratings, locations and price ranges, and I think this hotel is great. This is our second time there. I read a review before I stayed the first time saying that it wasn't a very 'family friendly' hotel for people with small children.... I would totally disagree with that statement. We stayed with two small children and I found it a very user friendly hotel. The rooms are large, the staff are very helpful. The pool is beautiful and there was never a shortage of pool chairs (which I have found to be a BIG problem at other hotels) the pool has all day sun. The breakfasts are amazing and cannot be faulted. The only thing I would like to see changed at this hotel (and many other hotels in Bali) is the little bottles of shampoo and conditioner and moisturiser, I would really like to see a more environmentally friendly alternative, there is no need for those millions of plastic bottles to go in the garbage every day, maybe re-fillable dispensers in the showers or something? Just an idea. Love this hotel, great location, near shop and restaurants. The gym is the best hotel gyms I have ever been to. The beds are huge and very comfortable. Traffic a bit of a nightmare, but like that on every road in Bali these days. Would highly recommend.",U Paasha Seminyak
1960,"Best location in Seminyak, unbelievable customer service!",50,June 2015,"While U Paasha is not the most luxurious venue in Seminyak, I doubt there is a hotel in a better location. That said, you will not be disappointed with the U Paasha experience; accommodation was cheap, the standard rooms are huge, the breakfast is comprehensive, the room service is inexpensive and quick, but the customer service is up there with the best I have ever experienced in Asia. The rooftop pool was very popular and again, the superior customer service only added to our sun-soaking experience - whether that was the steadfast delivery of a cocktail or just a general chat with the well-natured employees. Add transfers to and from the airport, complimentary alcoholic beverages on arrival, and their all day breakfast offer it is hard to complain.

All-in-all, it was a very comfortable stay. We are definitely coming back!",U Paasha Seminyak
1961,Wished we stayed longer!,50,June 2015,"Absolutely loved our stay here at U Paasha. We stayed for 3 nights and unfortunately was far too short. Right from the start with reservation enquiries directly with the hotel Surya on Reservations was amazing. Check out their websites for special deals. We got their anniversary package and got free cocktails and massage. It was a nice little added bonus.

The hotel is modern. Room and even bathroom area was very spacious and open with basic amenities provided. The personalised options such as being able to choose your own soap fragrance was a nice touch. Best part for my fiancée was the bed!!! Some may or may not know Asians tend to like hard mattresses and so most of the other hotels like our previous one before U Paasha had quite a hard mattress. The option on what type of pillow (Luxury duck down pillow, soft micro fibre pillow or medium firm polyester pillow was fantastic. I chose a feather one for my fiancée and a soft microfiber one for me. Good strong wifi in the rooms too which was handy for us when trying to Skype our son.

Facilities there were great! The rooftop pool isn't huge but never felt over-crowded. The view from the pool and the restaurant/bar (slightly hidden at the back) has a great sunset view. I recommend heading up there just before sunset for a nice cocktail. The restaurant usually has some sort of dinner buffet on. Don't miss the bbq meat one. We saw the spread being laid out and it was mouth-watering. The staff made such an effort laying it all out. Unfortunately we missed it and was a mistake.

Breakfast was great as well! Offered a great selection for all different taste buds. Option for cappuccino and lattes were available instead of just black coffee which I was so grateful for.

I couldn't fault the staff. Everywhere we went in the hotel whether it was the pool, reception or breakfast even the guards at the front gate were all fantastic.

Needless to say I definitely plan on returning.",U Paasha Seminyak
1962,"Modern,clean hotel in the heart of Seminyak",40,June 2015,"This hotel is in the heart of Seminyak town with shops, salons and restaurants surrounding it. The staff was attentive, friendly and helpful. The room came with daily breakfast and water replenished in the room something that is very necessary while in Bali. The breakfast made it easy for us to wake up early get a bite to eat before heading out for the day.
The rooms were very spacious with a cute oval seating area and very clean, modern interior furnishings. The bathroom was also very spacious and modern.
The pool was very large with enough room for everyone. The view from the pool was incredible as you could see the town around you and the ocean from far. The fitness center was also a good size compared to other hotels around, some didn't even have a fitness center.
Enjoyed staying here and would recommend to families and couples visiting the area.",U Paasha Seminyak
1963,Excellent Location,40,January 2015,"U Paasha, was great value for money and exceeded all expectations. Rooms were huge, clean and well maintained. The roof top pool is just beautiful with lovely views and waiter service for food and drinks.
Breakfast was excellent, very fresh with a wide variety of on offer. The 'all you can eat' bbq available from the roof top restaurant was really good, I would recommend eating there. All food was cooked in front of you and staff were exceptional.
The hotel is located on a street full of bars and restaurants, so you don't have to go far to enjoy Seminyak.
We walked most places from here, it was about 20 mins to potato head beach club. The beach is about 10 mins walk.",U Paasha Seminyak
1964,Perfect stay for sole traveller on business,50,June 2015,"I stayed 3 nights at Upaasha while on business trips on my own.
I felt completely comfortable and safe .
This hotel is perfect location if you want to be in the heart of Seminyak.
Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.
Rooms are huge and fabulous design.
I've got to say I've travelled many countries and stayed at plenty of hotels but I have never seen such a huge selection of breakfast to choose from. Any type of coffees are at service for no extra charge.
The Upaasha completely goes out of their way to make you feel completely comfortable and top service is always at hand with a gorgeous smile.
Thank you so much to all the staff .
A special thank you to one young staff member who I can't remember his name that was just wonderful .
I will definitely be back",U Paasha Seminyak
1965,Best pool in Seminyak,50,June 2015,"Lush hotel. super comfy beds, spotless rooms.
Location is right in the middle of the action but the rooms are super quiet.
The rooftop pool is absolutely magnificent. Service around the pool is amazing and you can swim all night. I'm definitely coming back.
So affordable too!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1966,Luxurious Hotel with attention to detail.,50,May 2015,Staff were outstanding. Hotel stay is for 24 hours so checkout is at the time you check in i.e. 2pm checkin/check out 2pm the next day. Lovely rooftop pool and bar. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are huge. View from hotel balcony was a little disspointing and slight smell in shower/bathroom but standard for Bali. Can pick room scent and flavour soap. Breakfast was great with heaps of options. Already booked again for November (2015) : ),U Paasha Seminyak
1967,Cheap and decent,40,July 2014,"Good location in the centre of Seminyak, comfortable (and quite spacious) room, good breakfast.

Decent pool considering that its a small/narrow hotel that they still make space for pool in the rooftop.

Stay here if you are coming to Bali for party weekends but not so much for relaxation.",U Paasha Seminyak
1968,Fabulous in a great location,50,May 2015,"Having not long returned home from my Stay at U Paasha, I have told my friends and family if they ever go to Bali they have to stay at this hotel, everything was just perfect, the bedrooms were a great size with the most comfiest of beds and pillows, I had the best sleep ever in the two weeks I was there no noise air on in our room, like others have reported...Breakfast is great with a wide range of choices the Lattes were great along with the Omlettes...also the check in check out is a great idea, wish more hotels would use this..
The staff well what can I say they were absolutely fantastic, everyone was so lovely always smiling they couldn't do enough for you, up at the rooftop pool there was a young Guy call Gede he is such a lovely person with a great personality, he served us our Bintangs and cocktails everyday always with a smile and a chat, thank you Gede and your colleagues for making our stay so memorable...
The location was in a busy street with loads of shops and trendy restaurants Ultimo the Italian restaurant was beautiful, along with Ginger Moon, and just a short walk along the road is Mamasan and Frankenstiens all fabulous all at reasonable prices..
I will defiantly return to U Paasha..",U Paasha Seminyak
1969,Stunning location and roof top pool,40,June 2015,"Stayed at Upaasha for 1 night with a large group of friends. On the whole our experience was very positive. I have stayed just off Laksmana before but Upassha is right in the middle of things and literally a stones throw to amazing restaurants like Chandi and Ginger Moon.
Welcome drink consists of 2 vouchers for their Alibi bar which is on the street level with a great outdoor area prefect for watching the world go by. 1 voucher is for a free juice, soft drink or beer and the second if 20% off your next visit.
The roof top bar is so calm and genuinley inviting. Great place for a pre-breakfast dip. So glad we made the effort after spending all afternoon down 'relaxing'at the alibi bar.
Our room was great. No issues. We were on level 3 fairly close the the main evelvator. It was huge with a sensational bed (soo comfy). Bathroom was clean and air con worked brilliantly. There were rust spots on the mirror and some of the concrete finished not perfect. I know this matters to some people, thats why I mention it. To be everything was fine.
My sister's room was a bit of a disaster though. Their key didn't work so at midnight they needed to get them re-activated. Their toilte flooded and they needed a plummer and their shower pressure was non existent. They were in room 321, from memory.
I was very happy with the hotel and will prob stay again. Great location, comfoy bed and a tastey breakfast!",U Paasha Seminyak
1970,It would have been a 5 except for...,40,June 2015,"My partner and I stayed at the U-Paasha for 4 nights. The location is great and the rooms are beautiful and huge! One of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. However, our room was on the first floor and looked at a brick wall. There were constant renovations going on while we were staying here which were very noisy and made lying by the pool not as relaxing, even though the pool and other facilities are great. For the last 2 nights of our stay there was loud water pouring down the side of the building that was landing outside of our room, not sure if maybe they were cleaning the rooftop pool? The air conditioning in the room was also very loud and I got two splinters from the weaved mat at the end of the bed.",U Paasha Seminyak
1971,Love it!,50,November 2014,"We stayed at this lovely hotel last year. The rooms are very spacious, clean and stylish. The customer service was excellent from all the staff. We loved the beautiful pool on the rooftop where you can order drinks and food poolside while you lounge in the sun. Bathroom is spacious and has a nice large shower.The breakfast had a nice selection and yummy food. Hotel is large and quite modern. We would definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1972,Disappointing,20,April 2015,"Located on a narrow street with over rated and over priced shops and restaurants. We arrived in the evening to a rather dark looking lobby, which gave us the impression to enter a dark high ceiling cave. Rooms are spacious, but that is actual all there is. Air condition was noisy, but after 2 nights we got used to it. Overall finishing of the rooms and the hotel is far below par, joints of floor and walls and ceiling and walls has large gaps. Stains in the stone/marble floor in hall ways, in front of elevators and in the room, probably left from during construction ?
Wardrobe sliding doors has large mirrors, these mirrors were all damaged. The large lounge chair in the room had a big dirty stain in it. Sheets, pillow cases and towels were all grey and dirty looking and with spots in it. Not fresh and crisp as you would expect from a hotel just open for two years. It was also a hit and miss with the towels that were provided, there was not one day we received a complete set, every day we either had face cloth or hand towels missing. But what put me off the most was that on one day we were given a bath towel with a hole in it big enough for me to put my fist through. Seriously ! Who is supervising the housekeeping staff ? Doors of shower and toilet do not close completely and are large glass doors on small hinges, and accident is prone to happen.
Breakfast was ok and is served next to the lobby, or actually in the lobby which can be noise with people checking out or in during breakfast hours. The breakfast spread is average but the breads and pastries provided are fresh and tasty. Coffee and tea is served to you fresh, which is good. Tables are not always set when you arrive and have items missing. As the area is rather too small to handle all guests should most come at the same time, staff is struggling in finding an empty table for you. This area was also the restaurant for lunch and dinner, however, we noticed that during the five days we stayed here we never saw tables laid or staff present. So we figured it out that this restaurant was probably closed and only used for breakfast. The hotel has a concept for 24 hours use of the room and a choice for bathroom amenities and pillows, breakfast anytime anywhere, tea and music. Sadly this was never explained to us, but on looking to their website more clearly we noticed this added extra service. Which is a nice touch, as long as they tell this to you. We noticed that the clientele of this hotel is almost all Australians, and also noticed many Australians in this part of Bali. Staff is friendly and helpful, but people all over Indonesia are friendly and helpful. We did not checked out the pool as we went out every day so cannot comment on that area. We stayed many times in Bali but never in the west part of the island. Would we return again? Probably not to either Seminyak, Kuta or Jimbaran as there are far nicer and more quite areas and hotels or resorts in the south and east of Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
1973,It would have been 5 but...,20,June 2015,"[ROOFTOP RESTAURANT REVIEW] my partner and I both got food poisoning just hours later after getting back to our villa (nothing else consumed I might add before the cause is highlighted as something else such as ""sea water"" or ""ice""). We went for the bbq at the rooftop restaurant and whilst there we had a great time and everything about it was very enjoyable. You choose the meats and they cook it for you and bring it to you but unfortunately hours later we both awoke with food poisoning. In hindsight we realised that they handled raw meat along with other items on the salad bar which is a recipe for disaster if gloves aren't changed between cooked and uncooked food! It's such a shame as we actually had a good time whilst there but being ill has now spoilt part of our holiday! The food hygiene in Bali has been on the whole excellent and at the relative price was a disappointment.",U Paasha Seminyak
1974,nice hotel with large room!,40,December 2014,"the best about this hotel is the 24hours policy using the room. u can check out at the same time u check in. u can also breakfast at anytime u want. very suitable when u got lazy and woke up at day time. Size of the room. very large. its clean, very friendly staff. located center of seminyak. very close to other attraction in seminyak. they have a very nice pool with city vew at the roof top, unfortunately the pool its not very deep.. good for tanning, but not for swimming.",U Paasha Seminyak
1975,"Amazing, everything was amazing",50,May 2015,"Everything about this hotel is amazing, the people, the rooms, the pool, the bars, the beds, the pillows. Everything, I can not find a fault, it is in a really great location also.
We were lucky enough to be invited to a celebration on the roof top (for their anniversary) this included free drinks and snacks but also we got to meet some of the staff from the hotel and got to know them and enjoyed learning more about Bali. I will visit again.
oooh and the buffet breakfast - soooo good!! waffles, pancakes, crepes, eggs, pretty much everything you can imagine and more.",U Paasha Seminyak
1976,AMAZING rooftop pool!,50,June 2015,"We decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a couple of nights at U Paasha at the end of our trip. We stayed at Amadea down the road earlier in our holiday which was fantastic so we had high expectations of U Paasha being that they are more expensive and class themselves as a 4 star hotel. Apart from the roof top pool I don't believe they offered much more than Amadea. The room was big but a little run down and dated with the odd bit of wear and tear and a little grubby. The breakfast was great, lots of options, I particular enjoyed the fruit, raw nuts and dried fruits available and the fresh juice. We had the BBQ dinner at the hotel one night which was great, all you can eat and great food, lots of options, seafood, meats, salads etc. We used the gym each morning which was a great wee gym to use while on holiday, nothing fancy but all you need, it needs better aircon though. Location is perfect, you couldn’t ask for a better location. WiFi can be a little slow in bedrooms but generally was fine. The pool is the best thing about this hotel, its big with great views and great service, I wish I brought my goggles to swim lengths in the morning as its defiantly big enough for fitness.

I'd like to make special mention of two staff members who made our stay particularly memorable, pool boys/waiters Gede and Alan. They were lovely young men, hardworking, passionate about their jobs and committed to the hotel. We enjoyed our daily chats about Bali and learning about their culture and experiences. They went out of their way to make our stay and others memorable, their level of service was exceptional. Their energy and general pleasure to be at work was heartening and really put things in perspective for my husband and I. These young men earn probably no more than 5% of what someone in New Zealand would yet they generally love their jobs with not a stress or worry in the world, we could all learn a lot from the Balinese people.

Over all the hotel was great, I’d give it a 4.5/5",U Paasha Seminyak
1977,Huge room... comfy bed!,40,March 2015,"I booked this hotel as a treat to my friend and i on the last couple of days of our holiday.
It's not an easy hotel to spot at night when you are cruising down the road at a snails pace and there are people, bikes and cars surrounding you. It is set back but there is a giant sign out front. The other giveaway is the thumping music from the bar below.
It is a stones throw from food and shopping. A great little spot. But not near a beach.
We booked the penthouse and were positioned in the front penthouse facing the street and mountains which you can see on a clear day.
The room is massive. Beautiful. The bathroom is lovely and adequate as is the open wardrobe. There is so much room you just want to jump from couch to bed to couch (well i did).
The choice of pillows and the comfortable bed make going to sleep easy and waking up difficult. It was my favorite part.
Having access to the minibar included in the price is smart. No need to freak out at the bill at the end if the staff remember it was included upon checking out. That issue was easily resolved by the front desk staff.
The pool is not as big as in the pictures but it is fabulous having a roof top pool. The view is sensational but the wooden floorboards are scorching hot up there. It closes early but we managed a sneaky late night swim and were met with cheerful others out for a dip. On a full moon, you can see the silhouettes of your surrounds coupled with the lights and music of seminyak.
I dont love seminyak. It is not my kind of area. But i do like this location.
Breakfast is ok. Lots of variety but i found i was trying to guess what some of the items were.
The egg station.... you order and go back you your table and the staff bring it to you. I found this odd because by the time my egg arrived, the rest of the food was cold or i had snacked away on it.
The only gripes i have were
a: during the night, we thought we were being robbed after waking up to some creepy noises. It is not possible to get robbed due to the prison like bars surrounding the room ... it turned out to be plaster crumbling off the wall in the wardrobe
b: the tiny balcony and the prison like bars surrounding the room... however you have floor to ceiling glass and views that remind you that you are not in a prison (and the minibar)... and it's impossible to be robbed
c: a funny smell comes from the shower. Making use of you selected fragrant bathroom products fixes this.
I didn't love my stay but i did not hate it.
I would stay here again because overall, it is lovely and in such a handy spot.
If you want a hotel where you want to enjoy the bedroom... then the penthouse would be ideal. No bath though.",U Paasha Seminyak
1978,"Wonderful location, great flexibility!",50,June 2015,"Five star location, near to everything! Great restaurants like cafe bali, ultimo right at your doorstep. The hotel has a great policy where you have 24h to the room, so if you check in at 6pm you can check out 6pm the next day which I think is really convenient. Complimentary in room breakfast service as well.",U Paasha Seminyak
1979,Great staff and great location,40,May 2015,"Stayed at U Paasha for 4 nights with my wife. The check-in was very smooth and efficient. Rooms, large and clean. I know Seminyak quite well and the location is very handy for all the shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Kiki at the front desk was really helpful at check out time. He made sure we were well looked after during our stay. We're definitely going to go there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1980,Great location and hotel for the price,40,June 2015,"It's in the middle of everything... the pool is not very deep but the hotel is modern, very clean and convenient with great service. Highly recommended............. ................ ..............................................",U Paasha Seminyak
1981,great hotel central to all the eateries you need,50,May 2015,"This hotel had great rooms, attentive staff and a wonderful breakfast and roof top bar.
Our stay included free drinks, massages and hotel transfers.
The location of the hotel is perfect, accross the road from Chandi, Ginger moon and walking distance to Ku de ta. Would definitely stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
1982,Great hotel great location,50,May 2015,Loved this hotel in eat street opposite our favourite restaurants in Seminyak. Huge luxurious room and bathroom with great rooftop bar and pool. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. Only negative was the poor water pressure in the shower. Very comfy beds and pillows.,U Paasha Seminyak
1983,Great location at a reasonable rate,40,May 2015,"We had a great stay at U Paasha. The location was perfect for us- close to the restaurants we wanted to visit and adjacent to the shops. The rooftop pool more then met our expectations, we spent quite a few hours each day there. The service was good and the prices reasonable. The pool was very clean and there are quite a few lounges there.
The rooms are modern & contemporary with large showers, I've seen a number of other reviews complaining about the proximity of the toilet to the sleeping area, this didn't seem an issue for us. The rooms that are odd numbered are located on the beach side but you need to be on the upper levels to get a glimpse of the water. As for the levels it seems there is no level 4- not sure why but the better rooms in regard to noise are the rooms towards the back of the hotel. We requested an odd numbered room near the pool and managed to get 517. This was perfect for us, straight out of the room and up a flight of stairs to the rooftop pool. Another great feature of the hotel is the checkout time. This is based on your check in time- if you check I n at 6pm you can checkout up till 6pm on the day you leave. This is great if you have an evening flight out of Bali and you plan your check in time accordingly.
The breakfasts are as you'd expect with all the usual suspects on offer. Service was good and we had no problems with communicating with the staff.
Overall this is a boutique hotel with a good pool and great location if you're into the restaurants and shops around Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1984,Amazing!!,50,May 2015,"Perfect location walking distance to everything you need in Seminyak. Very friendly staff were always willing to help. Rooftop pool is great, and so is the all day breakfast included in the price. Lovely rooms and cosy king beds! Will definitely be back!!",U Paasha Seminyak
1985,"Location, rooms, staff",50,May 2015,"Firstly i'd like to say thank you to the very helpful staff at the front desk who gave us lots of helpful tips in regards to exploring town. The location is PERFECT if you are a foodie and a beach goer! The beach is 10 minutes walk from the hotel. It is located in the centre of Eat Street which is where all the popular restaurants are located. Walking distance to spas and beach clubs too. Took us a bit less than 10 minutes to walk to Ku De Ta and 20 minutes to Potato Head via beach.

You do get a bit of traffic noise at night as it is in the central, but it is definitely bearable as it doesn't go til late.

The room was spacious and modern! We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite on the top floor and it was even more spacious and we felt so comfortable and relaxed in our room.

The roof top pool was amazing too! great relaxing spot!

We would definitely come back and stay here for our next stay and would definitely recommend to friends!",U Paasha Seminyak
1986,"Central location, spacious rooms",40,April 2015,"We stayed at U Paasha for 2 nights before we flew out of Bali. The rooms are very modern and spacious - beds very comfortable - and the hotel is very good with late check out requests. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1987,"Not bad, Not great.",30,May 2015,"We booked this hotel for our honeymoon and were looking forward to our first time in Bali. On first look this hotel is impressive, the reception/lobby area is lovely and the rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. On closer look, nothing has been finished off properly and everything is a little sub-par. The glass doors to the shower and toilet were clearly far too heavy for the hinges that held them to the wall and I was somewhat worried the door might fall off and shatter!

The bad:
1.There are tripping hazards everywhere in the hotel and I don't know how many times myself and my husband tripped e.g. varying heights in steps and slight difference in floor height from the toilet to the area outside the toilet (basically a little lip on the floor. - Toilets at pool bar and on ground floor).
2.There were mosquitoes in our room and we both got bitten several times. There were also some ants around the tea/coffee making area.
3.The hotel only provides 2 bath towels to the room, there are no hand towels and no face towels. We requested 2 hand towels and were given 2 more bath towels which were taken away by the maid a short time later.
4.We requested an iron and ironing board on the first morning and were told it wasn't available until 6pm. It never arrived.
5.There is very little water pressure to the shower.
6.Breakfast wasn't bad, but we weren't blown away by it either.

The good:
1.The staff were very nice and very attentive, especially in the bars/restaurants.
2.The food was very nice in the restaurants also - especially the sliders. Cocktails were also very nice too.
3.The bed was extremely comfortable.
4.The location of the hotel is great for shopping & dining, close to a range of bars and restaurants.

Overall, we felt that this hotel was too expensive for the prices they are charging. It really feels as though they are trying to deliver the best they can with what they have, but the prices are certainly too high.

We actually cut our trip short because we were disappointed with our overall experience in Bali and I doubt we will return.",U Paasha Seminyak
1988,Great location,40,May 2015,"The hotel is situated in the heart of Seminyak so we didn't have to take taxis anywhere. The staff spoke great English and were very helpful. The room was very spacious with a great bathroom. The bed sheets did have some stains and housekeeping forgot to leave us bath towels but overall it was a great experience . The food menu in the hotel was good but I was disappointed that Albens Cider wasn't on the drinks menu as it's made in Bali. Breakfast was good, lots of options to choose from. I would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1989,Good value for money and great staff,50,April 2015,"Have stayed here a couple times now and happy with both stays. We recommended that our wedding guests stay here our last time around and we stayed there when we weren't at our wedding villa.

Gindo and Harry (GM and Manager) are very easy to deal with and accommodating. All the other staff are very pleasant to work with. They added some thoughtful personal touches to our room and gave us some nice little displays, snacks and champagne as a wedding present All of our guests who stayed there were quite happy with it as well. Big rooms and great location. Not on the beach but for the price you wouldn't expect it to be. Good rooftop pool too. Thanks to Harry, Gindo and the rest of the staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
1990,100% recommend this hotel!,50,February 2015,"Upon arrival and after a friendly welcoming by staff I was immediately impressed by this hotel.The modern & contemporary architecture was breathtaking. I personally admired the use of texture and space in the design. Brilliant. For lovers of art the ground floor corridor doubles as an art gallery featuring work of several artists from around the world. Within a short time of our arrival we were taken to our room. The rooms are large and spacious with the hotel aesthetic consistent right through to the bathroom. Not only is the hotel new and fresh it is also very clean which is super important also. After being wowed by our beautiful room we ventured up to the rooftop to explore the pool & gym. Firstly the view is 360 and secondly the pool couldn't have been more inviting! Again the pool staff where welcoming, especially smiley. You'll know who he is when you see him! Location is great, imminently in the vicinity of restaurants and Seminyak square. It's very easy to get around from this point. Lastly I would like to mention the buffet breakfast. The choice of food was vast, they even had a pancake station amongst everything else on offer. I will definitely be staying here again! So overall a very positive experience!",U Paasha Seminyak
1991,Very Impressed!,50,May 2015,The U Paasha is located in a great spot within walking distance to Seminyak Square and lots of great Restaurants and cafes. The rooms are really fresh and great sized. All the amenities in the room are up to the latest quality and the bed was very comfortable. The only negative I would have to say with the room is the balcony is a little small for the size of the room and the massive corridors could have been brought in a metre to get the balcony area made bigger. The pool area was really nice and had great sun during the day and had shaded options too. The daily breakfast at the hotel was good and would I will be defiantly returning back to the U Paasha on my next visit to Bali.,U Paasha Seminyak
1992,Absolutely fantastic.,50,May 2015,"We stayed here for four nights and were really impressed. I booked directly with the hotel but asked for them to match the best rate advertised at the time with Expedia which was no problem for them. The rooms are huge, so much space which was great to spread out. Our room had a slight smell to it, nothing major and you got used to it once being in there for five minutes. Bed was really comfy, wi-fi was too slow for downloading but great for browsing, no noise from outside which was great too.
Bathroom is huge as well, make sure you stay here with someone you are super comfortable with, or by the end of the trip you will be comfortable. The toilet is pretty open and has a door which doesn't go to the ceiling so that in itself isn't sound/smell proof. That would be my only real critique of the stay though but definitely liveable!
The rooftop pool was great. Breakfast was wonderful especially the waffles. We had room service for dinner one night which was nice, but definitely better to go out and try all the amazing restaurants on Eat Street below. We tried the traditional platter for lunch one day too which was incredible and HUGE. Would highly recommend that before going into a food coma.
Service all around the hotel was incredible from the wait staff to security.
It was the perfect hotel and centrally located. When we come back to Bali I would definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1993,Rooftop pool area is amazing,40,May 2015,"Hotel is in great area,big rooms, friendly staff, good b/fast and room service.

My room was level 5 under the pool area, every morning i could hear something like a dragging noise from about 6am. Also dogs barking outside at all hours and very noisey a/c. Yukky smell comes from shower when you first turn it on. My a/co was leaking water from the roof onto the floor into a massive puddle one night but it was promptly repaired. Oh and dont leave food out anywhere as they have a bad ant problem. I found this in the room and in pool area.

The pool area! Amazing! Made me glad i chose this hotel over the Ize. Full sun but lots of shade too. Yummy food, happy hour drink special. Relaxing music by day,funky house music at night. Definitely best bit of the hotel! I spent a lot of time up there!
Would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
1994,Lots of room for improvement!,30,May 2015,"U Paasha is well located in the middle of Jalan Seminyak and within walking distance to many great eateries and bars. Room size is a massive plus, the rooftop pool has panoramic views (and all day sun!) of the Seminyak surroundings and of course the staff are very friendly and prompt with attending to your requests. So now you're asking yourself, why does he give this place 3 stars?
I'm disappointed with the upkeep of this hotel and how it's slipped over the last couple of years. To start with, the upkeep of pool area is very average. Algae is growing everywhere and there was even the odd broken tile in the middle of the pools. The timber decking looks old and weathered and there's very little greenery sounding this place. The rooms, they're large and we like that. What I don't understand is why would they design a corridor (that separates the rooms on either side of the hotel) wide enough to drive a bus through it, and leave our sad balconies less than 1 meter wide?
Hand towels get given if they've washed enough from yesterday. Sometimes we had it and sometimes not - where's the consistency?
I also thought by now that they would've nailed a flushing toilet - apparently not.
The hotels breakfast spread is terrible (personal opinion). I get it, I'm a foodie so I'm not about to settle of some oily omelet or lukewarm Singapore noodle when there's so many brilliant cafes serving up sensational options for $6-$7!
A hotel that's 2 years young should be getting these things right.
While I'm being fairly harsh on this review, keep in mind that $170 and night doesn't buy you too much in Seminyak anymore, so yes I'm nagging for perfection (and we know they can do it), but I'd probably still stay there again - hence why they're not doing anything about it.",U Paasha Seminyak
1995,Good place to stay in Seminyak,40,November 2014,"A cool and modern mid-level hotel in a good location. The rooms are very clean and good size for two adults with a kid. Helpful staff and management with an amazing rooftop pool. The breakfast was good with Asian and Western food options.
All in all a good stay and recommended place",U Paasha Seminyak
1996,Seminyak's trendy hotel,40,April 2015,"Unique points:
1. You can choose your soap scents upon arival
2. Open plan bathroom- bedroom.

Room: very spacious

Location: confiniently located amongst endless dining options. There is also a good massage place just 3 mins walkimg distance.

Breakfast buffet:
Some of the menu changed daily, mostly stay the same though. Love the fluffy pancake.

The only negative part of my stay was the a/c.. It was noisy and the breeze was not cool enough. Havent got a chance to complain or move to another room, as we were Always busy travelling and it did not bother us too much.",U Paasha Seminyak
1997,Pleasant stay,40,May 2015,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my husband and we did enjoyed our stay.Our check in process was smooth. The reception girl who handle our check in was really nice and informed us that the welcome drink can be taken at the Alibi bar ( which is part of the hotel ).Our room was spacious and there was honeymoon set up in it .Our 1st day bfast was great, the F& B staff greeted us and offered us for drinks ( tea or coffee). The roof top pool also great coz you can overlooking to the sea :). However, there was something that bothered us. We asked to get bed sheet to be change. They did change the bed sheet but not the pillow cases. So i assumed their assumption of change the bed sheet not including the pillow cases??? but thats the only minor thing in this hotel, overall our stay was great .",U Paasha Seminyak
1998,Exceeds Expectations,50,May 2015,"Everything about this hotel has exceeded my expectations - from the very convenient 24 hour check in, to the very spacious rooms with the extremely comfortable bed. Day beds were always available at the rooftop pool, breakfast was included daily and with our very early checkout tomorrow we have been offered a takeaway breakfast box because we can't stay for the buffet. Nothing is too hard or too inconvenient for the lovely U Paasha staff. My only very small gripe is the air conditioner in the room runs a little loud. We will tell our friends and family to stay here next time they visit Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
1999,Superb,50,August 2014,"We had a very late check-in and got our room upraded to penthouse (yay!!). The room is veeerrry spacious and located at the highest level, just before the outdoor pool on top. Great location in Seminyak, indeed.

The great thing that we really adore is the all-time breakfast service, I don't know if it's only available on the penthouse or valid for all types of room. So basically, you can order your breakfast in your room any time of the day! No need to wake up early before the breakfast time ended. We woke up late and had our breakfast at 12-1 noon and eat it as lunch!

The only flaw is the bathroom, it's kinda cold because of the aircon but definitely not a deal breaker!",U Paasha Seminyak
2000,"Excellent hotel, superb value",50,April 2015,"The U Paasha is in a brilliant location is you enjoy the great restaurants and bars in Seminyak, also very close to the fab Revolver coffee shop. We usually stay at another large and lovely but expensive hotel in Legian but have now found a 'new' home in the U Paasha. The rooms are spacious, clean and have everything you need. Our room was quiet - contrary to some reviews we had read. The roof top pool was fantastic, with plenty of sun lounges and great bar staff, great cocktails too!",U Paasha Seminyak
2001,very spacious room,40,May 2015,"I normally stay in a villa in seminyak but this time i decided to try this hotel. Surprisingly the room is quite big and comfy.The service is excellent,the staff are very friendly and helpful. They have a lot of choices for breakfast which is great. Location wise for me it's perfect because seminyak is a busy street with many choices of restaurants and bars.However if you like quiet place than this is not the one for you because it can get a little bit noisy. Will stay here again for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
2002,Great for a couple of nights in Seminyak,40,April 2015,"Amazing roof top pool, really friendly and helpful staff, epic breakfast buffet. 24 hr check out is brilliant idea. wifi not so strong in the rooms & sound proofing in rooms not so good, we were floor 5. Overall a good option for 1 or 2 nights in the hubbub of Seminyak to check out the shops etc & would stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2003,Ok For A Night Or Two,40,April 2015,"The best thing about this hotel is it's 24 hour check out. Arrived at 11.30 pm and left at 10.30pm the next day. Only left the hotel for lunch the next day as everything is there for you. However, this is not a Bali experience. No beautiful gardens or feeling like your away from it all. Not geared up for families, which personally on this one night stop over was nice and peaceful. Rooms were good and location great if you just want to eat and shop. If you want a little more of a genuine tropical holiday, then look else where.",U Paasha Seminyak
2004,Noisy,30,April 2015,"This is the fifth time I've stayed here. Great location for work. Just a quick 1 night stay. Thankfully.
Was 'upgraded' to penthouse , big mistake. Was so loud from thumping nightclub downstairs that no one attends anyway , until 1am. We could hear the phone ringing in reception. All night.
Great view.... To the roof outside.
Having said that, room is ok. Staff are great . And it's good for late checkout. ie u check out the same time of day u check in.
Ok for a cheap, quick stay but would not be my choice for a holiday. Great locale if u r a shopper.
Always ask for a room at the back of building on ocean side.",U Paasha Seminyak
2005,Great location,40,November 2014,"We stayed at the U Paasha last year and were pleasantly surprised by the location of this hotel. It was very central, close to shops, cafe's, restaurants and the beach. We spent a lot of time by the pool, which was lovely, or in our massive room. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. A little disappointed with the linen which all had old stains, staff changed these over when asked, and the hotel rooms which were dating (chips, peeling wallpaper etc.) and in fairly ordinary condition for such a new hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2006,Central. Good Service. Not for romance,30,September 2014,More of a party hotel. Very central. Clean. Great for singles. No balconies. Pool on the roof. We stayed for a few days. No complaints but I like a quieter location. The staff were great and helpful. Try Ginger Moon across the road. Excellent food places close by.,U Paasha Seminyak
2007,Amazing,50,April 2015,I checked in today and all I can say is wow. The staff are wonderful and attentive. Always smiling and great to chat to. The rooms are huge and very stylish. Love the roof top pool with views to the coast and Seminyak. I love the decor of the lobby. Close to everything in Seminyak this is truly a wonderful hotel. This is a must stay at place. I will be back for sure. Huge comfortable beds too. Can't say enough.,U Paasha Seminyak
2008,Lovely Rooms and Great Location,40,August 2014,"For a small hotel they do have the largest standard rooms I have ever seen. They're spacious and the interior has a soothing effect. The location of the hotel is also excellent, near the restos and shops and around 15 min walk to the beach. What I did find weird though was the Front Office would just give us 1 functional key card at a time. And the pool and service is amazing",U Paasha Seminyak
2009,I love love love It!,50,April 2015,"Astagaaaaa!!!
Walk into a beautiful place with happy smiles and friendly staff. All day long cold water is available and some crackers!
The buffet breakfast is the best I've ever had from anywhere and I travelled 4 months in Asia last year so I've had plenty! Everyday I ordered so much and the eggs Benedict was great and the Nutella I've never seen that before but what I really loved about breakfast was being able to order iced coffees or chocolates or anything! Fresh watermelon juice too! If you miss buffet breakfast there is a large breakfast menu you can choose from and they let me order anything which was great :)
My room was large and spacious and the aircon was perfect. The staff were helpful with my bags and their general english chit chat was great.
The security out the front always helped me get a taxi if needed or helped me cross the street.
Perfect spot on eat street! Across from cafe bali and right near la Luciola, ultimo and seminyak square. A close walk to motel mexicola and then onto petitinget with la Luciola and potato head.
A short walk to ku de ta and through to the seminyak beach. Along the beach its a close walk to double six and the beach bars such as la plancha!
We were there for a wedding so many member of family and friends stayed here. I did not stay here my second week in bali but they were very hospitable to me and let me through with my bags and looked after them whilst we waited for our plane because my parents were still in the hotel.
Another great thing about this hotel is the all day check out! There is no specific time to check out so you don't have to worry about your luggage or anything if you have a late flight!

2010,"Brilliant Hotel, will definitely go back!",50,April 2015,"U Paasha is a beautiful hotel, located right in the centre of Seminyak. It is clean and spacious and the staff go above and beyond to help you. Roof top pool is nice and chilled. Had breakfast in bed every morning which was lovely. The beds are so good as well.

All in all, if you are looking for a lovely place to stay in a great location, this is it!",U Paasha Seminyak
2011,Awesome Roof Top Pool,50,April 2015,"Huge rooms, giant bed. Very quiet.Great choice for breakfast. Book a room on the sea side.We stayed in 303. Very attentative staff. Walk to beach. Its on eat street so plenty of choice for shopping and restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
2012,Right hotel - Wrong room,20,April 2015,"There is a lot to like about this hotel & I did like almost everthing.
All the good stuff is true - the hotel in in the best part of seminyak for restaurants, shopping & nightlife. The rooms are well presented in a modern way with spacious bathrooms, large walk in showers and comfortable beds.
The TV's are big screen & have a massive selection of good stations while the WiFi was of adequate speed & able to be accessed in all parts of the hotel (breakfast, lobby, pool).
Breakfast was good for a small hotel - wide selection across western & asian tastes. Of note was the indo/asian food - especially the bubur. Coffee/tea needed to be ordered - but came quickly. The breakfast room was never crowded & food replenished well.
The pool on the rooftop was very peaceful with comfortable chairs & good relaxing music pipe around. The pool was a real drawcard.
Also there is a great rooftop bar with wonderful cocktails.
OK - now the bad (& boy it was bad).
We booked a room with a king bed - as a couple I always request this & it has never been a problem in the past. The first room given to us (101) had twin beds that could not be pushed together. We were assured that if we stayed overnight in this room we would be moved to a room with a king bed the next day.
This move did occure - & the new room did have a king bed (327) - but it was the noisiest room I have stayed in at any hotel - ever. Not only was the room build almost over the busy street & therefore got all the noise from this day & all night but it also got noise from reception & then from 9pm untill at least 2am every night it felt like we were standing in a nightclub the music & doof doof was so loud.
Because we had only booked 4 nights & we had already been moved & didn't realise the problem with the new room - we did not ask to be moved again. Also this room is larger - but not nearly as functional.
Normally I would not recommend a hotel I have scored so low - however everything else about this hotel is fantastic - so stay here (I plan to again) - but make sure you don't get stuck in a noisy room",U Paasha Seminyak
2013,Great hotel with wonderful staff,50,April 2015,"Ok let's get the basic stuff out of the way
This hotel is slap bang in the middle of the nightlife but we slept very well
The staff are wonderful and very attentive, going about their work with a smile
The room are very spacious with comfy beds, however the rooms with even numbers don't offer great views
The pool and pool bar is on the top floor, you must try their local cocktails...yum
A bit of a problem with obtaining sunbeds on a couple of days, I thnk there is enough space for the hotel to add some more
Useful info
£1 = 20k ish
You will need to pay 560k entering Bali and 200k leaving Bali - per person
Cost from airport is 200k the taxi drivers will try and tell you it's more
Taxi to Kuta is 50k
Try Bali Joes for a bit of cabaret.. Taxi 20k
Head for the shacks on the beach to watch the sunsets, sit on the beanbags and enjoy the live music....fantastic
Champagne Bar is a nice experience...come out of hotel and turn right, walk for 5 mins and its on the left
Market...come out of hotel turn left walk for ten mins and stay on left side of road
Free wifi in hotel
Bali, Seminyak, Kuta fantastic
Enjoy

2014,a lovely two-night stay with U Paasha,50,April 2015,"I had a lovely two-night stay with U Paasha. Since I was travelling alone, a hotel in a convenient location is more sociable for me. The breakfast and roof-top pool are great, and the most amazing thing is they have a flexible check-out hour!!!! I checked out at 6pm on the day I left!!! Not to mention their laundry service has helped me cleaned all my clothes and hiking boots which STINK since I just came back from a week hiking and the last three days were camping.",U Paasha Seminyak
2015,A lot to like about it,40,March 2015,"Good location, right in the heart of Seminyak's restaurant and shopping precinct, so there's plenty to do and see right on your doorstep. The rooms are very good - large, modern and very clean - the bathrooms in particular are huge. There are a few little touches that just aren't right though - like the quality of the towels and toilet paper, plus the water pressure in the showers. Fix these things and it would be a fantastic hotel. Aks for a room on a higher floor as they views are quite pleasant, the lower floors tend to look right onto neighbouring properties. The rooftop pool area is very cool and has great view too - a little more share up there would be good though. All up a good hotel, good value too.",U Paasha Seminyak
2016,Review,50,March 2015,This would be a 5 star experience. Everything was perfect sad to check out. Staff brilliant rooms beautiful so close to everything. So cheap would recommend to everyone. Rooftop pool beautiful. Walking distance to best restaurants and beach.,U Paasha Seminyak
2017,"Great Location, Nice Room, average entertainment and meals",40,March 2015,"We spent the first leg of our honeymoon here. To qualify, we stayed at IZE hotel just down the road as well. Our room was on the 5th floor, very large (almost double the size of IZE and IZE was not small). Loved the double sink and the shower area but the water pressure was a little low. Beds were comfy and our sheets were clean.

Breakfast was pretty decent, nothing much to shout about. Their breakfast when you want it option where you can order it to your room anytime is pretty interesting.

One thing we did notice though was the small design flaws in the hotel. If you didnt swing your door shut hard enough, it wont close fully. Those used to western hotels where you walk out the door and the door shuts fully should be carefully as there was once when we went down for breakfast and only noticed we didn't shut the door properly after breakfast. Looking over from IZE, I noticed that the exterior of the hotel was not done up at all. It's not a big deal, just an observation

Bar had a DJ but it wasn't as nice as IZE's which had a live band (we were there 2 nights) never went to U Paasha's.

In summary, the rooms were great but the atmosphere, not so much.",U Paasha Seminyak
2018,"Great food, staff and rooftop pool",50,March 2015,"One of the best hotels in Seminyak. Great food, drinks offering and an amazing roof top pool with staff who bring your drink to the pool. Staff are very friendly and hard working and food is great. Rooms are large, modern and clean and cleaned daily. A little slice of luxury!",U Paasha Seminyak
2019,Dirty rooms...,20,March 2015,"Despite a fantastic website, a beautiful entrance and friendly staff the rooms in the hotel are run down and dirty. We were surprised by this as we believe the hotel is not that old, potentially 2 or 3 years at maximum?

Upon arrival we were checked in smoothly, open terrain reception a bit hot.

Then we entered the room and were shocked. It smelled awfully, and after some inspection we found a dirty and leaking toilet. Also the bathroom was full of stains...

After a short call with reception the manager insisted on showing us a few other rooms, but one after another smelled and / or were very dirty. In one room we found blood stains on the closet, in another the toilet leaked and in another there were brown spots in the bathroom. In all of them we found marks and stains on windows, glasses and the bed.

So after seeing 6 rooms in total we decided to check out immediately, and moved to another hotel.

Staff and management were very helpful and understanding and made sure we were fully refunded. As were travel with a young baby we simply did not want to take a risk.

All in all we believe the hotel has huge potential due to the architecture, pool, and location... however they seriously need some good hygiene and cleaning otherwise guests will stay away.",U Paasha Seminyak
2020,Very convenient,40,March 2015,"The building is a 5 floors classic hotel
Don't expect for the traditional Balinese style : U Paasha is a contemporary western architecture building.
The room are quite big and comfortable.
The service is very friendly and efficient.
Everybody try to do his best to make that your stay in this hotel, Which is not the most fashionable place of Seminyak, will be perfect.
The swimming pool on the top roof is really a place of peaceful, unimaginable in the heart of Seminyak.
The hotel is very quite : you will never hear the noise of the street.",U Paasha Seminyak
2021,Central hotel with great staff good value for $$$ - Be careful of Minimart across the road,50,December 2014,"U Paasha is centrally located in Seminyak, the hotel rooms are large and staff friendly, knowledgable and eager to help (Gede the pool attendant is the man).

+ Great value for money - Breakfast and wifi included and you can check in same time you check out
+ Friendly, helpful staff
+ Large rooms (50msq for standard room)
+ Centrally located, just across the road from amazing restaurants like Chandi and down the road from MamaSan.

- Room thoroughly cleaned and staff lovely but 4/5 days linen was stained. Had been washed but still stained, should look at changing laundry chemicals.
- Not their fault, but the minimart conveniently across the road is a rip off. They tried three times to short change us and laughed it off each time.
- Rooftop food and drink not amazing. Beautiful food, but mediocre food and badly mixed drinks. Plenty of better options near by.

Overall: Great hotel and will definitely stay here again next time we are in Bali (we have booked again in June!).

Tips: Hotel price match and give 15% off if you find a better price. Book your room in IDR and pay in IDR as your bank will give you a better conversion than the hotel.
Use insect repellant on the roof top bar as the mosquitos will eat you alive.

Be careful of taxis, airport 'official tax desk' charged us 250,000 IDR to hotel when we arrived, on way back with meter it was just over 80,000 ....",U Paasha Seminyak
2022,Amazing!,50,November 2014,My partner and I stayed here for just over a week and it was perfect! The location is super convenient and the hotel itself is amazing. We especially loved the decor in the rooms and pool area was spectacular with ocean views! Would highly recommend to all friends and family!!,U Paasha Seminyak
2023,"Great Location, one of the best",50,March 2015,"My partner and I booked our first four nights in Bali at Upaasha and we enjoyed it so much that we re-booked for our last four nights. The location is great, so many great restaurants and bars at your doorstep. I recommend going to Motel Mexicola and Grocer and Grind (5 mins walk). Beach is about a 10min walk which didn't bother us as the hotels rooftop pool was amazing, temp was a little warm but what do you expect when the pool gets direct sun from the 5th level. We stayed in room 111 and 321. Didn't have any problems with noise expect in room 111 it was kind of close to breakfast area which meant you could hear a little noise in the morning. Cab to Potato Head was about $2. Cab to Kuta is about $4 and airport about $10 so getting around is cheap and easy. The hotel staff were always lovely and smiling. Our linen was clean, room was cleaned and made up daily. We left our possessions out and nothing went missing so the staff are trustworthy. Food and drinks are a little expensive but with so many cool places within walking distance we didn't eat or drink at the hotel much. Happy hour is buy 2 get 1 free which is kind of annoying when you are couple but can't complain. They did take away happy hour on Nyepi day which was a let down as we weren't allowed to leave the hotel (slient day). They also had an expensive buffet on Nyepi day which was about $33 AUD each. Overpriced considering we had no choice but to eat at the hotel. Air con was cold, shower was warm and water pressure was fine.. Overall the hotel was great, the buffet breakfast was perfect with a lot of variety. Barrista made coffee was yum. I will be back next time we are in Bali!",U Paasha Seminyak
2024,Everything great about this hotel,50,March 2015,"I am very happy that I stayed at this hotel. Staff is amazingly warm, welcoming and friendly. The room was beautiful, spacious and clean. Large variety of delicious breakfast.

The only suggestion would be to dry clean the sofas and headboard of the bed, because there were a lot of stains.

Also the balconies are not really actual balcony where you can enjoy a glass of drink. At least our balcony was very small and narrow and nowhere to sit. Almost like a French balcony.",U Paasha Seminyak
2025,Great location but needs work,30,March 2015,"the location of the hotel is great being right in the middle of Seminyak. Pluses are the pool bar on the roof which gives great views over Seminyak abd has excellent food. The entrance hall is stunning. However, downside is there is a real issue with the drains and our room stank or reeked of air freshener that the cleaners obviously used to cover up the stench. Recommend therefore not getting a room on the ground floor where it seems to be worst. Also couple of the electrical sockets were literally hanging off the wall. Not really acceptable given the cost.",U Paasha Seminyak
2026,BIG penthouse room - very nice bed,40,March 2015,"We liked the hotels overall look and it is very central placed. It was raining the days we spend so we did not use the pool. The room was clean and very big. It had a bit of a mouldy smell perhaps due to the raining.

The restaurant (we got a 20 dollar freee voucher) was not good - very average food cooked from frozen. Eat elsewhere! The breakfast was huge and average as it is for many hotels of this kind. We would prefer less selection and better quality.

The lady at check-in was very confused and insecure. She kept giving us different informations and then changing them. Later we got help from the reception which was very professional and the guy spoke good english.

Overall we can recommed the hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
2027,Loved our stay.,50,March 2015,"I just want to start by saying we had no problems with noisy aircon, stained linen or torn, shabby towels. Stayed 9 days so am surprised that if true, we did not experience same problems as other advisors have stated. Towels always fluffy. We only asked for our sheets to be changed twice during our stay (it is an eco friendly hotel and makes great sense not to wash them every day) and found no stains on the linen. And we never experienced any sewerage smells in the bathroom. We had a blockage in the toilet on the first morning, which was quickly dealt with when reported to reception, and we had no further problems with that.
We loved our stay at U Paasha and will stay there again if holidaying in this part of Bali. If you want to be right in the thick of Eat Street you won't go wrong. Staff were all friendly, helpful and professional. Special mention must be made of Alan, in the dining area each morning, and Gede in the pool bar area. Both strive to provide their customers the best possible experience and our daily interactions were a highlight of our stay. We felt very pampered. Breakfast dishes at the buffet changed daily and were of high quality, and the coffee was very good. Barista made Cappuccinos and Lattes were great.
Our room was always cleaned to a high standard. Bed was firm, but had a plush pillow top on the mattress and it was very comfortable. Pillows were just to my liking. They have pushbikes available which I made use of a few mornings. The Alibi Bar downstairs was a cool haven for a drink and I loved it's styling. The rooftop pool was refreshing and sunloungers were plentiful, though it is low season. The toilet is located just behind a glass door in an open style bathroom which we have experienced in other hotels and may be an emerging trend, so the room may be more suitable to couples, rather than just friends. This has been commented on, so if people are in the habit of researching trip advisor before staying anywhere, then they can't say they were not warned. We found the water pressure in the shower to be adequate, and the hot water always came on straight away. Wifi in the hotel is free and worked very well throughout the hotel.
We were on the 5th floor with a view to the water, at the rear of the hotel, and this area may be the pick of rooms to request. The balcony is only narrow, but I made use of it by either sitting out there on cushions, or opening the sliding doors and turning the little lounger so it faced outwards. A lovely spot to sit with a lovely breeze blowing in, a cool drink, and a good book. Highly recommend U Paasha, Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2028,Fantastic hotel in excellent location.,50,March 2015,"We stayed at UPaasha for one week and absolutely loved it.

During the booking process Surya was helpful and quick with replies and noted down all our requests. We had a fantastic room on level 5 at the back of the hotel which meant we didn't have any issues with street noise and the room was spacious with a great view. The room and hotel were all very clean.

All the staff were very friendly and attentive, making us feel comfortable and welcome. The option to have breakfast at anytime/anywhere was definitely a huge bonus and the rooftop pool was great with plenty of sun loungers. Whilst we didn't use the gym it was definitely one of the better gyms I've seen in Bali hotels.

The location was also perfect, close to lots of cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping. We would definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2029,Awesome service,50,March 2015,"Stayed for my birthday this year. Loved it. Our room was right at the stairs to the rooftop bar and pool! The service was great, especially a young man called Gede. Food from the hotel was good. the whole stay was excellent and inexpensive. Very central to everything. Even popped the q to my now fiance :-)",U Paasha Seminyak
2030,"Lovely, comfortable, great location!",50,February 2015,Stayed here with hubby for our 10th anniversary for 5 days. Loved it. Staff helpful and friendly. Room big and clean. Rooftop pool was fantastic - a great spot to relax and watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand. And so many great eating spots surrounding the hotel. Would stay here again if given another opportunity for a 'child free' holiday.,U Paasha Seminyak
2031,"""Perfect place to stay in seminyak.""",40,March 2015,"After intense hunting for perfect stay , i found U Paasha. its located right in the heart of seminyak. The moment you step out, there are too many clubs, pubs ( i found rumours and red carpet the best) and designer studios in the area. And a mini mart right opposite. Rooms are spacious and clean. Great staff (anna) .",U Paasha Seminyak
2032,Roof Top Pool,30,March 2015,"My friends and I stayed at U Paasha in Seminyak for 5 nights. First impression of the hotel was very dimly lit as we arrived at 7 pm. The lighting was very poor at the reception area, we all wondered how hotel staff could work in such poor lighting. The room was huge, the bathroom and toilet were very much open. It was very awkward when using toilet with someone in the room. Towels were shabby and the aircondition was noisy. The hotel is situated in a very busy road along Laksamana Street. The Roof Top Pool was the highlight of the hotel. It was quite nice, unfortunately pool towels were not available for every guest using the pool. There is gym at the same floor as the pool. The staff were very friendly and attentive, always eager to help us with everything we need. The breakfast was good with variety of local and western food. We just wanted to say 'Thank You' to staff of U Paasha for looking after us during our stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
2033,I would never stay here again,10,February 2015,"The location of U Paasha Seminyak is good, plenty of nice restaurants surround in this area. But there are other choices better than this overrated hotel.
1. The facilities are not good enough, several yellow spots on my bed sheets and pillows, water scales on the shower head.
2. The air-conditioner is really nosy, hard to fall asleep at night.
3. They kept me waiting at the lobby for 4 hrs after I checked in. The front office manager did apologize sincerely, and even promise me one night refund as compensation. However it's March 5 already, I haven't see any record in my account. That is highly disappointed, I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2034,Convenient and comfortable,40,March 2015,"This hotel is conveniently located amongst the hustle and bustle of the Seminyak eating and shopping strip. Modern Balinese architecture with an inviting lobby, nice restaurant spacious and reasonably priced rooms and a pleasant rooftop pool. Great value for a hotel in this price bracket.

The rooms are not 'opulent' but very comfortable. Breakfast is great and the staff are very friendly.",U Paasha Seminyak
2035,Great stay and huge size rooms!,40,December 2014,Stayed at Upaasha in Dec and was a great stay minus a few things. Rooms are great - really large however the layout is quite strange - the toilet and shower are pretty much very open - a little awkward if with friends. Only negative was the air con - nightmare! first night we were in a humid hot box however they came in next morning and regassed it and it started working perfectly - just very loud - loudest air con i have ever heard! - if you are a quiet sleeper bring ear plugs. Otherwise breakfast top notch!,U Paasha Seminyak
2036,"Great pool, great rooms",40,June 2014,"I stayed here for 2 weeks... The hotel lobby and general feel of the place is impressive! We had a warm welcome and shown to our room which was HUGE! We had a room on the top floor looking out towards the beach in the distance... The room was faultless, only bad thing I can say is the was a smell of sewerage that randomly appeared at certain parts of the day but let's face it its bali...

The pool was great brilliant place to relax.. Cocktail happy hour was also a nice surprise! The food was not the best brekfast had choice but Iv had better breakfasts in different hotels but wasn't to much of a worry as the location was perfect for all of valid best restaurants on your door step!

All in all great hotel wud stay there again",U Paasha Seminyak
2037,Good clean hotel,40,February 2015,"Stayed in feb 2015 with my boyfriend for 3 nights.
Rooms are spacious and comfortable.
Great 24 use of room where if you check in at 3pm you dont have to check our until 3pm. Great for late night flights in and out of Bali!
Breakfast was OK good options but could have done with more and some of the sweeter things and condiments had ants on them so that needs to be addressed.

Nice roof top pool with amazing staff. All very friendly.",U Paasha Seminyak
2038,Loved it. Location. Staff. Pool. Cocktails,50,February 2015,"We arrived and expectations were met by friendly staff; we really loved the security team too...always going out of their way to get you safely across the road or choose a taxi or even just welcoming you with a big smile!!
Breakfast was good. I fell in love with the ""virgin angel"" mocktail... drank many while relaxing on the fabulous roof top pool.
Clean, comfortable bed and unlike other reviews our water pressure and hot water were fine! (Room 116).",U Paasha Seminyak
2039,Lovely hotel in a good location,50,January 2015,"Stayed here for a few nights before we flew home. We picked this hotel because of their 24 hour check in/ check out policy as I had a late flight. The hotel and lobby are quite impressive. Rooms are a good size and clean. The TV had a good range of channels and the internet worked well if a little slow. The water was hot and the shower pressure was good.
Service was really good while we stayed and we ordered breakfast in our room one morning as part of their anytime/anywhere policy. The breakfast had a really good range of choices and was one of the best we had while in Bali.
We didn't qualify for the free transfer to the airport so we got a taxi but this was relatively cheap.
The pool on the rooftop was a good size and had a great view out towards the ocean.
Location of hte hotel is in the middle of the main eating street. You can walk to pretty much everything you want from here. The beach is about 15 minute walk from the hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2040,"Good, but room for improvement",40,February 2015,"A friend and I stayed here for two nights.
Positives:
The hotel is in a great location on ""Eat Street"" near lots of good restaurant and bar options.
It has an impressive frontage and spectacular lobby overlooked from all five floors.
Check-in was pleasant and quick, in which we were informed of the ""breakfast whenever/wherever"" facility available until 11pm (not quite sure who would be wanting breakfast at 11pm but it's there if you want it, and it's a nice idea to be able to have your breakfast either in your room or in one of the common areas including round the pool if you choose to). As we checked in at 9pm, we were told we did not have to check out until 9pm at the end of out stay which timed in perfectly for our night-flights back to Singapore and Melbourne, meaning we could shower and pack and leave for the airport directly from the hotel. I've not seen any other hotel do this before, and hopefully more will start to do the same in the future!
You can attend the buffet breakfast in the lobby, or choose to have one of the four set-menu's delivered to you. We opted for the buffet and there was a lot of choice including waffles/pancakes with toppings, egg station, sausages, tomatoes, beans, cereals and toppings, fruits, Chinese breakfast options, toast, danish/croissant/pain-au-chocolat.
The room itself is huge and had two large and comfortable twin beds. The pillows were very comfortable too.
There was a nice selection of jasmine-scented toiletries including shampoo, body wash and body lotion, but no conditioner.
The staff are very pleasant and accommodating, and delivered an Australian power adapter to my room free of charge at my request.
I had requested a top-floor, sea-view room and this is what we were allocated.
There was free wifi in the room and the common areas which was the fastest and most reliable connection that we experienced in Bali.

Negatives:
The main negative for us was the bathroom - it is open plan which even for a couple would be strange; for two friends it was particularly inconvenient. Further, the glass screen to the toilet did not close properly as the hinges had obviously given way in a past life and were polly-fillered back into the tiles at a different angle, allowing us to now not only hear everything that went on in the toilet but to also see it too.
The rain shower was not particularly powerful or hot.
I am no clean freak and expect a bit of wear and tear, however the tiled walls of the shower and toilet were in dire need of a good scrub as they were covered in the red/yellow residue of prior guests' body fat.
Whilst the room was large and modern, it did feel a little soulless as it is decorated quite sparsely and clinical.
The air conditioner was leaking into the bedroom.
The balcony is very narrow and there is no furniture so isn't particularly useable. Also, there was a one-inch gap between the top of the balcony door and the tracks.

Overall, the hotel itself and the lobby area in-particular is lovely. The location on the main street in Seminyak is hard to beat for access to restaurants/bars/shops/spas and with the beach just a short walk down the road. The size of the room is fantastic, but let down by the bathroom which really isn't suitable for anyone except the most open couples! A few simple changes to the room could make a huge improvement. The policy allowing guests to keep their room for 24 hours from check-in is great, and should be the standard in all hotels.",U Paasha Seminyak
2041,Cannot fault this hotel,50,November 2014,"Travelled here with my boyfriend in November and do not have a bad word to say about it. We stayed for one week. The room was gorgeous, so much space, lovely bathroom area and comfortable bed.

The breakfast every morning was delicious with a huge range to chose from- from cereals and fruits to freshly made crepes and omelettes. They also have a nice range of hot foods served including full English breakfast and Asian style breakfasts. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The pool area is amazing. Stunning views all the way to sunset. There is the option of having a massage on the roof top also but we opted to go down the street as it was a fraction of the price. On sunny days I would recommend getting up here early as there are not unlimited amounts of loungers.

The reception desk was very helpful and booked restaurants, spas and taxis for us on numerous occasions. The hotel is centrally located in Seminyak with restaurants surrounding it. Would definitely highly recommend this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
2042,Perfect Location,40,February 2015,"U Paasha has a perfect location not just because it is opposite one of our favourite Bali eateries Cafe Bali but because it is close to everything that is great in Seminyak.

The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. There are the usual Balinese construction problems in the bathroomsand despite not being very old wear and tear is very obvious.

Water pressure in the shower was terrible and it took a good five minutes to warm up. The toilet was also leaking and there appeared to be a shortage of hand towels and face washers as we didn't see any.

We usually stay at the Vasanti which we have given a couple of good reviews too, however we were alarmed to see their prices go up 150 to 200 percent. So U Paasha is a good alternative to this.

My only pet hate was breakfast, when are staff going to learn not to reach across guests to get plates, interrupt their breakfast and conversation to ask to take plates . It is so intrusive and just really poor service. We counted 11 times one morning that we were interrupted. U Passha are not alone in this problem it seems to happen at most buffet breakfasts whether its 4 or 5 start. Service and guest managers should get onto this as it reflects so poorly on the hotel .",U Paasha Seminyak
2043,Spacious rooms,40,February 2015,"The hotel is on a street lined with plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping opportunities. It is about 10 minutes walk to the nearest beach. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Wish the hotel improves the bathroom amenities by offering better soap, shampoo, etc. The staff are pleasant, welcoming and helpful. Offers a fairly decent breakfast although some improvements such as expanding the variety of offering will improve the experience. Tried the barbecue dinner on the 6th floor and was quite impressed with the meat and seafood selection and the way everything was grilled and served. Wifi connectivity was terrible. The pool and gym on the 6th floor are excellent.",U Paasha Seminyak
2044,Fantastic Location & Great Rooftop Pool,50,February 2015,"To start the stay you get complimentary pick up at the airport. Nice bonus when you book direct with the hotel.

Easy friendly check in & a drink voucher.
The rooms are large, comfortable & clean. Small balcony.

Location is the main reason we decided to stay at U-Passha. This will not disappoint. MiniMart across the road. Plenty of great restaurants a few steps away as well as Revolver (great coffee) Plenty of shop's to keep you busy.

Stunning Rooftop pool Area. One of the nicest I've seen.
Rooftop bar & BBQ area. Views over the Seminyak area & ocean in the distant background. Really nice breeze being higher up.

We would stay here again & happy to recommend to friends.",U Paasha Seminyak
2045,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"we came to the U Paasha after spending 5 nights at the Grand Hyaat in Nusa Dua, the U Paasha beats in 100% . You can't beat the breakfast. get real coffee (fresh cappuccino, latte whatever you'd like) can have breakfast anytime ! The staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome. The beds very comfy and the pillows are great, rooms big and very clean. recommend it it anybody. The only thing I can complain about is that there is no bath, but that's just my personal preference to have one. would recommend to anybody.",U Paasha Seminyak
2046,Excellent Seminyak Family Hotel,40,December 2014,"We stayed in the U Paasha 9-19 December 2014. My little family consists of my wife and I and our 3 year old daughter. Just to make life interesting, we were also accompanied by friends. They have a 5 year old, a two year old, and one on the way.
We selected a penthouse suite, which we could do with only one child. If you have a second child, you will have to get a second room. Our friends got adjoining rooms on a different floor of the hotel, which worked out very well.
Initially, the suite we got was at the front of the hotel, facing Jalan Kayu Aya, one of the main streets. Lots and lots of street noise, so if you have young kids, it will be worth asking for a room away from the road. We were moved to another room of the same price, but the difference in standard was amazing. This new suite had two distinct rooms (living and bedroom) a full wet room, a kitchen with full-sized fridge, and ocean views!

...but...

The sliding doors to the balcony are not sealed, which means if you leave the lights on at night, you will come back to a room full of insects. We dealt with this by, wait for it... turning off the lights when we went out at night, and limiting their use when we were in the room at night - which was not often. We also bought some insect spray from the supermarket.

The airconditioner outflow was too small, which resulted in it leaking from the ceiling onto the floor, more than once; pretty significant leaks as well - requiring maintenance attention. To their credit, the staff reacted immediately once contacted about the problem each time, but nothing was done while we were there to fix the cause of the problem. It is fair to say (like many things in Indonesia) that which looks amazing from a distance doesn't hold up under close scrutiny.

However...

Those are the only negative comments I have about U Paasha. Now let's get into the good stuff:

The staff were exceptional. All of them. From the General Manager, who stopped to chat at breakfast, to the towel attendants at the pool, and the housekeeping staff. Even the nightclub staff were welcoming to my family despite the fact we never went to the nightclub (due to being with our daughter).

The pool. OMG THE POOL! There is a reason the pool is in all the photos about this hotel. It is magnificent! It sits on the roof with sweeping 360° views. We never wanted for a sun lounge or a towel. Very suitable for children as it has a shallow area and submerged steps leading to the main pool which doesn't get much deeper than 5 feet.

The location of the hotel is perfect. If you love to walk (and we do), it is centrally located to Bali favourites such as Ku De Ta and Potato Head. It is a very short stroll to Seminyak Square, and there is a chemist and supermarket about 5-10 walk up the street. Restaurants are everywhere, so you will be paralysed by choice (I would not recommed Favela, however. Exquisite decor, but the absolute WORST service of anywhere we have been in Bali. The drinks were also warm, but full price).
The Bali Clinic is on the same street as the hotel, too, in case you have any mishaps, and there are Circle K convenience stores just about everywhere.

We used the services of a couple of nanies from Bali Baby (highly recommended), and the hotel had no problem with them being on the premises, or using the pool while supervising the kids. We did this a couple of times to allow the adults to go out, child-free. Priceless!

The bottom line is that we had a great time at the hotel. The minor problems were just that: minor, and did not detract from our holiday. I would recommend U Paasha Seminyak to anyone.",U Paasha Seminyak
2047,Hustle and Bustle,40,January 2015,"U Paasha is nicely situated in a good retail and restaurant area of Seminyak, all necessities are easily within walking distance with quality restaurants directly across the street.

The room was big and clean. It features a very small balcony although I'd recommend the short walk to the roof for smoke if you're inclined. The only complaint for the room is that the bathroom has little to no privacy and for a traveller not used to the Indonesian Cuisine, and open toilet is not ideal.

The bed was terrific, huge and stupidly comfortable.

The buffet breakfast was probably the best I've ever had. Everything was fresh and the food was above average. They will even make a proper coffee fresh for you.

Pool on the roof was really cool but can crowd with people and the Gym was small but pretty good also.

A pretty good, cost effective option.",U Paasha Seminyak
2048,"Nice boutique hotel in Seminyak, good value!",40,February 2015,"It took 25 -30 minutes drive from airport. The location of U Paasha Seminyak was great, it was at the middle of everything. Lots bar, mini marts, shops neat to the hotel. It was very convenient to stay at U Paasha. The room was big and clean, we were very satisfied with the queen size bed which is very comfortable. No bathtub in the room, but the shower room was quite big, no problem for 2 people to have shower at the same time. Staff was helpful. The buffet breakfast was good, we actually quite looking forward to the breakfast every morning. Roof top pool was good as well. We spent less than USD 100 to get the room and breakfast via agent. It was a very good deal. We enjoyed our stay in U Paasha Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2049,This hotel is disappointing,30,January 2015,"I have stayed at 8 different hotels in Bali over the last few years and this hotel would be my least favourite. It started with the check in. Firstly there are no staff staff to assist you arrive so you have to climb the stairs with your luggage to access the lobby. We were booked in for 2pm and were informed that our room would not be ready until 3pm. Luckily we had not just got off a plane as that would have very inconvenient after a long flight or with travelling with kids. (Yes it is a 24 hour hotel so that means we get to check out at 3pm on our final day). When I booked the room, I advised it was my sisters first trip to Bali and asked for a good room and 2 single beds. Instead we got a king bed and a room overlooking rubbish from neighbouring properties, so not quite the picture I had painted of Seminyak. I am balcony user when I am on holidays and not only were you looking at garbage, there was no furniture and there were many bees swarming around a plant so it was unusable. The hotel was not able to relocate us to our booked room until the following day. This too is another inconvenience, having to move plus waiting around until after lunch for the room to be ready threw out our plans for that day. The rooms are spacious and modern looking but are already showing wear and tear. The bathroom/toilet is strange and the shower has no water pressure. The rooms are cleaned daily but the fingerprints and marks over the bathroom areas makes it seem unclean plus it has a strong chemical smell which is very unpleasant. Even the elevator has a grubby look, strange odour and the carpet is lifting so you have to be careful not to trip. The breakfast and service are adequate but are sadly not to the standard of other Bali hotels. Upon check out the porter was unavailable at that time so we carried our own bags down. There were 5 staff on the reception desk but it appears that not everyone can do a check out so it took around 25 minutes to finalise, makimg us late to a lunch booking in Seimyak. The best assets of this hotel would be the Wifi, rooftop pool with a beautiful view plus it's location on 'eat street'.",U Paasha Seminyak
2050,Fantastic Stay!,50,May 2014,"So i was walking at seminyak after dinner with my friends around 10PM. And we started to visit some hotels along the streets (although we alrey had a place to stay untuil the last day). The first one was U Paasha, we asked for open room and we fell in love with the room and the ambience. The staff are very nice even it was already so late.
They explained to us that we can check-in at any hours and checkout 24 hours later. So we back to our previous hotel, packed our things and move to U Paasha at 12 AM :D
The room is so cozy, the rooftop pool also goos.
I will come back for sure.",U Paasha Seminyak
2051,"Modern Interior, great location & very friendly staff.",30,January 2015,"We have just returned from Bali spending our last 4 nights at U Paasha Hotel. Situated in the middle of the the vibrant Seminyak district surrounded by great restaurants, coffee houses and good shopping outlets. Enjoyed our stay but disappointed that such a new hotel is showing such wear and tear in a short time frame. Chipped pool tiles in and out of the pool, loose pool decking boards, glass walls in bathrooms falling off their hinges, also not cleaned showing hand & fingers marks from pervious guests. Water leaks and sometimes strange smells from the bathroom.
Pull it together as this is a great hotel it just needs high maintenance to maintain a good standard for the future.",U Paasha Seminyak
2052,What a great find,50,January 2015,"This time I thought I would try something in the heart of Seminyak..what a find! Central,modern,great friendly professional staff and food..nothing is too much trouble.. Thankyou to all !! Step outside and you have a choice of cafes etc..",U Paasha Seminyak
2053,Great place,50,January 2015,"Very well located, at Seminyak's main street. A walking distance to good restaurants, bars, shops, beach.
The Roof Top Pool is amazing and the service is excellent.
Massage available at the pool area.
I checked in at 6am, and for a 1,5 daily rate I could check out on the following day at 6pm,
Big room, well decorated, very clean.
Very good breakfast",U Paasha Seminyak
2054,Great hotel!!,50,January 2015,An oasis hiding in the middle of a busy area. Great roof top pool! Rooms are spacious and breakfast was delicious. Service was top notch by all staff encountered in the hotel. They really strive to meet all your needs. They have a 24 hour room rental which allowed for a 4pm checkout time ( we arrived at 4pm 2 days prior),U Paasha Seminyak
2055,Spacious room,40,March 2014,"Love the spacious room, that is number one. in the detail, I think the room needs to be clean more. Good location as well, since this is located in the loud and crowded street, we can find so many great restaurant and bar around.

Service of this hotel is also good, good and friendly staffs, breakfast were also great, many variety of food. you can also have it in your room, they said: anywhere anytime.. so flexible.",U Paasha Seminyak
2056,Modern and spacious,50,January 2015,"Love the interior of the hotel, very modern and trendy. The service provided by the staff was excellent and everyone was very friendly. Have booked 3 rooms for my group of friends.The rooms are very spacious even when i add an extra bed to one of the rooms. the breakfast was good didn't have much to complain as they have wide variety of choices to choose from.",U Paasha Seminyak
2057,Newish but poor quality and terrible service.,30,November 2014,"We haven't been as dissapointed with a Hotel in Bali as we were with U Paasha and my partner and I have been to Bali 5 times and never had service even nearly as bad as at U Paasha.
We stayed at U Paasha for 1 week and i was super excited about our stay there, When we arrived our room wasn't ready which was fine we went and had lunch and came back and it was ready - At first we were impressed with the size and decor in the room which was modern and fresh but a few days into our stay we had issues with the drain in the shower which smelt like sewerage and took 3 phone calls over 24hrs to get part resolved. On further observation throughout our stay the clenliness of our room was very questionable with the toilet and bathroom not once being cleaned during our stay. The pool is also on the roof which is super hot and windy most of the time with limited access to shade, The Pool temperature is also really warm and the quality of the water wasn't great - My partner ended up with an ear infection and we are pretty sure the dirty pool was to blame. I will give the pool staff credits they are amazing especially compared to the staff at the reception desk. The most disappointing part of our experience was that we were supposed to have our room until 7pm on the day of check out as promised by there reservation officer in numerous emails and the day before we were due to check out they told us we had to be out of our room at 2pm which was super inconvenient seen as we had a day trip planned until 5pm and weren't due to fly out until 11pm that night. We ended up having arguments with the staff and they were ridiculously rude - The type of hospitality that we have never experienced in Bali. Not once did they apologize or say sorry or even accept responsibility for there stuff up - They didn't care because they were fully booked and that was obviously much more important than keeping a customer who was about to leave happy. We had to wait in reception that night for 2 hours and they didn't even check to see if we had a driver. I then emailed Harry the reception manager when i got home (Who was conveniently not around when needed) and i never got a response. I would never recommend U Paasha it goes against everything i have been taught about Bali and the Balinese and is a hotel that is purely transfixed on profit.",U Paasha Seminyak
2058,Amazing stay and hospitality,50,January 2015,"Loved everything about this stay. Had a small complication with our in room safe on arrival and they moved us to a new room that afternoon. Rooftop pool is awesome, they do a buffet bbq 3 times a week and is a steal for $20 Aus. Location is right in the middle of everything but didn't here any noise at all. Breakfast menu changes everyday and the selection is huge. Would definitely recommend to friends and stay here again in a heartbeat",U Paasha Seminyak
2059,Excellent location and large comfortable rooms.,50,January 2015,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. The hotel is in an excellent location with a good selection of restaurants and shops just steps away. The lobby had a wow factor and check in and out was quick. The welcome drink was actually at the neighbouring bar and a choice of beverages. The rooftop pool was a pleasant temperature and relatively uncrowded. The gym had a good range of equipment with water and apples available. Breakfast included an excellent selection. The rooms were large with places to relax.The tv was a good size with a good selection of channels. The bed was comfortable with quality sheets and very comfortable pillows. The staff were also helpful in particular the security guy who would ensure safe crossing of the road. My only criticism is the shower. The water pressure was quite weak and sometimes there was only luke warm water. The bathroom area was excellent with good supplies and separate shower and toilet. The tea/ coffee making facilities were excellent. Overall I would recommend staying here and would love to return.,U Paasha Seminyak
2060,Convenient,50,January 2015,"So many conveniences about this hotel. First of all - great location in Seminyak. Right on Eat Street. The best thing for us was that the time you check in is the time you can check out. We had an 11pm flight on the day we had to check out, so we made sure that we checked in at 7pm, which meant we didn't have to check out until 7pm that day. Even though we arrived at 2pm, we were able to leave our luggage and come back when we wanted to check in. Fabulous breakfast and if you don't get a chance to get down to breakfast, you can request to have a breakfast any time of the day. They'll even bring it to the pool for you. The staff were very friendly and the pool area on the roof is great. Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely come back here.",U Paasha Seminyak
2061,resting in bali,40,January 2015,"This hotel is in a reasonably quiet area for Bail. The staff are lovely. The room spacious, and joy of joys decent mugs for your fresh coffee. Some days housekeeping might forget a couple of things, but just ask and you shall get whatever was forgotten. Breakfast is very good, as is an evening meal. Pool area has lovely views. Overall, a very nice hotel experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
2062,Brilliant hotel,50,January 2015,"U Paasha was a fantastic stay. The room was massive and bed and pillows just perfect. Location is right in the heart of the shopping. Rooftop pool is impressive and the views are awesome. I even loved the lobby. Just a gorgeous place to hang. The staff was great and nothing was a problem. It's not quiet but it is in the heart of everything but it's not too noisy.
Only downside was the internet was very slow.",U Paasha Seminyak
2063,Christmas break 2014,40,December 2014,"Great location, right in the heart of Seminyak. Had room 502 which is one of the larger rooms but it does look out over main street so can be very noisy. Lovely rooftop pool area. Would stay again as you can't beat location",U Paasha Seminyak
2064,Great stay,40,January 2015,"My partner and I (25 y/o) loved our stay. beds were comfy, rooms big and spacious, breaky was awesome with lots to choose from and location is perfect if you want to explore the Seminyak square area of Seminyak. Very much a couples and/or older families hotel, the rooftop pool and bar was ridiculously cool, and the underground/downstairs bar was awesome but we only discovered this on last day unfortunately- would be awesome location to have drinks with group of friends even if you weren't staying at the hotel. The staff also let us stay an extra two hours after check out until 3pm as we had a late flight, free of charge, which was handy. The only negative comments i have about this hotel would be the smell from the shower, if this was fixed and an upgrade of the bathroom amenities, it would be perfect. Also, the sheets weren't the best, but very minor.
Besides these points, I will definitely be rec this hotel to friends and will stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2065,A great location and amazing xmas,40,December 2014,"My partner and I chose to stay here after reading the reviews and seeing its position in Seminyak.
The Hotel is a great base to explore Seminyak. With the many great restaurants a and shops both a small stroll away.
The Room was large and spacious.
We had read a few reviews mentioning blood stains on the bed sheets and did experience this for one or two nights.
There was also a small step in the toilet which I forgot about a few times.. ouch! Breakfast was really good with many options available.
The rooftop pool was nice but chlorine was very strong. ( stinging eyes and partners blonde hair turned green).",U Paasha Seminyak
2066,Serviceable hotel in good location but rooms can be noisy.,30,January 2015,"There's nothing dramatically wrong with U Paasha - it has large rooms, great rooftop pool and friendly attentive staff. Breakfasts were comprehensive and bar food downstairs quite good.
However rooms can be noisy, mostly from adjoining properties, shower pressures low and some room locks idiosyncratic needing a steady supply of new keys!
Like everything in Seminyak it's close to hundreds of bars/restaurants.",U Paasha Seminyak
2067,Amazing,50,January 2015,"Highly recommend U Paasha. Perfect location, friendly staff and beautiful facilities, esp the rooftop pool!! Wifi is also a bonus. Wouldn't hesitate to re book, it's in the centre of Seminyak, minutes from restaurants and the beach, walking distance to potato head, ku de ta, cocoon, la plancha and all the other places you need to see!",U Paasha Seminyak
2068,Everything was great,50,January 2015,"Great big breaky buffet with everything on it! Real coffee and you can pick whatever you want👍!
Nice pool with a great view and service.
Fitness is average and outdated, but no problem use your imagination. Again a great view and great temperature.
The place is great for people with no kids!
Beautiful rooms, nice and clean.
Only thing about this place is the bedcovers. You get a dobbel dyvet with no bedcovers on, but a sheets on each side of the dyvet? They put it tight around the madress, so when you crawl into it everything gets loose! It is on big mess of covers, sheets and a dyvet falling out if its loose sheets! The bed was comfortable.
And not to forget the kind staff!",U Paasha Seminyak
2069,Won't be in a rush to return,30,January 2015,"After staying in a villa Upaasha just doesn't compare, the room didn't feel clean at all, especially the bathroom which had a horrible smell and the whole shower was stained (we wore thongs in the shower at all times), while service was great and the staff are lovely I found it hard to communicate with them due to poor English. The location is great though but for a brand new hotel the quality of our room wasnt good enough, the room also looked so different from the photos on the website?! Won't be in a rush to return to Upaasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
2070,More suited for couples,30,July 2014,"I stayed here with my two children. The service was great and the staff were always friendly and polite, our room for 3 people was rather small especially the bathroom which wasn't a separate section from our beds. The location is prime but this place would be much more suitable for couples then families.",U Paasha Seminyak
2071,Amazing hotel.. Amazing hospitality..,50,December 2014,Beat location to stay at.. Centrally located.. Rooms were clean and big.. Hospitality was amazing.. Extremely polite and helpful staff.. Loved the anytime breakfast policy.. Definitely recommend to any1 visiting Bali.,U Paasha Seminyak
2072,Rooftop Pool says it all!,40,December 2014,"On our arrival to Bali we decided to stay in Seminyak to avoid the hustle of Kuta. Overall we enjoyed our stay at U Paasha and my notes as follows:

Location - Close to a lot of restaurants, mini marts, shopping (both markets and upperclass stores), 15 mins walk to the beach, safe money exchange next door

Room - Very spacious and clean. Our room was on the 5th floor with a view towards the ocean. Very quiet despite being on a busy street. Nice complimentary toiletries and huge bathroom.

Service - When checking in the staff were not very informative when i asked about where we could dine, getting a driver etc and also had difficulty using the eftpos machine, putting my credit card through several times which was a bit of a worry but they were pleasant enough.

Pool - Fantastic! the pool was hardly ever busy and had a 360 degree view of seminyak, would have been a great place to spend New Years Eve to watch fireworks.

Breakfast - Great variety of food for both asians and westerners. Ice coffee was delicious and at o extra cost.

We came as a couple and stayed for 2 nights in December 2014.",U Paasha Seminyak
2073,Good Hotel,40,December 2014,"The only thing that they don't have in this hotel is direct access to the beach. Other than that this hotel is fantastic. The room is huge, clean and cozy. This hotel is surround by bars, cafes and shops, which makes easy to get drink and food. Taxi also easy to find. Friendly staff.

The morning breakfast is good.",U Paasha Seminyak
2074,"Top location, value and smiley staff",50,January 2015,"This modern, spacious and stylishly decorated hotel in the middle of Seminyak is a great place to base yourself if you want to be near Bali's best restaurants, nightlife and shops. We usually stay in a villa but opted for a hotel this time as it was New Year's and traffic is bad. Fantastic roof top pool, huge rooms, and great breakfasts every day. A youngish Aussie crowd but not a party hotel and all types of people were staying here. Staff were brilliant, always smiling and helpful. That is right down from the manager to the cleaners. They ran out of pool towels and umbrellas a couple of times, but hey, nothing is perfect.",U Paasha Seminyak
2075,Bed is like sleeping on a cloud!,50,December 2014,"Great location, beautiful room. AMAZING bed. Breakfast was lovely on the rooftop at the restaurant. Staff were so lovely, cannot fault this hotel. Still daydreaming of the bed. HEAVEN! Lots of shopping and nice restaurants at your door.",U Paasha Seminyak
2076,Great location and attentive staff,40,December 2014,"Hotel is in a good location, with many shops and restaurants close by. Mini mart is across the road which is handy for picking up supplies (although make sure you work out how much what you're buying should cost as they try to over charge you). Amazing rooftop pool and attentive staff. Rooms themselves are average, tidy, but bathrooms are open plan so would only be wanting to stay here if you're a couple as no privacy, and shower and toilet room is a bit dirty (I showered with flip flops on). Air conditioning unit is also quite loud at night time. Overall a good hotel though, and would recommend to people who are just wanting a tidy hotel close to Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2077,Great location in Seminyak.,40,October 2014,"Loved staying at this hotel. Staff very accommodating and good value for money. Walk straight out onto main street. If you need a taxi, there are always staff at front of hotel to hail a driver for you. Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.",U Paasha Seminyak
2078,Good hotel in appearance BUT ...,20,December 2014,"This hotel has everything to be a great hotel: location, staff, pool, breakfast.
But its main problem is the maintenance and the food.

A. The humidity rate in the bedroom is EXTREMELY high =>
1. a constant bad smell in the room
2. all our leather shoes and belts were full of moistures after 3 days (see photo).
3. bed sheets humid every day

B. The piping system for the used water is not maintained properly => the smell going out from bathroom and shower is absolutely terrible.

C. Bed sheets dirty, even after asking to change them, the new one were same. It happens 4 times.

D. Room service - food: quality of food less than average. Beef Burger with a beef with the same look as a tire. And eggs served cold

E. Food at the pool: serving wrap with moisturised tomatoes (see photo).
Staff was good and brought a new one, and didnt charge us.

This is sad, cause it could be a good hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2079,"All the right ingredients, except !",30,December 2014,"Upaasha hotel has all the right ingredients to make this a great hotel. Excellent Location, great pool, room size, and oh so friendly staff all contribute towards a great stay. The hotel was constructed less than 2 years ago and from a trained eye the use of building materials and finishing is simply not there, the tiles, grout and paint all chipping away or damp, with timber amd metal in the guest-rooms all showing signs of poor and cheap quality, honestly this is a shame. to spend more on the build would have been a better long term investment. Won't stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2080,Great hotel in heart of Seminyak,50,December 2014,"We only stayed 1 night and this was the first time we stayed at Upaasha Seminyak. We chose it because of the location, the best pool and because we stayed at U hotel in Phuket and wanted to check their Seminyak hotel.

Breakfast was great. We'll be back...",U Paasha Seminyak
2081,Pleasantly surprised,40,December 2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by U Paasha. This stylish/trendy hotel had a helpful staff, clean rooms, good breakfast buffet and a nice pool. It's located in a convenient part of Seminyak and is definitely a great deal for a little over $100USD/night.",U Paasha Seminyak
2082,Best place to stay in Seminyak,50,January 2014,"Visited Bali several times and stayed at different hotels/villas and this is definitely the best place to stay in Seminyak.
Great pool. Clean and comfortable room. Good service. Breakfast was yummy. LOVE the location. Honestly nothing to fault.
Will definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2083,Extraordinary Hotel - Stylish and Beautiful Rooms,50,December 2014,"This Hotel is just great. Stayed there fora few days and couldn't fault it . (I'm fussy about serve and facilities). Great central location in heart of Seminyak restaurants and shopping. The rooms are huge, s stylish and quality bedding makes it a dream. The breakfast was fresh and had a vast variety of options. The pool was lovely and plenty of pool lounges. One afternoon by the pool a staff member circulated amongst pool users with huge fresh fruit skewers. Just lovely. Staff also speak great English and bend over backwards to help with any request. Stay for the experience.",U Paasha Seminyak
2084,"Top hotel, top staff",50,November 2014,"From arrival to departure the service was superb. Room very large, clean and modern. Facilities excellent. Breakfast yummy. Pool area what can I say., always had a lounger, staff couldn't do enough for you, fruit kebabs welcome. Lovely breeze, pool like a warm bath. Didn't want to leave. Restaurants abound, within steps of hotel. It was my birthday while I was there and I was gifted a beautiful flower arrangement and a fruit basket. They go the extra mile to make sure your stay is memorable. IT WAS. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Bali. My sister and family are travelling on 27th December. Jill Woodward and she can't wait after my wonderful experience. Well done U Paasha and all the wonderful staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
2085,Great location!,40,December 2014,"Just returned from U Paasha yesterday and had a very pleasant 4 nites stay there. We were surprised by its large room size and cleanliness of the room. There is a slight smell from the bathroom sewage but it didn't bother us too much. Yes the aircon does have strong noise too but temperature is always cool and we weren't bothered by it at all.

I just realised that the guests can choose different kinds of pillows from reading reviews here. If I knew earlier, I would have asked for some firmer ones. The ones I slept on were too soft for my personal preference which gave me a neck ache / head ache on my 3rd nite. Maybe at check-in, the reception can let the guests know in advance.

Location is perfect. Shops and restaurants at the door steps. Too many food options on the same street and it's within walking distance to Ku De Ta, Mama San, Chandi, Nirvana, Sisterfields - all nice restaurants which we tried when we stayed here. If u need a Blue Bird Cab, just let the reception or security guard know and they will help to flag one down for you while you wait inside.

Breakfast is nice with a good spread. Food is tasty, omelette was way better than our earlier hotel in Nusa Dua.

I consider this as one of my favorites in many of my travels, for location, service and room quality at a very decent price.",U Paasha Seminyak
2086,"perfect location, spacious rooms",50,December 2014,"I honestly have no negative feedback. Everything was superb. Great location right on jln kayu aya (eat street). Walking distance to Ku de ta and a short ride to potato head.

The rooms are huge -50sqm. You can select up to 4 different types of pillows, bed was very comfortable.

The rooftop pool has a beautiful view of seminyak, unblocked view of the sunset.

Polite and courteous staff.. very efficient as they attended to my various requests within minutes.

Definitely would stay at u paasha again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2087,Enjoy the stay and the awesome service.,40,December 2014,"First impression by the design of the hotel which quit new and modern, huge bedroom space, comfortable king size bed and rooftop pool.

Awesome cocktails esp ""Rock Fest"" that me and my boyfriend love. We don't need to worry about getting up on time before breakfast close because it will be served until 11 pm by in room dinning. Even cooler about it, we can choose breakfast to be served by the pool, lobby or in bed :D

All staff very friendly and helpful.

Perfect location for the holiday! Very convenience and close to shops, restaurants or even the beach. Famous place like Potato Head Beach Club just 5 mins by cab or you can walk and enjoy the shopping all the way through.

Only one thing that could complete the wonderful stay with U Pasha is about the toilet. We can smell the drain from the bathroom to the main bedroom and that quit strong sometimes. But we didn't bother to complain.

Overall we were enjoy the stay and would strongly recommend if anyone looking to stay in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2088,Good hotel. Great location!!,40,December 2014,"Great location, spacious rooms, great rooftop pool and bar, reasonably friendly service (not amazing in comparison to other places but still very good). In room add ons (shampoo, soap, etc) are great. Bathroom has an awesome decor and spacious. Water didn't get overly hot but not really necessary in Bali. Number one positive is the location. Right across the road from about 10 great restaurants (Ultimo, Kuni's, Mykonos, ginger moon, etc), loads of shops all within a few meters walking distance. Doors can deceivingly seem closed but are actually not closed/locked properly so watch out for that. Room service was always delicious, never ate at the actual restaurants though. Breakfast was quite good- large variety, have had better though. Hallways on upper levels are a bit bare / clinical so they could definitely improve on that but overall nothing was majorly negative. Would stay here again for the location.",U Paasha Seminyak
2089,"Very Good Location For Food, Less so for Shopping",40,December 2014,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is smack middle of Jln Laksamana so it's restaurants, cafes and pubs/bars left and right for at least 500m each way. You'd be spoilt for choice and the roof top pool has Both a city And Sea view, depending on which direction you look. Nicely appointed rooms, strong wifi, and good size for money. A few disappointments were the dismal water pressure from its showers, and the in-efficient ventilation system for the toilet. Improving these 2 aspects will truly make it Good to Great.
Shopping is more high end here, compared to Legian and ubud. Mostly fixed prices but service from the sales staff in the shops, and for that matter, the food establishments and hotels have been very good.",U Paasha Seminyak
2090,Nice trendy hotel with nice location,40,December 2014,The hotel is located in the middle of restaurants in Seminyak. The staffs are friendly and efficient to attend your request. The room is very huge and with over 50 channels of TV selection. The air conditioning is quite cooling even though the room is huge. I like the breakfast with many selections especially my favourite is bacons and omelette. They have a very nice rooftop pool to enjoy suntanning.The best part is the flexibility of check in and check out times. I feel is safe to solo travel and stay in this hotel. I will look forward to return back U Paasha in future.,U Paasha Seminyak
2091,Nice location,50,July 2014,In the middle of everything. 10 min strol to Ku De Ta. A few steps to all the great restaurants in Seminyak. Good breakfast and a very nice rooftop pool and restaurant. We are going back in may and we will stay at U Paasha again.,U Paasha Seminyak
2092,overall wonderful hotel,50,December 2014,"Good value, great breakfast, actively change everyday with transitional English as well as Asian, including different supplies of local fruit. The most comfortable bed ever, but the air conditioning is very noisy, so if you are a light sleeper it may be a problem. Located right in the middle of the eat street, does not have much shops but nice massage place called 'wellbeing massage' is only 20 meters away from hotel. Never actually try their bbq night cause there are way too much nice restaurants around with better value. The pool is great however only open till 8pm. Lots peeps taken the day bed by 10am on a sunny day. Nice big shower room but would be better if there's a bath. We were staying in Superior room on third level. Overall a great hotel, very stylish, would return in the future.",U Paasha Seminyak
2093,Trendy hotel with great location,40,November 2014,"We really lucked out with the location on this hotel. If you don't need to stay on the beach, absolutely stay at U Paasha! It is located right on one of the main streets with bars, restaurants, and cute shops on both sides- couldn't get any better.

The hotel itself is very stylish, with an open air check in area, rooftop pool and bar, and large rooms with balconies. I think they're in the middle of remodeling because the hotel is a little older and is a little rough around the edges. Despite the wear (which really doesn't matter), your stay comes with a plethora of amenities: you get to pick the scent of your soaps, an extremely elaborate breakfast covering all nationalities (e.g. dim sum, vegemite, nutella), and over 50 channels with something for everyone (e.g. Korean, Chinese, American, Australian, Indonesian, Singapore, and European channels). They will also watch your bags for you for free if you are going on an excursion and they are flexible on check in/check out times.

The staff are incredibly nice. I showed up at the hotel with my cab driver threatening to fight me and screaming at me, and the hotel both dealt with him and handled my extreme embarrassment with a grace I probably didn't deserve but absolutely appreciate.",U Paasha Seminyak
2094,Wow! Just perfect,50,December 2014,"I couldn't be more impressed .
Prompt, efficient , friendly , welcoming check in.
Location perfect.
Rooftop pool area stunning!
Staff attentive and helpful.
Room spotless and enormous with a huge shower
Hotel has some lovely personal touches.
Staff found out that my mother had recently past away and sent a beautiful bouquet of roses to my room.
I have stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels in Bali over the years, including the Maya Ubud , The Viceroy Ubud and various others. To be honest U Paasha compares favorably with these 6 star resorts without the heavy price tag.
Couldn't ask for anything more.
I look forward to returning to u Paasha many times in the future!!!
Perfect .",U Paasha Seminyak
2095,"Great hotel, awesome location",50,November 2014,"Stayed here for 5 days a couple of weeks ago, and have barely anything bad to say about this hotel! We checked in around 12:30 and got into our room straight away, 5th floor and right at the back of the hotel (524) so we were lucky as we could hear no noise inside our room from outside other than the occasional noise from the gym which was right above our room but that would be about once a day maximum.

ROOM: The rooms were much larger than we expected, king size bed was extremely comfortable with a good choice of pillows. The bathroom was a couple style with two sinks with a mirror each, as well as a really big walk in shower. Only thing that I didn't like about the bathroom was that there wasn't a door between the bedroom and bathroom and the doors were just glass and didn't reach the roof, so if you are unlucky enough to get Bali belly then this might not be so nice. Shower had two options, either the rain type shower head, or just a normal type shower head. The shower also had a shelf and rail to hang your clothes and towel. The only fault we would have to say about the room was the first two days the air conditioning wasn't getting very cold, from what it said the room temperature was 25 even though we had set it as low as possible, we talked to the hotel staff and they sent someone out straight away to have a look at it and after that it did seem to be colder but room temperature was still only 22, but that was nice enough for us.

POOL: Pool was great and with our room on the 5th floor was just a quick walk up half a set of stairs to get to. You are given towel cards which you exchange for towels everyday and we only once found the pool loungers to be full but we still found one of the round loungers to share. Happy Hour, which was more like happy hours, where you get 3 drinks for the price of 2 was awesome, and we would always get the honey dew smoothie which was very refreshing after a day in the heat and humidity. They also have a Sunset BBQ every second night which my boyfriend found well worth the money.

FOOD: Breakfast which was included had a big selection, with options changing every day. I loved the freshly cooked croissants and the omelets which are made for you with your choice of ingredients. Breakfast goes till 11am and we never found it to be busy. Where breakfast is held, there is always tanks with fresh water with fruits inside and sometimes juice along with some prawn chips and a couple of other snacks. The fridge was filled with food which you had to pay for, but we asked the staff if this could be emptied and it was done very promptly. Two water bottles were provided daily.

LOCATION: We found the location to be great. Right on the street with a huge selection of restaurants and shops. Walk a little further around the corner and you get to the beach and about a 15minute walk to Potato Head Beach Club, worth the visit. All the restaurants on this strip were very cheap and very good food. We didn't suffer from Bali belly once. We got a taxi back from Kuta one afternoon and it cost about $4 AUD for a 20 or so minute taxi ride. The location of this hotel was a lot nicer than the Kuta area as here you are surrounded by mostly tourists and not many locals trying to sell you items on the streets, as the street is filled with proper shops such as Billabong, Quicksilver etc. There are plenty of taxis driving up and down the road outside the hotel so if you wanted to go there it's easy enough to get one, always get Blue Bird taxis, look for the name on the taxi, do not rely on the colour of the car.

Overall, we loved our stay at U Paasha and wished we could've gone back there for the rest of our trip. It is definitely worth the stay here, especially if you are looking for a relaxing and stress free holiday.",U Paasha Seminyak
2096,"Spacious, comfortable and clean - right on Eat St",50,October 2014,"I stayed here in October as part of a girls trip and it was a fabulous choice. Got a good price dealing directly - I believe it was an anniversary special they were promoting at the time and included breakfast and airport transfers @AUD125 pn nett (when I checked my credit card statement on returning home that was the conversion from IDR).

The room was great - the bed and pillows were comfortable and the Plasma worked well as did the wi fi. The shower is huge and has a rail for hanging wet bathers or underwear - with the fan on in there this worked a treat.

The breakfast was very good with an egg station taking orders for omelettes or poached. The coffee was mediocre but hey - Revolver is only a 2 minute walk!

The roof top pool has great steps but is only 1.1 metres deep - nice to hang out in and enjoy a cocktail or two. The poolside service was a bit hit and miss - some staff had it going on while others did not (ie. the girl who forgot my order!!) - but the menu (food and drinks) was very good. I never missed out on a sun lounge - but shade was not always easy to come by as not every lounge had an umbrella. The view is spectacular and the breeze was lovely.

The location is so good - in Eat St opposite Ultimo down towards Seminyak Square. Very central and with taxis easily caught right out the front. The hotel has a large driveway/parking space at the front so being dropped home at night is easy too.

I would certainly stay again if the price was right.",U Paasha Seminyak
2097,Nothing wrong,30,November 2014,"There is nothing wrong with this place at all. The rooms are nice and spacious, friendly staff throughout the entire hotel, great rooftop pool and sunset bar, breakfast was good.

On the other hand there wasn't anything exceeding expectations either, it is all basic good.

For the price paid one could expect a bit more when in Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2098,"Great place, great location!",50,November 2014,"We stayed here on our first leg of our Bali trip for 5 nights. Such a great hotel in a really good location! Would not want to be anywhere else. Breakfast is amazing! Staff are so friendly, they really make U Paasha! Rooms comfortable! Roof top pool really neat! Would definatley come back!",U Paasha Seminyak
2099,Highly recommended,50,November 2014,"We had a great experience there, lobby and the rooftop pool were very good. The room was perfect, big with a sofa and a table, also with a comfortable beds and nice shower. One of the best was the breakfast buffet which has a lot variety and delicious foods. The staff was so nice and helpful. The location of the hotel was very good, lots of nice bars and restaurants around, also one 24 hours fast food,which is necessary in a touristic place, was in a 5 min walk.",U Paasha Seminyak
2100,Best choice in Seminyak Bali great place,50,November 2014,"I stayed here for 5 nights last week & can honestly say that it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Staff are so friendly, accommodating, polite & their English is also very good. The hotel's in a great spot- with both bars & restaurants on your doorstep. Saying that, the hotel itself was very quiet- you'd never even know once inside this compound of paradise that you're staying right in the heart of Seminyak. Rooms were immaculate & very spacious. The breakfasts were fabulous- be sure to try the omelette (with everything)... I had one every day! The pool, rooftop & bar was great & very relaxing. I like the fact that they play music whilst you laze around the pool, sipping cocktails! Also, one of the things we like best was that you can checkout whenever you like! They don't ship you out by 10/11am on your last day, you can keep coming back to your room righ tuntil you go off to the Airport! In our case- this was 4pm, which allowed us to sit round the pool a while longer & freshen-up before sadly heading home. Thanks U Paasha- you guys were amazing!! We will be back next year for sure :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2101,Excellent hotel,40,November 2014,"I have just stayed at the U Paasha in Seminyak for five nights. The staff at reception and restaurant are friendly and helpful. The room is large and the bed amazingly comfortable. The breakfast array available is plentiful and tasty and I believe you would struggle to try it all in a week. The rooftop pool is stunning. My only complaint is that holidaying as a solo person I found at times at the pool I was overlooked by staff for drinks as they focused on larger groups and couples. A small thing easily rectified by getting their attention but annoying to be ignored at times
Overall though I intend staying at the hotel again on another trip as it is central to the shopping, Seminyak square etc",U Paasha Seminyak
2102,"Unbeatable staffs, but some areas were not as good.",40,November 2014,"All staff i met were helpful and attentive. Roof top BBQ every Mon, Wed and Fri worth a try.
The 24 hour concept and all day breakfast were the main reason for me choosing this hotel. I tried to order a breakfast at 0500. But the staff told me that only some bread without any drink can be provided. I understand the difficulty in preparing a set of full breakfast that early. However, i suggest as least a pack of milk or juice included in the breakfast box.

Two more things i would mentioned:
1) i found stains at the towels and linens
2) lots of dots at he big mirror at my room.
3) at the time of making reservations, i was asked if i want some inroom Music. However. Nothing found at my room even i asked again.

As a whole, the hotel is still a good one with their location and staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
2103,Would Recommend,40,October 2014,"This was the first time staying in Seminyak and it was a great hotel. I would definitely be back and would recommend to friends, although there are a few things which could be improved.

Pros:
- the comfiest bed I have slept on in Bali... and back home in Aus. Big king size, with super comfy pillows
- location is great, right along a restaurant strip, plenty of shops and minimart, chemist etc.
- staff were friendly and willing to help or chat (especially one of the guys at the pool, i cant remember his name, but he had braces, and was always super friendly)
- pool area was lovely. I wanted to avoid a hotel which had its pool covered by the hotel, so this was great
- the rooftop bar was lovely, albeit slightly on the pricey side
- the rooms were huge
- the bathroom and shower were huge and is decorated nicely
- the shower was great!
- we wanted to watch some movies, you can call for a DVD player to be brought to your room for free, and chose DVDs from their folder
- the breakfast.. omg, great! huge spread, pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, cereal, fruits, muesli, yoghurt, salad station, the list went on!!

Negatives
Unfortunately I couldnt give the hotel 5 stars
- the aircon was terrible. I could have put up with the noise if the aircon was cold, but it was noisy and the room was hot, which is not what you want after a long day in the heat. The hotel obvious knows this is a problem (from the reviews below), however still chose to put guests in the rooms and offer no way around it. such as a fan? anything?
- there was no chairs on the balcony, there was also no chairs that you could use from the room. It made it annoying as the balcony therefore was unusable
- We were on the first floor, which meant no view. This would have been ok, except the levelling of the hotel meant that our window looked onto the hotel of another hotel. We had to constantly keep the blinds drawn",U Paasha Seminyak
2104,Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff,40,November 2014,"I went on a short weekend stay with my mother. The hotel is really beautiful, from the outside of the hotel to the lobby to the pool area and the rooms. The staff are amazing, really sweet and attended to our every need very quickly.
The pool area is on the roof which is nice as you get a beautiful view and there is a bar on the roof as well. The poolside mocktails are AMAZING, soo good and the staff and service up there are great, even bringing all the guests at the pool complimentary fruit kebabs. There are a lot of deck chairs surrounding the pool but they do get used up and not all the deck chairs have umbrellas. I would not recommend this hotel for families with younger children as the pool area is small and any free area is taken up by deck chairs and there is very limited shade.
Location is perfect, on the same road as all the shops and best restuarants",U Paasha Seminyak
2105,Great value in a good location,40,October 2014,"Having stayed at private villas the last few visits to Seminyak we opted for a hotel this trip as we had a larger group with everyone arriving and leaving on different dates. The location was perfect for us as there are so many good eating venues less than 5 minutes walk away. The foyer of the hotel is very impressive and the pool is great if you are a sun worshipper...I am so I loved it. We made sure we got to the pool by at least 10:30 and never had a problem getting lounges. The peak pool usage is between 11 and 1. After 1 it tends to get too hot and guests head off to do other things.
The room are very spacious and having a room half way toward the back of the main road meant we had no disturbances at all. Being able to open the sliding door at night and get some fresh air. Whilst sleeping is always a bonus at any hotel. The beds are very comfortable and possibly the best hotel pillows I have ever slept on. A few small issues such as stains on the bed cover and water damage in the showers is all that really stops me giving 5 stars.",U Paasha Seminyak
2106,Perfect!,50,November 2014,"I don't think many (if any) hotels can beat the quality for price as U Paasha.

Check-in was quick, friendly and professional. The room 524) had a little bit of sound leakage from the treadmills in the gym, but not bothering. Apart from that, it was very quiet.
Room was spacious with lots of amenities and the bed was very good. Complimentary internet a little slow.

The rooftop pool area was very nice and the sunset view unbeatable.

Breakfast buffet had a lot of choices and the staff remembered my coffee preferences the next morning.

A fantastic stay at a wonderful hotel!",U Paasha Seminyak
2107,Great Location,40,November 2014,U Paasha is right in the thick of it in Seminyak and couldn't have asked for a better location. The service was great and the rooms were very spacious and clean. The rooftop pool is definitely a plus for this hotel although the service up there wasn't very quick. The only downside really is that we had the BBQ at night on one of our nights and it definitely wasn't worth it for the money we paid but other than that overall it was a really good hotel,U Paasha Seminyak
2108,It has it all!!!,50,October 2014,"First time at Upassha Hotel for a family surprise for my brother. The location is great... in the heart of the main shopping/restaurant street of Seminyak. Fantastic pool area located on the top of the hotel...so cool breezes and wonderful sunsets... Buffet breakfast has a lot of variety with quality. The staff and service was amazing.... nothing was a problem or too much to ask for. We loved Gede who looked after us around the pool....and Ana at reception who booked tours, restaurants and massages. For me, Upassha ticked all the boxes, great price, great location, great service,friendly and professional staff.... our hotel room was quiet.... we will be back!!!
The only thing I would say this hotel caters more for older children as their is no kids club....",U Paasha Seminyak
2109,We would stay again!,40,November 2014,"We should start by saying we believe we are well infomred and reasonable.

We stayed for 5 days at U Paasha, and we enjoyed the stay. We had noted various comments about issues at the hotel, such as smelly water and noise, and open bathrooms and Noisy Air Con. We were in Seminyak during a quite time of the year.

The Room, excellent, we really enjoyed it. King Bed was very comfortable, room was big enough, we didnt feel the air con was noisy, but i was obvious that was on. As for previous comments that the toilet was open, it had a glass opaque door, although the glazing wasnt to the cieling, it was still reasonably visually private, if not noise proof..... Our only complaint may have been the water pressure in the shower was lacking to say the least, and the hot water was very intermittent. We suspect this is an issue with supply rather than the hotels fault, and it really wasnt a major issue.

On the subject of noise, we were at the back of the builidng on the 5th floor. We heard no street noise. We did get noise from the neighbouring house, which seemed to have alot of workers early wach morning, again, not rreally the hotels fault, and not a major issue. Our room was under the gym, and weights were being dropped on the floor above us, which did make a bit of noise early in the morning. My wife slept through it, and i only found it minorly annoying. It might be wise to ask for a room not under the gym if your a light sleeper.

Staff were simply brilliant, they did there best to be helpful, and were genuinely eager to please. Language is always going to be a barrier, but they did there best to understand and were patient.

24 hour check in was great, on arrival our alotted room wasnt ready, and we were offered the option of taking a room on a lower level, or waiting till later in the day for our room tobe available, we waited, and this worked out fine. It was more than reasonable.

The pick up and drop off to the airport was good, we did find it hard to locate the pickup driver, but all worked out in the end.

Breakfast, amazing, large variety of choices, and food was good if not great. We were very happy with the breakfast service. Pool BBQ was also very good.

We will definately stay again, we thought by comparision to other places (including villas) this is the best so far.",U Paasha Seminyak
2110,Quirky modern hotel,30,October 2014,"After Courtyard by Marriott U Paasha felt a bit flat for us. It seems it would suit younger, party going crowd. The reception and main breakfast restaurant are all open air and it gets really hot in there. Swimming pool was nice to watch the sunset over the rooftops but during the day not many available sun lounges and was really hot.

Room: the room was quiet but the air conditioner was unbearable! The loudest ever, that put me off for good. I've read other reviews about the same problem and maybe the management have to do something about it.

Breakfast: not a massive choice which is fine but some of the items were looking a bit old?! Service was great though.

Area: in the middle of the chaos, crossing the road could be a challenge. Positives: close to Seminyak square for that amazing Bali bakery we loved and to Ku De Ta of course. Supermarket near by as well.

The hotel provided free shuttle to our next destination. That was great!",U Paasha Seminyak
2111,Super Hotel - only one tiny criticism!,40,October 2014,"This is a fantastic hotel! I stayed there last week with a couple of friends. The facilities are wonderful, particularly the rooftop pool. The rooms are finished to a really high standard and are very well-equipped. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. They will go out of their way to assist you with any query. It's very well located on the main strip in Seminyak, with many lovely cafes and boutiques within walking distance. My only criticism, is the acoustics. The way in which the hotel has been built, and the materials used, means that the sound from the bar downstairs resonates right up into the rooms. And when there is music playing late into the night, it's a bit difficult to sleep with all the noise. Other than that, an excellent hotel - I will definitely be back!",U Paasha Seminyak
2112,Could have been better,30,October 2014,"I was in Bali in December last year but to get a room here was unbelievably tough due to the min nights required over the new year season. To be finally staying here this time round, I'm a bit 50/50 on this place.

My last minute request (12hrs before arrival), I send an email to confirm my stay and see if they could try prepare something for my bestie birthday who's travelling with me. Because I didn't receive any confirmation before the plane took off, it didn't really matter to me if nothing could be done but they manage to fix up a cake and send it up to the room. It was a lovely surprise for me as well. I too receive an email shortly right after our indulgence.

Room was exactly what u see in the hotel website; huge shower fit for 10, double vanity sinks and mirror - no fighting, ample space to hold an indoor party!!

Upon check in, room wasn't ready until 4pm - 1.5hrs later. The next day, we booked hotel pickup to a wedding in Benoa and was told the cost of transport to pick up our friends from another nearby hotel and to final destination, covers also the toll charges. Traffic was bad on the way and we reminded the driver that we want to go by highway and he insisted that we had to pay for toll, so we did. Worst was the car stopped and was out of petrol. He kept blaming the driver using the car earlier before him, but it was his duty to check before we left in the first place!! We ended up walking another 200m in our lovely get-up, avoiding the pit holes on the incomplete pathway and sweating on arrival at 4pm (sun was still hot at 38deg!)

Feedback was given to concierge the next day and he apologize said he will check with driver and get back to me. Haven't heard a word since but he did offer airport transfer at a lower rate. After what happened, I wasn't sure I could catch my plane on time and took a local taxi instead.

Going forward, maybe the hotel would like to consider a collaboration with known hotel / airline partnership program where mileage or points could be accumulated. It's very common for a chain hotels to have such partnership so it's a bit strange to know they don't have any in place.",U Paasha Seminyak
2113,Great Central Location,40,October 2014,"Good clean hotel in very central Seminyak location. If you want to be close to good restaurants and shops you will find it hard to beat this hotel. Breakfast is excellent, service good, and the hotel facilities are great for a hotel in this price bracket.",U Paasha Seminyak
2114,All round Excellent!,50,October 2014,"We stayed at Upaasha for 6 days, and were so happy with our experience.
We normally stay in Villas in Bali, but thought we would give Upaasha a go, and they exceeded our expectations.

The value for money is great as the breakfast was soooo yummy, the staff helpful, and the rooms really spacious, not to mention the location in the middle of JL Laksmana.

The pool area was great also, not too crowded and the staff always there to take your order if you wanted drinks or something to nibble on.

I would definitely recommend Upaasha, and will definitely be back as its really well priced and so located so centrally.",U Paasha Seminyak
2115,Will definitely return...,40,October 2014,"Me and my partner had such a great experience. Large spacious rooms, promt service, the most friendly staff, and I absolutely loved the variety from the buffet especially when many places surrounding aren't open for early breakfast - enjoyed knowing this was taken care of. Happy hour upon the rooftop, alway a plus! - cocktails were fabulous and might I add quite strong ;-) no skimping on the alcohol nips there :-)
Stay, you'll enjoy!",U Paasha Seminyak
2116,"Nice pool on roof! Clean, cheap, good location",50,October 2014,"Good location - close to: ku de ta, potato head, sea circus, revolver, la favella, townhouse, markets, chemists, money exchange, shopping

Very nice rooms - clean, modern, huge comfy king bed (in double room) huge bathroom with his and hers sinks, good shower woth overhead or hose option. has ipod dock, flatscreen tv (if u wanna watch tv on holiday?)
Aircon was REALLY good.

Rooftop pool - main reason i chose this place. Always sunny up there, theres attentative people giving out fruit, and taking food/drink orders, giving magazines and sunblock. Rooftop bar area next to pool.

Service all around was absolutely amazing, room service and cleaning teams very efficient. Reception and bag bous, security everything was spot on.

Price - we paid 160aud/night for 3 nights but loved it so much we stayed another night.

Only thing i can say negative is the breakfast is pretty bland. But hey its included for free",U Paasha Seminyak
2117,Modern well located,40,October 2014,Quick facts (and I have a lot a Bali accom experience). Well located for all high end shopping and eateries in Seminyak. Oberoi Street a nightmare for traffic particularly between 5pm to 10pm. Modern design and rooms spacious well laid out. Roof top pool brilliant. Service really good and breakfast was excellent. They will need to keep in top of maintenance in future to keep up the high standard. Roof top pool not really for kids so think parents could find more accommodating places. Be quick for pool bed in shade in the morning.,U Paasha Seminyak
2118,Nice stay but room to improve,40,October 2014,"We had a two night stay at a suite. U Paasha offers a 24hr stay which was fantastic but also creates problems of its own. We arrived at about 3pm and were offered the choice of two rooms, one being ready in 10 mins and one, which had a better view but which the guest would check out later that night. As we have had a very early start in the morning, we decided to take the available room.

Upon entering the room, we were pleasantly suprised by the spaciousness of the room. To our disappointment, there were numerous dark stains on the full length mirrors on the doors of the cupboards. We weren't that comfortable as the colour made it seem a little like blood stains. The reception agreed to move us to the other room later that night.

Later that night, seemingly due to a mix up or misunderstanding between the change in shifts of hotel staff, we were unable to secure a change in room as there were no rooms available. After a long discussion, we were then offered another room which also had the same problem, probably due to a defect in the mirrors.

Breakfast was fantastic with a wide range of choices and more variety than your standard hotel buffet. Items from the bakery were of an excellent standard. They also offered the choice of having your breakfast other than the buffet table which was both interesting and unique.

Service staff at the hotel were pleasant and always had a smile on their faces. Laundry was prompt and efficient.

The location of the hotel is fantastic, right along ""Eat Street"" with many choices for food and shops for your every need. This also means that the street tends to be heavy with traffic.

Nonetheless, we had a very enjoyable stay at U Paasha and consider it as good value for money.",U Paasha Seminyak
2119,A perfect Oasis on a crazy fun street,50,October 2014,"Loved it - beautiful large modern rooms and one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever seen, literally you can order anything, a full buffet!! The staff that work here are a credit to the owners of this hotel, we had a couple of problems with the electrics in our room and after calling the front desk the engineer was at our door within 5 minutes and the job was fixed after another 5.

The pool and bar area are fantastic, great food and large cocktails and of course, excellent service! Its so peaceful and quiet when you consider that this hotel is on such a busy street. They do play some nice chill-out music around the pool from decent discreet speakers, which just added to our relaxation. We had a room on the ground floor and couldnt hear any noise from the street. Someone mentioned the air con was noisy, we found it wasnt too bad, I dont think ive ever really heard a 'quiet' air con unit anyway. Upon checkin we did ask for a room on a higher floor (only because of reading previous reviews on here) and they said they could only move us the next day, but by then we were so happy with our room we didnt bother.

One attention to detail that I thought was brilliant, was a lovely basket of different suntan oils and lotions for you to use as you enter the pool area. I was so happy, because I'd forgotten mine!

Will definitely return here again, lovely location for everything so you dont need to grab taxi's all the time, a wonderful shopping/eating street. Thank you U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
2120,"Great location, fantastic value",50,October 2014,"Stayed here for three nights. Excellent value for money, well located. Large roof top pool. Huge riins, good service (some room for improvement at front desk), quality buffet breakfast with lots of variety.",U Paasha Seminyak
2121,Large hotel centre of Seminyak,40,October 2014,"great hotel, 5 floors, amazing design. huge rooms, lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed. Service extremely helpful and pleasant, amazing to have 24/7 check out. will remember for next time when we have a late flight. Breakfast very generous and pleasant surroundings, staff great there too. step out front door onto busy street with bars, rests and shopping. about 15 mins walk to beach. great pool area on roof, however, problem with not enough lounge chairs!! e.g. we could not use the pool during the day to relax, nowhere to sit!!!! extremely disappointing, as this is a brand new hotel we are hoping that this will be rectified before we book to return, when we will check out that situation, only if you intend to use the pool, otherwise, just for a stopover couldn't be better.",U Paasha Seminyak
2122,Great choice - perfect location,50,October 2014,"We recently stayed with another family - and have only positive comments to add. Perfect location, a lovely oasis right in the heart of Seminyak. Great restaurants and bars, and a short walk to the beach. Hotel staff very friendly. Breakfast menu great - always used dining area, did not use anywhere/anytime option. I am a very light sleeper and was not woken at all, the air con was a little noisy, but still managed to fall asleep with it on. 24 hour check in policy worked well 7pm check in / out. Driver was there to pick us up and deliver us back to airport.
Excellent stay overall. Our adult son staying there at end of month. With free cancellation policy would advise him to change if we were unhappy, not needed all good. Pool for wading only - 1.1 metres - nice to cool off.",U Paasha Seminyak
2123,Not the best hotel on the strip.,20,September 2014,"The only good think about this hotel is the location.

Positives:
1. It is a great location. It's on Eat Street - can't complain at all. Everything is in walking distance.

2. Great roof pool if you enjoy sun. No shades excepts for umbrellas provided. At busy times, sun beds can be hard to come by.

3. Great sound proofing in the room considering the noise from the hussle from the street. Though this turns into a negative (see below)

4. The bed is nice and soft.

5. Wifi is strong.

Negatives:
1. The hotel does not provide a second room key. Very frustrating, the most frustrating part was they wouldn't tell me up front. They kept telling me to come back later on the day as they had run out of cards. It was only after my 4th attempt I had someone tell me that they didn't provide second room keys.

2. The shower was quite dirty. It desperately needed some form of bleach. Mould all around. You can tell it's not scrubbed when cleaned... (if cleaned)

3. If you are bladder shy with your travelling companion, do not choose this hotel. There is not a lot of privacy between the bed and the shower/toilet. There are no solid roof to floor walls. You hear everything..

4. The room is incredibly spacious but the space is wasted. The TV ends up looking incredibly small although it's the same size tv you find in your standard hotel - it's just because the room is quite large and the bed is far away from the tv, it feels inadequate. There are nice chairs and day beds, but there were stains on the cushions.

5. When we arrived - the shower didn't drain very well. They were attentive in clearing the pipes when we told the front desk.

6. The A/C is incredibly loud. You are unable to change the flow of air. It is constantly on high.

7. We weren't given the 24 hour policy - we were told we had to check out by 12pm because the hotel was fully booked the next day. This was quite frustrating as it was one of the reasons why we booked this hotel.

I have previously stayed at Ize which is a few doors down. I find that to be a better hotel in comparison (the breakfast there isn't as good, but a small compromise)",U Paasha Seminyak
2124,In the heart of the Seminyak,30,October 2014,"The U Paasha is a nice hotel smack in the heart of Seminyak. Literally!

You step outside the entrance and you are greeted with the hustle of Bali life… which is not a bad thing… you are surrounded with some of pretty amazing restaurants and bars. All within a few steps from your door.

I found it to be a good value-for-money hotel with beautiful people working there.

I had a few issues with the air conditioning in my room and had to ask for it to be fixed a number of times and each time, it was attended to immediately, couldn't fault the staff one bit.

I would not stay on the 5th floor again as the pool is directly above and you get woken up by children playing at 7.00am in the morning. Every morning!

The breakfast was nice, again for what we paid it was pretty good.

The pool on the rooftop was good for a refresh but not for a proper swim as it is only 1.1 metres deep, but the views and sunsets more than made up for it…

On the whole it is great value for what you spend in a top location.",U Paasha Seminyak
2125,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location!",50,September 2014,"Loved our stay at U Paasha!Huge room with super comfy bed- honestly one of the best sleeps I've ever had at a hotel! Conveniently located in the heart of Seminyak, near all the awesome cafes (Revolver), bars, restaurants & shops! Great pool on the roof- just be careful if you're blonde (my hair turned lime green)! Our flight was cancelled so got to stay an extra night- tip- book on a booking site rather than through the hotel (a lot more expensive for some crazy reason). Would definitely stay again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2126,"Great hotel, great staff.",40,October 2014,Great value modern hotel which is really well designed. Just don't try to find the 4th floor. The staff are great and the views from the rooftop pool are incredible as the sun drops into the sea at sunset. The rooms are very large with incredibly comfortable beds. Loved our trip here and would recommend it.,U Paasha Seminyak
2127,Next to the best resturants in Seminyak!,50,September 2014,"beautiful modern designed hotel in the middle of eat street and walking distance to many good locations of Seminyak.
Very large rooms that are well maintained with balcony's, high floor rooms have views.
Pool on roof top with bar, great for relaxing during the day.
Breakfast anytime you want and the time you check in is the time you check out.
I will be back, thanks for a great stay!",U Paasha Seminyak
2128,Great location,40,September 2014,"Good value hotel, with 24 hour stay/checkout. Great location in Seminyak for coffee, restaurants and shopping. Great suite size rooms, rooftop pool and friendly helpful staff make this a hotel that I would stay at again.
Only constructive feedback is that bathrooms could do with an update.",U Paasha Seminyak
2129,On top of Seminyak,50,October 2014,"Location is very good if you like good restaurants, but Seminyak is busy. Not yet like Kuta but unfortunately the loud Aussie crowd is definitely expanding in this direction. But Seminyak is still fun and you can comfortable walk around in the area. There are many hotels and villa's, but in an area like this a villa wouldn't make much sense as your view would be a wall or the back of an hotel. U Paasha understands that and it's one of the few high buildings which results in a nice view over the rest of Seminyak. Especially from the roof pool you can see a nice sunset, almost better than at the beach. While watching the sunset enjoy the fresh sate lilit (Balinese fish sate), it's very good and not expensive. The pool is big and there is enough space for everyone, sometimes there can be a shortage of beds but that means the lucky ones don't intrude each other privacy. There is a good mix of people and any noise will come from the few Aussies that have found this. I don't know for how long... What's special about U Paasha is the size. It's very spacious, big hallways and rooms are huge. They are huge but so well designed that they still feel very cosy. About the design: it's awesome. There has been thought about every detail and color. Design is five star. But it's unfortunate that it's very hard to find precise construction workers in Bali and that can be seen in u Paasha as well. There are some cracks and stains, but it's still very clean. The downside of a big room in Bali, is that it needs a big air conditioning and those are loud. The one in U Paasha is like an airplane engine but it works and you can get used to it. If U Paasha needed to prioritize anything it should be replacing that airco. There is enough to say about how good this hotel is, but it starts with checking in. 24h stay, how awesome and convenient is that! Check in at 10pm after a long flight, no problem check out at 10pm also. U Paasha sets the standard for this. Same with the breakfast, don't want to wake up early? No problem they will bring your breakfast to the room at your preferred time. The score for U Paasha: 8 and will definitely stay again. Just replace that airco and it will be a 9.",U Paasha Seminyak
2130,Superb,50,September 2014,"Stayed there during sept 14 .

Been to bali on 24 occasions , and
U passha made it feel like the first time.

Awesome management supported by a very proactive crew willing to fulfil all your expectations.

Exceptional service on all fronts .
Centrally located, next to boutique coffee houses ,restaurants and eateries and above all , the best spas and pampering logistics on offer this end of the equator.
I highly recommend U passha to anyone .",U Paasha Seminyak
2131,"Great Location, huge rooms",50,September 2014,"I stayed a the U Paasha for four nights with my family and having nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The rooms were huge and would be considered a suite at most hotels. We had connecting rooms but each room was big enough that we could all spend time in one room

The breakfast was good with a few items changing each day to provide variety, with a range big enough to keep everyone happy.

The roof-top pool was just like in the photos and the service (& prices) was good.

The location was close to many other bars, shops and restaurants in Seminyak and I would not hesitate staying there again.

Their 24 room policy is unique (not that we used it) we check-out time is 24 hours after you check-in. Which is great it you arrive and depart from Bali late at night.",U Paasha Seminyak
2132,Great,40,September 2014,"We were really impressed with our room at U Paasha. It was so big and spacious and tastefully decorated. It had a great bathroom, two lounges, a huge desk.. I loved it all. The staff around the pool had trouble getting their head around the concept of charging the poolside drinks/meals to our room account - a simple concept that happens daily (and seamlessly) across Bali. I think perhaps their English was lacking.. and to be honest the poolside staff were not particularly obliging, but what we lost there we made up for in a great room, great central location and a great buffet breakfast.",U Paasha Seminyak
2133,Absolutely wonderful all round!!,50,September 2014,"What a Fantastic 6 nights we had here...wished we had of stayed for 8 nights! Wonderful staff who spoke basic English. Roof top pool is amazing, big enough to fit most guests and sun lounger chairs are new with single, double or even bigger sun chairs to choose from. Everytime we went swimming there was a sun chair for me and my partner to use. In central Seminyak, loads of shopping, about a 5 minute walk to the beach. Yummy restaurants to choose from close by...Full breakfast is a highlight with loads of breakfast options to choose from. Egg station, pancake/waffle station, crispy bacon, dim sims...what more could you ask for?!
Hotel rooms are very spacious, daily service provided, with all the delicious soaps and body washes. Maybe the showers could be a little cleaner but thats just being picky. Pool towels were in great condition. Free Wi-fi also and works in your room. Nothing ever seemed to be a problem - Thank you U Paasha Staff, I will send many clients to you without ease! :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2134,Great location,50,September 2014,Great hotel! Loved the roof top pool. Great for sunset drinks . It was so central to good shopping and great restaurants. If you want to be close to the beach it's probably not the best place but it was a pleasant walk to the beach passing a great coffee shop called grocer and grind,U Paasha Seminyak
2135,Will not visit again,10,September 2014,"Read from Agoda to provide hotel info abt check in time as they need to plan our stay. Received confirmation on about timing, yet when we arrived timely we were asked to wait 1.5hrs. I insisted on getting a room immediately as my toddler had to sleep. Prob big mistake as the room was terrible

1) many mosquitoes in room.
2) air con was loud and very noisy. I had to turn in to 26deg and the noise went away.
3) blood stain on bedsheet. I only discovered the next morning.
4) very old and greyish towels

The only thing gd was the location and size.
Definitely will not stay here again and i am glad we only booked for a night",U Paasha Seminyak
2136,Enjoyed my stay here,50,May 2014,"Good location with lots of nice restaurants around the area. Love the 24hrs check in, arrived at 8pm and check out around 7+PM to caught our flight home. The room was big and clean. Free baby cot was provided. Didn't touch the fruits platter as there were ants crawling all around it. Nice pool with a good view. We tried the BBQ buffet at the roof top bar on our 1st night, the pork ribs was really good (better than the wahaha pork ribs).
We will definitely come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2137,Lovely stay,40,September 2014,"Stayed with a friend for 3 nights. Rooms were lovely as were the staff.

Lovely breakfasts, but the food and drink did take awhile to come when on the rooftop pool

Only negative- one key per room! With two people staying in one room, this should be a given. Never had this issue before. When we asked for another one was told there wasn't enough keys?

Would recommend though. Great location",U Paasha Seminyak
2138,Loved this hotel..,50,September 2014,"My boyfriend and I have just got back from our stay at U Paasha, I can't recommend it enough. The breakfast was AMAZING and the rooms were big and clean. The vibe of the hotel is pretty stylish and the pool did not disappoint. The staff are very friendly also and food and drink service at the pool is pretty good.

We went slightly out season so I think it was a bit quieter than usual which was great. You also can't beat the location - right in the middle of everything. The free Wi-Fi was great, it worked in the room, reception and rooftop pool.

The only thing I would say is I didn't have the rooftop bar so much. The one downstairs is much nicer. But everything else was perfect for us, we'd go back next time!",U Paasha Seminyak
2139,"Professional, well-trained staff, great food, comfortable room",50,August 2014,"Our Bali-specialist travel agent booked us into U Paasha Seminyak for five nights in July-August 2014 and once checked in we were very impressed with her recommendation! The central location gives direct access to some of Seminyak's best shopping and dining precincts, without the need for transport. We have visited Bali many times and our room was among the most comfortable of all the hotels or villas we've stayed in over the years.

Our beds were large, our aircon was more effective than any I've previously experienced in Bali, the bathroom was lavish with a fragrant selection of soaps and shampoos, and the shower itself was spacious with a nice high water outlet allowing you to stand fully upright to wash (important when you're nearly 2m tall!) We had a west-facing position on Floor 5, which allowed us to enjoy sunsets from our own room. My only suggestion for our room perhaps would be to replace the quirky circular seat with a more comfortable regular lounge or even just a few normal chairs around the coffee table, as the round seat was too low for my older relatives to sit in comfortably.

In many Bali hotels and villas, staff can often be anything from laid back to downright lazy. I am pleased to say this is not the case at U Paasha, where we experienced world-class professionalism from the whole team. The staff were attentive to all our needs and helped us promptly with any of our requests, including general room service needs, laundry and even made the extra effort to help us locate and recover lost property. I was also very impressed that the General Manager maintains a high service standard at the hotel by personally checking on all sections of the U Paasha staff team on a daily basis and also takes the time to chat with guests during breakfast.

The U Paasha breakfast buffet itself was a daily highlight during our stay. There is something for everyone and we were able to choose from a vast selection of foods including Chinese/East Asian, Indonesian/South East Asian, many Western-style breakfast choices, great omelettes from the egg station, a waffle & pancake station and outstanding coffee. Some of the food selections are changed from day to day so it never gets boring or repetitive. The head chef clearly has a love and respect for good cuisine and the other breakfast staff are fast, efficient and attentive.

We also spent time in the rooftop pool and bar area, which offers superb 360 degree views and often has a refreshing breeze. There we enjoyed massages, cocktails, relaxation by the pool and the delicious rooftop barbeque - this I can thoroughly recommend to anyone staying elsewhere in Seminyak who wants to try something different to the trendy (but oft-times over-rated and stuffy) street-level restaurants in Jl Laksmana, as the elevated position allows you to dine somewhere cool and fresh, with a great view of the lights of southern Bali by night.

We were sufficiently impressed with U Paasha that we chose to stay there for an additional five nights at the end of our visit to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2140,Great location and beautiful hotel,40,August 2014,"Great location with a beautiful rooftop pool. It is about a ten minute walk to the beach. The hotel is located in the heart of the city near shops, restaurants and bars. Clean rooms. Only issues are closet doors don't close well and we had to switch rooms because of an electrical problem the first day.",U Paasha Seminyak
2141,Over Rated Hotel with Bad Service,10,September 2014,We visited U Pasha with our family and very disappointed with the facilities and services provided at the hotel. It takes 30 minutes to get beer at Happy hours and it was over priced. I will not come back to U Pasha and will not recommend to any visitor to stay here especially the roof top bar.,U Paasha Seminyak
2142,"Fantastic location, great staff - highly recommended!",40,August 2014,"My wife, daughter and I stayed at the U Paasha for five nights in August 2014. We had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for:

- A stylish and extremely well located hotel
- Fantastic and very friendly staff
- Flexibility (we were allowed a late check out which was hugely helpful with a 2 year old sleeping at the check out time)

The U Paasha is located in the heart of Bali's ""Eat Street"" and is extremely conveniently located for bars, restaurants and beach bars.

The rooftop pool is also excellent and a great place to watch the sunset and get a massage (highly recommended).",U Paasha Seminyak
2143,A nice hotel in a good location with a high price,30,April 2014,"Bali has quite a few hotels so choosing is not easy. Tourism and prices have reached a level where one should carefully consider if the beauty of the landscape weighs off the masses of tourists and the open greed of most locals trying to make your wallet as light as possible.

Seminyak is considered a posh area on the south coast (read expensive) and it is indeed a bit more upper class than Kuta (choose that for lowest price and a backpackers experience). Easy to get there with public transport or taxi. Beach not too far away however no swimming because of the dangerous currents. Many restaurants and nightlife and shopping options on the doorstep, all on a high price point compared to other nearby Asian countries offering tropical beach holidays.

Hotel is nicely build and clean. Huge rooms, ideal for running your children or practicing your latest ballroom capabilities, aircon is a bit noisy but bearable. Bathroom amenities, TV, WiFi all work as can be expected in a developing country.

Only visited the rooftop pool in the night so cannot comment on the lack of deckchair problem. Never tried the restaurants or the bar either. Loved the breakfast buffet though. Staff attentive and friendly.

If only the people on the island had conserved their open and friendly attitude towards visitors this would still be one of the best places on earth for a summer holiday in the tropics.

The 120 USD we had to pay per nigh which needs to be paid upfront (in reality, they claim not but they take the full amount from your credit card the moment you book and it is non-refundable even if you stay and maybe need to leave a day early) is not worth it in my opinion.

Also be aware the airport tax has silently raised to 200k pP so if you save in local currency what everyone tells you, you will still fall in the trap of bad exchange rates and high credit card commissions the local government has set up to give its visitors a nice goodbye and screw you a last time for a nice memory of Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2144,Ini baru hebat,50,April 2014,"- Flexibility #1, for instance: breakfast can be ordered everywhere: in-room, at the pool, at the rooftopbar and throughout the day so you never miss a breakfast. This service is free of charge! - Flexibility #2, check-in at 17.00, then check-out until 17.00. This is very convenient. - The design details of the hotel. Everything is beautiful and well thought - except the materialisation of the entrance which allready show some aging while this hotel is just 1 year old. The rooms however is spacious, very well designed and of a high comfortlevel. - Pool on the roof is perfect - always sun which makes the water-temperature perfect and no need to reserve the bale. Massage is also possible on the rooftop. - Very good restaurants just across the street. - Nice shopping area with high-end shops. - Complementary drinks valid througout your stay. - This hotel sets a new standard in terms of flexibility and convenience. They really put the guest central.",U Paasha Seminyak
2145,Rooftop Barbecue is a must.,50,September 2014,"Had a lovely night on the rooftop of the Hotel, for a barbecue with seafood,chicken,steak and pork ribs. As much as you can eat with all the side trimmings as well as great view over Bali at night.
Would definitely recommend this for anyone when you are in Seminyak. Good Value.",U Paasha Seminyak
2146,Great location,40,August 2014,"We stayed here on the last part of our honeymoon in bali. When we were first arrived we stayed in IZE hotel which was nice but pool wasn't great. We chose here for location and rooftop pool. Large clean rooms with air conditioning. We used the pool although it's a struggle to get a sun lounger. We ordered food by the pool which was pleasant.

Breakfast was delicious with loads on offer from pancakes, pastries and a fry.

The laundry service was expensive.",U Paasha Seminyak
2147,Excellent,50,September 2014,"My family and I are seasoned holiday makers to Bali for over 10 years and this hotel stay for us was excellent and such great value.

We stayed for 4 nights traveling with young children and loved everything, from the facilities to the professional and friendly staff all made this place the best stay of our trip.

We felt very welcomed, even the hotel manger/owners would greet us when they passed by.
Rooms were beautiful, clean and spacious, wifi was good and the rooftop pool area was great fun.

What surprised me the most was how delicious the food was, breakfast came with many choices, the standard of the dinner deals were also very tasty so it was a good option when you didn't feel like dining out.
The hotel's location is in the heart of Seminyak so great for shopping and dining.

We had such a memorable stay and would highly recommend to all, I am looking forward to trying out more U Paasha hotels around Asia if the standard here is anything to go by.",U Paasha Seminyak
2148,Fantastic 5 star hotel!!,50,August 2014,"I stayed here for 5 nights last week & can honestly say that it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Staff are so friendly, accommodating, polite & their English is also very good. The hotel's in a great spot- with both bars & restaurants on your doorstep. Saying that, the hotel itself was very quiet- you'd never even know once inside this compound of paradise that you're staying right in the heart of Seminyak. Rooms were immaculate & very spacious. The breakfasts were fabulous- be sure to try the omelette (with everything)... I had one every day! The pool, rooftop & bar was great & very relaxing. I like the fact that they play music whilst you laze around the pool, sipping cocktails! Also, one of the things we like best was that you can checkout whenever you like! They don't ship you out by 10/11am on your last day, you can keep coming back to your room righ tuntil you go off to the Airport! In our case- this was 7pm, which allowed us to sit round the pool a while longer & freshen-up before sadly heading home. Thanks U Paasha- you guys were amazing!! We will be back next year for sure :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2149,Location location location,40,August 2014,And at a great price with a nice buffet breakfast included . Request for ice and ironing board were attended to promptly. The rooms are large and comfortable. My room was on the 5th floor and there was some early morning noise from the pool/bar area above - it was not too loud but may bother some light sleepers. 24 hour stay is wonderful if arriving and departing late. My one complaint is that I requested a twin room on the fifth floor on the ocean side the receptionist said twin rooms were not possible on that side and that there were none available anyway but after checking in I saw the cleaners in two empty ocean view twin set ups on the fifth floor - not the end of the world just a little disappointing as we stayed for six nights.,U Paasha Seminyak
2150,My Second home during trip to Bali,40,August 2014,"This is my 6 times stay ( i thing more) in U Paasha Seminyak Hotel Bali and i always have a good experience. Nothing much to shout since by location is exact in Seminyak and closed to point another point such as Petitenget, Kerobokan, Legian etc and thats the reason i always stay in this hotel.

All good seriously, the only thing my advise is please provide ""bottle opener"" in the room and i thing this is something not ""wow"" request, you may only need IDR3,000 - $10,000 per opener to buy a bottle opener instead of your staff ""Sorry we cant borrow you since we only have one"" I was not happy with the answer instead entire my stay in hotel always provide.

The reason for Bali is very important, your guest is 90% is tourist which they most likely buy something from other store outside of your hotel, so imagine for example 50 guests buy 1 - 2 bottles beer so how your staff can handle it if your guests need a bottle opener??

Is not complain for sure, its just an advise based on my experience!!

But overall my stay was good and i am happy!",U Paasha Seminyak
2151,My new favourite!,50,August 2014,"Just got back from a 4 day stay at U Paasha. I was so impressed with this hotel, it has to be the best in its price range in Bali. The hotel is new and funky, perfect for young couples. I would say it's not the best option for families with kids, the pool area is not geared up for children and the times when small children were charging up and down the decking by the pool were rather disruptive to my R&R, families, please go elsewhere. The rooms are huge and spacious, with king size beds and huge soft pillows - bliss. The interior decor is cool and modern and the wide airy corridors are beautiful. The only issue with the rooms is that there is no door to the bathroom, it is all open plan, so if you're a little bit shy this may not be the hotel for you. The rooftop pool is stunning, sea views, constant chill out music and polite and attentive waiters to bring you cocktails to sip. The breakfast is great, plenty of options including eggs made to order, every element to make a good English breakfast, pancakes, and the best barista made coffees we had in Bali. The location of the hotel is perfect, directly opposite lots of great restaurants and a 2 minute walk to seminyak square. You could not get a more central location. Make sure you ask for a room at the back of the hotel, these are the furthest from the street and therefore the quietest.",U Paasha Seminyak
2152,Best hotel I've stayed in,50,August 2014,"The best hotel I've stayed in in my life. We had such an amazing experience at the U Paasha hotel. We even got upgraded to a penthouse during our stay. The staff was always super helpful and very friendly. Pool area was amazing, everything was amazing! You guys are doing a great job at your hotel and we will definitely be staying with you guys in a year when we are planing on going back to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2153,Great hotel in the heart of Seminyak!!,40,August 2014,"We had a 4 night stay and this hotel was just perfect for us as it is in such a great spot! You are surrounded by shops and restaurants and only a short taxi ride to Petitenget which is a favourite area of ours for shopping and eating.
The check in process was quick and efficient and as we arrived in the late evening our room was ready. The complimentary breakfast had heaps of options and never seemed busy. Our room was huge and the bed was very comfortable. Our shower was quite dirty and the white sheets were also quite stained. Our toilet blocked on our second day but it was fixed by the time we returned from breakfast.
Our room was on the ground floor and we were worried about the noise from the street and front bar but we we didn't hear a thing other than other guests coming home at 2am and being inconsiderate. The air conditioner in the room is extremely noisy but it didn't bother us.
The roof top pool was a lovely place to spend time and was never busy despite the hotel being 90% full.
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again as a couple but probably not with children. It was extremely good value!!!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
2154,Fab hotel,50,August 2014,"We stayed for seven nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Location - excellent, close to all the best restaurants including mama sands, bamboo, and ultimo. 10 mins walks to the beach and KU DE TA, amazing views of the sunset whilst listening to great music.

Breakfast - fab, lots of choices to suite everyone tastes.

Pool - incredible, peaceful with stunning views. Service is very good and the food is nice and quite cheap.

Rooms - spacious and clean. Showers could have been better but not a massive issue.

We were situated on the 5th floor towards the back of the hotel which is away from the reception and bar. The music in the bar is loud so ask to stay at the back of the hotel.

Overall a great experience and would recommend for couple and families alike.",U Paasha Seminyak
2155,Customer service from GM down,50,August 2014,"I have previously lived in Bali for two years and always arrange my own accommodation..but my well informed Travel agent Nicki Lawson recommended tiring Seminyak n UPaasha.. The 24 hr check in is fantastic idea cos we arrived at 4.30pmwhich meant we had the room till 4.30 on day of check out..check in was fast efficient and I didn't like position of room allocated,no problem moved to exactly what suited us..I have stayed in hotels in several countries and the service from Mr Gindo , General Manager,Anna on Reception,Chef and each staff member encountered ,was exceptional..great bfast,cleanliness matte notion to detail.This can only be achieved when the standard is set by a General Manager who was always available..We were so impressed after first five days,we returned for the last five days of holiday..only drawback for me, although on Eat Street n boutiques etc.perfection would be right on beach..Btw..we had twin bed room on 5th floor ,uneven number side..Will certainly return,,",U Paasha Seminyak
2156,Great hotel!,40,August 2014,"Such a great hotel! Couldn't be any more central being right on eat street in the heart of seminyak. 10 minute walk to beach. Big rooftop pool with a breeze making it not too hot up there. Super spacious rooms, friendly staff, nice breakfast. Aircon in room was located in a smart spot so it doesn't blow cold air into your face all night. Free bicycles for hire. Very happy.",U Paasha Seminyak
2157,Excelent,40,July 2014,"Excelent Hotel, located at the heart of semyniak
Staff very friendly, rooms very quiet and very spacious
Very charming pool at the roof top, free wifi
Breakfast not many western options varieties but ok",U Paasha Seminyak
2158,Great hotel in a fantastic location,50,July 2014,"Located right in the middle of all the bustle of upmarket Seminyak, you can walk out of the hotel right into the main street with loads of restaurants and shops to choose from. Another bonus was the spacious rooms and pool area. Apart from breakfast,we did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on the restaurants .

The rooms are really nice BUT we had to move the first night as the noise from the street was so bad we could not sleep. Once we moved a few rooms up, we could no longer hear the noise.

Another negative is that whilst the 24hour check in sounded great, we booked two rooms for a 1.00 pm arrival but could not get access to the second room until after 9.00 pm. There was no duty manager on to complain too. The next day I complained to the reservation manager who did do the right thing by not charging us for one night's accommodation for one room but it was very inconvenient and spoilt the start of our holiday.",U Paasha Seminyak
2159,Excellent little find!,40,August 2014,"I was a bit worried about this hotel as I had never heard of it (and I'm a travel agent!!) but it had good reviews and it was a good price. When the taxi pulled up I realized I had nothing to worry about! Firstly the entrance/lobby is all open air, very comfortable with many seats and a very calming vibe. The restaurant just off to the side is all very open and comfortable also. Enough tables for everyone without feeling crowded.
When we showed up at 4pm our room wasn't ready - that's because they let you check in AND out at whatever time you want (which was good for us with an afternoon flight, no trying to occupy ourselves for the last few hours worrying about luggage). We went downstairs to the large bar for our welcome drink. There are outside and inside areas to sit, they have happy hour 6pm-8pm every night and judging from the music it's quite a popular place (side note: you CAN hear the music in your room HOWEVER it's so quiet it sounds like it's far in the distance).
Once we got in our room we were surprised at the size. It was MASSIVE!! The only downside is the bathroom is not very private. The doors to the shower and toilet are frosted but have no lock or anything, they're just swing doors....they're also not soundproof if you know what I mean!!. It wasn't a problem though, we just took showers when the other was watching TV or reading.
We went up to the rooftop pool and it was amazing! Open until late we sat on a cabana and had dinner and drinks there the first night. Quite busy during the day because it gets good sun coverage, lots of tanning going on. Not difficult to find somewhere to lay although the cabanas go early and if you have a big group it may be difficult to find a whole bunch of seats together. The pool is just a simple style and not massive or anything but considering the amount of people that went swimming it wasn't a problem. I think if you had more than about 10 people in there at once it may feel a little cosy though.

LOCATION: Because it's so centrally located we walked around checking out the local stores and restaurants while we waited to get into our room. It's about a 10 minute walk to Ku De Ta (20 if you get distracted by the markets like we did. The little carpark marketplace we found had the same stuff as the Kuta markets without the harassment and loud yelling that go with them). Security very helpful getting taxis for us (usually only took them about 20 seconds!) and was around IDR50,000 (about AUD$5) to get into Kuta. Getting back was always a tad more difficult for some reason, it always cost us 2-3 times more but that's not the hotels fault.

OVERALL: This hotel is a little gem. If you want staff that go out of their way to help you and smile and say hello when passing in the hall, good food and drinks, great location and general value for money then this is the hotel for you!",U Paasha Seminyak
2160,"Modern, fresh and easy",50,January 2014,U Paasha is a breath of fresh air in Bali. It's uncomplicated design and service are minimalist in their approach but it works. It is not your typical 5 star and I prefer the boutique feel of this sophisticated hotel. The pool upstairs is rad and the 2 for 1 cocktail happy hour adds to the rad sunset on the pool deck. Book - you won't be disappointed!,U Paasha Seminyak
2161,Great Hotel,40,July 2014,"The hotel is located perfectly in the middle of Jalan Laksmana, close to shopping and restaurants and a short walk to the beach. The rooms are a great size, very clean and modern with all the facilities you need. Bathroom very spacious also with lovely amenities. Staff all very helpful and friendly and service is always prompt. The roof top pool is the most amazing space with great views and all day sunshine!",U Paasha Seminyak
2162,U Paasah Dave's 50th.,50,August 2014,"I would highly recommend a stay @ the U Paasha Hotel in Seminyak.
Rooftop Pool is fantastic,rooms are nice,food great & service excellent.

Downstairs Bar has happy hour every night & great place with music pumping whilst being served by the lovely girls (Tia Maria) was our favourite.

Right in amongst all the great bars,retaurants etc in Seminyak,great place to stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
2163,Great location,40,January 2014,"Enjoyed my 8 night stay here. Because it's quite new it still has a few teething problems.
The location is fantastic, right on eat street, just a stroll down the road and your at some of the best eateries.",U Paasha Seminyak
2164,Great place in the heart of Seminyak!,40,July 2014,"The location of this place was superb! You literally walk out onto the most happening street in Seminyak. The rooms at this hotel were one of the biggest hotel rooms I've seen which was really nice! The breakfast was also amazing! There was a wide variety of food to choose from everyday. The rooftop pool is also breathtaking, but was quite crowded. The beach is only a 10-15 walk from the hotel if you get bored of the pool.

Right outside the hotel, there is a wide variety of restaurants and boutiques to eat and look at! However, these places would be packed by 6 or 7pm. We had to wait at least half an hour for a table each night. Our favorites were Altimo and Mykonos, both packed and amazing food. You definitely need a whole day or two to just walk the streets of Seminyak to see all the different boutiques! One thing though, we were told to beware of drinking ice water, as sometimes the ice is not made from clean water. My 2 daughters ended up getting a stomach infection on the last day, and we were told by the doctor that this was quite common for tourists.

Overall, this place was great and i would highly recommend it. Seminyak is a great place to be in! However, wouldnt recommend it for more than 3 days as you will run out of things to do.",U Paasha Seminyak
2165,Lovely hotel,50,August 2014,"We had a fantastic stay at u Paasha. The room was huge and the bathroom was great, loved the big shower. The buffet breakfast was fantastic, delicious pastries! Wide variety of good food. The pool area is lovely, sometimes hard to get a bed if you're not there by 11 (but people vacate regularly so you won't be waiting too long). Good service up on the roof, we are lunch by the pool one day and it was very tasty indeed.

My only complaints; they refuse to give you more than one towel per person, which seems stingy and silly for such a good hotel.
The air con in the roof is tremendously loud, it works well and didn't affect me but was a bit too loud for my girlfriend.
And finally, although the bed was DREAMY and so comfy, the bedding didn't fit! The sheet was too small for the bed, which at first we thought maybe they put on the wrong size, but every day it was the same! A good 4 or 5 inches too short for the bed. Bizarre.

Fantastic location, and a great hotel. Would definitely recommend and stay here again",U Paasha Seminyak
2166,Staying in this hotel,20,July 2014,"We went to Seminyak at our honeymoon in July, 2014. I can say that this hotel is not worth 4 stars. It's hard to believe it was built only a year ago... The towels were grey, the floor in the bathroom was cracked, it was too noisy at night and one morning there was no water there. We planned to stay there for 10 nights, but we checked out earlier. We moved to Nusa Dua and stayed at Mariott Courtyard there. The price was the same, but it was absolutely different. I highly recommend everyone this hotel. They have a private beach, where you can be taken every 30 min by their minibus. The food in the nearby restaurants is great, and the prices are cheaper than in Seminyak. If you like massage, you can have it for only $15 there. I wish everyone a good holiday. Yelena.",U Paasha Seminyak
2167,Great Servic,40,July 2014,"I stayed in the hotel for a week and we had a really good experience. In the beginning I was worried about the noise from outside as it is located in one of the most popular streets in Seminyak, However we couldn't hear the noise from outside which was great. All the staff in this hotel are very friendly and always happy to help. The roof top pool is very relaxing and with a beautiful view. My husband and I used to go to see the sunset lying on one of the beds next to the bar. You can't missed the BBQ they offer is just amazing and only $19 all you can eat, our best meal in Bali. Overall the hotel was the best part of our trip as I didn't like Bali that much, probably because I had a high expectation and I couldn't see why Australians love it so much. There are not side walks, so you have to share the road with motorbikes and cars, beach and streets are dirty, so I was a bit stress outside of the hotel. Anyway you have to know the place to talk about it I guess.",U Paasha Seminyak
2168,BEST STAY YET,50,June 2014,"Had a wonderful stay at Upaasha, The rooftop pool and bar area was amazing. Sunshine all day then a delightful view of the sunsets. The rooms were clean and comfy. The location is perfect for shopping and many eateries in the area. The buffet breakfast was sensational. Overall an amazing experience. Wouldn't stay any where else. THANK YOU.",U Paasha Seminyak
2169,Nice hotel,40,June 2014,"Lovely hotel, big rooms, very spacious and plenty of storage. Breakfast was nice and the staff at reception very helpful. A little disorganised at times but typically Balinese. Great location with plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep",U Paasha Seminyak
2170,Clean and Comfortable,40,July 2014,"U Paasha is a clean and quite comfortable hotel in Seminyak Bali, it's located in the middle of Oberoi Road, so there is a fair few shops and restaurants all next door and within walking distance, I also walked to the beach which was not far either, maybe around 10-15 minutes.

The hotel is well presented and offers a fairly nice buffet breakfirst, lots of choices and friendly smiling staff. The rooms are also quite nice, and comfortable, furnished really well with nice lamps, chairs, great big bathroom with large shower, and great size bed, roof top swimming pool and deck area was also quite nice, smiling friendly staff and enough deck chairs for everyone to enjoy, lovely views too.

WiFi is typical for SE Asia region at hotels, disconnects continually, sometimes as much as twice a minute, I've had to accept this is just the way it is, as I've had the same issue at hotels through Thailand too, my hot water kept running out after only 2-3 minutes of showering every morning, I had notified the reception twice and they said a engineer would look into it, but the same problem occurred every morning of my 2 week stay, no hot water after 2-3 minutes if showering, the air conditioner is quite loud but that was ok, I was fine to leave it off and have the balcony doors open letting some fresh air in, I don't like air conditioners and overall noise of other rooms was acceptable, not too bad at all.

In conclusion, I would rate U Paasha as a borderline corporate hotel over a resort style hotel, it doesn't have the plush surroundings and comforts of a resort that make you wanna stay within the walls of the hotel, but it is indeed a comfortable and nice hotel to come home to everyday after exploring Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2171,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,August 2014,"This was a wise choice staying here. The hotel is conveniently located near the beach, in the center of shopping street, have a beautiful rooftop pool, happy hour on the rooftop bar and downstairs bar, tasty breakfast with lots of option and a large clean bedroom! What do you need more?",U Paasha Seminyak
2172,Would definitely stay again,50,July 2014,"We loved U Paasha, We thought the location was ideal for a stay in Seminyak and we couldn't flaw our experience. The roof top pool was great and not too busy, and the breakfasts were absolutely delicious, with delightful staff members. It was our first time in Seminyak and we had considered staying in a Villa, but I think this was a much better choice. Our only concern was when another guest charged a spa charge to our room number (which was a shock at checkout) however staff quickly were able to resolve this. I can't wait to come back and stay at U Paasha again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2173,It's U Paasha,40,July 2014,"It's not a very big one that you will expecting for but it's unique one!
Location is great for those who love Seminyak area. Room is homie with comfy bed and the General Manager will greet you upon breakfast time. Oh, and 24 hours check in concept is lovely.
Surely will come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2174,Great location,40,July 2014,"Location was fantastic right In the middle of eat street. The street offers all wonderful bars restaurants, boutique shopping, beauty places, money exchange and convenient stores. Markets are an easy walk away and semiyak square within metres. You never need to leave this strip, its all you could want. The room was large and bed very comfy. Floors polished concrete, modern decor clean and fresh, some mildew starting to form in shower which does need attention. The balcony is very narrow, so not somewhere to lounge on and outlook not hat pleasant (villas and vacant land being prepared for a build). The only major annoyance was the airconditioner, whilst effective, it was extremely loud. Couldn't sleep with it on. The shower water pressure is not super strong. But lovely large bathroom, no bathtub. The corridors are polished Concrete floors and very wide, which can lend itnself to being noisy, although we only heard the odd inconsiderate guests with children running and screaming up the corridor. The rooftop bar and pool were nice. The bar overlooks towards the beach. Breakfast was typical of a restaurant buffet style offering all the choices you would want. Staff were lovely and accommodating to requests. The hotel is only a couple of years old, it was great value at $129 a night (through travel online, highly recommend). I would stay there again as the location really is fantastic! Step out the door and step into all the action. At night you are spoilt for choice. I recommend, chanti - for drinks and great value lunch, check out their lunch for 2 people at 18,000IDR needs to be ordered 24 hours in advance. Ultimos - dinner, but must book in advance or you will never get in! The junction - great food lunch or dinner. Bistrot - lovely modern ambience great food. La Favala - (hard to find as tucked away hidden on Main Street, opposite red carpet champange bar) - just go and look inside, amazing! Red carpet champagne bar - great for a drink anytime, and complimentary nibbles are awesome, but at night around 9 or 10 the place has great atmosphere and fun music. Mama sans - at the top of eat street the best meal ever! Fantastic Asian fusion good you will not be disappointed. Same owner as the sarong, which is a taxi ride away but equally worth it!",U Paasha Seminyak
2175,Love U Paasha!,50,July 2014,"What a fabulous find. So pleased we chose U Paasha for our stay.
Fantastic location, amongst the fabulous restaurants and shopping of Oberoi St.
Rooms were modern and spacious, bed was super comfy.
Breakfast was delicious with an abundance of choice.
Rooftop pool area was great, very clean and a beautiful sea breeze and amazing views over Seminyak and the beach. Rooftop bar area also great for a sunset cocktail before dinner.
Staff were always friendly and accommodating.
Bathrooms great but unsure if there are any rooms with a bath so you may need to check if holidaying with small children.
Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and staying here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2176,Secret Pool bar,50,July 2014,"We just went up for a drink to the rooftop bar, and the staff was very nice to us, treated us like hotel guests. Not the cheapest booze, but the environment is luxurious and relaxing. Would go to stay there too, if price is not too exorbitant.",U Paasha Seminyak
2177,A great introduction to Seminyak,50,July 2014,"Huge rooms, great space, friendly staff and great value. Pool was nice. I scored breakfast and an airport pick up at no extra charge by booking directly with the hotel.

Felt very safe staying here as a solo female traveller. Room was always made up by lunchtime which was great.

Central to everything: All the boutiques and shops recommended by other reviewers on here were within walking distance. The 24hour check-in/out system is perfect for evening departure flights.

OK yes, the wi-fi is a little hit and miss but who's in Bali to stare at their screen all day?!
Will certainly stay here again.

For good food nearby, I can recommend Ginger Moon (they do decent wines by the glass at good prices for Bali) and Cafe Bali for quick meals - both are practically across the road from the hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2178,"great location, nice hotel",50,July 2014,"If you want to be in the middle of everything stay at U Paasha! Walk to loads of great restaurants. Nice rooftop pool. Yes the air-conditioning is a bit loud but you get used to it (and I am a light sleeper). I had no problem, but my friends room did get a little smell from the bathroom, but only on one day then it went away. The rooms are huge. The beds are really comfortable. 24 hour check in system is a bonus, especially with a late flight. Breakfast is good. Staff are helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend and I would stay again at U Paasha. Oh and they got nice new big beach towels for the pool (previous reviewer commented on old towels).",U Paasha Seminyak
2179,Ahhhhmazing,50,July 2014,Rooms are huge and comfortable for reasonable prices. The buffet breakfast is divine especially the omlettes. The rooftop pool environment so relaxing. Staff very very helpful and friendly. Definitely coming back to stay again.,U Paasha Seminyak
2180,Great modern hotel,50,July 2014,"This hotel is in a great spot, rooms were big, modern, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was great, lots of variety. Roof top pool was fantastic. It is good value for money. It is our favourite hotel in Bali, we would definitely stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2181,Superb,50,July 2014,"The rooms are huge, modern, well appointed and the staff cannot be more friendly. When we had the tour guide from hell for a bespoke tour, the concierge took this to Management immediately and we didn't pay a single cent for the trip. Now that's what I call service!",U Paasha Seminyak
2182,An average stay,30,July 2014,"After a late flight in to Bali, I was picked up by U Paasha at the airport. Upon arrival, I was checked and went straight to my room. I noticed that the sheets were stained. Upon my call, they were replaced and the housekeeping noticed more stains on the bedding and was changed. So after an hour after check in I was able to get to sleep. The soaps, teas and pillows I selected were there but there was no iPod playing. Breakfast was okay but would have liked the coffee service more frequent. The roof top pool looked nice but didn't try it. The snacks and drinks at the rooftop bar were nice but the downstairs bar had a stench to sewerage. On the last night, there was a power outage on the street but the loud humming noise I heard in my room suggested the electricity at the hotel was from a generator. I didn't like the location but then again, others like the location.",U Paasha Seminyak
2183,Great location,40,July 2014,"This hotel is In a fantastic location with lots of great shops and restaurants/cafes nearby. A short walk to seminyak square and other great bars etc. Love the 24 hour check in. Check in time is check out time and the included breakfast, apart from the breakfast buffet in the morning , breakfast can be had at any time during the day.
The staff were reasonably friendly but I didn't really understand having to pay for my entire stay upfront. They also wanted to add another $150.00 US upfront onto my bill for incidentals, mini bar and restaurant. I was not happy with this as most people go out for meals and drinks, and don't stay in the restaurant. So said I would pay any extras with cash, and couldn't bill anything to my room. Normally you pay a bill at the end of your stay.
Air conditioning unit in rooms sounded like a freight train and could not leave it on at night as you couldn't sleep.
Wifi kept dropping out and had to constantly relog in when iPad went into snooze.
For a hotel that's only 1 year old, parts are looking a little worn. The bathrooms were a little mouldy, towels were grey/yellow and the pillows were yellow. The shower and sink often smelled of sewerage and the shower drain didn't really clear quickly and often left you standing in ankle deep water.
The bed sheets were not changed in my whole stay.
The balcony overlooked a noisy resort with no view and no seats. The day bed inside the room was great with lots of cushions to make it comfy.
The roof top pool was nice but not enough lounges and it closed early of a night. They had complimentary sunscreen and also a great cocktail list for the pool area. It does get a little windy up there, being on the roof and the pool is great but not overly big for the size of the hotel. I was surprised there was no spa for such a new, modern hotel.
The rooms were huge, as was the shower and sink area, with 2 sinks and quite a bit of bench space. The beds were comfortable also. Some renovations? Improvements were being done also and jack hammering and construction work could be heard every afternoon.
There are no typical tropical grounds to walk through and enjoy and balconies don't open onto anything. It's a hotel not a resort, so keep this in mind. I would recommend staying here and the location is great but do take in to consideration all of the above.",U Paasha Seminyak
2184,Great Location & Huge Rooms!,30,June 2014,"If you want to be in the heart of Seminyak, this is the place to stay! The rooms are huge and very comfortable fit three of us! They were very modern also! Only downfall was the lack of WIFI. The first day we arrived it was perfect but after that, it would only work if we situated ourselves in the bathroom! I would definitely return to U Paasha, however, make sure the internet was 100% working!",U Paasha Seminyak
2185,Great location,40,June 2014,"This hotel is located in a great spot, lots of cafés, restaurants and shopping at your doorstep.
The beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable and the rooms furnished with nice decor.
Bathrooms were spacious, and unlike other reviews, we never had an issue with our water running out or running cold. Only noticed a slight smell from sewer/shower on a couple of occasions, so really wasn't an issue for us.
I would however agree that I didn't find the linen as clean and fresh as I'd expect from a hotel of this rating, I wouldn't say it was dirty, just wasn't cleaned to a high standard.
Loved the pool area and enjoyed some fabulous cocktails, by the pool and in the rooftop bar. The saté available during late afternoon was yummy! We did have the BBQ one night, but must say none of us were particularly impressed by it, but perhaps that's because the caliber of eateries around the area are exceptional.
As stated in other reviews, the very noisy air conditioning is an issue, and one which I hope the hotel can resolve. Luckily it wasn't overly hot while we stayed, so were able to turn it off during the night when the noise became overbearing.
Breakfast was great, and loved having the choice of any type of coffee we wanted.
Overall, UPaasha was a hotel I'd recommend, however I do hope they can resolve a couple of minor issues, to make it an awesome hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2186,Choose it for Great Location and it's Ok service.,30,July 2014,"Checking in the U paasha is fine not hard to find since it's on a main strip in Seminyak. The lobby is modern kept a bit dark. It was 4pm which is a late check in time, yet our room wasn't ready. Told to take our welcome drinks downstairs at the bar which was fine. At check in you get to choose soaps u like and then they will replenish that one throughout your stay, if available, if not they'll surprise you! After half an hour we went back up. The room is ready but has no pillow covers. So she asked us to wait another 10mins. This time i asked if we can take the room then they can bring pillow covers later since we were not going to sleep. We head upstairs whilst she offered to send the suitcases for us.

The pillow cases came within 2minutes which is fine but we were still waiting for our suitcases half an hour later. So I decided to go downstairs to check on them, (you would ask why didn't I call? Do you ever get a feeling in certain hotels that if u want something done u better do it yourself?) Well, I was right as the suitcases were there in the same spot we left them whilst a lot of staff stood there hands across. I asked if I can take my own suitcases upstairs and they were like yes offcourse like nothing happened while another guy asked me if I needed help with them. And I refused like a nice guest, I don't want to disturb whatever he is not doing.

The room is nice and spacious. Good bed size and amenities. The aircon is a bit noisy. The only problems we had is that the room was being cleaned late at around 4pm every day I'm assuming because we checked it at 4pm the first day, and towels kept diminishing from the first day. First the hand towels left us which we could still live without, then we came back to a cleaned room with no towels at all. We had dinner reservations so we did not appreciate the wait for towels.

The pool is nice great size and you won't have problems finding deck chairs. What I also like is that if u enjoy tanning on sunny days the pool is great since it is has no obstruction from other buildings. The service is also great on sunny days! But like the weather it changes! We used the pool on a cloudy day and yes it wasn't that busy, first we got stained old grey used to be white bath towels instead of the nice pool towels you get on other days. The deck chairs had no padding put on them incase it rained. Oh and the staff were maybe 6 behind the bar chatting in case it rains aswell I'm guessing?

The breakfast is good, eggs on order , Asian options available. Our over all stay is still a good one the location played a good part for us since we had already stayed in Seminyak last year but in a villa further away. So do book this place For its central location and trendy look and spacious rooms. The hotel needs a little push when it comes to service and the little things that make people come back but still recommend it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2187,Great Hotel,50,July 2014,"Stayed there for a night. The service was great and the room was very spacious and well furnished. There's a nice rooftop pool and bar as well. Very centralised location. The hotel is relatively on the pricier side, but it was totally worth it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2188,"Great location, spacious rooms",40,July 2014,"Great location, spacious rooms.

Think the hotel may need some refurbishment; room was a bit worn out I thought.

Otherwise, they've got good breakfast option with great fruit. Price is decent for their location. Hotel staff generally knows what they're doing.

I stayed at TS Suites prior to U Paasha. TS Suites' rooms are newer and arguably nicer, but U Paasha is more central, and I think their hotel staff is better managed (i.e. most understand English better).

Price - fair value. I wouldn't say it's a gem or boutique hotel. Location hard to beat. Wasn't noisy either so I quite enjoyed my stay there.",U Paasha Seminyak
2189,great on all fronts,40,February 2014,"Stayed at the U Paasha in February with wife and one other couple for 6 nights.
The location is great walk out the front and restaurants and bars of all types abound.
Rooms are large and comfortable, love the 24 hour check in/out service that is provided. Roof top pool and bar is a must to visit, staff in all areas of the hotel are friendly and efficient.
will certainly stay there on my next visit to Bali.
A word of warning in relation to money changers, there are a few around that offer a greater exchange rate, upon checking After I left I found that I had been short changed by 400,000 about $38.00 AUD checked the next time and they tried to do it again, according to locals it is widespread in some areas.",U Paasha Seminyak
2190,Great location safe clean very spacious contemporary great breakfast.,40,February 2014,Stayed in upaasha on my own however had friends stay as well same time. For a female traveller on own felt safe. Aim for me was to rest shop and spas! Excellent choice was cheaper then seems price has gone up. Air con kept conking out thats the only minus would of preferred seaview but not available. Appreciated spaciousness of room and little luxuries. Perhaps going off season was cheaper worth its value then.,U Paasha Seminyak
2191,rodent attack,10,July 2014,"Horrible experience! There were rat or rats inside the ceiling inside the hotel suite. Those pests were running and kept making noises. After tossing and turning for several hours, i called the front office and asked for housekeeping staff. They weren't helping at all, they were spraying the exhaust duct with insectides. Of course it did not solve the problem, after a while the rats kept making noises. So we who stayed in the room with the rats did not have a good sleep after all. Seriously it such a major flaw for the hotel. We cannot move to other room since the available room had not been cleaned so we have to wait untill 10 am in the next morning.
Unbelieveable!!",U Paasha Seminyak
2192,Cool hotel at the heart of Seminyak,30,June 2014,"Location is very good! You basically are surrounded by the best restaurants and shops available in Seminyak area, and it's not too far from the beach as well. I love the interior designs, both in the public area and in the rooms. They use 24 hour base from check in to check out, thus when we arrived the rooms were not readily available, which i think was fine since we could stroll around the area, but would've appreciated if they could informed us in advance. Check in process was also a bit slow and when we finally got our rooms after 1-2 hours, the water was not working. Overall I think this hotel has a good potential to be a very good hotel, they just need to pay more attention to details to avoid things like this. The breakfast area was really chill and food was nice. Roof top bar could also be improved and livelier. Upaasha is a good value for money. Hopefully when I come back here the hotel has fully realized its potential.",U Paasha Seminyak
2193,Love their check out policy!,30,March 2014,"I often does check in at night and just want to relax until I check out. The best part of this hotel is that if I checked in at 6 PM they will allow me to check out at 6 PM the next day.
So they really give us a 24 hours to use their facilities including their rooms.
Room is spacious, clean, and modern style.

The only drawback, during my stay the water stinks/smell.
I hope the management have solve this problem.

Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
2194,Excellent Location,50,June 2014,"It was a very good stay. The location is fantastic, the staff very nice and friendly, and the rooftop bar is awesome. Only downside is that they could not accommodate to my request for high floor even though I asked a month in advance, and thus had to put up with the traffic noise from the bustling streets downstairs.",U Paasha Seminyak
2195,Great value in perfect location,50,June 2014,"Seminyak was our last stop on a Bali holiday and Upaasha was perfect. The hotel is in a great location, loads of restaurants and shops around. Great if you want to get out and about but the pool was fantastic too, being on the rooftop it has great views. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They have a 24 hour check in which was perfect for us as my partner was unwell and we were able to extend our check out to just before we had to leave for the airport. Highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2196,"Best location,fantastic breakfast and staff",50,June 2014,"had a lovely time at this hotel the room large, bed and pillows very comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and helpful. the breakfast was excellant and you could ask for extra shots in your coffee if you like a little stronger as we do. Poached eggs down to perfection everytime, which is unheard of in Perth! I dont know why anyone would complain about the breakfast you could have it anywhere in the hotel and it was of a very high standard. As always with Bali hotels they get a little tired very quickly but it was still beautifully clean. enjoyed the 2 for 1 cocktails during the happy hour and the free fruit kebabs around the pool. considering the price we paid through webjet all in all a great holiday.",U Paasha Seminyak
2197,Excellent location and service,40,June 2014,"Stayed here for just over a week with family.

Location is awesome. You are surrounded by a handful of beautiful and popular seminyak restaurants and boutiques. The beach is within walking distance.

The staff are friendly and attentive. By the pool they often walk around handing out fruit kebabs or cups of cold water.

The rooms are quite large with room for a king size bed and two sitting areas with plenty of extra space. Shower is massive! And there is plenty of counter space in the bathrooms.

Breakfast is what I've come to expect with hotel buffets: fruit, salads, cheeses, pastries and hot food. Pretty decent spread that changed every few days.

A few negatives that I hope will be fixed by staff and management:

There was an unpleasant sewerage/drain smell emanating from our open plan bathroom which was very noticeable in our room for a few days.

The air conditioning unit was loud but did not interfere with sleep.

At breakfast the staff did not offer coffee or tea upon arrival, and it was hard to find a staff member to order it from.

The happy hour cocktails were incredibly weak.

There was a lack of sun beds around the pool area.

The bathroom situation may make sharing rooms with siblings/friends awkward as the shower and toilet doors don't close properly and are frosted glass however the ""handle"" is a big hole in the door, meaning there is little-no privacy.

All in all, a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend this hotel to those looking for accommodation on a busy and popular street.",U Paasha Seminyak
2198,Average hotel in a great location,30,June 2014,"Location of this hotel is unbeatable, as it sits on a street bustling with boutiques, eateries both local and of a more Australian feel. Although the hotel has a modern finish, fittings and cleanliness have room for improvement. Our shower door was not fitted properly and scraped heavily along the stone floor on opening and closing. Bed sheets and pillow cases were stained and towels did not smell fresh, despite the daily attendance of housekeeping. Would recommend based on unbeatable location and price, but definitely not up to 4 star standard.",U Paasha Seminyak
2199,Great Location,40,June 2014,"The best thing about this hotel is its location, close to many shops, boutiques, cafes and restaurants. You will never run out of ideas on where to eat. As a newly built hotel, the decor and interior design of the hotel was also nice and modern. The rooms are spacious and the buffet breakfast was wonderful. There was a modest selection of Asian and Western breakfast choices that changed on a daily basis. The staff were also friendly and helpful with all enquiries and information. Overall, good value for money.
The only setback during our stay at the U Paasha Hotel was the cleanliness of our rooms. Our 'new' bedsheets, pillowcases and towels had stains and marks on them. The cleanliness of the shower was also not to the standard of a 4 star hotel. It also appeared the glass door of the shower was not fitted properly as it would constantly drag along the floor on opening and closing.",U Paasha Seminyak
2200,Fantastic cocktails at roof top pool and bar,50,June 2014,"Although we didn't stay here, we did come for cocktails and to watch the sunset. A great location in Eat Street. Bar staff were very friendly. There are games on the tables at the bar like chess, checkers, backgammon etc which was good for kids and adults too. Great cocktails! Really good perspective over the roof tops of Seminyak to the beach. Will definitely come back. One of our friends did stay here and the rooms looked very nice!",U Paasha Seminyak
2201,don't go for breakfast...... unless a a guest,20,June 2014,"firstly my friend's room was big and beautiful.......... nothing to fault. My ""complaint"" is that unless you have breakfast included in your package I would not go there for breakfast. Coffee in a thermos ? why ................? we love our espresso !! and waiting for eggs.poached...while the bread is only slowly cooking.......... cold when the eggs arrive............I hope they understand that we have a""breakfast"" mind set................. and we can be very fussy.............. hot espresso/good eggs/fast service................... we are very fussy and want to get going in the morning with a positive feeling!!!!!!!!................... I""m sure they can do it..................... competition in the area is tough!",U Paasha Seminyak
2202,"Excellent location, great rooms!!",40,June 2014,"This was a 1st trip for our family outing of 19 pax.to Bali.
U Paasha is an ideal choice to stay in Seminyak. Located right in the middle of pubs, café and restaurants. Conveniently accessible. Waliking distance to The Flea Market, Seminyak Square, the beach and many more branded shops / boutique outlet surrounded.
We love the 24 check-in policy. We will be back again with a larger group in 2015.",U Paasha Seminyak
2203,Dirty,20,June 2014,Stayed for 3 nights with my boyfriend. We were checked into a room that had clearly not been cleaned. The floor was dirty giving us filthy feet after walking around. Our sheets were stained and we were bitten a lot on our first night. I complained and special attention was given to cleaning our room after this however it should not have been an issue in the first place. The staff are quite unfriendly and breakfast was so average and not worth getting up for. Luckily this was our last stop in Bali and they arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport without charge due to the issues we experienced. Although this was appreciated the hotel seems like a 3 star and needs a lot of improvement.,U Paasha Seminyak
2204,Modern Convenience & Value in Seminyak,40,May 2014,"For the price and location, U Paasha is hard to beat. We stayed for five nights and loved it. You're in the heart of the Seminyak action and walking distance to everything. Note: this hotel is not on the beach. For the price, the hotel provides an excellent level of luxury and service. The breakfast buffet is tops (and know that you can have breakfast served anytime, anywhere). The poolside drinks are delicious. The bed is seriously the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. The in-suite details like customizable radio stations and toiletries are the cherry on top touches.

The only place the hotel fell a little short for us was at the pool: the vibe could be vamped up a little bit with some music, we could never find clean towels and the poolside service was average at best. We found ourselves having to constantly flag down servers for refills or food.

Other than that, it was a fantastic stay and a real treat after backpacking for five months.

2205,Best location,40,June 2014,"Perfect location - right in the middle of the Main Street surrounded by restaurants, pubs and shops. Walking distance to everything.
Standard room was beautiful and spacious. Weird smell would creep in now and again, but have had this everywhere in Bali (water systems overused etc). The pool is amazing. Included breakfast was faultless. Staff friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed the stay and would come back!
Wifi is not very good. Constantly cuts out, often slow and have to log in each time your phone locks or leave the area. Only downfall.",U Paasha Seminyak
2206,Excellent choice in convenient location,40,June 2014,"This hotel is one of the newest on the Oberoi strip. The location is superb, right in the middle of the all the trendy restaurants, cafes & shops in Seminyak. I highly recommend staying at U Paasha.. we stayed for 4 nights in early June and were really happy with the large guest room and really large bathroom. It is quiet in the hotel & there is a fantastic roof top infinity pool here with adjoining bar. Cocktail service by the pool is superb. Perfect for couples. Breakfast is great and highly recommend Chandi restaurant directly across the road. They offer complimentary pick up from the airport if you book with the hotel directly. Highly recommend! We will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2207,Great location in Seminyak,30,May 2014,"This hotel was the scond on our Bali visit, but unfortunately it didn't meet up with our expectations.

When booking this hotel, we were impressed by choosing the kind of pillows, soap smell etc. But during check-in we were very disappointed. The lobby is large and spacious but the staff at check-in was very slowly. There was nobody ahead of us waiting to check-in or out but it took over 10 minutes for one staff memeber to even notice us.

So finally after a very long wait in the lobby, we arrived in our room and were impressed by the size. The rooms are very large and ensure enough space. Also the large amount of pillows were a great feature. The only thing we didn't like about the room was the shower. The shower is from white stone which turned yellow and looks disturbing. I believe the hotel also had issues with their pipes since every now and then a very weird smell like Kimchi approached the sleeping area coming from the bathroom. We called room service and they tried to fix it but didn't really solve the problem.

Anyways we also checked out their pool area. Another disappointment occured when the pool didn't have any towels. They said they were out of towels and we had to use our room towels. We were shocked by this. Never experienced a hotel running low on towels. Furthermore we didn't get new towels the next day. We again had to call room service to take the old towels and bring us new ones. Why does this hotel doesn't change towels daily? The whole situation was very strange. At least they brought us new ones after asking.

The pool is also dark by night. I think pools should be open by night, since many people like to take a night swim.

Now to the PROS of this hotel:

The location is perfect. So close to the best restaurants in Bali. We could walk from one to the next one and enjoyed Balis best cuisine.

Also the breakfast at this hotel is far better than many 5 Star resorts. Their variety of food is medium small but what they have is very tasty and good. They also have great juices which made us very happy every morning. The only negative was, when you decided to take room service instead of the buffet you only had a much smaller variety of food to choose from. But at least they offer this for people sleeping long like us. Very good breakfast.

Overall our stay was okay. We expected much more but maybe our expectations were just set to high. Staff was always friendly but sometimes also a little lazy. At least they smiled when they saw us which made it somehow okay even though they lacked in service training.

One last remark: The hotel only has two elevators and we had the feeling staff member take the elevators all the time making the waiting time infront or inside the elevators endless. I think a hotel with only 5 floors shouldn't allow staff to use elevators unless carrying large and heavy goods. Sometimes we spotted staff only driving up and down since the lobby and aisles didn't have any aircondition and the elevators did.",U Paasha Seminyak
2208,Excellent location great value,50,June 2014,"Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, all in all this hotel is excellent value for money. The guest rooms are a very good size for this type of hotel, the location is very good with restaurants and bars very close. The beach is a bit of a stroll, but the hotel has a nice rooftop pool. The only slight negative is some breakfast items could be hotter. Would stay here again and also recommend this hotel to friend and family.",U Paasha Seminyak
2209,Brilliant stay,50,May 2014,"This hotel is well worth the money you pay and I would go back again and again. The location itself is fantastic it's right in the heart of Seminyak where there are plenty of great shops, bars and restaurants. Five minute walk to the beach and Ku de at.

The roof top is a highlight to this hotel, amazing to drink cocktails and watch the sun go down. The staff in the hotel are so friendly and go out of their way to help and serve you, they were also very helpful when wanting to boom trips and taxis.

The breakfast is more than enough and up to standard, fresh eggs made to order and freshly made pancakes is always a good way to start your day:) I could not fault this hotel I don't no why there are reviews of bad smelling water we did not have this problem in our room and thought the room itself was lovely and had everything you needed.

We will be coming back to this one, a must whiles staying at seminyak, I would advise that you do not get the transfer from the airport that the hotel offer you can get a taxi for a third of the price when you arrive.",U Paasha Seminyak
2210,Very nice comfortable room and Breakfast,40,May 2014,"Room is large and clean, the bed is very comfortable. Great location for walking to shops and restaurants. Lovely breakfast each morning. The staff are friendly and helpful.
The only small problem we had was we were on the ground floor in room 108 and the noise from the car park in the early hours travelled up and was noisy, so I told reception at 1.30 in the morning and within 15 minutes it settled down.
Overall great hotel for the price and I would stay here again, but I would ask for a room on the higher levels.",U Paasha Seminyak
2211,Excellent location in Seminyak,50,May 2014,My husband and I stayed at U Paasha for 7 nights at the end of May and loved the experience. The location of the hotel is brilliant if you want to just walk to the shops and go for a nice meal. Beach is only 5-10 minutes walk away. The rooftop pool was very nice and the view was amazing. Rooms were much bigger than we had expected and the decor was nice and modern. For breakfast you could have pretty much everything you could wish for. Overall we were super happy with the hotel and would recommend it for anyone who wants a great location for a great price.,U Paasha Seminyak
2212,Every bit as good as we hoped,50,May 2014,"This is a super hotel. The staff are brilliant: always friendly and helpful. Roof top pool is pretty massive and the views across Seminyak must be the best as it's one of the highest hotels around. There aren't very many sun beds but we managed to get a pair most days.
Breakfast is excellent and offers a fairly wide selection to satisfy varied and international tastes.
Huge, comfy bed in a large room.
Hotel location is ideal, smack in the middle of many good restaurants and shops.",U Paasha Seminyak
2213,5 Star - Premium value for money!,50,May 2014,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in Seminyak.
Great service, great location, great accommodation, this is premium value for money!
The rooftop pool with the panoramic 360° view is just amazing, would without a doubt rebook this hotel if back in Seminyak!
Don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed",U Paasha Seminyak
2214,ok,40,March 2014,"Was very quiet. in late march. Design was industrialist which I liked. Nice pool on the roof with a view.
Aircon a bit noisy, Wifi a bit slow but generally good value.
They had a few bikes in the basement you could borrow, which was nice",U Paasha Seminyak
2215,It looks good ..but,30,May 2014,"I found U Paasha a mix of fantastic and flawed.
Yes it is an impressive entry and building in many ways- especially after observing exactly how they build in Bali, and the roof top area is fabulous and gets you up and away from the hustle and bustle. Beds are soft and rooms spacious, but our room had an extremely noisy air conditioning unit that we were told is normal (maybe at U Paasha but nowhere else I've stayed). It was so noisy we couldn't sleep with it on so turned it off only to be woken by an absolutely putrid smell- the drains and the water need some serious revision here! On a number of times the toilets (occurred in the roof top area too) gurgled and bubbled releasing a scary stench and left me wondering if they were going to over flow.
All in all U Paasha was ok- staff were generally very friendly and helpful (until you talk to them about air con and smells), and the breakfast was great.
But ultimately I wouldn't spend the money we did to stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2216,Big room & centrally located!,50,April 2014,"Centrally located in the heart of Seminyak, stone throw to restaurants and shops! Rooms are huge, bright and clean. Staffs are all very smileys and positive. We especially love the 24-hour check-in policy! Will be back again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2217,U pasha...perfect for a girlie getaway,40,June 2013,"Stayed at the u paasha about a year ago..it was a few months into its opening so managed to get a fantastic deal.
Lovely hotel...minimalist decor but huuuuuuge rooms...very comfortable furnishings and soft soft bed.
Only thing is they were setting up the wifi at that time so connectivity only in rooms closest to the front of the hotel...do check ahead if you need to remain connected.
no issues with traffic noise for me as the rooms were large with stone walls.
Loved the 24 hour stay rule...so I could have a late checkout with no hiccups since I arrived at 9pm for my check in.
Very handy if you shop til the very last minute and still want to freshen up before your flight.
Directly located on eat street so very very convienient for all the hot spots like ultimo, Kaizan etc.
The staff were still newish so while not slick, they were friendly and eager to help...major plus there!
Breakfast was ok...but I may have been spoiled by the other places I stayed at but fair value.
If they are still having promo rates would highly recommend this place.",U Paasha Seminyak
2218,Location Location Location !,50,May 2014,"If, like us, you go to Bali to relax stay somewhere nice and eat well, this is the hotel for you.
Located right in the centre of ""Eat Street"" ( and I mean down the front steps and you are there) it is a short stroll to every great eatery in Seminyak and by definition the best eateries in Bali. This hotel is less than a year old and although it advertises the rooms as all suites.....let's just say there are suites and there are suites.
They do offer 2 day beds but there isn't a lot of separation between the main kingsized bed and the others.
That said, it has lovely presentation with its polished concrete and timber look with raw stone, and plenty of glass features. The foyer is breath taking rising 4 floors with a multitude of different textures and lighting. I asked if we could have an iPod dock in our room prior to arrival and found not only had they provided this but also they had placed an iPod filled with chillout music in the dock for us.The buffet breakfast is extensive and varies and has the ability to be available for 23 hours of the day.....yes 23 hour a day breakfast!I never put it to the test so I don't know if there is a charge after 11am but a cool idea if your body clock is out of whack. They also have a unique check out situation whereby you can check out the same time you checked in, meaning if you arrive at 10pm on the first day the room is yours until the same time on your day of departure.
The rooftop pool is beautiful, no swim up bar but plenty of staff to get you whatever you want.
My wife's only complaint was the lack of a bath in our room (we do a lot of walking), maybe they have them in some rooms, might be worth asking. They are very good communicators, all my correspondence was with Mr Harry Nurbito and he was excellent.
I had read that the nightclub downstairs was a bit noisy for older guests and asked for a room at the rear and higher up and never heard a sound.......except for those people that walk out of their rooms and lets their doors slam like bombs.....you get them in any and every hotel though. All in all a delightful place to stay, with the ease of location being an even bigger plus.",U Paasha Seminyak
2219,Great Hotel & Location!,40,May 2014,"Stayed here for a couple of days in may 2014.. Checkin was simple, you can chose your own fragrance for soap... the rooms are very spacious and clean, with all modern amenities... the rooftop pool is huge... the breakfast spread was excellent... and the best part is they change their menu everyday ... the staff was polite and courteous ... the Location is excellent... in middle of Seminyaks happening street.. plenty of food and shopping options.
Over all, we enjoyed our stay at U Paasha and would stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2220,"Nice hotel, service not amazing",30,May 2014,"I am torn about this hotel. Somethings are really great like the room space (a standard room is huge), the 24 hr check in policy, it's boutique feel (not overcrowded with millions of rooms) and the location (right in middle of eat street) and of course this huge rooftop pool. And just when you are convinced this is a great find and secret gem, the flaws show through.
The bad - the pool service (and service in general). The pool itself is large, on the rooftop and decent amount of deck chairs. But there are no towels. I went up at 10am, no towels. I went back at midday, still no towels. I went back up at 3pm...still no towels. And each time I was told ""one more hr"". This happened on 3 consecutive days. And it is NOT peak period, the occupancy (based on breakfast and general observation) was low,...I would say not even half full. How can there be no pool towels!!! And then I was told to just bring my room towel up, and I stupidly did. When I went back to my room to take a shower my room had still not been made up (this was now 3pm) and I had no clean towel. So I called up for a clean one, explaining that I had been told to use my room towel as a pool towel. I was met with a rather rude response and grunt and they said they would send one up. I waited an hour! I called again and all I got was yes yes yes, and no towel. I finally gave up and found the cleaning room (which was unlocked) and grabbed a towel (I hoped it was clean). I should not have to do this. And I shouldn't be plicated and promised when they were not going to deliver. This may sound like I am overacting and ranting, but something like this really makes a difference. Bali is a place where (some/most) people come to relax and hang by the pool. You need to have towels! The hotel is well staffed, but the staff are just not very good. Another point - the pool bar service. There were at least 7 - 8 staff at any one point (basically there to help out 20 customers) and they just kept getting things wrong. Forgetting orders, over charging, forgetting about happy hour pricing (and then laughing it off) and just not very helpful. This is very surprisingly for a 4 start hotel in Bali. Other bad points, really noisy air con and sometimes a bad sewage smell in the lobby.
I am reminded of the old saying - you get what you pay for. We thought we had nabbed a bargain of a 4 star hotel, great location for $130 AUD a night (taxes inc)..... I can now see why. It's a pity because for all it's good, U Paasha has the makings of an amazing boutique hotel, but it really falls short. This is now our 6th visit in Bali and we have stayed in 10 hotels/villas in various degrees of pricing and comfort. There are many choices in Seminyak, to stand out you really have to give good service. I won't say this is a bad hotel, but I won't be quick to recommend it either.",U Paasha Seminyak
2221,"Great rooms, very good location but service not great",40,May 2014,"The rooms are spacious, fantastic location right in the middle of Seminyak's hustle and bustle with fantastic views from the pool and an excellent rooftop bar. The deco is gorgeous, very clean and excellent bathroom facilities. We were three in a room and definitely did not feel cramped at all. We stayed on the ground floor i.e. where reception was and unfortunately was woken up by banging at about 3am and when we complained the following day at 6pm (out diving) they did not entertain our complaints with any seriousness and kept insisting we should have made our displeasure known at 3am rather than, more reasonably, the next day. This was the only real beef we have with the place, had an excellent time overall but for this unpleasant with the unhelpful and ungracious customer relations officers.",U Paasha Seminyak
2222,Great location and rooftop pool,40,May 2014,"Located in the middle of everything shops, restaurants and the beach minutes away. I recommend their roof top BBQ, very good value and amazing food. There is also a roof top happy hour until 9pm.

I didn't have any problems getting a sun bed but did go up in the mornings. Breakfast was also good with the additional option to have it in your room as well. The waffles with the main breakfast are great.

There is no real balcony, no chairs to sit on so you're better off going up to the roof. The rooms do look a little tired but there's a lot of space when compared to European city hotels.",U Paasha Seminyak
2223,"Spacious, Luxurious bed, Amazing rooftop, Great breakfast",50,March 2014,"A great place to retreat away from the busy streets of Seminyak. Centrally located on a main shopping street with plenty of food options nearby.
The room was extremely spacious and beautiful designed in a modern style. The bed was so comfy - i love the fact that you were able to choose what type of pillow you wanted. You can also select what type of tea and soap you would like! Nice personal touch!
The bathroom was also massive with a double shower and sinks.
Fantastic staff, very kind and efficient.
The best thing is probably the amazing rooftop swimmingpool and bar with incredible 360 views accross the neighbourhood. Really beautiful to watch the sunset and have 2-4-1 cocktails !!
The breakfast was very good with a large selection on offer - all in all a very good value top quality hotel that I wish I had had more then 1 night at !",U Paasha Seminyak
2224,Always Honest,40,May 2014,"When you first arrive at the U Paasha your first impression will be of a modern spacious hotel where the theme continues through out. All central hallways are at least 4mtrs wide, bedrooms are 50m2,standard room and complete with modern furniture, quality king beds, large bathroom and shower. The balcony is long and narrow, only ideal for that yearning smoker.
The roof top pool has panoramic views of all that is around Seminyak. Light lunches are excellent and not over priced and with happy hour 4pm to 9pm and all 2 for 1 makes for a very relaxing afternoon by the pool.
The rooftop BBQ with panoramic views at night, is small with limited selection of quality food. Breakfast has a good variety and most internationals catered for.
U Paasha is in the centre of Seminyak and on the best street in Seminyak with restaurants galore to choose from. A short stroll will take you to all the beachfront hotels and trendy restaurants. Plenty of small boutique shops and grocery stores with ATMs available.
Getting to Kuta and Legian is only a $2.50 to $5 taxi ride depending on the time of day.
The U Paasha has only been open for 1 year and Yes it has teething problems that many of the other reviewers have noted and have valid points, which the management know about and are attending to with earnest.
The staff at U Paasha are all happy and nothing you request is a problem for them.

Would I come back here again, ABSOLUTLEY! on our next trip to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2225,"Yeap, pay for a day, stay 24 hours",50,May 2014,"I have stayed in the hotel twice and will likely come again due to its unique feature:24-hour check in-check out policy. Rooms and corridors are spacious, rooftop pool magnificent. Just one drawback: AC is a bit too noisy even for low blower. Others: location, amenities are just as great.",U Paasha Seminyak
2226,Good Hotel,40,April 2014,"Found hotel to be clean and comfortable. Rooms are very large, with big bathroom.
Breakfast was good with lots of choice.
Just a few negatives
By 11.00 am pool had run out of towels on both days and we had to go back to our room to get the towels we had already used. Towels at pool area were replaced at 4.00pm and we were told to come back to get dry towels to take to our room.
We also booked a massage, thinking the hotel had a day spa. It turned out the girls came to our room and the massage for myself and my husband was done on the bed. Not very good for either us or the girls and not to miss the fact that we had paid Day Spa prices.
Other than that it is central for restaurants, shopping and transport.
the 24 hour stay is good as you book out at the time you booked in avoiding loosing a day.",U Paasha Seminyak
2227,Great stay,50,April 2014,"My first time in Bali, my partner's been many times so he chose Seminyak as our staring point, quieter than Kuta but still near the beach for sunsets, bars and sunbathing with plenty of shopping opportunities. Great hotel, we had a ground floor room, nice and clean, lovely walk in shower and decent products, plenty of space, lovely big bed, really good choice for breakfast: local fruits, European and Asian options, free yoga class one morning by the rooftop pool. Lovely service throughout. We highly recommend the poolside cocktails and snacks as the sunsets are beautiful.",U Paasha Seminyak
2228,Wonderful trip,50,May 2014,"As a lone traveler, and my second time to Bali, u Paasha was an excellent choice, it's a fabulous resort to relax within the hear if Seminyak. It is a modern hot and completely safe environment. Staff and facilities excellent, location brilliant. I will be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2229,Great rooftop pool,40,April 2014,"As two couples on a three week long trip, the purpose of our stay at Upaasha Seminyak was mainly to relax and get some sun and we definitely did that taking full advantage of the Upaasha rooftop pool. We had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay at Upaasha and although the hotel is clearly working out some kinks having opened relatively recently we still had a great time.

The rooms are big with a bit of an industrial feel. The bed was really comfortable and the room was always the right temperature. The bathrooms are a bit funny because it is open concept so there is just a shower stall and a bathroom stall that are both enclosed with shaded glass. Although it would have been nice to have a bit more of a traditional bathroom this wasn't bothersome at all.

We really enjoyed the pool although as other reviewers have stated there are a limited number of deck chairs at the pool which always fill up so you it can be difficult to get a chair. We would generally go up right after breakfast or later in the afternoon and only really had trouble getting chairs if we went to the pool around midday. We also met some people from another hotel who had just walked into the hotel after seeing the sign for rooftop pool and helped themselves to some deck chairs so this might explain part of the problem Upaasha is having with there not being enough deck chairs for guests. I am not sure if Upaasha has a policy about non-guests using the pool but since the hotel is quite new this might be something they will be working on to ensure there are enough lounge chairs.

There was also a huge selection at breakfast which was great. The room service was also fairly reasonably priced although I ordered a ""gluten free"" pasta which had clearly been mixed in with non-gluten free pasta making it inedible for someone like me who can't eat gluten for medical reasons. This was frustrating although not shocking since it is Bali after all.

We did have some hiccups with out stay at Upaasha. Primarily I don't think Upaasha has quite figured out how to make it's 24 hour check-in system work yet. When we arrived we were told that our rooms would not be ready for 2-3 hours and then when we came back hours later only one room was ready and our friends were told that the hotel was oversold so for their first night they would be ""upgraded"" to the penthouse. The penthouse was larger than the normal rooms but was also right above the hotel bar/nightclub which blasted music until the wee hours and the room also had barely any lights in it so it really was more of a downgrade. Our friends did get a permanent room the next day.

We also had the $15 BBQ while at Upaasha and it was just okay. Given how extensive the breakfast is we had high hopes for the BBQ but it wasn't much to write home about. One of our group had quite a bit of the green salad from the BBQ and was quite sick the next day. We can't be sure the salad made her sick but I wouldn't be surprised for the vegetables were washed in the local water and not purified water.

The hotel was also quite a bit farther away from the beach than we had though it was. This is not the hotel's fault at all but something that would be nice would be if Upaasha had a shuttle to the beach just to make the trip a bit easier.

We were also a bit surprised at the end cost of our hotel given that the 21% hotel tax was not factored into the advertised price. I enjoyed the hotel but it ended up costing more than I had initially expected.",U Paasha Seminyak
2230,Great Family Accommodation,40,April 2014,"My family had a lovely week at U Paasha. Staff and service were wonderful. Breakfast was delicious. Kids (& husband) especially enjoyed the danishes. Rooms were lovely and spacious. Yes, there was a smell coming from the drain in the bathroom/s at certain times of the day but it's Bali and smells are something you just have to learn to live with. You could nickpick about the light also not turning off in the wardrobe... but honestly, for the price and the excellent location, and wonderful friendly staff, I found it easier to let it go and venture up to the rooftop pool and enjoy.",U Paasha Seminyak
2231,"Pay 24 hours, stay 24 hours",40,April 2014,"U Paasha is in the main street of Seminyak surrounded by restaurants and shops and is central to pretty well everything, and a ten minute walk to the beach. One of the best features of the hotel is that you pay for 24 hours for your room and receive 24 hours. Because we arrived just after midnight on the first night it meant that we were able to stay in our room until midnight on the day of departure, which was especially good for us as our flight did not depart until after midnight. On arrival we were booked into room 124 on the ground floor, and noticed an unpleasant smell when we first went into the room. Because we were tired from travelling we did not say anything until the next day. When we did speak to staff at reception we were moved without question to a room on the 5th floor which had great views. Unfortunately the room we were moved to had twin beds but this was better than putting up with the smell. Also the first room had a problem with the kettle not working but maintenance staff fixed that straight away. The Happy Hour 2 for one drinks offer was great. Rooftop pool was great, but not enough lounges for guests.",U Paasha Seminyak
2232,good location poor service,30,April 2014,"Good but not worth the price.
If ure the type who used to splurge in branded 5 stars hotel, then u will realize that this hotel fall short in the quality they promise to deliver. Among all the hotel of the same level I stayed, this is at best 3 star standard. We check in at 9pm and room wasn't ready. When we went back to the hotel to request for our room key, the front desk didn't do a good handover job after she left for the day. We gotta go thru another 15mins to get the room key. We requested our choice of toiletries, there's 4 scent options, ended up with 3 different scent of soap, lotion, shower gel n shampoo in a set. In ALL of our 5 rooms booked! Facilities of hotel are not explained during check in. No one highlight to us on the iPod with music preference as on the internet. First look, Room feels good and spacious. But when u look in details, view was of construction sites for most rooms in hotel. Toilet dirty with grime, toilet door can see thru while the other person using vanity. A few other hiccups during our stay like elevator is slow, lack of sunchair in pool area, internet unstable.... etc. Upon departure, while we were waiting for our driver, we requested to have our welcome drinks in the lobby, literally few steps away from the restaurant. But the frontdesk doesn't allow it. Strictly ask us to go to the bar at B1. As a group of 10 with luggage, we find it too troublesome to deposit all our bags at the concierge, spend time filling up the luggage deposit card and etc. We gave up having the welcome drink even tho the lobby was very hot. The staff definitely didn't go thru the extra mile in ALL aspect of services. And yes, some rooms do stinks. Tho I requested non smelly rooms. The road in front always jam and take hours to even go to Kuta. For this price, I wouldn't return. Definitely no where near 4 star.",U Paasha Seminyak
2233,Pretty Average for Bali,20,December 2013,"Hate writing a bad review but this place was all great on checkin and appearance but unfortunately its the service that lets it down. A group of us checked in for new Years Eve and many left Bali saying never again would they do a New Years in Bali. Yes there was rain and yes there was crazy traffic but overall the team at this hotel didn't seem to be connected in making a great experience for guests.

Rooms look great but we had a number of occasions where a bad smell emanating from the bathroom.
Breakfast was below average so we ate every day after the first day - there many other great options in Bali.
What was the clincher was the promise of new years Drinks and celebrations on the eve of New Year - staff were clueless and couldn't accommodate.
Organised a friends birthday on site and most got sick straight after - staff didn't seem to keen to discuss.

Pool area is great and it worth just going for a drink and admiring the view - especially when theres a fireworks display at night.

Its hard work trying to sell luxury in an island that has luxury on offer for everyones budget - this hotel was average. We moved on to a villa after this and that was incredible and advise you seek villa accommodation in this area.",U Paasha Seminyak
2234,Great Location - Great Beds!,40,April 2014,"Lovely hotel with fantastic check in/checkout service - if you arrive at 9.30 am - you check out at 9.30 am. The rooms are spacious, the hotel is quite new and opposite some great restaurants such as Chandi and Ultimo and within walking distance to Ku de Tah and La Lucciola. The bathrooms are open plan - so not a lot of privacy - good for couples but probably not so good if you are just ""sharing with friends"". The beds are super comfy and soft. Breakfast is more than adequate - not a huge selection, but what they do have is tasty and made fresh. The service around the pool is a bit ""hit and miss"" - the first day we got offered cold face towels, iced water and fruit kebabs - from them on it was only fruit kebabs. One day there was no ice available until after 12 noon - and over the Easter period if was very busy and they did not increase their staff at the pool so people where getting frustrated with wait times for service. Also it was quite frustrating as most days they ran out pool towels by 9.30 am and of course also there was a shortage of sun beds. It's also very frustrating that people would obviously go and claim a ""chair"" by placing their book on it and not return for hours - therefore limiting others from utilising a sun lounge and having to sit or suntan on the decking. I read a number of reviews from guests complaining of the smell of sewerage from the water in the hotel rooms - I did have a faint whiff of something one day - but that was all. The cleaner also broke the coffee perculator and failed to replace it with a new one - I asked for two days in a row and it never got replaced - placing another cup under the drip filter did not solve the problem. Also the towel linen in the bathroom some days looked quite old and worn with a ""grey"" tinge to it - the pool towels looked brighter and newer. For those that are wanting western comfort and close to all the restaurants and shops - great hotel, would definitely consider staying there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2235,"Excellent Location, reasonable price, flexible check out.",50,April 2014,"The biggest draw for me is the flexibility of checking out 24 hours after you check in. This gives you flexibility when booking your flight, and doesn't leave you stranded after check out if you have an evening or night flight.

U Paasha's location is excellent, and only a short walk to lots of great cafes and restaurants. While their breakfast buffet is pretty substantial, you might just have to give that up for breakfast and coffee at Revolver Espresso, which is only a 2 minute walk from U Paasha. I had the best breakfast and coffee in Bali here. Just opposite the hotel, is Chandi, a nice restaurant which makes a great dinner option. I've tried many dishes here and they are all good, especially the Duck Betutu.

On the topic of food, I ordered Oxtail soup from Room service, and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. Service was also prompt.

For USD105 a night inclusive of airport transfer, it's more than reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel if you're planning a short trip to Bali and want to be right smack in the middle of all that seminyak action.

The only downside to the hotel - 1) There was a bad sewage smell one afternoon but when I came back to my room in the evening, it was gone. So not really an issue
2) The balcony faces a few villas which unfortunately housed the noisest group who were screaming late into the night and early in the morning. I could hear them even with the balcony glass door closed and curtains drawn. But again, this is nothing some earplugs can't solve and also no fault of the hotel.

This is definitely where I'll be staying during my visits back to Bali!",U Paasha Seminyak
2236,Should be the #1 hotel in Seminyak!,50,April 2014,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay.

The service was impeccable - we initially had to wait for 2 hours for our room to be available, but eventually they bumped us up to a penthouse suite. Every staff member was welcoming and smiley - even the guy standing under the hot sun by the entrance flagging in taxis would cheerfully greet us each day.

We left a Samsung phone by the poolside, and before we even noticed it was gone, a staff member brought it down to our room and refused to even take a tip. What amazing service attitudes!

The rooftop bar and pool has a truly magical ambience as well, with day beds and couches to relax. Happy Hour has 1-for-1 on all drinks - we enjoyed some amazing and creative fruit smoothie creations while watching the sunset.

Its location is also ideal, surrounded by great restaurants and shopping.

Highly recommended!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
2237,"Nice hotel, awful smell!",30,April 2014,"After reading all the great reviews, I decided to go ahead and book U Paasha. First thoughts were that the location was excellent, very central and a stones throw from a range of great restaurants in Seminyak. Staff were quite friendly and happy to help out. The food at breakfast was ok, nothing special, however I did have a panini for lunch at the rooftop bar one day and that was very good, as was their range of delicious cocktails! Dragon mojitos were great on a hot afternoon. More Sun loungers are definitely needed by the pool, there is plenty of room there. The thing that let it down for me most of all was the overpowering smell of sewerage(not sure exactly what it was but it was not pleasant!) in our room, which seemed to constantly emanate from the bathroom. Our room was on the first floor, not sure if this was why it was so bad. I noticed that previous travellers have also commented on this so I did not bother making a fuss about it as we were only there for 4 nights anyway. I'm pretty sure it is the same throughout the entire hotel, which is a shame. Also the aircon in the room was very very noisy. My partner found it hard to sleep but luckily had ear plugs.

Overall I don't think I will return to U Paasha again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2238,Towels out early!,40,April 2014,"U Paasha ticks all the boxes; location right on Eat Street, value for money, uber cool design, modern, great breakfast, friendly honest staff. Only cause of complaint was the lack of enough sunbeds. Only solution was to follow everyone else and put towels out first thing in the morning! C'mon management. ..provide some more beds there's plenty of room. 5 stars if not for this irritating aspect.",U Paasha Seminyak
2239,Second stay.. Very noisey!,40,April 2014,"This was our second stay at u paasha. We rebooked after having a good experience last year, although this time did notice a big difference in the presentation of it. The roof top pool is great and what sold it for us, but this time we noticed it needs some maintenance. Also there were never any pool towels up there. I would recommend giving rooms two shower towels and two pool towels.
The killer for us this time was the noise!! We got upgraded to the penthouse as they had no king rooms left. Room itself was great and huge, but the sound of the air con is unbelievable! Last year we had slept with ear plugs in (and obviously forgot about it this time) but even worse was the noise from the street.. But especially the bar on the ground floor of the hotel. It wasn't just doof doof sounds, I lay there and clearly heard the songs playing and scooters tooting as they go past. Last night we rang reception and they told us the music would stop at 1am!! We ended up turning the air con on just so it covered the sound from the music. Pretty bad when it's music from the actual hotel. My husband was awake at 5.30 today and couldn't go back to sleep for the noise. Sound proof windows and quiet air con would make a huge difference.
The staff are very friendly, but we won't be staying there a third time.",U Paasha Seminyak
2240,Great Hotel to Discover Seminyak,50,April 2014,"U Paasha is a Superb Hotel with a unique 24hr check-in/check-out. There location is wonderful. The rooms, service, food and pool all are execellent. Its a great place with the best of seminyak all walking. We simply loved everything about the Hotel. Highly recommended in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2241,Perfect!,50,April 2014,"Loved U Paasha! Was in the perfect location in the middle of everything! We had a room on the top floor with ocean view which was what I asked for and exactly what we got, was so quiet! Didn't even know you were on the main street! Staff were very happy, friendly and willing to help! Pool was amazing and the buffet breakfast was the best thing ever!!!!",U Paasha Seminyak
2242,Awesome cocktails,50,April 2014,"My sister and daughter had a fantastic few nights here, enjoying cocktails and dinner. The cocktails are the best we had in Pettinget . The building is beautiful, a d.j playing most nights, and great value happy hour $5 cocktails. The staff are all fantastic, Thankyou and see you again soon,",U Paasha Seminyak
2243,Great for you who'd experience Seminyak,40,April 2014,"U Paasha Seminyak is located in the heart of Seminyak, which is great for you who would visit several cool places around seminyak. The Rooftop swimming pool is pretty average, however you could see 360degree of seminyak area. The breakfast is okay, the room is huge and very cool design and the bathroom is very big. If you are looking for a hotel to spend the day with, i would not recommend upaasha because it has limited space to move, but if you want to experience seminyak area then go for it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2244,Good location on main Seminyak Road. Lovely rooftop pool and bar!,40,April 2014,"We stayed here during our visit to Bali. The hotel is well-located on the main Seminyak strip. The rooms are spacious and clean. The only negative for some might be the Perspex partitions in the bathroom - but we weren't bothered by this. The only other downside is the noisy and difficult to operate air con.

The hotel has a lovely, peaceful rooftop pool. Staff are friendly and attentive - often bringing round fruit skewers and water refreshments throughout the day.
We had cocktails most evenings - recommend the Dragon Mojitos in particular!

Breakfast was plentiful and varied. The BBQ evenings on the rooftop were nice, if a little over-priced.

Overall, a nice hotel that I would certainly stay at again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2245,Fantastic hotel,50,April 2014,"We stayed at U Paasha for 8 nights ,and we would certainly return.From the moment we checked in to leaving the hotel it was excellent .The staff were amazing ,nothing was a problem for them,we were always greeted with a smile . Breakfast was excellent lots of choice and variety ,couldn't fault,they offered all day breakfast ,from 7am until 11 pm.The hotels rooms were a great size ,plenty of room for the 3 of us.Bathrooms were good ,sometime got a little bit of a smell from the drains ,which is normal in these kind of undeveloped country's .The hotel it self was nicely done ,just needed a few finishing touches.The location of the hotel was excellent very central ,with excellent restaurants on the door step.The only disappointing thing I could say is that the food at the roof top bar was expensive and wasn't that good. All in all we had a excellent time.Thank you !",U Paasha Seminyak
2246,Excellent value in the heart of Seminyak,50,April 2014,"I stayed at the U Paasha for two nights just after my arrival in Bali. I was looking for something central and of high quality but still affordable. The U Paasha ticked all these boxes. The hotel's style is quite modern and sometimes unusual, a little bit like W Hotels but a price segment below.

Pros:
- Central location of Seminyak close to many bars and restaurants
- Contemporary style
- Large, air-conditioned rooms including big waterfall shower, iPod dock and lounge area
- Great serviced roof-top pool with views over Seminyak all the way to beach
- Roof-top bar with lounge area
- Friendly staff

Cons:
- Minor maintenance and upkeeping issues in my case (batteries of in-room remote and safe were dead).
- Breakfast not a must-have.
- Perhaps not entirely at the level of a four-star hotel in Europe or the Middle East, but certainly at a high level for Bali.

If you are looking for something typically Balinese and/or romantic, this is not the place to go, but then again you will probably have to look for that outside of Seminyak anyway.",U Paasha Seminyak
2247,Average stay and wouldn't go back,20,January 2014,The air conditioning was so loud we couldn't sleep with it on. The included breakfast was really average and unappealing- we ate elsewhere. The bathroom drain in our accommodation was completely blocked and you couldn't shower for more than a minute until the area flooded. There were numerous other issues with the hotel and U paasha do offer a competitive price but it just doesn't deliver. The pool was the only good point and even during our stay sometimes the sun lounges were all taken around peak times. I wouldn't recommend this place even for the price.,U Paasha Seminyak
2248,Great location and great breakfast,40,March 2014,"We only stayed 2 nights at U Paasha but will certainly be back. The rooms are a great size, we added an extra bed with no problem or real need for any more space. The beds and pillows are really comfortable and the standard of cleanliness was great. There was the Bali smell you can get in the bathrooms but hardly noticeable.

The hotel itself is modern with a impressive entrance foyer. The rooms are nicely decorated.

The staff were wonderful and always helpful. We enjoyed our breakfast very much, the selection covered options from all over the world.

The hotel is located close to great shopping and restaurants. Over all a really great stay, value for money exceeded expectations.",U Paasha Seminyak
2249,What an absolutely wonderful surprise this hotel turned out to be.,40,April 2014,"What an absolutely wonderful surprise this hotel turned out to be. We had spent 7days in a very high end hotel in Sanur and were a little apprehensive about our hotel change and had only booked to spend a few days experiencing the Seminyak restaurants and shopping. U Paasha is only a year old and very modern, a great location, bang in the middle of the main strip. Restaurants and shops a plenty. Our room on the fifth floor was HUGE as were the shower area and toilet. Beautiful king size comfortable bed, day chaise and cane sofa. Loads of toiletries, a safe, robes and slippers and a TV for those that must, free wifi. Large sliding windows to a small balcony with a view over the villas and gardens below giving a green outlook. Looking out to the ocean and the mountains. We turned the couch around to face outward and watched the sunset from our room, champagne in hand. The breakfast was plentiful and a large choice. The pool a good size and kept very clean by the staff the rooftop bar another great place for sunset. The 24hr check in/out is such a great idea. Check in at 3.00pm check put at 3.00pm etc. and the management were very cooperative to a couple of hours later check out in our case. Surprising what a smile and consideration to the staff can do. The jewel in the crown were the staff. Always smiling, always friendly, helpful and professional. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all who are considering a stay in Seminyak where being beachside is not a top priority. And a great price. My best wishes and compliments to all the management and staff who made our final days in Bali such a joy.",U Paasha Seminyak
2250,Average,30,April 2014,"We arrived at 22.00 silent day eve and were told that all the surrounding restaurants were shut in preparation for the following day so were advised at check in to order food service. We got to our room and called room service but they told us they were closed. So I had to go down stairs to talk with reception and after explaining that we would have to go to sleep without dinner or lunch they agreed to cook us some burgers. The next problem was in the room. The water smelt like sewerage and made me dry retch every time I took a shower. I brought this to staffs attention and they offered to move us to another room, but that room also had the same water problem. After silence day was finished I sat with the hotel manager and explained to him that I could not spend the rest of my booked and paid for four days smelling like sewerage and I would be leaving the following day if the problem was not rectified. He was very empathetic and understanding and promised to find a solution and apologised for the broken water pump which had caused the problem. The manager kept his word and the next morning he had moved us to a much nicer room on the 5th floor with an ocean view and normal smelling water. To be honest the rooms on the 5th floor are the only rooms worth staying in at this hotel. The breakfast is average but room service items are decent.",U Paasha Seminyak
2251,"Go on, treat yourself!",50,February 2014,"This is an epic escape destination!

Great place to selfishly indulge yourself for a week or two of solid kick-back-and-relax.

Plush rooms, well appointed furnishings, thoughtful complimentary toiletries.

Buffet breakfast downstairs at the smart open air restaurant was thrown in with the room and it was fantastic - waffle station, egg station, cooked breakfast, cereals, tropical fruit platters, free flowing coffee etc. Ended up spending the better part of the morning just hanging out here helping myself to multiple courses and reading my book.

Rooftop pool was also a highlight and was an easy place to spend the rest of your day. A cold draught beer was always close at hand thanks to the attentive waiters.

I would happily go back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2252,Awesome stay,50,April 2014,"From the time we stepped foot in the hotel we were made very welcome and the staff were very attentive. I could not fault the service, food or staff in anyway. It is located on main strip near good restaurants and shops etc. Rooftop pool is great with 360 degree views. They also have 24hr check in which means you check out at the same time you check in which we found to be very handy. Lots of options in buffet breakfast. Rooms are very spacious with lovely feel. We would not hesitate to stay at upaasha again and could not recommend it more. We loved it!",U Paasha Seminyak
2253,Terrible,10,April 2014,"Currently staying at this hotel and only on the second day here, feeling absolutely miserable and HOT, aircon has been blasting for hours and it's still so damn hot in this room. Trying to shower, but hot water runs out after 5 mins and it's pretty dirty. Breakfast is not ""24 hours"" they told me it was only until 11pm. Curtains barely block out any sunlight which makes it impossible to sleep in. Organized with the hotel for someone to come pick me up from the airport but no one showed up, the whole process of getting from the airport to the hotel and checking in took 2 hours and by the time we arrived it was too late to goto anywhere to eat or do anything. Not one person who worked there apologized or wanted to compensate me with anything even though they had made these mistakes. First time in bali and honestly feeling miserable because of this hotel. I've read many good reviews so maybe I just got really unlucky, if this hotel didn't cost so much I would just leave and book another hotel right now. It's 8am, hot, bright and I cannot wait for this stay to be over.",U Paasha Seminyak
2254,Great hotel,50,April 2014,"We stayed at Upaasha for one night to go to the beach. Hotel is located right on the main strip where you ca walk to all the shops and restaurants. Service was excellent, rooms lovely and extremely spacious, breakfast offered a wide array of food, and decor is beautiful. Best of all, they have a checkout policy that allows you to check out 24hours from checkin time. So we checked in 8:30pm and stayed through the following day, which allowed us to shower after the beach before heading out. Highly recommend this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2255,AMAZING cocktail bar/restaurant,30,April 2014,"I stayed here with a friend for 5 nights. The room was clean however the water in the shower smelt mouldy. We spoke to the staff who promptly had maintenance fix the issue. Rooftop bar was lovely with gorgeous views over seminyak. Food in hotel we found to be average and not much choice in buffet breakfast so we didn't bother with it most days.

Downstairs in the alibi cocktail bar was a completely different story! Very funky atmosphere, fantastic cocktails & friendly staff. The food was absolutely outstanding!! We ate there twice having pasta both times and couldn't get enough of it! It was some of the best pasta I have ever eaten!",U Paasha Seminyak
2256,Amazing hotel,50,April 2014,"Hotel location is great. Lots of shops, restaurants and bars around, also there is no noise at all im the room.

7 min by walk to the beach.

Has amazing rooftop pool and bar.
Room is big, brand new decorated, confortable and room.

Hotel offers flexibility: check in time is check out time. We arrived at 5.30pm, which means check out time was 5.30pm! Breakfast can be taken any time in the day, anywhere in the hotel.

Wifi works very well.",U Paasha Seminyak
2257,Great place!,50,March 2014,"Loved the check out when you checked in policy, and the 24hrs breakfast policy. The rooftop pool is really nice. I got a fantastic deal and was really happy with my stay. The staff here are SUPER! I just wish the hotel was a little more animated. They have the best pool, but the music and vibe are too quiet. Could maybe use some music, some candles, some fresh flowers and serving drinks poolside! Aside from that, it's perfect!",U Paasha Seminyak
2258,Roof Top Pool & Margarita's.,50,February 2014,"We 5 days with friends at U Paasha in February what a truly wonderful time. The afternoons and evenings in or beside the rooftop pool,having frozen strawberry margarita's or beer, was fantastic as we looked over the area by night. Suksma.",U Paasha Seminyak
2259,Great Locaction,40,March 2014,"Location of the hotel is very good, its on the main Seminyak street... lots of Cafes, Bars, restaurant and shopping around the hotel.

Rooms are very spacious, 24hrs checkin(arrive any time and check out after 24hrs)

Breakfast was good, if you miss the breakfast they serve it in your without any extra cost... this was really great.

Rooftop Bar & pool is a really nice....

The only problem was the BAD smell from the water... This was really annoying.

I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth and the smell in the water was unbearable...

The shower area is spacious but not clean.

Overall a good hotel for the price except the bad smell..",U Paasha Seminyak
2260,Great place in great area!,40,March 2014,"This hotel is amazing. The 24 hours check in is really helpful (you can arrive at any time and check out exactly 24 hours after your time of arrival), room is beautiful and huge, service is great, staffs are friendly and helpful; Seminyak itself is a great area for young people who love to shop and dine. It was a pleasant trip :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2261,Perfect location! Love the roof top pool!,50,March 2014,"We stayed here for our honeymoon after our wedding in Bali. We hadn't organised accommodation after checking out of the villa where we were married. On the day of our check out I did a quick trip advisor search and found U Paasha. We had a driver take us there and made our booking at the front desk. We mentioned we were newly married to the girl on the front desk who arranged rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed. This was a really nice touch.

The hotel is new and the rooms are very spacious. The location is perfect if you want to hang around seminyak. There are plenty of restaurants right outside the hotel. One of our favourites cafe Bali is opposite the hotel.

The roof top pool is peaceful. The pool isn't very deep but that's not a problem for a shorty like me. It annoyed my husband. A little but the water came up to his waist. Happy hour runs from 4pm each day with satays offered as snacks.

Breakfast was good and one of the better buffets I've had in Bali. The eggs are all cooked to order rather than having fried eggs sitting in the warmer for hours. The general manager Gindo was around in the mornings greeting guests at breakfast and inquiring how our stay was.

We stayed for 9 nights and were very happy with our choice of hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2262,Great Hotel in the Heart of Seminyak,50,March 2014,"My partner and I stayed at U Paasha for a week in March, the stay was outstanding. The room was huge and comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful, and the rooftop pool was so, so hard to tear yourself away from. I look forward to my next visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
2263,Best price + quality + location combo in Seminyak!,50,February 2014,"The whole hotel looks brand new, everything is really modern and clean & the outside design of the hotel stands out. Our room was amazing - very big, clean, modern & the bed was so comfortable. Aircon worked well & I didn't find it noisy at all like other people have said. The ocean view from our room was quite nice (request the 5th/top floor). The rooftop pool is beautiful to watch the sunset & have drinks, happy hour from 5-8pm & service for drinks was good. Breakfast was amazing, huge selection. Having a gym was good, but it was very small & needs more weights. The location is very good, right in the middle of Seminyak along a busy street with lots of shops and good restaurants. Seminyak market & most attractions in Seminyak are within walking distance & there's heaps of taxis right outside the front of the hotel. Noise from the street was not an issue - I couldn't hear anything from the room. All the staff were very friendly & the service was always fast. 24 hour check in is very handy. We absolutely loved this hotel!!

Negatives: The water that comes out of the shower is very smelly! When we were checking out they tried to charge us for 7 phone calls made from the room, but we didn't use the phone the entire time. They very quickly took them off the bill though. But overall these were minor things & we still LOVED our stay at U Paasha :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2264,Much better than expected,40,November 2013,"My friends and I stayed 3 nights here in November 2013 and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Pros:
+ Location was perfect - There's a whole row of restaurants right opposite the hotel (such as Ultimo and Rumours) and further down the road you can find Revolver Expresso (opposite the Bali Clinic) which you can enter via ""This is a Love Song"" or ""Home"" store. Revolver Expresso is a good breakfast/ brunch alternative if you tire of the hotel's offerings. It's also really easy to hail a cab from the lobby, and it's a short distance to most places (e.g. about 5 mins to Jiwa Bikram Yoga and Amo Spa - both of which are recommended to try)

+ The room was spacious and well-appointed. I especially liked the double sink and that the shower was separated from the toilet - this made getting ready a lot faster. The beds were also super comfortable.

+ Service was excellent. Staff were friendly and super efficient - we were checked-in and checked-out really quickly and without any fuss, and our request for some room spray to mask the damp smell in our room was met promptly.

Cons:
- There was this damp, sewage-y smell that would hit us whenever we entered the room (from the aircon perhaps?) but that would go away after awhile. I think it helped that the staff had brought us some room spray to counter this.

- Breakfast selection is somewhat limited, but this was fine by us as we were more keen to save our tummies for brunch/ lunch.

Would definitely return and recommend this place to friends.",U Paasha Seminyak
2265,Amazing,50,February 2014,"Great manager Gindo, great staff, great location, great rooms, great rooftop pool, great all day breakfast , great 24 hour check in, great price . Great fun. Great bar at front of hotel, happy hour every night",U Paasha Seminyak
2266,Fantastic,50,January 2014,"My wife and I spent 10 nights here and were very impressed with the staff, location and room size was really good, the breakfast is also very good and the surprise was that if you missed breakfast by 10.30 am you could still order breakfast as room service even at 1 pm and no extra charge, also if you checked in at say 6 pm you can check out at 6pm which is a very nice touch if you have a late flight, the rooftop pool is great with the views, only down side was that if the pool was busy, extra lounge chairs could be supplied, overall the location is on the main eating strip and very handy to just walk to nearby shops, restaurants and Seminyak Square, we would stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2267,"Don't know why all the fuss, but ok for what you pay",20,March 2014,"I will go with these facts first, then you can be the judge as to whether it's worth the stay or not. 1- air conditioner sounds like a jumbo landing, if you consider bed/sleep important than this a whole star off...get it fixed upaasha it's ridiculous how loud it is, 2- the room smells like sewage, 3- the shower is disgustingly mouldy, clean it properly, 4- service at the pool is horrible, slow and never anyone around, 5- pool area needs a vibe, a heart beat, they're playing songs from the elevator and there's young clientele, know your customer, 6- the Buffett breakfast is average, I'd rather pay for my own breakfast somewhere else.
This is a 3 1/2 star at best...if they put effort into it it can easily be a 4 1/2, it's a long way off at the moment.
Best things are price and location",U Paasha Seminyak
2268,wonderful stay,40,August 2013,"a new hotel with unique interior located in main street of seminyak, surrounded by shops, cafe, mart. spacious rooms equipped. nice breakfast with free cafe latte or cappuccino everyday. they serve my omelette exactly the way i requested. Beautiful roof top pool with great views.",U Paasha Seminyak
2269,Fabulosity!!!,50,February 2014,"Love this hotel. Trendy, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable rooms. We were coming from Guili T from valentines week that was super romantic. Stop one night on our way back home, Hong Kong. My partner decided to book this hotel and I loved it! From the welcome drink, to drinks at the pool with romantic sunset background. Super comfortable bed and great location. Breakfast was also very good. Will definitely recommend it and go back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2270,Good value in Seminyak,40,February 2014,"If you want to stay in the Seminyak area, the U Paasha is a very good choice. It is not on the beach like other hotels in Seminyak, but it is located in the main street which makes the location very good if you want to enjoy walking around to the shops and restaurants. A bit too far to walk to the beach, but taxis are easy to get or you can hire a bike or car very cheaply.

There is a nice rooftop pool with a bar, and the service is very good. Worth considering.",U Paasha Seminyak
2271,Perfect Location,40,February 2014,"My first time at U Paasha but definitely not my last.
This hotel is in the perfect location in Seminyak with everything from shopping, restaurants a very short walk away.
The hotel is well set up with a rooftop pool and bar the perfect place to chill out or just escape the Bali crowds after shopping.
With very well appointed large rooms, comfortable beds and everything you need for taking time out, this is a great hotel.
There's a bar / night club in the basement so your not going to feel the effects from the party happening below you. The buffet breakfast was very good served in a nice relaxed atmosphere.
Can highly recommend U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
2272,average hotel service with great location and exterior,30,February 2014,upaasha has excellent room with a good concept of being able to have the complimentary breakfast at the restaurant or in ur room till 11pm. the very fact that you can check out at the same time on the day of your check in is definitely a plus. however the service staff were not as good and did not deliver as promised. nonetheless an overall average stay.,U Paasha Seminyak
2273,Best valentine !,50,February 2014,I stayed in u paasha seminyak for 2 nights and the room is very clean and the most experience i had is celebrating valentine at rooftop restaurant and we don't use the valentine package just for usual dinner and the way the staff treat us just like we're on a valentine package. They gave us flowers and all the service for valentine couples. Will be back soon,U Paasha Seminyak
2274,"Modern, Comfortable, Good Value",40,February 2014,"Rooms are spacious and modern with tiny balcony, air con is good and wifi free, the location is really handy if you like being in the thick of Seminyak shopping and restaurant precinct. The rooftop pooling is stunning and offers great 360 degree views, great photo opportunities and sunsets.

Staff were friendly and efficient and breakfast was very good. This is a really great place a little far from the beach for us though.",U Paasha Seminyak
2275,A Stunning hotel,50,February 2014,This is really a quite stunning hotel where the management and staff perform above and beyond the call of duty. Any trivial problems were rapidly sorted and always with a smile . The roof pool and restaurant are top quality and the girls at reception willing and very able . Anna was an absolute credit to the hotel and was extremely efficient confirming my on going flights. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will use it and it's sister hotels on our ongoing travels. Well done to all the staff.,U Paasha Seminyak
2276,Great location,40,February 2014,"overall great stay & top location if u want to be amongst all the good shopping & hot spots. whilst there are some con's re staying here I wouldn't not say they have big impact to my stay.
pros
1. everyone is super friendly & helpfully & very welcoming all the time
2. big king size bed
3. awesome massive rooftop pool and quite easy to get a bed, but not always a towel ; )

cons
1. great AC but very noisy
2. shower looked dirty, needed some bleach & elbow grease
3. the roof to cocktails were very sweet lolly water drinks, more practice making drinks

minor cons for me & would stay here again & recommend to friends !",U Paasha Seminyak
2277,"Best View, Free Cocktails during Sunset",50,February 2014,"I can't review for the rooms, since I only use the restaurant - The Rooftop Bar.

Friendly staff, best cocktails with great value.

Beautiful view, especially with buy-1-get-1 free for any kind of drinks during sunset.

Will recommend this bar and restaurant to others.",U Paasha Seminyak
2278,AMAZING hotel,50,February 2014,"I am 3/4 of the way through a 10 night visit by myself. I booked this hotel knowing nothing about Bali, just took the advice of a work colleague who has been here a few times. Very happy I listened to her!!

I have a massive room on the 5th floor with some views of the ocean.

The pool on the roof is the highlight, I have been there most days and haven't had any issues getting a sunbed. The cocktails here and at their bar at street level are great and at the pool they have them 2 for 1 from 5pm - 8pm and the Alibi bar (at front of hotel on the street) has different offers on depending on day etc

Buffet breakfast has a good selection with a omelette chef who happily makes my egg white omlettes every morning. I have had dinner once up on the roof for their BBQ night, the food was EXCELLENT!

The gym / fitness center is quiet small but has just enough to get by. I know a lot of people don't care about training on holidays however it's a must do for me! So this gym just makes it though they could do to have full sized towels there, I just bring mine from the room, the small ones they have on hand don't really achieve much. Their are 3 aircon units in the gym, the one remote works them all so be sure to turn them all on if they aren't on all ready as it gets hot in there fast

All the staff here are so nice, really friendly and accommodating!

They have a 24hr check out policy which means because I checked in at 6.30pm I can then check out at that same time on check out day rather than the usual 11am which is so fantastic as my flight home doesn't leave till midnight so I basically get the whole extra day there at no extra charge!

There are a ton on boutiques on this road (none are Bali prices, all pretty much what you would pay at home or a bit cheaper) but some great stuff, not the cheap Bali stuff you can find elsewhere! I have done quite a bit of spending at Uma and Leopard, check them out! Earth Cafe for AMAZING organic food is like a 3 min walk from the hotel (I have written a seperate review on these guys). A 5 min walk the opposite way is Cool Spa for cheap but fantastic massages, Body Works is approx another 5 mins away and really good too but more expensive than Cool Spa

If you want to stay in Seminyak I would recommend U Passha, if I was to come back to Bali I would stay here again :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2279,Great Value;lovely place,50,February 2014,"U Paasha is a great hotel. Lovely, modern design. Extremely friendly, competent staff.

The location is perfect. 10min walk to the beach. Great restaurants and bars down the street.

Rooftop pool was lovely and there were always enough sunbeds when we were there, whether early morning or in the afternoon.

The rooms are nice and spacious. The bathrooms were ok, would have liked a bathtub, but they were clean and spacious.

Breakfast was great! There was a buffet AND you could order from a menu anytime. You could eat it anywhere-room, pool or restaurant. Nice touch.

Great value- I would definitely come back to stay here.",U Paasha Seminyak
2280,"Great Hotel, Great Service, Great Pool and Great Mojitos!",50,February 2014,"My husband and I are currently staying in the U Paasha, having been here a week and with another week to go.

It's a great hotel and while there are a couple of small issues, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives.

So here's all the good points:

1. Location. The hotel is located on the main street ""Eat Street"" in Seminyak and when you walk out the front door, there are cafes, restaurants, shops and boutiques everywhere. There are also lots of taxis going up and down the street so you can pick one up very quickly.

2. Style: The hotel is really modern and hip. The rooms are huge, with a very comfy king size bed, a small sofa and a day bed. There's a mini bar and tea/ coffee making facilities and you get 2 complimentary bottles of water daily.
The room has a balcony but it's not really a working balcony. It's long and just deep enough to stand out on but if you open up the huge french doors of the room then it feels as if you're sitting outside anyway. The shower is really big although the water pressure is not the best we've ever had (but not the worst either). There's an iPod dock in the room which is great. You also get to choose your own toiletries. We chose Jasmine and they are really lovely. Oh and there's also a safe in the room.

3. The Pool: The pool is fabulous. It's on the roof and is surrounded by nice trees. It also has speakers around it and the music played is lovely. We've never had a problem with not getting a subbed, there's always plenty and there are plenty of large towels. There's also a basket with sunscreen in it if you want! The water temperature has been lovely while we've been here. There's a happy hour every night between 5pm and 8pm where you can get cocktails for £2 each and they have a great cocktail menu, and there are always plenty of staff going around the pool so you don't even have to get up off your sunbed! You can also get food but we haven't tried any.

4. The Gym. There's a really nice gym beside the pool. It has 2 cross trainers, a few treadmills, a bike and a multi-gym. There are also free weights which is great for us and plenty of yoga mats.

5. The Breakfast. We've seen a few comments about the breakfasts being poor but we don't understand this as we've had a great breakfast every day. Here's some of the stuff on offer...

Egg station - Fried, poached, scrambled, omelette... you name it, it's yours!
Waffle & Pancake station - With fresh strawberries and syrup
Warm, freshly baked pastries - Croissants, Pan au Chocolat, Danish Pastries (This was a favourite)
Soup station - Build your own soup - Chicken noodle, Meatball, Beef Noodle
Cereal bar with fresh fruit
Meats & Cheeses
Bread/ Toast station
Fresh Juice bar 0 you can also order cafe latte, cappuccino etc
And then there was the buffet... Sausages, bacon, hash browns, baked beans, potato wedges, fried noodles, fried rice, beef rending... etc etc

When other reviewers are saying there's not enough choice, I have to wonder what kind of breakfast they're usually used to if all that is not enough!

It's served from 7am - 11am (but they also have an all day breakfast policy, so if you miss it you can call them up and they'll deliver it to your room right up to 11pm at night) and you can sit inside or out on a small terrace.

6. Service. The people of Bali are really friendly and helpful and the staff here are the same. They always stop to chat and have been teaching us some local words and phrases.

So, what could they do better? Well as a few people have pointed out, the air con is quite noisy but there's an iPod dock in the room so we've just put on some soft music and the noise hasn't bothered us.

We've also noticed a sewage smell in the room but it's only in the evenings and to be honest, we bought a packet of nag champ incense and just burn one every night and it's been absolutely fine.

The hotel offers airport pickup which we used and it was great, but it also cost $25 and you can actually pick up a taxi at the airport for half that.

There are a couple of excellent restaurants just across the road from the hotel:

Cafe Bali - great food, quite cheap, lovely atmosphere. Wine is about £20 a bottle but that seems the norm for everywhere. The service is very 'relaxed' so don't go if you're in a hurry!

Chanti - Excellent restaurant, quite pricey but the delicious food is worth it. The service is great and there's a romantic atmosphere.

All in all we are really enjoying this hotel and would definitely come again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2281,Good location and value for money,40,January 2014,"Pros:
-Get to keep your room for a full 24 hours - we checked in at 5pm meaning we didn't have to check out until the same time the next day, perfect as we could shower and change before getting our flight.
-Breakfast - you can have it anytime and anywhere. Good selection.
-Rooftop pool - lovely pool and relaxing atmosphere.
-Location on the main street in Seminyak
-Huge, clean, comfortable room

Cons:
-Toilet and shower have non-locking, partially see-through swingdoors, which is a bit strange if staying with friends.
-Bit of a walk to the beach.
-Check-in process was quite slow and staff were not amazing.

Overall, great value for money and lovely hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2282,"Perfect position, great pool, wonderful views, super comfy bed",50,January 2014,"We paid A$135 per night with bfst
We chose this hotel for it's 24 hour check out policy because we had a late night flight home - fantastic idea :)
This hotel exceeded expectations !
Pros
Very hip vibe
Huge room with wonderful comfy bed and lovely distant view out over the sea (we had a room on the top floor at the back of the hotel)
Big windows and a small balcony
Quiet (surprisingly)
Position - right in the middle of all the best restaurants and shopping in Eat Street !
Pool area was fabulous - lots of sun and awesome views.
Freindly, helpful staff

Cons
Breakfast fairly ordinary
Hotel seems to be built on the cheap - cracked pot plants around pool, huge cracks on bathroom floor, 2"" gaps between sliding doors and ceiling.(Stay soon before it falls down lol :)
Shower needed a good scrub
Hallways a bit echoey - but our sleep was not disturbed

A fantastic hotel in an unbeatable position - highly recommended",U Paasha Seminyak
2283,Great stay,40,February 2014,"Minuses:
- 10-15 mins to the beach
- hotel is industrial minimalist so finishing is a bit rough, i wud imagine bathrooms are a bit tedious to scrub
- water pressure is so so

But the pluses are plenty:
- smack bang in the middle of jalan kayu aya/laksmana eat and shopping street, so many quality restaurants all ard or a short walk from the hotel
- HUGE comfortable room (much larger than hotels of a higher category), ipod dock, well-stocked coffee/tea maker, large double vanity area and shower and toilet stalls
- cold a/c and very comfy king size bed
- nice rooftop pool area with view of the sea and a quite well-equipped 24 hr gym (cardio/treadmillls, weight machines, free weights)
- good bfast selection w i think outstanding properly made croissants. They serve local Sosro Heritage black tea which shows they care abt quality.
- very reasonably priced vs other options in this most prime seminyak area.

For the price and what's on offer i definitely will stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2284,Nice.... Just nice,50,January 2014,"Brest place, reserve on line at the hotel website, free transport from the airport back and forth, complementary welcome beer and discount coupon for more. Breakfast included for around 100 usd. Plenty of restaurant in the area as well as bars. No too far from the beach, about 10 min walking, great staff always friendly and spoke English.
Will come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2285,"Check in time is check out time, perfect for a late flight!",40,December 2013,"The U Paasha hotel is located in Raya Oberoi, which is a street packed with restaurants and shops. So if you're looking for a central location this is it. Rooms are spacious and have large bathrooms. My room looked clean and neat. Breakfast was ok. I mainly chose the hotel for their check in time is check out time principle as I had a late flight so that it was no problem to leave the hotel at 8pm. The hotel has a nice roof top terrace, but there are too little beds: around 20 which of course is too little for a hotel that I believe has around 65 rooms. Wifi worked good. I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. I joined the hotel's Christmas bbq buffet as I was given a voucher to do so for free. Quality of the food was ok, same applied to the sandwich I ordered for lunch.",U Paasha Seminyak
2286,Still Teething,40,January 2014,"I just had a 7 night stay in this Hotel. No 1 is location, it's right in the middle of some great restaraunts and shopping places. The Decor is very nice, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The only negative is they are still learning how to cater for the clients needs, like the we couldn't get a drink by the pool before 12pm on one day and they ran out of pool towels another day, just small things but annoying. They also didn't pick us up from the airport at arrival which was frustrating!",U Paasha Seminyak
2287,Good Stay,50,January 2014,"+ 24 hour rule. Allowed me to stay in the room until the evening.
+ Great Location
+ Huge and quiet rooms, great bed.
+ Friendly staff
+ Free pick-up from the airport (otherwise use a cab for IDR 100k)
+ fantastic roof-top terrace and bar

- noisy air condition (turned it off at night). Needs fixing.
- poor water pressure, but did not really car

In conclusion:
great stay for a weekend.
The 24 hour rule will really allow me to come back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2288,"Cool concept, great value!",50,October 2013,"We booked this hotel due to its 24h policy which matched our needs perfect, arriving at 2am in the middle of the night. In other hotels we would have to be out of the room by noon or so while we had our breakfast at 3pm instead which they serve you during the whole day at any time, anywhere at the hotel. How great is that? I really love this very guest-friendly concept!

The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. Or view on the wall of the house net door wash't that exciting but who cares?

The pool on top of the hotel is good enough and the location is great with a lot of shops and restaurants right next door and not too far from the beach either. The staff we encounter were most friendly and helpful.",U Paasha Seminyak
2289,"Great pool for lap swimming, good location",30,January 2014,"Stayed here from 11 to 18 January 2014. Annoyed that because I didn't book directly with hotel there was no transfers to airport, then they told me by phone from Aus that it was 300,000 rupiah one way where if I had researched better we could have got a taxi for 100,000. So didn't think they were particularly customer focused. The toilet did get a sewerage smell from time to time, the housekeeping wasn't great, breakfast was ok but the usual Bali brekky buffet- nothing special. Location was great, right in the hub of Seminyak. Air con was noisy but does't bother me as the noise is constant not stop start. Wouldn't stay here again as there us so much competition & new places being built but certainly it wasn't a disaster.",U Paasha Seminyak
2290,Great value for money!,40,January 2014,"This place is in the heart of Laksmana Rd where all the great shops and restaurants are. Worth the money u pay, staff are friendly and very handy to 24hr checkout. Rooms are huge and new looking and I love all the materials they have chosen for this hotel, it's hip and earthy design.",U Paasha Seminyak
2291,Best hotel in Seminyak!,50,January 2014,"Have stayed at many hotels around Bali now, and I rate the Upaasha as one of the best.

Staff are great, relaxed, helpful, friendly.

Location is amazing, right in the heart of Seminyak, walk to all the best restaurants and shops.

We stayed in the Penthouse and it is huge, we appreciated the extra space.

The best part is the rooftop pool with the great sunset views at night!

Will definitely be back again and again...",U Paasha Seminyak
2292,Could have been better,30,January 2014,I and family stayed at U Paasha seminyak between 3-6 Jan 14. Great location no doubt if you like the hazzle and buzzle of seminyak. Restaurants and shoppings are just a step away. Hotel in general is good but could hv been much better if they pay better attention on room cleanliness (especially bathroom and toilet) and have usable and clean balcony. For me usable balcony is very important as I like to drink coffee in the morning while sitting in the balcony or have an afternoon beer. Coffee tables in lounge area were not regularly cleaned. Everything else is good but not great. Roof top bar is also too bright at night with too many chandeliers but not enough indirect lighting.,U Paasha Seminyak
2293,Nothing Special,30,January 2014,"For a Hotel that is rated 4 star, this place is very disappointing. The location is great, its probably why I chose it. But thats about it. The air conditioner is incredibly loud, so at night in order to get some sleep I have to turn it off. I have also scored myself a room with a delightful aroma of toilet/sewerage - not quite what one wants on their holiday. Check in was pretty average. There is not many sun beds either, so have to get up there early to find one. Anyway all in all I probably would never stay here again. The ""balcony"" is not exactly functional either.",U Paasha Seminyak
2294,"Great design, good location",40,December 2013,"U Paasha is a great choice for its location - right in the heart of Seminyak, 15 minutes walk to the Seminyak Beach, surrounded by nice boutiques, restaurants, spas, easy to get to anywhere! The check in/check out at any time policy, as well as the all day breakfast is a great concept (though I would have preferred a more varied spread for the breakfast). We were also pleased by the layout and design of the room in the hotel, which is modern and new. The pool located on the top floor enabled us to just chill and not go out if we dont want to.

The main problem we encountered was major though. The airconditioning in the room was especially loud and we complained to the Management on Day 2 of our stay. Someone was sent to look at it, and it worked well for a night. However, it stopped working altogether after the that. The technician that tried to repair it mentioned a part that was not working with the airconditioning - something we thought should have been mentioned to us when we first lodged a complain, and for the Management to change our room to one that has no problems then. This was settled though after our second complain - thank you to the Front Desk Manager for upgrading our room to make up for our nights of discomfort.

I read here that the problem with the airconditioning is a recurrent problem in the Hotel. I hope that this is looked into more seriously as the rest of the Hotel is absolutely perfect.",U Paasha Seminyak
2295,Great Location,50,December 2013,"I wasn't sure what to expect when booking this hotel but the minute we arrive it was great. The staff are always friendly and very helpful, and the room was tidy and spacious not like some hotels we have stayed in.

The breakfast was yummy with lots to choose from. The location is spot on with walking distance to many great restaurants and shops.

The roof top bar has a great view you could sit and watch many beautiful sunsets if it were not raining and overcast like it was for most of our stay. The bars also have happy hour which consists of a two for one deal, so we made do with this sampling all of their yummy cocktails.

We also stayed over Christmas which to our surprise meant we had a Christmas dinner included in our stay on the roof top bar. There was so much food from seafood through to turkeys and dessert also a welcome cocktail on arrival.

All in all this Hotel is great, the only thing to complain about was that like everyone else has mention the air-conditioning is a little noisy but you do get used to it. And that the water pressure in the shower was not great but I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2296,One thing after another!,10,January 2014,"I thought it may be easier for prospective guests to read my review in point form, this hotel basically could not get anything right from the get go.

1) Arranged an airport transfer as it was my first time to Bali… My flight landed early and after waiting an hour a fellow traveller at the hotel called the front desk and was told the driver would be another hour and i should just get a cab. It was pouring rain and I then had to haggle with the local taxi drivers.

2) A group birthday lunch was arranged for 15 people on the roof top on NYE afternoon within 3 hours of eating the lunch 2 of the group became so ill that they could not attend NYE dinner and another two left the dinner early with stomach pains. The dinner was pre paid and non refundable for the people who did not attend. 80 USD PP

3) A new years package was booked which included some pre dinner cocktails on the rooftop. When the group asked the front desk to confirm, they knew nothing about what the marketing team had been selling even though it was also inside a booklet they had been distributing in the lobby, the hotel staff then changed the time and the place of the drinks 3 times within an hour! this meant that we could not attend as we had dinner plans at 8pm. Basically a complete mess and staff seemed some what indifferent. They simply could not deliver on what was advertised and sold to guests.

4) The hotel has 90 rooms and only 10 brollies! no wonder they never have any available, I am unsure what the room to brolly ratio should be in the tropics but this seems a little light on.

5) The lobby constantly has mosquitos and guess what??? They ran out of repellant!

6) As the previous reviewer suggested the showers in the rooms don't operate correctly and for some reason have stains around the drainage areas. The general finish of the bathrooms is substandard.

7) Aircon fans are extremely loud even when cycled onto low, which meant we had to get up during the night to change the setting.

8) Breakfast is ok but nothing to rave about so unless you get it included then don't bother. Go down the street to revolver cafe

9) On check out the hotel attempted to charge a higher room rate! to more than one person in our group and then when questioned seem to take forever to sort our the issue.

All of the above was placed in an email to Harry a few days prior to our departure… Harry along with the F&B manager made contact with me and we worked through the list… Make no mistake about it I was looking for a discount on the room rate etc I was left at the airport, my friends had been poisoned our NYE was tipped upside down and it was difficult to enjoy yourself when you feel like you are being taken for a ride… All that was offered was a free ride to the airport and a bottle of cheap champagne! All with Harry's signature smile.

On a lighter note the hotel is in a good location and the roof top bar and pool are nice and relaxing, staff are generally friendly but have limited English skills which is to be expected.

So buyer beware!",U Paasha Seminyak
2297,U Paasha U got it,40,December 2013,"We stayed at U Paasha for the start of our Bali trip. After our first Bali visit I knew we wanted a hotel that was the perfect location- and this surely is. It is right on the main strip of Seminyak boutiques and restaurants. The hotel is a very contemporary industrial style which I love however, fussy guests and others who like more of a classical look will find this 'unfinished'. The rooms are simple and neat, showers weren't the most clean but hey, just wear your flip flops in there! The staff were always attentive and met our requests. Highlights of this hotel are the impeccable design of the lobby (one of the best I've ever seen) and the AMAZING rooftop pool and bar, great bar food- recommend the Seminyak burger. I would definitely return to U Paasha again :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2298,DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL,10,January 2014,"For a ""4 star"" hotel U Paasha was terrible.
Shower was disgustingly dirty, ants constantly in the room, air conditioning was too loud, light switches didnt work and room service was absolutely ridiculous waiting far too long.
Then when I mentioned all my disappointment to reception they just stared at me with a smile!!! Very bad customer service and nothing done to fix these issues! I strongly recommend you STAY AWAY from this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2299,Simply the best ever!,50,December 2013,"The best hotel in Bali.. Hands down!
From the get go, although it was NYE and there were plenty of people checking in at the time, Henry checked us in swiftly without hesitation or differentiation, within minutes after arriving in Bali and we were checked in to the penthouse room.
Everything about U Paasha is simply amazing. Definitely highly recommended!
The location is right smack in the shopping dustrict of Seminyak, within walking distance of the Seminyak Square, flea market and great restaurants.
As NYE falls on my birthday, it makes me happy that the staff remembered that.
The hotel room is wonderful. The bed is extremely comfortable, to me it feels like sleeping on cloud nine. Slept soundly (despite the street / traffic noise) all night long.
The breakfast buffet spread is generous with plenty of superb options.
The staff especially Henry, are very warm, welcoming and friendly, they are just wonderful people to be around with.
A little thank you note to U Paasha for the amazing stay, I just can't wait to come back. Keep up the great work.",U Paasha Seminyak
2300,Perfect Stay,50,November 2013,"What goes beyond a beautiful hotel and truly makes a difference, is service. U Paasha really set the bar high. We arrived into a gorgeous hotel and smiling welcoming reception staff. Our room was bright and spacious, our balcony looks out to a field of balinese villas. They've placed rose petals arranged in a shape of a heart on our crazy comfortable bed.

Probably too excited to explore the island, we forgot a wad of cash on the bed and left the room. When we came back, the room was turned down perfectly and our money neatly placed on the table, not a rupiah missing. We were touched by the honesty of our housekeeper (I hate myself for not remembering his name now). On my 2nd day, I fell sick and was down with the mother of all sore-throat. Knowing this he stocked my room with numerous bottles of water, gave me honey and lemon too! I also know now there is a clinic located within 5 mins walk away, if you would appreciate this information.

U Paasha lets you eat your breakfast at ANY time of the day. No more stress of making it for the breakfast hours. Got up late and don't feel like getting dressed for breakfast? It's ok because you can choose to have the breakfast set served to your room! For me, this flexibility is awesome. Why don't more hotels do this?

The location is superb, plenty of great restaurants around, supermarket around the corner and never difficult to get a taxi.

To sum up this long review, Balinese people are some of the warmest, accommodating people I've met who genuinely seem to appreciate you enjoying this lovely island they are proud to live in. I know U Passha has recruited some great people like this - keep it the good work we will be back soon!",U Paasha Seminyak
2301,Wow fabulous new hotel in great location.,50,September 2013,"4 nights in seminyak U Paasha for the start of our Bali adventure and wow what a start. The hotel was stunning such a magnificant entrance and welcome. Staff really were very helpful and smiley especially the breakfast team. The rooms were the largest i've ever had, the decor was uuber cool and funky and i loved the huge bed and ceiling to floor patio door/windows which gave each guest a lovely view over seminyak (choose high floor for best views). The highlight of this hotel is the roof top pool which was a must to relax in at the end of hot day wondering around seminyak. We were there is september and we always got a sunbed and it was managed marveously so no beds being bagged by towels and left for hours as in other hotels, most people just popped up for an hour or two and left allowing others to come and rest... How civilised and nice for a change! The hotel is positioned in the nicest part of seminyak with some lovely and nice restaurants with some amazing food and its just a 15min walk to the beach which isn't stunning but is the same all along that coast - huge sweeping beaches which seem desserted until sunset when everyone comes out to watch and chill out of the coloured bean bags with a bintang or two... Bali is very magical and very special and this hotel was just the same... Breakfast was always a highlight of the day and the choice brilliant... why am i waffling just book it you won't regret it and i would defiantly return if i was lucky enough to go back to bali and i never say that!",U Paasha Seminyak
2302,Great Stay,50,September 2013,"Great pool and view, modernist design, great location yet very quiet. Cocktails were great and staff were really friendly. We loved the pool area, no shortage of sunny spots or beds and staff were always on hand with the towels. Enough room in the bathroom to swing a cat. No negatives!",U Paasha Seminyak
2303,Excellent,50,August 2013,"Helpfull staff, great rooms and amazing roof terrace. 10 min Walk from the beach, but was not a problem. U pasha is placed right across an Italian restaurant and close to restaurant the junktion - great restaurants!

Would definently recommend U paasha",U Paasha Seminyak
2304,Fabulous,50,December 2013,"7 nights at this great hotel. Rooms are large, clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge with a separate toilet which is a big plus for me. The only negative for some may be the lack of a functional balcony, however they do have a great bar on the rooftop to take in the views. The staff were extremely friendly the buffet breakfast was adequate. The rooms are quiet, although the noise from a group at the villas next door was annoying.",U Paasha Seminyak
2305,Great Location. Great room.,40,December 2013,"Location - awesome. Close to plenty of stores, and restaurants. Close beach.
Room - contemporary design, clean, spacious.
Bathroom - large, double sinks, rain shower head - except that the bathroom floor was flooded due to poor drainage.
Service - courteous, accommodating, professional.
Choice of welcome drinks.
Breakfast - more than decent selection, continental plus Asian.",U Paasha Seminyak
2306,"Modern design, great location",40,December 2013,"The rooms/ hotel had a modern ""industrial"" design which you either liked or disliked. I liked the clean, wide, industrial like concept with concrete floors, open concept bathrooms where one person can use the sink and the other can shower. Bonus! There were two sinks in the room which sped up to freshening up process.

It is unfortunately a double edged sword. My mom did not like the industrial concept as it made the room look ""unfinished"" and felt that the open bathroom area with no doors separating it from the room was noisy if one person was washing up and the other was sleeping.

Another con, the air-con was terribly noisy when it was switched on and the noise did not stop. If you're a light sleeper, you might have difficulties sleeping. Although it was a relatively new hotel, we faced other issues as the door was unable to close fully. Upon closely examination, the hinges at the lock was falling apart and the screws were coming out. The staff promptly fixed it.

Do a quick check on the water kettle before using it. The coating was coming out and was floating in the water and we only realized after having drank some. It was promptly changed by the staff when we informed them.

Breakfast selection was excellent and the hotel has a great location with many restaurants around it and a short walk to tourist destinations.",U Paasha Seminyak
2307,Very Good Hotel,40,December 2013,"if you looking for a great hotel in bali, this is the place, great location in seminyak, a lot of near by restaurants, very good service, friendly staff, nice design, rooftop swimming pool and spacious room",U Paasha Seminyak
2308,"Great central location, delicious breakfast & great rooftop pool!",50,December 2013,"This hotel is definitely good value for money! It has a great central location in seminyak and is walking distance to boutiques, great restaurants ... though not many good bars! It has free wifi which has good coverage throughout the hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful and always greet you with a smile. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom had 2 sinks which made getting ready in the morning sooo much easier with us being 2 girl travellers. There was also a good range of western and asian cuisine in the morning ranging from waffles and yoghurt to noodles and rice. Make sure to take a dip in the rooftop pool as well in the morning and enjoy the view of the rooftops of Bali! There's also a well equipped gym and yoga mats provided for all you health nuts as well. I would definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2309,Made the right choice,50,December 2013,"This is my 3rd trip to Bali and 1st time staying at Seminyak. Was deciding on a hotel which is nearer to all the restaurants & shops so shortlisted a few along Jln Laksamana. Finally decided on this hotel but with some reservations as there were some -ve reviews but there were a lot more +ve reviews so we decided to take our chances.

Just checked in today and we sure made the right choice. I send an email to the hotel notifying them that I will arriving at 7am & I received a reply the next day that they will arrange for an early check in. My room was ready when we got to the hotel. Checking in was fast, and the staff makes you feel welcome. As I will be checking out early & will be missing my breakfast on the last day, they allowed me to have breakfast on the day I arrived. How accommodating and bravo to the hotel that values their guest. The room is huge & clean. Only one of the bath towel had some rust stain but I can live with that. Otherwise, everything is perfect until now.

To the General Manager, well done and take good care of your valued employees. They made a great difference.",U Paasha Seminyak
2310,Amazing Hotel right in the heart of Seminyak. Will definitely be back!,50,October 2013,"We decided to stay here for 1 night towards the end of our trip after our friends we had been travelling had left. We were originally staying in a Villa nearby and loved the location as was close to a lot of the good restaurants. The 2 for 1 cocktails from midday to 8PM is what originally brought this Hotel to our attention. Some of the best cocktails in Bali if not some of the best I have ever had. We booked 1 night being the night before my Birthday and my friends had arranged a cake and some espresso martini's to be delivered at midnight which was an awesome surprise. All the staff were very nice and went out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Walking up and down Oberoi St. can be quite a punish. Traffic everywhere, dirt in your face, Puddles. As soon as you step of the road in to the Hotel you instantly feel relaxed and is good to get out the hustle and bustle. One of the little things that made this Hotel stand out was having an Australian Power plug in the rooms.",U Paasha Seminyak
2311,Will definitely be back!,50,October 2013,"Had an amazing time. The rooms were well equipped, staff very friendly, great price, great location, the check-in and check-out at anytime is a huge bonus. Only down side was the very noisy air conditioning. Will defiantly be returning.",U Paasha Seminyak
2312,"Location, location, location",40,December 2013,"U Paasha is located at the heart of Seminyak, just within walking distance to loads of nice resto, lounge n boutique.

Rooms are so spacious, nicely designed, well appointed. Love their concept of, whenever n wherever to have your breakfast till 11pm. And you can occupy your room for a good 24 hrs as one night stay, their policy is like, if you check in at 1800, then your check out time could be 1800 the next day.

Their roof top pool, perfect for a sunset cocktail, while you can dip into the pool and enjoy the chill out bit.

An excellent choice if you wanna enjoy the parties, n gourmet around, as it's so close to everything.",U Paasha Seminyak
2313,Soooo coming back!,40,November 2013,"I would definitely visit again! We arrived back in Seminyak for one last night without a booking and we were glad we decided to stay here. Uber friendly staff, massive rooms which are tastefully designed and the rooftop pool is great! The only negative thing I could say is that we were staying on the ground floor which has a huge generator/fan that runs along the outside of the rooms. The noise it generates could potentially keep a light sleeper up.",U Paasha Seminyak
2314,Will definitely be back to U Paasha,50,November 2013,"Friendly and efficient staff, clean comfortable large rooms. Fabulous breakfast with ample choices. Beautiful rooftop pool. Amazing views at sunset. Great location among Boutique shopping and close to all the well known restaurants as in Ultimo,Cafe Bali, Ku De Ta, Potato Head, La Lucciola, Sarong & MerahPutih. Loved everything about U Paasha will definitly be back.",U Paasha Seminyak
2315,Wonderful! Service and luxury,40,May 2013,"I would visit again, staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel is spacious and looks really nice. The rooms are beautilful, I loved the bathroom- with guestsupplies of your choice,isn't that a nice touch?

It has a great rooftop pool, you dont need a balcony or garden here. (with all the hotels and restaurants standing side by side, a garden would seem useless anyway)

Only thing that bothered us was one day housekleeping woke us up by knocking on our door well before 9 AM for cleaning :( Otherwise: no complaints!",U Paasha Seminyak
2316,Great staff and service,50,November 2013,"My husband and I stayed at U Paasha hotel for a few nights and loved it. The roof top pool is beautiful and the bar staff up there are so helpful. Nothing is a problem at Upaasha and you really feel like they go above and beyond to make sure you are happy. The roof top bar is great for yummy cocktails and nibbles. I can't wait to go back. Yeah the hotel itself is not perfect but it's pretty close and the service makes up for it. The air conditioning is noisey but we just turned it off before we went to sleep and on again in the morning and it was perfect. The room smelt a little strange whenever we went in but we just opened the doors for a while to let it breathe. (i think it's just because the want to have the room cool for the guest so they never open the doors) The breakfast was really good too and i loved the birchers muesli! I will be back :) Also not too far to Potato Head, W bar and Ka Da Ta Beach clubs which were also a fav. Maybe a $7 nz taxi max. I think if they gave the showers a really good scrub, changed the air conditioning units over to quiet ones and aired the rooms it would be absolutely perfect! Those things don't really bother me tho.",U Paasha Seminyak
2317,Loved it here...,50,November 2013,"After a luxurious stay at the Arma in Ubud, we were concerned nothing in Seminyak would measure up. Rather than try to recreate the Balinese botanical wonderland of our previous hotel we decided on U Paasha and found its modern W style accommodations to be a fabulous contrast. We loved having the freedom to check-out at the same time we checked in, breakfast is included and available as a buffet or until 11pm delivered anywhere to you in the hotel, lovely rooftop pool, 24 hour gym, high powered a/c, helpful staff and great beds/pillows. We have a hunch this is the best deal in Seminyak.",U Paasha Seminyak
2318,Excellent experience at U Paasha Seminyak,50,November 2013,"We stayed at U Paasha from 13 Nov to 14 Nov 2013. Although we only stay just one night, but we felt an excellent experience at this hotel. Started from the welcoming process, the staff offered a welcoming drink, which can be collected at the Alibi bar. It would be better if the drink was delivered to the reception area, considering Alibi was located below the reception area.

During check in process, it was smooth, and the reception staff was very attentive and informative. If you booked through their website, you will be asked for pillow arrangement and free iPod with selected genre for your pleasure during your stay. I did select the pillow and iPod. However, they missed to asked me about my pre-booking. It's not that a big thing, but it should be recorded on the system and they should pointed out to the guests, regardless they have a pre-booking or not. This service is something new (at least for me), which could be a good added value to the guests.

Me and my wife arrived at noon, and were hungry, so we ordered lunch (Sop Buntut + Satay) from the restaurant and asked to be delivered to the room. Around 30 mins later, the food was delivered. They were delivered not as much as I expected. Instead, far exceed my expectations. My Sop Buntut was separated from the soup, which made it perfect! They keep the soup warm in a-teapot-like jar, which I like it! And the Satay was also delivered exactly the way I ordered! Two thumbs up for the restaurant crew!

The room, there’s no other way to describe it. It was spacious (no kidding), and my wife thought I booked a Superior Room (which I didn’t)! And I wasn’t expecting a balcony, although there’s not much view to see, other than the resort next door. The bathroom was unique, a mixture of a semi-open door (not outdoor) bathroom and a bathroom sink.

The location was perfect, right in the middle of Seminyak. You will easily find restaurants of your choice. If you walk 5 mins down the road, you’ll find Seminyak Square. I didn’t go to the beach, so I don’t know how far it is from the beach.

The only thing that was a downside was the in-room wi-fi connection. It was unstable, I couldn’t even connect to the network. Maybe you need to improve the networking so guests can enjoy the wi-fi inside the room. I didn’t try the network at the other area, so I wasn’t sure about the connection there. One more thing, the room’s odor was plain. You barely smell anything. It would be better if there’s a fresh odor every time you enter the room. It wasn’t bad at all, but I prefer a fresh fragrance in the room. Overall, I enjoy my stay. Weel done U Paasha!",U Paasha Seminyak
2319,"Best hotel ""price considered"" in Bali!",50,October 2013,"We only discovered the Paasha near the end of our stay in Bali and left our very comfortable to give it a try because the check out, the time that you check in, appealled to us. We were catching a late night flight back to Melbourne. We loved the room, loved, loved ,the pool area! The breakfast was more than perfect and the staff went out of their way to accomodate. I can't wait to go back and stay there!",U Paasha Seminyak
2320,"Perfect location on ""Eat Street""",50,November 2013,"My partner and I stayed at the Upaasha Hotel in November 2013. For the style of hotel and value for money, this hotel was fantastic. The staff as always in Bali are so friendly and accommodating. If you're looking for a unique hotel, Upaasha fits the bill. The decor is modern and looks like there has been so much work involved in the intricate wooden tiles. You can have breakfast anytime of the day or night. Check out time is based on check in time, which for us was perfect. For instance, if you check in at 5pm, then you don't need to check out until 5pm. The rooms are very spacious, cool and have a trendy warehouse feel to them. We loved the polished concrete floors and limestone feature walls in the standard room. There is a selection of movies to choose from if you wish to use a DVD player, plus a computer and library in the lobby. The sky bar and pool area is very large, and you can expect a lovely warm pool as it has all day sunshine. We changed rooms for our last night to the penthouse as a special treat. The size of the room is massive. Very similar decor to the standard room but separate bathroom, toilet and walk in robe. The menu is fairly standard and pricing not over the top for a hotel. You can grab a cheese burger which was more food than I could eat for around $7 AUD. We also enjoyed the welcome drink which was any cocktail from the menu. I would recommend a visit to the Alibi Bar downstairs, very trendy and cool plus they make the best Martini around. A special thank you to Anna at reception and Eddy in the restaurant for making our stay personalised.

The only criticism would be the size of the balconies. Although they are as long as the room, the are barely a meter wide, so really only standing room.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for it's great location, fantastic service, unique room decor and friendly staff.",U Paasha Seminyak
2321,Great Value for price.,40,October 2013,"We stayed here after a indulgent 5 days at the W Retreat. Of course this place was not on that scale but I would honestly say the next best thing for the price. The rooms were simplistic and well furnished. Beds comfortable, good quality linen, and nice bath products. The pool on the roof was beautiful - only issue is it was quite shallow and warm, and not enough loungers but what can you do. Breakfast was adequate - good selection. We did have it in our room on 2 occassions which was nice. The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and helpful which is a good. (Eggs, crossiants, dumplings, noodles, rice, bacon, sausages the works... As this hotel is quite new they are replacing the tiles in the lobby - which mind you is amazing. This hotel is very chic and in a great part of Seminyak for adventuring around and shopping. I have travelled to Bali 15 times and stayed in a variety of places - this being one of the best for price. $519 AUD FOR 4 NIGHTS.

Only thing I would change is prehaps moving the breakfast from the front restaurant to the restaurant on the rooftop - The view is amazing, and definitly something worth waking up for.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced in comparision to whats around the area. I was finding a meal for the same price as highend scale restaurants such as 'Metis' which is on a whole different scale.",U Paasha Seminyak
2322,Location Location Location,50,October 2013,"I have been travelling to Bali for over 20 years now and having stayed at the likes of The Intercontinental, The W and also The Padma in the past, U Paasha is a GREAT HOTEL, in a GREAT LOCATION! U Paasha Seminyak is located on the main street of Seminyak, also known as 'Eat street'. Its surrounded by some great restaurants and cafes such as Ultimo, Revolver, Rumors, Cafe Z and the Earth Cafe. Its only a short walk to Seminyak Square and 5-10mins (depending how fast you walk) to the beachfront of Kudeta. I hired a bicycle from the hotel and found it extremely easy to get around on. If you want to hire a motorbike/car, there is a huge parking garage downstairs.
Rooms:
Spacious, bright and modern. Comfortable, fabulous bed and décor. The only negative is that their wasn't sufficient lighting in the wardrobe area and no full length mirror.
Food:
The buffet breakfast was typical of what you find in any other hotel, only just on a smaller scale. You can have you eggs made any way you like, the waffles were SO good! Any style of coffee available from Cappuccinos to Lattes.
Pool:
Wow wow wow! What a luxury to have a rooftop pool in Bali! You have almost a 360c view of all of Seminyak and beyond. The pool is quite shallow, at its deepest 1.1 metres. The only negative is that the Pool Bar is not in operation properly until 12pm! But they do walk around with free bottles of water and fruit on skewers. Actually free bottled water is available from the Gym and any staff member
The Staff:
Wonderful and courteous at all times! Their English was fantastic and always smiling as Balinese are famous for doing constantly.
Hotel:
The hotel itself is modern and stylish. The interior can be dark in various places but over all quite lovely.
I would definitely stay here as its location, rooms and food are quite good.",U Paasha Seminyak
2323,"Unique, in the heart of Seminyak",40,July 2013,"Most of the options in Seminyak are to stay in beautiful private villas, some of which are really expensive, others are a bit of a hike away. U Paasha was in the central part of the city, but an easy walk to the beach. The flexibility in check in and breakfast was great for a short trip.

The room was huge and quite nice, but the AC was so strong it gave me a sore throat. The pool was great to sit by, but was short on beach chairs and you'd often find yourself inhaling second hand smoke.",U Paasha Seminyak
2324,Just an ok hotel,30,October 2013,"Since we don't feel like staying in a private villa in Seminyak because we want to explore the area we stayed in this hotel. First the location is great, if you are into food tripping, wants to try different restaurants this hotel should be considered. We are just disappointed with the smell of the room. Smells like toilet all over the room. There is no door that separates the bedroom and the bathroom. But advantage of this hotel is that the time you check in is also the time you can check out. If you check in by 5pm you can check out till 5pm too! Their rooftop swimming pool has nice ambiance and very inviting. For some night outs, you can check for their in house bar at the basement. They also serve complimentary cocktails/drinks for in house guest, just say your room number. The buffet breakfast may not be grand but satisfied with the number of choices. Breads, eggs, pancakes, rice, bacon, fruits, salad, different fruit juices. The hotel is good, but the price is not worth it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2325,Worth every penny!!,50,November 2013,"This is my second time staying in UPaasha, and I become more in love with this hotel. The staffs were great, the room was spacious as well as the bed. The breakfast is top notch, you'll find variaties of breakfast from waffles, fried rice, congee, soup, eggs, cereals, fruits, pastries, u name it!!You can also ask for hot chocolate, cappuccino, espresso etc during breakfast for free! The unique thing about this hotel is the check in time, u can check in whenever you want and check out the same time as you check in. The rooftop swimming pool is great. And since the hotel is the highest building around the area, you can see beautiful sunset from here. Another thing, their mocktail is also good!! Order it during happy hour coz u can pay 1 for 2!! Location wise it's great, across the street you'll find cute and delicious chain of restaurant from cafe bali, trattoria, ultimo. It's also within walking distance to Kudeta. So I really recommend this hotel for those people who love to be in seminyak area...",U Paasha Seminyak
2326,Fabulous hotel,50,October 2013,"Initially I was hesitant to book this hotel for a three night stay in Seminyak, wanting something a little more traditional. But after a glorious eight nights in a private home in Ubud and at the prompting of a friend who had stayed I thought maybe a modern hotel would be ok for a short stay. And it was. It exceeded expectations. From the front office manager Hendri and his very helpful and exceedingly friendly staff, to the large well equipped rooms and the superb rooftop pool I found my stay to be perfect. So well located with 'Eat St' right at your doorstep.....I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again. I didn't need the beach as I live in a beautiful coastal position in Australia so this hotel fitted our requirements perfectly.

If there has to be a down side I guess the slow wifi and the noisy air conditioner were two minor grumbles!

Thanks U Paasha",U Paasha Seminyak
2327,Stylish hotel in Seminyak,40,October 2013,"Stylish decor in public areas, large bedroom with a large bed, good breakfast, free cocktail on arrival, very late checkout time (6 pm), good location for shopping and dining, though not really walking distance to the beach. And the always friendly Bali service.",U Paasha Seminyak
2328,Outstanding... Stay here if you can,50,October 2013,"WOW.. I have been working in travel for over 22yrs and I love it when I find somewhere that still manages to impress me. It has great unusal concepts like you getting to choose the scent of the bath products, the type of pillows, ipod music etc when making the booking. Also the 24hr concept , where you get to checkout at the same time that you checked in. (ie if you check in at 8.30pm then on your last day you can use the room till 8.30pm, which means you don't have to pay for the day room or an extra day if you are getting late flights out of bali). The staff were exceptional and seemed genuinely excited and happy to be working here. Breakfast was well above most hotel breakfasts, and you can have it when you want. Either in the restaurant or room services, have it at 8am or 8pm.. At U Paasha it is all about U. Beautiful sunset from the bar on rooftop and from the rooftop pool. And the location is right in the middle of Eat St and very close to Seminyak Square.. I couldn't recommend this place high enough... Love it",U Paasha Seminyak
2329,Spacious,40,March 2013,"Located in seminyak road, it was convenience to get to most shops and restaurants. The rate was acceptable, the lobby had a high ceiling which was good. The staffs were friendly but check-in was a bit slow.

The room is really spacious and the design is minimalist. Welcome drink was given which can be consumed anytime of the day. didn't try the food, as I was trying other local foods.",U Paasha Seminyak

2331,"A cool, Balinese gem ...",50,October 2013,"Arriving at this cool, open concept of a hotel, with extra-spacious rooms and bathrooms, comfortable beds, was a great start to the wonderful holiday my daughter and I just had in Bali. The staff are amazing, their smiles and their helpfulness certainly shows genuine Balinese hospitality. We were attended to so well, that no matter what we needed, or where we were at the hotel -- the staff at the front desk, housekeeping, pool attendants, at the restaurant for breakfast, or food and drinks at the bar, we always received excellent service. The hotel's location is so central that we only had to walk up and down the streets of Seminyak which are loaded with a huge choice of great restaurants and bars (all lined up around the hotel area) as are the best beach clubs in Bali, and of course the quaint shopping boutiques. After a full day out in the sun, or a day trip sightseeing, my daughter and I were always happy to head back for to the hotel for a few relaxing evening drinks and yummy snacks at the bar before heading to our cozy room. What an amazing value for money which includes an offering of little unique but great touches (besides the usual soap and pillow options). They do complimentary all day breakfast, anywhere you want it as well as a late check out if needed. I highly recommend a stay at this hotel, because you will not be disappointe. I know when I return to this beautiful island I would make sure to stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2332,perfect for a weekend getaway!!,50,October 2013,"As a Westerner currently living in Jakarta, I wanted a mini-weekend getaway to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city. I already spent two weeks in Bali in August doing all the touristy stuff, and just wanted a place that I could bum around and relax for two days. U Paasha was perfect location!!

I arrived close to 2 AM on Saturday night (flight delayed), but the staff was still there to check me in and get me settled for the evening. The beds were extremely comfortable and wonderful for a lazy morning and once I got up and moving, I was able to enjoy a delicious breakfast and a relaxing day at the pool. The hotel is close to many great restaurants, but the pool cafe serves some yummy dishes as well. I spent Sunday at the pool all the way up until I was picked up for the airport on Sunday and check out was fast and efficient.",U Paasha Seminyak
2333,Great value for a small boutique Hotel,50,October 2013,We arrived early from Bangkok and check-in was smooth and fast. Break fast is awesome even though selection is a bit on the lighter side. Food on the Pool is amazing and cheap. Drinks are 2 for 1 after 5 PM. Service is great there. Rooms are large. Perfect location for shopping and experiencing the nicer side of Bali. Great location and easy to get to UBUD and other touristy stuff like Ulluwatu and Tane Lot.,U Paasha Seminyak
2334,All perfect,50,October 2013,"This hotel located exactly at the centre of Seminyak, great location, with famous restaurants around.
Has spacious room, clean , nice interior decoration, perfect lighting design, comfortable bed,pillow, make us have good slept.
Very nice View from roof top bar , we even can see the sea from here.
Interior decoration at the lobby also very special,cozy.
Nice and very help full staff, and polite.",U Paasha Seminyak
2335,"Value for money, excellent location!",40,October 2013,"My husband and I visited Bali for a short one week holiday and decided to split our stay into two parts - the first halve closer to the beach and second up in the cultural center - Ubud!

We decided to stay at U Paasha in Seminayak and were not disappointed. We didn't want to spend too much money on the hotel since we were planning on diving and were not going to be at the hotel almost the entire day.

We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at U Paasha. It was bang on the busy streets with lots of boutiques, restaurants and bars. This was super helpful cause we didn't have to go very far to eat or drink (specially after a long day of diving).The hotel lobby was swanky and the rooms very comfortable. They have a 24 check in check out policy which was convenient. They also have breakfast included which can be enjoyed anywhere and anytime up until 11pm which was very nice specially on vacation when you want to sleep in and not set any alarms.

The only negatives that I can think about (which weren't a very big deal for us) is that there was a slight musky smell every time we entered our room. And also the free internet was a little slow. But that's ok! Fast enough to check emails while on holiday!",U Paasha Seminyak
2336,What's there not to love?,50,October 2013,"Perfect location at the center of Eat Street in Seminyak - so you have all the action at your doorstep, yet the hotel itself is a haven of tranquility with zen-like interiors, and a stunning rooftop pool with a view over neighboring roofs and the ocean (gorgeous sunsets).
The rooms are very large, with comfortable beds, and have spacious bathrooms with twin wash basins. Amenities are great too, with your choice of fragrance.
Breakfast is served when and where you like it.
And they offer a gym, plus complimentary sunrise yoga lessons on Saturday.
What more can I add? Staff are all very nice and service minded. I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this hotel. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a 5-star hotel at a bargain price.",U Paasha Seminyak
2337,U Passha Seminyak,50,October 2013,"Great location and spacious room. only 8 minutes walk to Seminyak Beach. Lots of restaurants close by.

Staffs were super friendly. I emailed the hotel manager, Harry Nurbito to inquire about transportation and for a higher floor, he followed up and answered all my questions prior to my arrival.

The room includes free wi-fi & breakfast. They offered various local exotic fruits. I love the passion fruit! Latte, espresso, cappuccino also included with breakfast!

They hotel offers airport pickup for US$30. It cost me < US$8 for a taxi from the airport. Due to the recent increase in gas price (>40%), taxi from airport to the hotel did go up slightly from 60,000RP to 80,000RP. Still a lot cheaper than the hotel car. I travelled by myself and felt safe the whole time.

Rather than hiring a hotel driver for a day for US$80, I located an excellent driver from a TripAdvisor referral. He only charges 500,000 RP a day (about $43) for 10 hours!! He was punctual, courteous and I felt completely safe with him traveling alone. He even stayed late so he could take me back after I watched the sunset on Jimbaran Beach. His name is Buda from Buda Bali Tour. email: budayasa_nyoman@yahoo.co.id www.budabalitour.com

Dollar is strong against the IDR now. Bali is truly an amazing place. Great time to visit.",U Paasha Seminyak
2338,"Great location, 24hr stay option perfect for late Aus flights.",50,October 2013,"Right in the heart of Seminyak so great for all restaurants and shops. $1 cab to Potato Head / Sarong or 15 min walk.

Excellent size rooms with all mod cons inc iPhone speaker. Open plan bathroom will not leave much to the imagination.

Rooftop pool is great with good ocean views, but needs more sun beds. Very simple to solve.

Best thing about the hotel is the priceless 24hour stay rule meaning you can check in at 6pm and stay til 6pm the next day. Perfect if you are on the late flight back home. It's 4pm and I'm still by the pool with a Heineken in hand.",U Paasha Seminyak
2339,Great Hotel,40,October 2013,"Lobby is modern and nice ambience. Room was very big and comfy. Staffs were friendly and quick to check in. I had a welcome drink that include alcohol too, good touch. The price of the alcohol however was quite expensive when I ordered at night, a bit disappointed. Located in the busy road of seminyak, it is very convenience to get around.

Check out was 24 hours from check in, very helpful. Breakfast can be ordered until 11pm by room service. If you want to eat at the restaurant, the breakfast closed at 11am.",U Paasha Seminyak
2340,A great Hotel in a great location,40,September 2013,"Location, location, location - This hotel is a great find. Its in a great location on restaurant row, with shops on your door step and the beach close by.
The staff in this hotel are so lovely - I travelled here alone and felt welcome and safe throughout my trip. The rooms are exactly how they look on the web site. They are huge and very new.
The air con though is very noisy and ear plugs are required.
The breakfasts are good and the hotel pool is amazing.
You wouldn't be disappointed if you stayed here.",U Paasha Seminyak
2341,Everything we wanted!,50,September 2013,"We were looking for a one week get-away in Bali and this hotel situated in the heart of Seminyak provided everything that we wanted. It had specific extras that made the stay far more enjoyable such as the rooftop pool and bar which is truely special, and the staff are the most helpful I have encountered be it handing out free fruit skewers or cool hand towels at the rooftop pool or assisting with a restaurant reservation for the evening. In addition the 24 hour check-in concept is a fantastic idea and meant that we did not have to vacate our room on our last day until we had to leave for the airport in the evening. The room is very spacious with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. I would also note that the wi-fi is available throughout the hotel including the rooftop pool and it has a strong connection. We also enjoyed the daily buffet breakfast. The gym whilst not huge is well equipped for a cardio or gun sculpting session. I will definitely be re-visiting in the near future.",U Paasha Seminyak
2342,"Spacious, clean and comfortable in great location",50,September 2013,"We stayed for 5 nights and have nothing to complain about. We stayed on the top floor (5th), which was great as we had direct stair access to the gym, pool and bar one level up and it was also very quiet - we didn't hear a peep from the street.

The location is excellent, very central, with many restaurants and shops close by and just a few minutes walk or cheap taxi fare to Ku De Ta/Potato Head etc.

As others have mentioned there is an awesome rooftop pool. Could have lazed here all day long. Service was top notch, rooms cleaned very well and all towels and linen immaculate. All staff polite, friendly and always doing something/keen to assist (ie. no slacking off!). A/C cool and crispy. Buffet breakfast not too bad with a good selection of things to eat, both Asian & Western options.

Gym was pretty good as far as hotel gyms are concerned. Free bottles of water provided, towels, sound system and the A/C is great!

Yes, we also LOVED the concept of having the room for a full 24 hours from the time you check-in. Hotel also happily stowed our luggage until it was time to catch our flight.

Recommended - we would happily return to this hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2343,Alibi Bar is a Must,50,October 2013,"During our 10 day trip in Seminyak, my partner and I unintentionally stumbled across the Alibi bar, on the ground floor of the U Paasha hotel. At first glance it looked like it was catering to the higher end crowd but I felt at home there. The service is exceptional, special mention must go to Iwan who looked after us every time we were there. Drinks were promptly refilled, with all staff remembering what we preferred from previous visits. The bar menu is ok, ask for the restaurant menu which is much more appealing (and the food is delicious).
The décor is fitting of a top bar in Chapel St....urban chic. I can't wait to head back to Bali to drink at the alibi bar again. From our time there, we are considering staying at the hotel on our return.",U Paasha Seminyak
2344,Pleased to have stayed here,40,September 2013,"We stayed here twice on our recent visit to Bali, the first time for 5 nights, then we went off to Ubud, then came back here for another 4 nights. We were very impressed by the hotel, which is a good affordable option for Seminyak, as most of the other accommodation I looked at online was way more expensive than this. The hotel seems to be brand new. The bathroom area is quite open to the main bedroom - you probably wouldn't want to be shy with your partner. The air conditioning unit was really really noisy, but we worked out by turning it on to auto quietened it down considerably while still keeping the room cool. For some reason the staff kept turning it back when they serviced the room. Some of the light switches seem to be in odd places - the one for the little entrance hallway is by the bed. It took us until our second stay to work that one out, and we had to put up with the light on at night, as the staff turning down the bed turned it on in the evening. We stayed both times on level 3. There is no level 4. Level 5 has rooms, and then above that is the roof top pool. The pool was lovely, although could be quite windy. However, mostly this made it cooler, and we found the breeze pleasant while we were there. They could do with a few more sun loungers, or at least some better options for those who can't get a lounger - currently just a yoga mat and a towel on the concrete is the only other option. We found the service really good, although my friend staying in another room left her swimsuit behind, and was told they couldn't get it out until the people who had checked in after her checked out, which I found a bit odd. Luckily we were going back so were able to collect it then. The variable check in was a great option. The hotel is well located right on the main strip opposite cafes and restaurants and not too far to walk to Ku De Ta if that's your thing or La Lucciola, which is more our kind of place. Overall, I'd highly recommend it for a central place to stay in Seminyak if you're looking for a more affordable option.",U Paasha Seminyak
2345,Excellent option,40,September 2013,"This hotel is just four months old and is keen to establish a good reputation. It is well positioned in the heart of Seminyak and within walking distance of all you would wish to be close to. The staff are fantastic and very friendly- they can't do enough for you. The hotel is nicely designed with comfortable rooms. A bath would have made my room perfect. The rooftop pool is a lovely feature and I spent a couple of days there with great poolside service for food and drinks. The only thing I would personally change is to do away with the poolside music, which is constantly played at volume from a number of speakers positioned right beside the beds. I found this got pretty irritating, especially when you just want to read or sleep- I eventually gave up on it and went to the beach. This is the ONLY thing which would make me seek an alternative next time and I am sure it won't be an issue for many. A good option.",U Paasha Seminyak
2346,glad I stayed here...,40,September 2013,"I was a little unsure reading some reviews. But, I must say, I have had a great stay here...
I love the variable check in/check out times, thats a great USP. I checked in 10pm Friday eve, so I can check out 10pm Monday eve for my late flight - perfect.. GREAT IDEA.
Love the rooftop pool and deck, with the welcome breeze and good service from the staff. Smooth east check in, no language issues with the local, as many reported.
Agreed breakfast could be better, I note many comment, the hotel should address this, it would take much!! Its almost there.
The rooms - BIG< COMFY BED>NICE LINED>GREAT BATHROOM>WIFI GREAT>TV OPTIONS GOOD. Yes the water pressure is a bit low, but I can forgive that.
The location is spot on for the best restaurants in Seminyak metres away, and nightlife too. Room was very quiet and clean.
GOOD JOB U PAASHA :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2347,Seminyak in style,40,September 2013,"Great location
Amazing room sizes
Great design and layout albeit slightly shoddily built but that's fine.
Amazing openness and unfussy approach to the hotel.
Great breakfasts.
Amazing rooftop pool with service to match.
Noisy rooms from AC condensing unit.
No views from rooms but that's ok.
Great value for money
Great location for easy access to seminyak nightlife.",U Paasha Seminyak
2348,"Perfect location for foodies, excellent value for money",40,September 2013,"I really like street presence and this hotel has a lovely lobby. The rooms are a really good size and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay because I had untold fabulous restaurants right there.
Pros: lobby, clean big rooms, comfy beds & pillows, ipod dock & dvd, tv with lots of channels, location in eat st, rooftop pool, coffee percolator in room, nearby restaurants deliver food to your door like trattoria! No check in/check out time. Lovely security who help with getting a cab or crossing the rd. no shortage of towels and service at the pool.Get to pick your own soap fragrances, quiet rooms, good views.
Cons: amount of staff with little English, in house menu selection poor, water pressure in showers not the best but I still enjoyed it. Mini bar wasn't refilled. Need more day beds or Loungers at the pool. Need better concierge services with good English speaking staff as the ""hosts"" can sometimes have no room for flexibility. Air con loud.
If you're like me and want good accommodation in seminyak you can't go wrong with this hotel :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2349,Nice,50,September 2013,"The design is modern.
Although there is no air conditioning in the public area, the weather of Bali and the design of U Paasha make it cool and comfortable. We didn't have a sweat at all.
I love the spacious room. Clean net and modern. The bed is super comfi. We love the sunset view on the roof top pool. But since we went there on Sep, the tempreture in the evening is a bit cool.
The booking and check-in system is great too. We booked through U Paasha's own website. They provide the best price.",U Paasha Seminyak
2350,Ideal Location in Seminyak,50,August 2013,We found this on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. A Bali friend suggested we steer clear of Kuta and it was the best tip ever. We stayed 4 nights. We loved how it was on a street with lots of shops and restaurants but once you entered the hotel it was very quiet and away from the hussle and bussle. Breakfast buffet was included and it was very delicious we ate tons every morning. We used the free bikes which made the adventure more fun in getting us around Seminyak and seeing more then on foot. The beach is a good walk away so the bikes are useful. The room was large and clean with a very comfortable bed. The shower is great as it is so large but the water pressure was a bit low. We read when you check in you get to choose your soap and they forgot to do this for us. So the next day we asked about it and they apologized and let us choose our soap for the rest of our nights. It was a fun touch.,U Paasha Seminyak
2351,Nice modern hotel with good service.,40,August 2013,Lovely contemporary spacious clean room. Convenient being able to checkout 24 hrs after check in. Good spot on eat street. Nice breakfast. We travelled with our 7 month old - cot provided. Lovely rooftop pool.,U Paasha Seminyak
2352,Great value for money,50,September 2013,"My daughter and I stayed on the 3rd floor and had read reveiws regarding the smell, wasn't that big of an issue for us!first the pro's
Roof top swimming area brilliant no issues with getting enough sun very quiet and great views.
Also fruit skewers, icy cold flannels, great relaxing music to listen to.
We always got a 7 pm knock on the door by staff making sure we had enough dry towels, bottled water etc, I really liked this!
The late check in/out they allowed us to leave our luggage in the store room for 3days while we left for the Gillies no questions asked.
The staff were extremely attentive.We enjoyed the large rooms and beautiful decor.I would definitely stay again.

The cons, noisy air conditioner bothered me more than my daughter but got used to it after a while.
Construction noise outside noticeable during the day(we were out mostly) so not a big concern!

Our stay was for 7 days we never heard fom adjoining rooms or noise from the hallway, also the taxis always new where to find the Hotel....

Good job Upaasha we had a great time, and would definitely stay again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2353,Worst smelling room I've encountered.,30,August 2013,"I stayed at this hotel at the end of August into early September for a total of 10 days.

I was travelling alone so I wanted something which wouldn't require me to travel long distances to get to where I wanted to go. This place definelty wins for location but apart from that there are quite a few problems.

I'll start by saying the hotel itself is beautiful but if I didn't have trouble with the smaller things my stay could've been well improved.

I booked into this hotel 5 weeks before my stay. I organised through email with the reservation team prior to my arrival: 1) airport transfers to and from hotel 2) late check out 3) I requested a room on a high floor with a view as I didn't plan on going out much at night so a balcony was important to me - to which I was told this would be no problem.

Airport transfer picked me up no problems. On check in I was told reception would need to hold $300 AUD on my credit card for any damages or mini bar purchases. This amount is WELL above what it needs to be. $100 maximum is what they should ask and is the most I've ever had held.

Second. The check in staff had no idea about my late check out even though I had emails confirming it they again had to call someone to ok it which added extra time to check in which isn't what you want after a long flight.

Ok this is the important bit - the room.
The room i was given was on a low floor - facing a building. No view. Nothing. Very poor effort given my request had been confirmed and then I was given that.

The next problem.....THE SMELL. I noticed it slightly on entering the room but didn't think much of it. After having a shower and leaving my room for a few hours the smell really intensified. Like a mould water smell. I called reception and the engineer was up shortly flushing out all the pipes.

The smell was gone. The next day it was back. Called reception. Pipes flushed. Smell gone. The next day it came back. I again called reception and I was really annoyed at this stage as the smell had kept me up. Again the engineer came this time he fixed it and I was given a can of air freshener.......how insulting? Not once was I offered a room change or offered anything off the price of my stay. Very poor effort. My advice is if you notice this smell once - ask for a room change straight away because it won't get better. It's actually a disgusting smell that was so strong it woke me up during the night.

The roof top pool is really lovely. Definelty not enough sun lounges up there and I did notice people go and 'reserve' them by placing their personal belongings on them, then leave the hotel for hours, come back and use them - all while others have missed out. Really unfair and pool staff should monitor this and remove unattended items.

Breakfast was ok. I ate it once. Eggs weren't great. After this I went out for breakfast.

My tip. Only get a room on level 5 and just because you confirm things via email with this hotel - doesn't mean they're going to happen. It's a shame because my stay had the potential to be so much better if they had more attention to detail.",U Paasha Seminyak
2354,Best boutique hotel experience,50,August 2013,"Stunning interiors, super clean and fresh and incredibly helpful, friendly staff. First time in Bali, I loved the location, the rooftop pool, the extensive breakfast options and the thoughtful touches like jazz music filtering through the poolside speakers which made it feel more like a guesthouse and less like a hotel.

Incredible value for money - I only hope the prices and services stay the same as it increases in popularity.

Rooms at the rear on lowest floor can be a bit noisy from the main air con unit below, but staff offered me a number of alternate rooms when I requested a change.

Absolutely great place to unwind, where everything felt effortless.",U Paasha Seminyak
2355,The best location in Seminyak!,40,September 2013,"For the price of this hotel, it was definitely a good find. Our room was a twin and we had comfy beds and plenty of room. The breakfast buffet is great - good selection and serves for a long time period.
We really appreciated that we didn't have to checkout until the same time that we checked in; helped us to make the most of our last day without having to pay for an additonal nights accomodation. Enjoyed the Saturday morning yoda session at the pool - was a really nice touch.
Just a couple of points that we were disappointed with.....this hotel has one of the worst showers I've ever experienced! the water pressure is very low and this gets worse with the later in the day you get your shower. The couple of times that I got a shower after 7pm, there was also very little hot water. The decoration is really modern but the cleanliness around the bathroom sink area could be better - it looked as though it had never been wiped below the bench area against the wall!
We unfortunately lost a credit card whilst in Bali and had money taken out of our account. We needed to urgently call the bank in Australia but this was impossible to do from the room, so we went to the front desk and the person we had assisting was obviously not familiar with the phone system as continually told us that that 'emergency 24/7 365 number' was busy with no holding message?!! We went to another receptionist who was much more efficient and able to put us through to the correct number immediately! Just a little frustrating in an already stressful situation!

A great hotel though, with lovely friendly staff on the whole and I would definietly recommend to anyone, especially for the location, pool and gym area. I do agree with other reviews regarding the very noisy aircon though - probably annoying if you're a light sleeper but we were fine!",U Paasha Seminyak
2356,Good hotel at a great location,40,August 2013,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August.

Pros:
1. Great location: Right in the middle of the action. Surrounded by good restaurants and is walking distance to Semniyak Square and the beach.
2. Pleasant staff and ever smiling staff who were always eager to help.
3. Spacious rooms with comfortable beds
4. Great view from the pool on the roof.
5. Decent spread at breakfast
Cons:
1. They have a 24 hour check-in policy which meant that we had to wait for an hour to get the rooms even though we had arrived at 3 PM.
2. Noisy air-conditioner in our room which kept humming like a wind turbine was a minor irritant

Would recommend staying here due to the great location.",U Paasha Seminyak
2357,Amazing Find,50,August 2013,"Great hotel centrally located - almost brand new - wonderful service and awesome rood top pool
Its on the main strip - close to all cafes beach restaurants and shops
The service is amazing -even during the day the pool staff bring you fruit skewres and cold face washers to refresh
Breakfast is varied and is very good and rooms are modern
You dont hear the noise from your room
Id stay definitely again - in fact am thinking November",U Paasha Seminyak
2358,A beautiful hotel but still has a long way to go.,30,September 2013,"I stayed at U Paasha for a week in two seperate interconnecting rooms early to mid September and the quick summary is perfect location, simplicity and beauty but much work needed with the staff.

The long story is I originally had a booking error and was given a lower rate by the hotel not open to the public. After booking and my email confirmation coming for the two rooms I get an email from Harry, the Reservation Manager advising I may not have this rate. I was rather upset at the point more than the money, emails went back and forth of him apologising but saying I can't stay at the rate confirmed. It was not until I took it to the Hotel Manager they advised I can keep the rate.

Upon arriving at the hotel you are treated by the most beautiful foyer (more so at night). Check in on the first room was simple and fast (it was midnight). Check in for the second room 2 days later was 5 hours late, luckly we have another room. The pool is fantastic for tanning, can get a little windy however I liked that. The down side of the pool is the amount of deck chairs, every day there is many missing one, not good enough in my opinion. The gym is well equipped and you get a great view over seminyak, not to mention free bottled water - rare in Bali!

The rooms themselves were stunning in every way, I lived the earthy-esque of it all. BRAND NEW. Polished concrete, frosted glass, bamboo, king koil bedding and a huge room. It almost felt too big because of the amount of furniture. Plenty of room for guests to relax if they come over. The toilets and showers aren't the most private if you worry about that stuff. The only downside I have is the mini bar. A. it barely chills. B. it's tiny. C. staff like to take your stuff out.

Staff in the hotel are amazingly friendly as you'd expect however you're better off doing everything yourself. And I don't say that loosely. Any request is welcomed but because the hotel is new the staff are undertrained/don't speak English very well yet (I understand its not Australia but in a tourism city it's expected). Maids often tried to ""save the environment"" or whatever their excuse is by not changing bedding.

Beware of the front foyer stairs, the waterfall often leaks on to the polished cedar. I slipped and fell damaging a pair of glasses and my back.

The location could not be bet anywhere in Seminyak. No money change on-site which is frustrating but a safe and friendly lady next door does it with a receipt. Buffet Breakfast was well set up and a huge variety but I got bored. They couldn't poach eggs. Omelette was delicious and fruit and salad options was impressive. Never tried waffles etc. bacon was always overcooked. Coffee was average (but they had soy), walk to the left 3 doors down and drop in at revolver for coffee - your mind will be blown. A la carte in room was better than buffet, much enjoyable and an awesome option, especially free up until 11pm. One day hungover I had breaky at 5pm and was loving life!

Never ate lunch or dinner at the hotel but the ""famous"" BBQ looked nice.

At the end of the day it is a beautiful addition to the middle of eat street but it is still too early to run seamlessly. I wouldn't stay again for the fact I like trying new places but in 6 months this place will be worth while.

Ps. I'll add heaps of pics soon.",U Paasha Seminyak
2359,"Excellent location, Comfortable stay",50,August 2013,"Loved our stay at U Paasha from the very time we checked in. The layout and decor of the hotel is very contemporary and refreshing. Much different from other hotel kind settings. Hotel is situated at one of the most happening streets - spa, eating places and shopping can all be done in 5 mins walk. Beach is also a comfortable 10 - 15 minutes walk away. Breakfast was excellent - variety of options with smiling staff to help out. Rooms are really big, spacious with comfortable beds.",U Paasha Seminyak
2360,Great stay in the heart of Seminyak,40,August 2013,"This is a great spot to be - right in the middle of great restaurants and boutiques in Seminyak. Our room was huge and the bed was very comfy. The staff really made us feel welcome and comfortable, they are so friendly. We loved the rooftop pool, it was a perfect size with nice sunbeds and pool side service and very quiet - everyone was there to relax which was perfect. There is a great selection at breakfast, both western and indonesian food. There is also an egg station (cooked any way you like) and a waffle station.
If you're looking for a nice spot to relax and enjoy the great restaurants that Bali has to offer then I would recommend the U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
2361,Good. That's all.,30,August 2013,"We enjoyed our stay at U Paasha, but there were a few things that didn't quite meet our expectations.

Let's start with the good: We were very happy with the rooftop pool (as were a lot of reviewers, it seems) and had no problems getting a deckchair. We loved their cocktail list and juices. The staff at the rooftop bar were always attentive and smiling. The suites themselves are huge and we loved our bed - slept really well, no noise complaints from us. The location is excellent - smack bang in the middle, Jalan Laksmana is a great point to start your journey around Seminyak and really easy to get cabs. The reception and decor all-round is impressive.

And now for the issues..

I think I'm just a little spoiled from small, boutique hotels - with service that caters to YOU and goes out of their way for you on a personal level - but the staff at reception just seemed a little cold or half-assed, despite the smiles. First off, they carried my boyfriend's luggage up but not mine.. which made an awkward situation of my boyfriend hauling my luggage up, while the staff carried his. Not a big an issue I guess, but seemed a little strange considering I was the one struggling with my bags! For breakfast room service, there was absolutely no flexibility with meal choices (more on this later). For questions concerning where to eat for dinner or whether they had such-and-such item in the hotel (a cable for your phone, for example, or decaffeinated coffee), I was given pretty short, unhelpful answers, and generally heard a lot of 'sorry's for things and no helpful suggestions or alternatives. Sorry and a smile is fine, but I was definitely expecting a little more from this place.

Some strange, stingy aspects of the hotel, too: no shampoo/conditioner distinction, rather: one little bottle of 'conditioning shampoo' which made my hair dry and hard to manage.. no toothbrush or TOOTHPASTE is made available for you unless you call to ask specifically for it.. a lot of things you might need you have to call and ask for, see if they have, etc.

More on the bathroom: the giant glass swinging door things, that are meant to supposedly distinguish the toilet from the shower and basins, are poorly built - so if you don't close them gently you get this loud CLANG sound of the hard glass hitting more hard glass. But what's the point in closing the ""door"" anyway when there's this giant hole where it seems like a doorknob should be? Lots of chance for peek-a-boo here. We also had a lot of flickering light, and saw a few paint splotches around the room. Meh.

And yes, the aircon is loud. This still hasn't been fixed, contrary to the management's replies to other reviewers.

As for their breakfast: The 'whenever wherever' policy is a pretty poorly executed concept. We thought we'd take advantage of this option on a Sunday afternoon, having been drinking the night before, but the selection ordered by phone was so limited compared to the buffet downstairs in the morning that you'd be silly not to wake up before 11am. You get your choice of eggs, 2 sausages or bacon (not both, mind), choice of bread and cereal. It sounds OK, sure, but we woke up earlier the next few days for their actual breakfast selection instead. This is far more impressive - the waffles, congee, hash/potatoes, salad bar, sundried tomatoes, cheeses, olives, Indonesian dishes, various juices etc. Yum.

One big big big problem we had though was on our last night - when we called for a wake-up call the next morning at 5.30am (early flight). The staff at reception on the line (after calling TWICE because no one was picking up...) confirmed the time with us, but the next day: no call!!!!!!! Thankfully, I woke up before 6 so we got to the airport on time but this is pretty unacceptable. We told the staff downstairs that morning and they said they had not logged in anything. Hmm.

U Paasha is a beautiful space in a great location, but small things let them down. Perhaps it's because it's new and still working out a few things, and I really do hope that they improve in some aspects because it would be a waste of such pretty decor.

In all: I would definitely return to U Paasha, if only for their rooftop pool and their prime location.",U Paasha Seminyak
2362,Good option if you like to be in the centre of the action,40,August 2013,"Stayed 5 days. Room is huge. Big bed. Double sinks. The quality of the finish is not great and will not age well.

Staff were helpful.

Enjoyed the roof top pool. Good people watching.

Right on the Main Street so lots of great cafes and shops around.

Gym is well equipped as far as hotel gyms go.

Food served at the pool restaurant was tasty.

If you can get a good deal (around $150 a night) it's very good value.",U Paasha Seminyak
2363,Excellent Hotel and Fantastic Service,50,August 2013,"Whilst this hotel is not traditional Balinese, it offers it's guest with a five-star service.

The rooms are spacious and spotless. The hotel staff clean the rooms two maybe three times a day and are very attentive if anything needs changing.

The breakfast is superb (can be ordered up until 11pm!) and offers all that anyone would wish for.

The roof top pool is probably one of the best in Seminyak.

The staff are very pleasant and accommodating - always there to help.

Some of our friends were in neighbouring hotels and were of the opinion that for value for money, U Paasha was by far superior.

If we return to Seminyak we would definitely stay at U Paasha again. We would recommend this hotel to everyone without any hesitation.",U Paasha Seminyak
2364,"Friendly, friendly",40,August 2013,"The U Paasha was pretty good, but it was the staff that made it great. Smiles and help everywhere. Loved the pool (especially its lack of swim-up bar), the industrial look, top buffet breakfast and the location was great. Downsides? The room smelled a little ""moldy"" and the aircon was a bit loud. Nothing to worry me though.",U Paasha Seminyak
2365,"Location, great service, friendly staff, great rooftop pool and bar",40,August 2013,"Location is perfect on eat street seminyak. Rooms are a great size, new and clean. Rooftop pool is tranquility in the middle of Bali craziness, with great views over legion and changgu. Breakfast is lovely and served at all hours, if you request. The staff are very welcoming and always smiling and happy to help with anything you may require, be it taxi or room service. Great hotel for couples.",U Paasha Seminyak
2366,Random visit but surprisingly very good,40,August 2013,"On our first night at Bali, we randomly visited few places near Seminyak square. Visited Alibi Bar at Paasha.
The bar wasn't crowded at all but the music was very good with just the right mood. We decided to go anyway for good music.

Very good lounge, good music and amazing drinks. Mojito and lychee martini were the best.",U Paasha Seminyak
2367,Good experience at Upaasha,40,August 2013,"Positives:
- Excellent unlimited Wifi throughout the hotel
- Huge room size
- Very friendly & helpful staff
- Lovely pool area, gym and bar
- Flexible check in/out and breakfast anytime/anywhere
- Location, right on ""Eat Street"" in central Seminyak

Negatives:
- Very average finish, especially considering this is a brand new hotel
- Air conditioning is extremely loud, so loud it prevents you from sleeping at times!
- Shower pressure very poor
- No ironing board provided in the rooms
- At the times when we switched off the air conditioning due to the noise, we were kept awake by the noise coming from the building/house outside our room

Overall we enjoyed our stay at Upaasha, and we would recommend to friends looking for a reasonably priced hotel in central Seminyak. If we were to return to Seminyak, however, we would probably look at alternative options - we would be willing to pay the extra to stay in a slightly better hotel which did not have these slight snags.",U Paasha Seminyak
2368,Nice location with easy access to many restaurants,40,August 2013,"Staying in Seminyak is more relaxing than down in Kuta.
Kuta seems to be too much of everything, with shop owners that wants you attention.
U Paasha offers a modern hotel like facility. They also have unconventional checkin and checkout time. The work with 24 hours periods instead of the normal 12:00 checkout and 14:00 checkin. Coming in to the hotel give you a good atmosphere, but the restaurant on the reception level have old style furniture which does not match the rest of the hotel.
In the ground floor you have a bar, bar in the evenings plays to loud music. And if you get a room close to the reception i would bet you get disturbed. The pool on the roof is excellent, with a nice view over Seminyak. The also have an evening buffet on the roof which was nice if you wanted to have a quite evening.
The rooms are fresh with a nice bed. The toilet is just protected by class walls, so what you do in there will be noticed in the rest of the room. You will also notice that everything is not 100% perfect as you would expect in a hotel.
But a very nice place to stay, and i would pick the same hotel again if i would come back to this area.",U Paasha Seminyak
2369,Beautiful hotel..,40,August 2013,"Last week my husband and I stayed in the U Paasha Seminyak and we enjoyed our stay. We had a beautiful room. Very spacious and well decorated. We were on level 1 though and didnt have a great view from our balcony.
Staff were friendly and helpful but not over the top. I enjoyed the turn down service each night too. Nice touch.
The view from the care and pool deck is amazing. My only criticism was that on a couple of occasions we went to the pool deck for a swim but there weren't any sun lounges available. The deck is very large and I understand the hotel has a minimalist design but I think a few more lounges around the pool wouldnt hurt.
Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
2370,"Great potential,but I wouldn't stay there again",10,August 2013,"This is a new hotel in the hip area of Bali, Seminyak. The photos on line certainly do it justice, and the location is perfect with a distant beach view from the roof top pool.Being our first real holiday in 3 years, my wife and I were excited to spend 8 days at the pool sunbathing.My wife even called to check the length of the pool and were happy to hear about its roof top location.The breakfast buffet which is included was great, the friendliness of the staff is unbelievable and the weather while we have been here( still have 2 nights to go) has been stunning,but the reason why I wouldn't come back is that when we get to the pool everyday ,with the stunning view ,with clear blue skies and sun,THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE DECK CHAIRS.Every single day the same thing, so the only option is to lie on a hard deck,and since I have a form of arthritis, this wasn't possible.it really was a downer for our holiday,especially since we called ahead to ask specifically about the pool,and this wasn't mentioned.. Not far off being a great hotel though,but I won't be back to find out.

2371,"Excellent hotel, great location, visit whilst it's still a bargain....",50,August 2013,"Central location in Seminyak, close to top restaurants and walking distance from the beach.

Large and spacious rooms, very clean and modern.

Beautiful roof top pool and bar with excellent views.

Friendly and helpful staff.

This hotel has recently opened and is priced accordingly, this makes it a bargain for the quality of accommodation and location.

We stayed for 8 nights in 2 rooms on the 3rd floor, there was no smell as other trip advisor visitors have stated and there was no noise from the nearby street despite the rooms being at that side of the hotel. I would recommend requesting a 3rd/4th floor room.

There was no view from the room.

I have 3 points of feedback for the management:

1. A clothes line to hand wet swimming things on the balcony would be useful, there is nowhere to hang wet clothes at the moment.

2. A sign at breakfast requesting guests to wait to be seated. Breakfast was very busy between 9am to 10am, ofter requiring guests to wait in the lobby, however, some guests decided to seat themselves effectively jumping the queue, this was because there was little organisation and control.

3. More sun loungers at the pool. Sun loungers were all taken by 11am, guests had to revert to laying on the floor.",U Paasha Seminyak
2372,"A brand new modern hotel, comfortable and central",40,July 2013,"We stayed here 3 nights and I have to say It was perfect.
If you are in places like Bali, I suppose you won't spend most of your time in the hotel, so what I usually look for is a big comfortable clean quiet room, great breakfast, friendly staff and quick answers to our needs and this is what we found. The reception, facing the street, is huge and completely open, quite cool! As other reviewers already noticed they propose a 24 hours check in - check out concept: you are allowed to leave at the same time you have checked in, and this is quite useful, especially when you have an early or late flight to catch.
Regarding the rooms: ours was huge, with two incredibly big twins beds (difficult to get up in the morning...!) and a very functional wardrobe, with plenty of space and mirrors (always a plus, for two girls travelling...). The bathroom's very big as well, the only negative point being the clear glass door separating the shower area from the rest. Yes, air conditioner is quite powerful and there is no remote control (this could be surely improved) but once you go to sleep you don't need, in my opinion, to keep it on, as the room is fresh enough, so I didn't find it to be a problem. Big flat screen, sofa and balcony facing the villas.
Breakfast: we have never had a problem to find a table and the quality was good enough: they also serve eggs and waffles, prepared at the moment.
Rooftop terrace: there are a very nice swimming pool and bar, but we never used it.
They also have a bar at the ground floor, but It didn't seem to be very popular: the music can be very loud, but they stop at a certain time and in any case we couldn't hear anything from the room; actually, the quality of the sleep was exceptional (3rd floor)
Location is perfect: plenty of restaurants and shops around, and ten minutes walking from the beach.
I would definitely recommend it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2373,Fantastic Location Enjoyable Stay,40,August 2013,"We stayed for 7nights in August. This was my first trip to Bali. This hotel is new and understandably will have a few teething problems. The rooms were spacious and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was good but gets a bit hectic around 9.30am. The staff looked stressed but handled everything fine. There is a good selection of food. The rooftop pool is amazing and well serviced. On windy days though, you cannot put up the umbrella. The location is perfect and is right in the middle of the restaurants and shopping. There is also a massage place right next door. We had a massage every day. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the beach. The only suggestion I have for the hotel is to put soap holders in the showers. All the staff were smiling and were very eager to please. A special mention to Anna in reception. Having great staff enhances your holiday. Anna was extremely helpful with anything that you needed. Also Ginto was very friendly and warm. I will stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2374,All about U,50,July 2013,"I was on business trip to Bali last week and i was stay with U Paasha Hotel Seminyak for 5 days and I am glad to share my great experience stay with this hotel. I can tell that I am overall are satisfied during my stay there, the good thing i may want to share are:

- All Staffs are friendly and helpful regardless who they are and what they do, as long as you may need an assistance, they will happy to assist you.
- Unique concept of 24 hours stay, no matter what time are you check in you will still enjoy at check out at the same time you were check in (24 hours basically is your right to stay - pretty good and unique right? )
- Breakfast, if you havent good time for breakfast you can request to change with your lunch, that's something cool i guess:-)
- Since i was on fasting during my stay, i was change to early breakfast and send to my room and i can tell you all the meals are fabulous, thank to chef on preparing my ""Sahur"" during my stay there and high compliment your chicken porridge is so awesome - do delicious!
- Location, no doubt is reside in heart of Seminyak area where the urban, chick, glamor of Bali was there and easy to go around and easy to get taxi either.

Above then good thing, i have comment on below:
- Rain Shower, please add more pressure on the pump so the water spray strongly and refreshing upon take a shower (My room and my colleague room have low pressure so upon take shower was not really enjoy)

I am recommend this hotel for your reference stay for your plan holiday in BALI:-)

Keep it good and Bravo!",U Paasha Seminyak
2375,Has a lot of issues,20,August 2013,"My husband and I stayed here and moved rooms so many times in one night . First it was the view of a black ugly wall, the air con units sound like you have helicopter in the room, they don't really change from one too another. We did approach the manager to give him the benefit of the doubt. He helped as much as he could and upgraded us to a penthouse. The room was much better and air con slightly quieter. However we did have a nightclub underneath us and duff duff duff was what we got. However because the manager was helpful we decided to stay and just make the most of it. One does need to remember for Seminyak and its location it's a cheap hotel. Our holiday in Bali was excellent but we know it well and knew how to escape the hotel. The pool on the roof top is lovely, very badly run however , we suggested to the manager to get some staff working the pool area he did then we had service at last . The restaurant for breakfast is a complete and utter abortion. It drove me mental watching the disorganization of it. Staff if any around are completely useless. They appear like they have never worked in a restaurant before. Buffet food runs out and not replaced unless you ask. We worked out to eat after 10 am at least then we could sit at a table rather than queue for one in the foyer. If the owner of this hotel ever reads this then I would suggest you take some control before you end up flat broke. You ought to be ashamed of yourself . It is a total mess and you need to take some responsibility in directing your staff to be better. You reputation will be diminished before you get one, or you will end up a budget hotel with an undesirable clientele. Your hotel has a lot of potential and could be excellent if it was run properly .",U Paasha Seminyak
2376,Great stay!,50,August 2013,"My partner and I stayed 5 nights at U Paasha. Beautiful new hotel. Staff are all very helpful and friendly.
Lovely big rooms, bed was very comfy. The toilet and shower sometimes let off a bad smell, but nothing too over powering. You come across the same smell walking around Seminyak so I guess it can't be helped. Other than that, room was great.
Rooftop pool and bar is beautiful, it can get a bit windy but it's nice when it's hot! They do a great BBQ on the roof at night which I highly recommend!
Breakfast in the morning is everything you need with a wide range to choose from. We had ours on the rooftop by the pool one morning which was nice!
We enjoyed a few drinks in the downstairs bar which is very stylish and relaxing. The girls working there were just lovely!
Top location, so many great restaurants just a few steps away. Beach is just a 15 minute walk.
I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Seminyak. It's fairly new so there's still a few things they could pick up on but I'm sure in time it will get even better!",U Paasha Seminyak
2377,Modern elegance in a unbeatable central location.,50,July 2013,"Stayed for 3 nights with my husband as part of our Bali holiday. Loved the sleek, minimalist decor and roof top pool. The gym is also brand new and although small, has good kit. Breakfast was wonderful and service was very good. The rooms, lobby area and pretty much all aspects of hotel are spacious which makes it so enjoyable to relax in. The rooftop bar is great especially the happy hour where the views across Seminyak are unrivalled. I think the Conceriege service needs further work in terms of restaurant recommendations, etc however I thought it was great overall and very good value. I would recommend this highly to friends seeking a cool and trendy hangout.",U Paasha Seminyak
2378,Can't beat the location,40,July 2013,"Is still early days for this hotel but large rooms, stylish designs and friendly staff make it a good choice in Seminyak. Rooms are very function able and have some nice flair. Excellent breakfast and caring employees. I will be back. Best of all is easy access in Jalan Laksmana right in the middle of Seminyak,",U Paasha Seminyak
2379,Nice place,40,July 2013,All nice. A little pricey. Breakfast was great. Pool on the roof was nice but a little exposed. Not really a hotel for kids but the kids loved it and the staff were really friendly to them. Room was nice,U Paasha Seminyak
2380,Our stay was ok,30,July 2013,"The design of this hotel is amazing, lobby is beautiful, rooms are large and comfortable, and the roof pool is amazing. Check in was very slow (had to wait 45 min for checkin despite arriving an hour later then advised). We had to change rooms on the second day as every time we showered the roof flooded in the wardrobe (soaked all our clothes the first time). They kept saying it had been fixed however we had to experience 3 mini floods of the wardrobe and bed area until they offered to move us to another room. As other reviewers have noted the rooms have a stale musty smell (both rooms had this problem) but you get used to it pretty quick. The food was really tasty, particularly the rooftop BBQ and lobby restaurant (we had a really tasty Thai lunch) and the drinks served in happy hour are good value (all nice and strong). So overall looks great, food is great, customer service not good and a bit smelly.",U Paasha Seminyak
2381,"Sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives.",20,July 2013,"My boyfriend and I stayed at U Paasha from the 25th to 30th of July, for a total of 5 nights. Well, I'll start with the positives - the lobby area is stunning, as other reviewers have mentioned. The rooms were very large, although it may be a little too big as it gave the feeling of sparseness. The staff were excellent, always polite and eager to help. The breakfast spread was quite good, there was a great choice of hot foods (nasi goreng, curry, waffles, eggs any way you like, bacon) as well as the usual continental selections (toast, cereals, fruit). The rooftop pool was gorgeous, although it was a little windy at times.

Ok, on to the bad. The first night we checked in, we were given a room with two single beds, and the room.. stank. There was an overwhelming smell of dampness and mustiness as you enter the room, with the smell seeming to come from the bathroom. We were ok with the smell, as you kind of 'get used' to it after a few minutes, and we did come to expect this from previous reviews. We asked to change rooms for the second night, as we wanted a double bed, and thankfully the second room did not have the musty smell. The staff were very efficient in getting this organised. We stayed at the second room for the next 3 nights, until we realised that the itches we were getting were not from mosquitoes, but from.. bed bugs. The bed had a minor infestation of them!! They were quite small, but we managed to catch a few and we took photos of them to show staff. They were definitely bed bugs, as one tried to bite my boyfriend on his finger when he caught it. We changed rooms (again!) on the morning of our last day there, and we were given what must have been the suite, the room was huge! Thankfully, there were no bed bugs in this last room, but by then we were so sick of all the room changes and complaining I think we would have just put up with it to be honest. One thing though, the sheets on all the beds had horrible looking stains on them, which were turned on the inside and we wouldn't have noticed if we weren't turning over the whole bed looking for the bed bugs!!

Overall, I am disappointed with our stay at U Passha, especially given the price we paid, which I thought was quite steep compared to other hotels in Bali. It is unacceptable for a hotel to have bed bugs in their beds, we still have the sores from all our bites! Also, the shower areas in the rooms were a little grimey, the shower floor especially had mould which is weird considering that the hotel is quite new. Also, I did not like the polished concrete interior, it made the rooms feel dirty and unfinished. I would not recommend this hotel to others, until they have sorted out these issues which unfortunately did negatively affect our holiday.",U Paasha Seminyak
2382,Hip and stylish boutique style hotel,40,July 2013,"I booked a couple of nights at U Paasha in Seminyak towards the end of our Bali trip and we decided to stay here to check out the Kuta and Seminyak area , the hotel seemed quite new and the price was not bad. I booked the hotel on the hotel homepage and in the booking process you also get to choose which pillows you want, what kind of tea you want and what kind of soap you want.

When we arrived at the hotel the front entrance was pretty cool – the front was pretty much open towards Jalan Laksmana. The check in process was a bit on the slow side but we were assigned room 124 on the ground floor. The hotel seems to be long and narrow and the corridor leading down to our room was not very cozy with a sort of concrete floor and naked walls. When we got to our room there seemed to be some construction noise coming from the outside of the hotel but luckily we did not hear any of the noise inside our room.

The room was fairly big with about 50 square meters – the entrance hall was long and narrow and could not be used for anything. The floor was the same concrete floor as in the hall and the walls were a combination of light walls and some large rock tiles behind the bed (see the photo). The bed was huge and with lots of pillows – and after staying at various hotels with firm pillows I was happy to find the duck down pillow that I has ordered when booking the room. Apart from the bed there was also a small sofa and table and a sort of chair. There was also a pretty naked desk with a large TV and a stool to sit in front of the desk. By the bed there was a Philips radio that was also a iPhone docking station – ideal for charging the phone and for listing to your music. The wardrobe just contained a small safe that worked just fine.

The bathroom was pretty funky with a bee hive tiles theme which was repeated in the mirrors in front of the two sinks. There were some amenities like shampoo and bath gel that was OK. The toilet was in a separate cubical with a frosted glass door so it gives a bit of privacy. The shower area was with a clear glass door and it was huge.

Free wifi was provided and it worked pretty well and the username and password were provided when we checked in. Check out time is the same time as check in time – this was very convenient for us as we only checked in at 4 PM.

The aircon in the room was pretty noisy and there was no remote control to adjust the fan speed and temperature. In order to adjust the aircon I had to fiddle around with the control panel by the door and it was not very practical.

Breakfast was served by the lobby and it was not lavish but provided the basics. There was cereal, bread, some fruit, coffee etc. There was also an egg station where you could get eggs made the way you want and it was possible to add bacon, beans etc. There was also a waffle station – I have not seen that in many hotels. The hotel pool is located on the hotel roof and was pretty big – but the view is not great as there are only 4 floors.

The location of the hotel is pretty good – on the road Jalan Laksmana you can find a mix of shopping, restaurants and art stores. It is only about 1 km to the Oberoi resort and the Seminyak beach.

Conclusion
The U Paasha hotel in Seminyak was a nice boutique style hotel that wants to be hip and stylish. The rooms were a bit naked but the bed was comfortable, the location is pretty good and breakfast was not bad. So all in all I would not mind staying there again if I’m going to stay in the Seminyak area.",U Paasha Seminyak
2383,Very nice and clean,50,July 2013,"We arrived here on 25/7/13. Check in was very easy and fast. Staff very friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was very good and the servig everywhere any time is so cool. We had b'fast twice so far on the roof top near the pool and was amaising. Coffee was so good and they have skinny milk tooo. The gym is very well equiped if you need to attend every day, is more than enough. I did attend every day and usualy is just me in at 7 am and is open 24/7.
The staff clean your room every time yiu step out so clean towels and glasses and cups at all times. We definetely stay here again if they keep the good work up. rooms are very spatious They let visitors in to join the pool and area. We had x2 free dinnerrs which were very good.The bar underneath is so cool and affordabe. We loved the happy hour.
Thank you and we will return.",U Paasha Seminyak
2384,New hotel in central Seminyak,30,July 2013,"This was my second time travelling to Bali and first time in Seminyak. I booked this hotel as they had cheap deals going, I would only stay again if there was a deal. I am giving average instead of poor as the hotel did allow us to change our dates as we had booked the wrong dates and didn't realised until the day we were arriving. The hotel is very new with a nice lobby area and the bed in our room was very comfortable. The drains in our rooms bathroom smelt very unpleasant and our balcony opened right next to a very noisy bungalow which kept us awake at night. As someone else commented the aircon is so noisy its hard to sleep with it on. The rooftop pool area is lovely but it is very windy there and waitstaff can be hard to find if you are hoping to have cocktails there. The in room breakfast was very slow and not anything special. The buffet breakfast was ok you can get eggs cooked to order or waffles specially for you. Overall not a great experience but not terrible either.",U Paasha Seminyak
2385,Stylish but smelly room.,30,July 2013,"The hotel is nicely designed and looks good in photos but does not reward close attention.

Our room was on newly finished 5th floor facing ocean. Only it was not really finished. A gap between top of sliding balcony doors and the wall meant noise, Mosquitos and heat could easily come pay a visit.

The room is spacious and stylish but was marred by a sewage smell from toilet and very noisy aircon.

If the room was cheaper (we paid about US$140) then I'd be less fussy.

Breakfast and the rooftop pool were highlights.",U Paasha Seminyak
2386,Not off to the Best Start,20,July 2013,"I frequently travel to Bali and was so excited for my stay here,
the exterior, entrance, lobby and pool was most definitely beautiful and the location was prime.

However, they seem to be lacking in a lot, mainly in customer service, the staff were not very friendly and seemed uninterested, not often was i greeted with a smile.

The shower was horrible, dirty, grimy and smelt terrible.

Air-conditioning was very noisy, it was hard to sleep comfortably.

Room service was awfully slow, just under an hour for 2 pieces of toast.

Transportation was very hard to arrange, i booked a return airport transfer prior to my stay (3 weeks out) and on the eve of flying i re-confirmed transfer, nothing was arranged and it took over 2 hours to be sorted.

Can't make local calls from the bedroom, and international calls have to be made at reception.
Wifi was very slow.

Save yourself the stress and $60 per night, stay at the Amadea Hotel 50m down the road :)",U Paasha Seminyak
2387,New hotel with a great location,40,July 2013,"Stayed here in July with my partner as a last minute trip to Bali. We have stayed many times before in seminyak but due to the last minute couldn't get in to our usual place.
The hotel is new as it was just built 3-4 months ago - which you can tell. There's still things that aren't finished and not quite right.
Rooms are big and clean. Unfortunately we had no view and were looking at the building next door.
The location is ideal if you want to shop and walk everywhere. Not really walking distance to the beach but amongst the Main Street of seminyak shops and restaurants.
Staff are not quite there sadly although very friendly when asked for recommendations on spas, where to purchase things and restaurants they were very confused and did not recommend well.
All up its a nice hotel but probably 3.5-4 star quality.",U Paasha Seminyak
2388,Could be better,10,July 2013,"I read the reviews for this hotel on TripAdvisor and could not wait to arrive.
When we arrived we was so happy as the main reception area was just beautiful.
We had to wait a long time for our room even though we had booked it one week before. Staff was not very apologetic about this.
Our room was backed onto another hotel and the noise from the other hotel was bad. It was noise coming from the staff that worked at the hotel. It looked as though it was the staff quarters of next doors hotel.
We had the anytime breakfast option and every single time we ordered during our 7 night stay our breakfast order was never right.
There is not much privacy from the bathroom it is all open plan with only a glass door on the toilet.
Rooms are nice and big.
Pool area and bar is beautiful.
Location is good but Seminyak is not cheap compared with kuta.",U Paasha Seminyak
2389,"U Paasha - new hotel, great rooftop pool, comfortable beds",50,July 2013,"U Paasha

Our family of five stayed in two rooms in July 2013 with the Hotel being opened for about two months. The rooms are very large with plenty of space. The hotel is modern in appearance and the staff is very friendly, with many staff remembering me by name after a few days which was nice. The highlight is the rooftop pool, it's very relaxing to sit on the comfortable lounges and enjoy the sunshine. While we were there they had happy hour from 5pm to 8pm with two for one drinks which we took advantage of 3-4 times. A couple of times we stayed on the rooftop and enjoyed the excellent BBQ which was 95,000 Rupiah or about US$13 with tax and service and it was great quality. Breakfast Buffet was also great with Omlettes, Waffles, bacon, sausages, etc They also served good coffee included in the price - I took a double shot espresso and later a double shot latte and they were nice. Most importantly, the beds are very comfortable, with a nice, soft top layer.

In nearby Seminyak be sure to visit PotatoHead for a great chill out experience, food and drinks and a pool on the beach. The road that the Hotel is on is quite busy with many shops and restaurants to choose from. Seminyak square was only 200m away and offered some more shops and restaurants. The beach is about 15 minutes walk but I don't see the point in going to the beach with the fantastic roof top pool. Kuta was only 15-20 minutes in a cab that cost a paltry US$5 and we squeezed all five in the little cab.

The Hotel also arranged a comfortable van and driver for eight hours of touring, ""Peter Jackson"" was a friendly driver who showed us around. The fee for this was a very acceptable 800,000 Rupiah or about US$90. Airport transfers also were great value at around US$30.

WIFI was free and OK, not fast, not slow and it worked in the hotel rooms and on the rooftop and breakfast areas.

Note extra bed charges for a third bed.

All in all a lot to recommend this modern and new hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2390,"Smelly, Noisy, 3 rooms in 24hrs!",20,July 2013,"We had seen all the great reviews for this place, so were really disappointed when it didnt live up to the hype and ended up with three rooms in 24hrs! The first room we were given (322) smelt of damp which the management said was an issue they had with drainage but were not apologetic about it at all. However the main problem with this room was the noise from the building next door. we tolerated it until midnight and then finally called and asked to be moved. About an hour later and after i had to go downstairs to follow up they finally moved us. They moved us to 233 which was on the other side of the hotel (seminyak side) which solved the noise problem and this room did not smell.

However the next day we went out only to come back to find water leaking from the electrical light fittings and over the toilet, so again we asked to be moved. We packed up out stuff and spoke to the manager and he said something would be done and there was a room on the 5th floor. When we got back from dinner at 11pm expecting it to be taken care of no one knew anything about it and we had to go through the whole thing again with another member of staff.

THh new room 505 also stank of damp as did all the bedding, to the point where we were spraying them with deodorant just to try and sleep. By this stage we were bored of complaining.

All in all they did not seem concerned with our issues or willing to compensate us for the issues, originally we were offered 2 cocktails before they did offer us 15% of two nights, which i still dont htink is good enough considering the frustration caused during most of our short stay.

Further to this they also booked us on a tour telling us it would be $54 US dollars only to get out to Noosa Doa and be told it was actually $150 US Dollars!!

Breakfast is an average buffet, which was sometimes cold and uninspiring, in contrast to the ala carte breakfast we had head at our previous hotel

The positive is the foyer is amazing as is the pool bar and the new bar downstairs called Albi is stunning.

I would recommend people looked into IZE prior to committing to U Paasha, our stay there was far superior and welcoming and the hotel is just as new.

We will definitely not be back",U Paasha Seminyak
2391,Excellent hotel which has it all!,50,July 2013,This new hotel (new in May 2013) has it all. With friendly staff to well equipt rooms and stable wifi this surly must be one of the top choices in the heart of Saminyak. The breakfast buffet is enjoyable with very good and variable food. A hotel which is comparable to the high scandinavian hotel standards is my final compliment. Thanks for a memorable stay!,U Paasha Seminyak
2392,Modern hotel but with issues...,20,July 2013,"The hotel is located in one of the most busiest streets in Seminyak and surrounded by good restaurants. Stylish, spacious rooms, large tv screen and fluffy towels. It could be a perfect holiday but as soon as I entered into room 203 I felt a sewage smell coming from aircon and bathroom. I requested to exchange room and the staff provided room 201 wich was better but after the aircon ran for hours I woke up in the middle of the night and could not sleep because of the same smell problem. I requested to exchange room again and after waiting for long time my daughter and I were moved to room 219 where there was no odour problem but the water pressure was awfully low and we took 40 minutes to get showered. It seems my son was was luckier than us on room 217. Although modern be aware of eventual odours coming from bathroom because of its ""open space"" design. There is no privacy during shower since the glass door is completely transparent. Not convenient when travelling with friend. They offer limited choices for breakfast and there is not even a simple selection of cheese.
The pool area is small but clean and with comfy lounge chairs. The view from poolh is not that great.
The idea of changing rooms several times was not what I had planned for holiday and definitely I will not be back to this hotel again. I prefer staying at Nikko in Nusa Dua where activities and food choices are plenty for people of all ages.",U Paasha Seminyak
2393,A Bargain,40,July 2013,"The moment we stepped into the room, an unpleasant sewer smell greeted us. This seemed to be a problem from what I have seen from comments of previous guests. We traced it to the drainage system in the shower and toilet partitions. The staff brought up some aroma oil and a burner which helped a bit. Too lazy to change rooms as we had a lot of baggage, we decided to hang on for 5 days. We did discover that the smell was evident in some parts of the hotel. For a new hotel, this is a huge disappointment. If this problem is fixed, this place would have been awesome!

Other annoyances:
Our choice of hand soap was not provided even though it was offered upon arrival.
Local calls could not be made directly from the hotel room even though there were instructions on how to do it on the in-room phone. Instead, the call was routed to the concierge who politely told us that this facility was not ready yet and they will transfer and connect the call.

Now for the good part. The staff were very friendly and courteous, even the security who would greet you with welcoming smiles. We also got help at the front desk due to language issues. We made a lot of calls, but the staff were very attentive and patient. The rooftop pool was a nice place to hang out. We didn't spend much time there but wish that we could!

Overall, this place is good value if you are fortunate enough to get a room without the smell!",U Paasha Seminyak
2394,New hotel with great location,40,July 2013,"New modern hotel right in the middle of Seminyak, directly only Jalan Kayu Aya (Laksmana) with great restaurants literally across the road and only a five minute walk to Seminyak Square.

My room was large with a very comfortable bed (probably the best I've experienced in Bali), big screen TV with a good range of channels, in room wifi and decent sized bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the place was spotlessly clean.

A few teething problems being a new place, the Internet wasn't the fastest (even by Bali standards) and the drainage in the shower was poor but nothing that can't be fixed. I should note that the hotel provided feedback that both are being worked on.

The laundry service is somewhat overpriced for Bali, save yourself and walk to the nearest laundry, about a tenth of the price. The food and drink was also a bit on the high side in my opinion, which is a real shame particularly on the roof top bar which was a great location with views all over Seminyak and Kuta.

I'd certainly consider staying here again if the price was right.",U Paasha Seminyak
2395,"At first I went ""WOW"" and then it got better!",50,July 2013,"This is one of the truly best hotels I have stayed in Seminyak. From the grandiose lobby to the wide open spaces, the large and tastefully decorated rooms, the amenities and the great service this hotel offers just makes the stay fantastic. I will definitely stay at U Paasha again on my next trip to Bali.",U Paasha Seminyak
2396,Upaasha Seminyak Bali,50,July 2013,"Just stayed at this place, great rooms, very clean and modern style, great staff, great breakfast, love the roof top pool view. Great parking for your car or motorbike. Love that the check in time can be used as your check out time. So if you check in at 2pm then that is when you can check out. I had the single bedroom with a king size bed. The room and bathroom were very spacious. 42 inch plasma screen tv with pay tv, nice ipod doc for music.",U Paasha Seminyak
2397,Hip hotel and stylish,40,July 2013,"U Paasha was our first hotel after landing in the evening with my teenage daughter. Very hip and stylish decor so loved the ambience of the place. Staff were more than happy to bend over backwards to assist you but sometimes the English language barrier can be a bit awkward as you feel you are not being understood occasionally in the reception area. (I guess I should learn to speak Indonesian if I'm in their country) Very happy with the price we paid with the hotel. I did leave a letter for them with a few minor tips that would make the rooms a bit more user friendly for a traveler. (lack of ironing board in room as I don't like to always call room service for everything, the one australian electrical plug was not in an easily spotted location in the far corner of the room near the floor at the side of a desk. Maybe a big notice next to the desk to indicate so I don't have to call and bother them, and one other minor detail, a soap dish for the wet soap for reuse (or liquid soap) rather than back in the wooden box where it gets stuck.)
I found the pool quite chilly, it felt about 25degrees C in the heat of the day (July) and most of the time it's too windy on the rooftop for umbrellas so you have to rely on a hat. A fixed shade part would be fab for people like me. The rooftop needs some people to make it more fun to visit in the evening. It's was bit of a ghost-town when we visited, but hey, that's not a criticism on the hotel.
I think this hotel was stylish in it's design and very, very nice indeed. Highly recommend this hotel for Seminyak. Smack bang on 'eat street.'
We only stayed for 3 days as we wanted to experience other hotels for fun.",U Paasha Seminyak
2398,"Nice, but not for me....",40,July 2013,"I don't want to be the first to write anything but a glowing report on U Paasha, not sure if it's the hotel itself or my personal taste, but it wasn't really for me I have to say...... We didn't get off to a good start when the pre booked and confirmed airport transfer didn't show up. Not ideal at 11pm, single woman travelling with a child.

We had to move rooms a couple of times as there was always something not right. A terrible smell came out of the air con in our 1st room, moved to another where the smell was only a little better but a water leak coming from above outside our door on the 'balcony' meant it looked and sounded like it was raining all the time. Last room had a drip or some ticking noise in the air con but I couldn't bear to ask to be moved again - just turned it off and opened the door.

House keeping was a bit hit and miss. Some days room was made up within 5 minutes of you exiting, others (the days you needed it with a sick child) I had to ask 3 times over 3 hours.

Should have known that by the lack of photos that the 'balcony' would have been pretty much unusable. It's 2 foot wide only housing the air conditioner unit and a dead pot plant.

The price was great, but I think the quality and attention to detail is reflected in that price. The decor is lovely, but somehow already looks a little worn in areas when the hotel is brand new. The crisp white bed linen and soft towels are beautiful. Staff are lovely, as is always the case in Bali. We found the choice of food pretty limited and not great at all - luckily it's across the road from Cafe Bali.

I travel to Bali alot and have stayed in many & varied styles and prices of accommodation, so I am certainly not hotel precious, but something just wasn't right about U Paasha for me. Sorry U Paasha, I know you tried, but something just didn't work for me..... I would recommend it for short stays where you are out all the time and just need a nice room to sleep in (provided the air con doesn't smell) or a business trip. Not for extended stays with a child if you want to eat at the hotel.",U Paasha Seminyak
2399,Perfect Stay,50,July 2013,"It was after much of a research and i managed to chance upon U Paasha @ Seminyak. Usually, the pictures on the website would defer after you had seen the real thing but U Paasha delivered what they promised!

Their team:
I booked 1 night stay through Agoda but to my dismay, it is the wrong date. So I wrote in to the Reservation Manager, Harry Nurbito. He was so nice to change the booking date for me and i decided to stay another night with U Paasha. I am also able to choose the type of soap, tea and pillow for my stay which i feel add a personal touch to what the norm hotel have to offer.

Their Room:
I stayed at 3rd floor, Room 322. Room is SPACIOUS and CLEAN! In the room, they have two huge resting sofa, the pillows and bed are very much comfortable, i feel that the huge bed will be able to hold up to a family of four. Thou on the first night, the a/c went off and the lights flickered but upon calling the front desk, they were knocking on my door within minutes. Wifi in the room was very very strong. They have DVD Player upon request and docking for your iphone and ipad. Room are available to stay 24 hours, which is a plus plus point to me as I checked in at 5pm on the first night and as my flight is at 8pm on the last day, I'm able to freshen up before i make my way to the airport.

To reiterate how they go the extra mile for their guest, breakfast are provided to all guest till 11pm daily at anywhere in the hotel compound.

Their location:
U Paasha is located at the stretch of Laksmana, which is a busy street, be it in the morning or at night. I feel is good for solo traveler like me. Just opposite U Paasha, Ultimo Restaurant serve the most delicious italian food (& cheap!) with valet parking (be prepare to queue, if you are there after 7pm). If you love authentic Balinese food, just opposite as well, Warung Murah, which i feel their Nasi Goreng is excellent and cheap as well! The hotel is also within a stone's throw away from Potato Head Club and Ku De Ta. Along the hotel itself, there are loads of designers' shops selling from apparels, bags and shoes. If you are looking at getting a painting, along Laksmana, there are a few excellent quality gallery for your buy.

Overall, U Paasha is definitely the place to stay when you're are Seminyak. My next Bali trip, i will not hesitate to make a booking with U Paasha.",U Paasha Seminyak
2400,"Beautiful, luxurious new hotel - did not want to leave!",50,June 2013,"Booked a last minute package trip to Bali through Expedia before starting a new job, and chose U Paasha after a lot of deliberation. I had never been to Bali before and was travelling solo so decided to please myself on the location etc! Even though U Paasha is a new hotel,so had very few reviews compared to some of the other accommodation options in Seminyak, the reviews that were available were glowing and the hotel looked really good online. I was so happy with my choice. The lobby area was really unique, upon arrival just after 11pm, I was greeted warmly by staff at reception and given a nice cold towel to refresh myself. I was given a choice of soaps and escorted to my room. WOW! The suite was huge, and about 1/2 the size of my 3 bedroom apartment in Sydney! Huge comfy king size bed, mattress and pillows were so comfy that if I hadn't been in Bali, I don't think I'd have wanted to leave the bed! The next morning I went for the inclusive breakfast which was really good - the free wifi in the hotel is strongest in the lobby and restaurant areas so a good opportunity to check emails/plan your day while having breakfast. The restaurant staff were fantastic - very friendly, efficient and polite - nothing was too much trouble. They did not forget my name from the first morning to the end of my trip which was impressive given the hotel was fully booked at times! A special mention to Rini and Eris who looked after me so well during the trip. Breakfast is served in the restaurant 7am - 10am but I believe you can order it to have in your room or by the pool at other times. After breakfast, I went to the roof top pool which was just amazing, so serene and peaceful given that the hotel is in a busy area, you would never know whilst lying by the pool! Comfy loungers, the staff there were fantastic too bringing towels, opening umbrellas etc. I had lunch by the pool 2 or 3 days, they had a reasonable menu (sandwiches, burgers, fries etc - around $8 AUD) so rather than leave the luxury of the pool for lunch, I got it delivered to my lounger!
I ate in the restaurant two nights, and was the only person there on both occasions - maybe given the fact that I was on holidays solo and found it more comfortable to eat at the hotel, but the steak , dessert, cocktails and service was all fantastic.

Location wise - as I had never been to bali, i was unsure of where to stay, but the location was perfect - 200m walk to Seminyak Square shopping area, with lots of restaurants and shops directly on the street outside. I walked quite a bit around Seminyak but cabs were always available within a minute directly outside the hotel on the street. Because the hotel is so new, alot of cab drivers did not know where it was - so I found it easier to say Seminyak Square when returning to the hotel.

I found a fantastic spa on a walk one day, about a 5 min cab ride or 20 minute walk away from the hotel called the Sundari Day Spa. I had a 3 hour package and it was to die for. Up there with some of the 5 star spas I've visited in Dubai and the U.S! Very reasonably priced and i even bought some massage oil and face products to bring home with me.
Also, upon recommendations from friends prior to my trip, I went to visit 2nd Skin leather shop (close to Semara resort and Potato Head) where I had a beautiful leather jacket made. Was very pleased with this.

Overall, I had a fantastic trip, my only regret was that I only had 5 nights at the hotel and in Bali! I will definitely be back to U Paasha on my next trip. Thank you to the wonderful staff!",U Paasha Seminyak
2401,Little hiccups,40,June 2013,"Lovely hotel, was everything the pictures on the website promised. Generally satisfied with my stay except for a few small grouses. Firstly, the wifi in the room was not working, to my great disappointment. I had been planning to do some research on places to eat and visit while in Seminyak, arriving armed with a list of recommendations, but was unable to do so. The wifi in the lobby was supposed to be working, but I was unable to connect most of the time. Wifi in the room was one of the main factors I considered when I was choosing a hotel, so I was quite bummed about this. Secondly, the bathroom design, though beautifully minimalist, lacked a simple shelf for placing toiletries. We ended up putting all our bottles on the floor. And we were puzzled as to why they toilet door was frosted but not the one to the shower. Not very convenient when you're not travelling as a couple. And lastly, even though a big deal was made out of having us choose our favorite soaps when checking in, none of our soap choices materialized over our 3-night stay. This was more amusing to us than anything so we just left it. Overall, the staff were really friendly and helpful, breakfast was delicious (killer croissants!) and we had a good stay.",U Paasha Seminyak
2402,"Loved it, all of it",50,June 2013,"I stumbled on to U Paasha Seminyak by chance after scouring the Internet for a place to stay, and I'm so glad I found it! The service was five star. The hotel is amazing. The beds were incredibly comfortable, I had the best sleep I've had in months. We had a wonderful stay here and I would definitely recommend it.",U Paasha Seminyak
2403,"Great location, great accommodation, great service!",50,July 2013,"Nicely appointed rooms-with great large beds, great bathrooms, good brealfast, great location. Great checkin/checkout. Rooftop pool is great, make sure you have breakfast on the roof during your stay! Recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
2404,Perfect location,50,June 2013,"The location of U Paasha is perfect, near Seminyak square , in eat street.Walking distance to Mamasan, 15 minutes walk to Potato Head.Service fantastic, room huge, roof top pool and bar fantastic, with some of the best views in Seminyak.Great concept with breaky anywhere and anytime.Would definitely recommend to everyone.Evan if not staying here , the roof top bar is a must at sunset",U Paasha Seminyak
2405,Room with a view,50,June 2013,"The foyer is magnificent marriage of contemporary and Asian design, spacious and modern. The reception service amazing, matching my cheap online-gained price, when I extended my stay. I liked that I got to choose the soap type for my room, a lovely touch. The room is huge, with glass walled toilet and shower, loved it. I only had one small complaint, and that was my emperor king coil bed was a little too hard for me, but that comes down to personal taste. The gym has a great view over over Seminyak and beyond on the 5th floor, with state of the art equipment. The pool is on the roof, with palm trees and magic sunrises and sunsets, and is open 24 hours. The attendants bring all sorts of things during the day, from fruit to cold wet towels...just perfect. I liked the breakfast, simple and fresh. The coffee was amazing, and the restaurant won me from there on. I think the best thing at UPaasha is the ability to check out 24 hrs post the time you check in, giving versatility. Really LOVED staying here, close to many of my fav eateries and an easy walk to minimarts. I will definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2406,Highly recommend!,50,June 2013,"U Paasha was perfect for my 3 night Seminyak stop over. Traveling on my own, I wanted something safe and central and foun exactly this at U Paasha, as well as incredible service (they learn your name), beautiful large rooms and a stunning rooftop pool. The hotel is located right in the middle of the Seminyak boutique shopping strip, within walking distance to the beach and surrounded by great restaurants and bars. I will definitely stay here again!",U Paasha Seminyak
2407,Great Location and Customer Service,50,June 2013,"The customer service in this place is phenomenal, they really went out of their way to make me feel welcome. You get two free drinks when you check in, the room itself was incredibly spacious (I didn't have a view, but that wasn't important), and they provide a free breakfast wherever you want in the hotel - I chose to have mine in my hotel room. The breakfast itself wasn't the best in the world, but it was free, so whatever. The female manager in particular was incredibly helpful, and her English was very good. They do have 24 hour stays, which I really enjoyed as I had a flight the next day at an otherwise awkward time. The location is also very central to Seminyak, with easy access to minimarts and more importantly, souvenir shops, and is right next to a restaurant where they have fire dancing displays and decent cheap food. Overall, I loved it, and I would stay here again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2408,Fantastic,50,June 2013,"The hotel is great and it is quite new. Location is not too bad and it is just opposite Bali Cafe (great value for money).
The king size bed can sleep 2 adults and 2 young kids which is great. Some savings already.
The roof top pool view is fantastic too as it overlook Seminyak town and the sea.
The staffs are very helpful and nice! Kudos to them!! I will definitely stay there again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2409,I love it,50,June 2013,"Nice and comfortable spacious room, no check in and check out time, can choose movies from DVD player, can have breakfast anywhere,at anytime until 11pm,and its delicious too! man i love this hotel! Friendly staff they have, and one more thing, the acoustic band (True Calling Band) on rooftop near swimming pool is awesome! they play songs their ways, unique, easy listening and relaxing, yeaa!!
And plus, the location is strategic, you are close to any high end entertainment in Bali such as Huu Bar, potato head , mint and many more, and ofcourse nice fancy restaurants or delicious local foods. Pheww. love it!!",U Paasha Seminyak
2410,A Rare Find in Bali-Seminyak,50,May 2013,"Stayed here with a friend just to getaway for the weekend and instead found a hidden gem in Seminyak. Little did I realize that I would find my weekend to be so relaxing and peaceful yet located in such a convenient area such as Seminyak.
The room was humongous! Toilet was spacious and cool choices of amenities given to you when you check in. The service was super friendly and attentive! A very important point for me as I always hated to have to wave to staffs to get their attention.
Had breakfast and dinner at Al Cove. For breakfast, more variety choices would have been great. But food quality was good. For dinner, tried the Cheeseburger, Miso Glazed Gindara and Upaasha mocktail. Burger was JUICY! A good find where nowadays burgers were mostly dry and just a burger. Gindara was lovely but slightly too sweet. Beverage was top notch and innovative.
All in all, for tourists or people staying in Bali,you should at least drop in and stay there at least once. With their Uncomplicated motto, this place offers the best flexibility a hotel can give. 24 hour check in/ check out and breakfast at anytime, anywhere!!! And I haven't found any other hotel with this unique concept. It is a MUST TRY!",U Paasha Seminyak
2411,Best hotel in Bali so far,50,May 2013,"We were only suppose to stay here for one night, and ended up spending the rest of our stay (total of 9 days). This hotel was the best we'd experienced after traveling around Bali for 3 weeks. We arrived when they had a soft opening. Their grand opening is sometime in august. What struck me was that they took this really serious and really eager to get customer feeydback to improve the quality of their hotel experience.

They deliver top service - everyone who work there is kind and realy wants you to have a good time. As an example, we were treated with complementary poolside dishes - the waiter wanted to know wether or not we liked their new dishes. Wow!!

The service would sometimes be ""too good"". The waiters would come pick up your used dishes only seconds after you finished your meal after breakfast I'm guessing thats going to change once they open for full, and get a packed hotel.

The rooms are VERY clean and nice. They also make sure to clean it really thorough, even occasionally dropping by to make sure you have new towels. Perfect!

We had a great stay - recommend this to everyone as it is located in the best place in Bali!!

PS: The 5th floor pool is awesome!",U Paasha Seminyak
2412,Spacious rooms and what a great rooftop pool!,50,June 2013,"Read about this unique concept hotel and decided to give it a try. Found out later that they barely opened a couple of months ago!

This hotel is all-suite and has a unique concept of 24-hour stay - you check out the same time you check in! Fabulous! Also interestingly, they offer breakfast at any time and anywhere you like, so as I was only there for one night with an early flight the next day, I opted for breakfast in bed, which was really great. Only grouse with the breakfast was it did not come with coffee/tea.. but the food was delicious and more than sufficient.

Rooms were spacious and beds were comfortable with good linen. Design was a tad minimalistic but everything seems to be clean and neat. Service by all staff were great, and they were helpful and very efficient.

The rooftop pool won the prize for me. A large rooftop deck with a good sized pool and plenty of deck chairs to tan and watch the sunset.. that is just what holidays are made of.",U Paasha Seminyak
2413,Great place in centre of Seminyak,50,June 2013,"After ten days in a great villa we decided to stay four days longer, as we were having such a great time. The checkin was fast and the Reception manager went out of her way to help me contact the airline to rebook our flight home. Great, friendly service. Rooms are large and clean. Bed great. The pool and bar on the roof are terrific with the friendliest staff making superb cocktails. The restaurant food was good with friendly staff. Very. A great place to stay right in the middle of Seminyak near everything.",U Paasha Seminyak
2414,Loved it,50,June 2013,"We only spent 1 night here but wish we spent more. The architecture of the hotel is breathtaking. The rooms are spotless and super roomy, the AC is amazing! The staff are all so helpful and lovely like most of the balinese. We loved it will definitely recommend ...",U Paasha Seminyak
2415,an experience,40,June 2013,"Spent one night here and definitely impressed. The room is spacious and clean. Complete in room facilities and great bathroom amenities. It's just the shower has clear glass door, which make bath time a bit awkward when you travel with a friend.

The rooftop pool area is a nice place to hangout and surely for sunbathing in the middle of chic Seminyak.
The hotel has a good location, in Seminyak main road, close by to restaurants and shops.

One plus point that no other hotels offer is the maximize timing for the hotel guests. Whatever time you checked in, that's your checked out time.

Food is so so, unfortunately.

Parking, basement only, so don't be shocked to find out that you are thoroughly being checked by hotel security staff who might thought you're hotel staff.

But overall, the hotel is nice and recommended.",U Paasha Seminyak
2416,A Must Stay Place in Bali,50,May 2013,"My friend recommended this hotel to me as I was looking for a relaxing weekend getaway yet still having options to access the convenience of food and entertainment. I wasn't expecting anything WOW when I heard about this place but I was impressed instantly when I walked in to the hotel: amazing design at the lobby, super friendly staff (especially the security staff, very friendly) and fast and trouble-free check in. upon checking in, I was asked to choose selections of bar soap, my kind of music and also DVDs. The receptionist escorted me to my room, still very in love with the interior design, and as I enter the room, I was very pleased with the fact that the room is HUGE!! this is rare for city hotel these days, It's big and yet very comfortable and the bathroom is huge too, the size of the room can be easily divided into 2-3 city hotel's room these days. The rest of my stay was excellent from that point on, visited the roof top pool that afternoon, beautiful view and great pool. The breakfast was fantastic, although bigger variety would make it even more fantastic and I also tried dinning in their restaurant Al Cove, great food especially the Honey Glace Gindara and the Cheesecake beverage. Anyway, It's a very recommended place to stay if you are visiting Bali and another things is, you check out at what time you checked in so it's really 24 hours stay time. I will definitely come back again.",U Paasha Seminyak
2417,The ultimate indulgent stay at reasonable prices,50,June 2013,I spent three nights at U Paasha and was so impressed with the whole Hotel. This brand new hotel means that the whole building is spotless as well as immaculate communal areas. The rooftop pool is the ultimate sun trap which allows you to enjoy the Bali soon - coupled with the absolute best customer service I have ever experienced means that the U Paasha is hard to beat. Special mention to the staff who made us feel spoiled and showed dedication to customer service throughout. Thank you so much!,U Paasha Seminyak

2421,Very nice experience!,50,May 2013,"The rooftop experience is very astonishing!! Wide space with big and nice pool completed with a very beautiful sunset view is something not to be missed when you are visiting Bali especially the Seminyak area.

The design and architecture of the hotel is really well planned from the building, interior, lighting, and furnitures. Five star!

I got a chance to have an elegant dinner at the Alcove Restaurant and it was fantastic!! Chocolate cheese cake is not only a cake there but also a drink and the taste was really good! The meals are high quality as well.

This hotel is absolutely recommended!",U Paasha Seminyak
