0,"Good location, average room",30,April 2023,"üôÇThe welcome was lovely, the breakfast was good, the pool was nice, the massage at spa was good too. The bed room is very spacious and the location is great. We stayed in a deluxe standard room on the 2nd floor.
‚òπÔ∏è We were overpowered by air freshner when we entered the room. I found a bag of freshner beads attached to the toilet and put them outside problem solved, the smell they were covering was better than the air freshner.
Our mattress was old and hard and so were the pillows, the duvet appeared thin and old too and there was a slight musty smell from a pillow and the duvet. The bed linen and towels were clean but the towels were discoloured. I thought the pool area looked a bit tired too.
We stayed here 4 years ago but sadly I don't think we will stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
1,Good but could do with some improvements,40,May 2023,"The hotel while being in the perfect location may not necessarily be the perfect hotel. The staff are very friendly and do their best when they can to help. I stayed in the 2 bedroom villa and the only complaint I can say about the villa was the shower heads had lime scale all over them and the slight smell of sewage came from the drain but didn‚Äôt last that long once the water of the shower started to flow. The villa itself was wonderful. The tiles are very slippery when wet so be very careful when getting out of the Villa pool. The breakfast of the hotel was ok. It had the basics of toast, eggs, fruit, cereal etc. other guests that came on the holiday with me stayed in other rooms and a few complaints and room changes due to rooms not being cleaned properly, showers smelling, the biggest issue was safes not working ( but that was mainly due to previous guests being dicks and locking the safe when they leave) but again that should be checked by the safe when a guest checks out.
Overall I would stay here again due to the price and location but the hotel itself needs some TLC.",Puri Saron Seminyak
2,Beach Hotel,40,May 2023,"This is my second stay a Puri Saron Hotel and this time I am very pleased. My room has a very nice balcony and a garden view. I love it. Thanks very much for accepting my request for this. I really appreciate it.
As for the employees I just can repeat again that everyone is very friendly, helpful and polite. Thank you for a lovely stay here. I will be back for sure.",Puri Saron Seminyak
3,Very close to the Seminyak Beach,40,April 2023,"Good experience, the hotel is a stone throw away from the buzzing Seminyak Beach. Would recommend for anyone on a budget. Food and hospitality met our expectations. There is a Circle K close by for any groceries which we found useful.",Puri Saron Seminyak
4,Definitely recommend,50,March 2023,"Have just left Puri Saron last week and cannot recommend enough . Our room down towards pool area was fabulous. Hotel is authentic old style and staff were the friendliest ever , Alit Merta the manager could not be more obliging . In a great position right on the beach ‚Ä¶ will definitely be staying again .",Puri Saron Seminyak
5,Relax all day,50,March 2023,The feeling of friendly comfort comes to mind whenever we come to stay at this hotel the staff at the hotel are so very welcoming the hotel location is second to none the food the amenities are exactly what you‚Äôre looking for for a relaxing time. Once again you have exceeded our expectations and we look forward to our return to Bali.,Puri Saron Seminyak
6,Another wonderful stay,50,March 2023,"An awsome stay once again. It had been 4 years since our last visit due to Covid restrictions. Once again The Puri Sarons' accomodation, staff and hospitality was first rate. The staff as always were extremely accommodating, nothing was too much trouble for them. Location is central to everything we needed and enjoy. Will definately be back again same time next year.

Thank you Puri Saron and Alit Merta for another wonderfully relaxing holiday.

Michelle and David (Aka Captain)",Puri Saron Seminyak
7,Another great experience,50,March 2023,Once again another fantastic stay was welcomed back with open arms staff are absolutely brilliant will do anything for you location is brilliant bars restaurants and beaches within minutes can't wait to get back to my second home miss the place and people so much,Puri Saron Seminyak
8,"Excellent value, great hotel",50,March 2023,"Excellent in every regard. Sure it's an older style hotel, but that's part of the charm. Amazing friendly staff. Huge rooms, amazing location. Walk to everything in Seminyak, or a short scooter ride.

Can't fault it!",Puri Saron Seminyak
9,"Tired, but very friendly.",30,January 2023,"Stayed here for 10 nights in January, booked a double room last year, on check in, we were told no double room only a twin, we said no, we wanted a double, so 1 night in the twin room then given a double room next to reception which was OK.
A few days later, water started running through ceiling above toilet, so we complained and ended up in what must be one of the best rooms, upstairs above restaurant.
I understand covid has been a contributer to no money, but really this hotel needs tidying up.
The pool is lovely, the barman too. Had a lovely massage which I'd highly recommended. The restaurant staff and reception staff very helpful.
The pool area toilet needs attention, tap broken, wall needs re plastering, bin needs replacing as broken for paper towels",Puri Saron Seminyak
10,"Old, tired hotel.",20,January 2023,"Where to start, the property is in desperate need of refurbishment. Although the room was clean, the room fridge was old, dirty and froze everything we put in it. The water pressure was poor for the shower. There are broken tiles everywhere inside and out, all the garden ornaments are crumbling/ dropping to pieces. The various fish ponds around the hotel are dirty (poor fish). The night receptionist was rude and inappropriate to my wife. I have read on here that this is not the first time that has happened. The rest of the staff have been very helpful and pleasant. They have been reduced from 150 staff to 70 so they are doing the best they can. The photos shown are probably from when it first opened and it looks nothing like that now. There are better places to stay, we will not be returning. On a separate note, the beach is quite dirty and polluted in this area. The authorities need to address this.",Puri Saron Seminyak
11,I was sexual assault by the front desk guy,10,December 2022,A guy name Budi at the concierge sexual assault me in bahasa indonesia. He wasn't aware that i am able to speak bahasa. He commented out loud to his colleagues about my boobs and look me in the eye. He is definitely aware 10 mins later i approach him for his name after speaking to him in bahasa indonesia. He ask me why. Which i guess he was stunned to know I'm able to speak bahasa. There wasn't any apology and i have not receive any email yet from Puri Saron Seminyak. That behaviour shouldn't be on a front desk greeting guest. I was feeling really destroyed leaving Bali with that remark. I hope this catch their eyes and reply my email.,Puri Saron Seminyak
12,Debating 3 or 4 stars.In need of upgrades but awesome location,30,November 2022,"We have just come back from Puri Saron in Seminyak.I must admit that we were underwhelmed when we first arrived with the room.The bathroom stunk and smelled like the septic was coming back up through the drains but it improved.The room was quite tired but the bed was comfortable and clean.The pillows smelled a bit of previous guests but the sheets were clean.We did have to ask for extra pillows as we only had one each but they were delivered immediately.The bathroom was very dated and the soap provided didnt clean you at all or lather up.Shampoos and other items were OK.The shower curtain was discoloured and had mould along the bottom of it.The water was hot and a good strength.The grounds are beautiful and situated right across the road from the beach and restaurants but the beach restaurants left a lot to be desired.Overpriced and poor food,Breakfasts in the hotel were good and the staff were fabulous.Pool was lovely and clean and plenty of day beds to be had.Swim up bar.We used the spa which is not something we usually do and had massages which were EXCELLENT and worth paying the $3AUD extra to be in a peaceful,clean spa.Very good massages and they had 30% off the prices so very happy.We didnt have any meals here as the kitchen didnt look to be busy at night but I am sure you could have.So from arriving and not being impressed we left saying we would definately stay here again.We warmed to it",Puri Saron Seminyak
13,all round great hotel,50,November 2022,"Stayed here for a week in November, could not fault anything. Older tyle of hotel, but rooms are huge, kept spotless clean. An excellent breakfast buffet that caters to everyone. And the location is just amazing, on the beach. And best of all a great mix of guests and age groups! And spa is excellent too, as is pool area.
Very good value for money, my new go to hotel for future trips!",Puri Saron Seminyak
14,"Very pleasant, close to the beach.",40,October 2022,This was a pleasant place for a stay. The restaurant was awesome with great range of foods. The pool and day spa were great. I stayed in the older part and it was fine. The staff were helpful but could not supply all I requested. Would take my own travel adapter next time. All good would go back.,Puri Saron Seminyak
15,Ticks all the boxes,50,September 2022,"You can‚Äôt beat Puri Saron because it really does tick all the boxes;
-prime central Seminyak location
-pool with swim up bar
-located on the edge of the beach so you walk out past the pool and you‚Äôre on the beach in the bean bag/ umbrella area
-lots of great eateries and bars in any direction around the hotel
-good shopping nearby (both markets type and boutiques)
-directly across the road from two marts, laundry shop, massage shop
-rooms have safes, hair driers, mini fridges, small mosquito repelling devices and air con
-very budget friendly
-buffet breakfast that has something for everyone (savoury dishes, fruit salad, egg station, pancake station)
Alit the Room Divisions Manager is wonderful, very accommodating and helped us get twin bedroom confirmations for all of our girl group.
I‚Äôve stayed here twice now and would recommend for couples and friend groups who are looking for a good base to go out and do day trips or keen to relax by the pool.",Puri Saron Seminyak
16,Great stay,50,September 2022,"This is my second time here, currently on our fifth day of a six night stay‚Ä¶would definitely recommend and stay again. We stayed in a twin room which was clean, roomy and bright apart from bathroom. Breakfast was substantial, options changed every day, the freshly cooked omelettes were delicious. Staff were friendly, attentive and accommodating. Location is brilliant, just a step away to beach restaurants and bars. There is construction work currently outside the hotel, but this looks like it will be finished soon. Overall, great value for money.",Puri Saron Seminyak
17,"Perfect location, requires some renovations",30,August 2022,"Location is great, right on double six beach which is perfect for sunset.
The gardens are gorgeous and creates a very relaxed traditional Balinese atmosphere.
Standard rooms are a bit old and dated, bright (bring you eye mask) and can be noisy in the mornings. Requires some renovations which is understandable given covid, would upgrade to a suite near the pool next time. Breakfast is average and the same every day.",Puri Saron Seminyak
18,First stay here but not our last,40,August 2022,"Great location, spacious room and varied plentiful buffet breakfasts. Unfortunately the advertised hotel shuttle is not currently operating but hopefully it will be re-established soon. Stayed here because our regular place was not accepting any more bookings. Feeling is that many places are short-staffed (same as in rest of the world post Covid). Most restaurants and shops are operational or in process of becoming operational (unlike Kuta where many businesses have closed permanently.) You will have a great time if you go with the moment and accept that yes, there are changes but the one thing that hasn't changed is the smile and friendliness you will receive from the Balinese - sempai jumpa (see you later).",Puri Saron Seminyak
19,Lovely staff. Very tired hotel,20,August 2022,"I have just spent three nights at this hotel, and this is my third visit. I wouldn‚Äôt come back again, this hotel is now in desperate need of some investment.

You don‚Äôt expect five star when you stay here because you don‚Äôt pay five star prices, and the staff are delightful. I had a nice room (once upon a time!) but it had many faults. The air conditioning unit drips constantly and has obviously done so for many years as the floor boards below it are warped. The stink from the toilet was unbearable at times and it stopped flushing completely the day after I arrived. This was fixed very quickly.

The shower head is on a bracket that isn‚Äôt adjustable so it sticks straight up, there is no way you could stand under it. Of course you can take it off the wall and hold it but a tiny bit of thought into how somebody would use it would have been appreciated. And the shower curtain was ripped and falling off. How much is a shower curtain?

A nice touch was the fruit plate on arrival, but I didn‚Äôt eat it and it was still there three days later, covered in ants.

The pool is lovely and clean, but every day they ran out of towels around midday so most people didn‚Äôt get one.

The breakfast is okay, the egg man is lovely and all the staff do their best to help.

I have absolutely no complaints about the staff at this hotel, but it is in desperate need of some renovation. If what you want is cheap and great location then this is a fabulous choice, but if you want everything to work, a clean room, the drains not to smell and a little bit of Balinese luxury, there are much better choices.",Puri Saron Seminyak
20,Bali Break,40,July 2022,"Check in was super quick, buffet breakfast sufficient, our room was spacious with garden and ocean view, unfortunately we had to change rooms due to no fault of the hotel but the constant LOUD music from the beach bars 4-6 pm every night, once we moved to a garden room it was a lot more peaceful, location is great but what really makes this place is the amazing staff",Puri Saron Seminyak
21,Beachfront Bliss,50,May 2022,"Beachfront Bliss

Back to Bali for the first time in 2 and a half years ! Yay ‚Ä¶

I wanted to embrace the feeling of Bali, and where better than front and centre at Puri Saron

I‚Äôve stayed here a few times between other visits that had me staying in friends beautiful villas but I wanted to remember what it felt like to be back.

Puri Saron feels like Bali

From the moment you drive up to the front steps you are greeted with that sense you have stepped back in time. A time when Bali‚Äôs hotels were uniquely Balinese .. Puri Saron is it .

The staff are always smiling and eager to make your stay special ‚Ä¶ as you walk through the foyer you then walk a path of tropical gardens that are brimming with colour.

The spacious pool area leads onto the beach where you can find many restaurants lining the beachfront with their festive umbrellas and beanbags ready for you to capture the gorgeous sunset ‚Ä¶

Pool days at Puri Saron are relaxing , and the staff are there with a smile if you needed anything.

Close to great shopping and spas,

Puri Saron is my kind of Beachfront Bliss üôèüèºüå∫üôèüèº
Thank you Alit and team for making our return to Bali , Perfect üå∫",Puri Saron Seminyak
22,NO SERVICES AVAILABLE SO YOU ARE ONLY PAYING TO SLEEP HERE!!!,10,April 2022,"We have stayed here quite a few times in the past (maybe 6 or 7 times) we came back to Bali after a long awaited holiday and choosing to stay here was a no-brainer as we have enjoyed our previous stays. BAD CHOICE.

THERE IS NOTHING AVAILABLE AT THIS HOTEL.
Nothing.
Just a really crap (but large) room with a leaking, stinking toilet.

Their website has no disclaimer letting people know that there are limited, or in this case, NO sevices available.

Their restaurant is closed and we were instead offered an in room breakfast with very poor offerings; 2 eggs (your way) on bread that pretended to be toast, a cardboard tasting fruit plate and dirty dish water tasting coffee.
There is no in room or sit down dining option, and the pool bar was shut - we were told at check-in (only after we enquired about it) that we could buy our own and drink it by the pool...hot Bintangs, yay.
The pool is open (and clean) with about 4 deck chairs with ripped and dirty covers on them.
We ended up using a pool in another hotel for 35k each that came with a free fruit juice.
They even cut the cable T.V and turned the water down so it dribbled out.

We paid FULL PRICE for a ""bungalow room"" that had the worst shower I've ever used. It was positioned directly in front of the restaurant that was only opened to local church groups that chanted really loudly (probably praying to get out of there like I was.) The left overs from one of these events were used for a buffet breakfast the following morning which I wasn't invited to attend but I just loaded my plate and sat down anyway.
I was prepared to get Bali belly just so I felt like I got SOMETHING for my money.

The staff are lovely; of which their are many although I'm not too sure why when there was literally 2 other people staying at the hotel the entire time we were there? Regardless, it's not their fault they work for scammers.

I assume they will open at least partial services at some point, but I actually don't care.
I won't be back.

To the Manager: I understand that the pandemic has decimated this island, but covid has affected everyone in the world in one way or another. You people weren't the only ones to lose their jobs and/or loved ones but being deceitful to your loyal paying customers will not help you ""rebuild.""
Don't bother replying with your cut and paste response, I don't care. You know exactly what you are doing.",Puri Saron Seminyak
23,Excellent Hotel and fantastic stay,50,August 2020,"We went to celebrate there (Bali) for our pre new year holidays. A fantastic resort with all facilities , friendly staff right in front of the beach in a good location with great restaurants & bars. Surely will stay again & again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
24,Always a pleasure,50,March 2020,Once again I went to see my second family we got stuck with this terrible thats going on the management and staff could not have been any better in the way they helped us please visit you wont be sorry I've been going to bali for over 20 years and the greeting I get is that I have never left cant wait to back at this fantastic hotel.,Puri Saron Seminyak
25,Ian knights,50,March 2020,What another fantastic stay at this gorgeous hotel staff so friendly and helpful with everything nothing is to much can't wait to be back there a lot of work has been going on in the last year and it's now better then ever.,Puri Saron Seminyak
26,Puri Saron visit March 2020,50,March 2020,"Back again at our home away from home. Still lovely to see the same faces and the same friendly staff. Our room had been updated since our last visit with a lick of new paint, bathroom fittings updated and TV area enhanced with a cabinet.
The whole resort had undergone slight but noticeable changes to the gardens which freshened the look.
Only thing I would suggest is that more sun umbrellas are added to the pool area and the existing umbrellas are updated.
I sincerely hope that Bali survives this current health and economic crisis and that we can return soon.",Puri Saron Seminyak
27,Great little resort,40,March 2020,"My partner and I stayed at the Puri Saron for 8 days in March 2020. What a little gem it is. The staff are amazing and so friendly, and give lots of tips and information. Nothing is too much trouble.

The rooms are a little old, and to be honest could do with a bit of a makeover but they are clean and the beds are very comfortable.

The breakfast is nice but again could do with an update also. A bit more variety would be nice, but that‚Äôs just a personal preference. We had a dinner and a lunch at the resorts restaurant and both were nice.

Overall the resort is lovely and the gardens are very pretty and well maintained. The location is great as the beach is so close and shops and restaurants are just around the corner. We will definitely visit again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
28,From Pool to Surf,50,March 2020,"Took a short break and found Puri Saron
What a great place
The amenities staff and service I‚Äôve got to say are second to none
The fact that you can also get out of the pool walk 20 metres and your on the beach is for me a major plus
Add to that that La Planche is also right out front then you know you‚Äôve got a great place to stay
Will definitely be returning",Puri Saron Seminyak
29,Morgan,40,February 2020,"Great hotel close to beach
Swim up bar in pool with friendly staff
Grounds well tendered and food delicious and affordable
Value for money and manager Alit is capable and friendly
If your after a relaxing holiday Puri Saron is the place to stay",Puri Saron Seminyak
30,Good,40,March 2020,"We stay in Bali quite alot so have stayed in around 12 different hotels over the past few years. This one we quite liked! For the relatively cheap price as opposed to Mandira etc it's a great balance.

The facilities were good, breakfast ok (not a giant choice but that's why it's relatively affordable) good pool etc.

The type of patronage is generally good ie: not many lower socio types. Some people did tend to just sit drinking all day in the pool bar and not once did I notice them get out to go to the toilet if you know what I mean.. But you get that anywhere there's a swim up bar.

The Hotel is basically at La Plancha! So a World class attraction literally metres from the hotel. Good location, good staff, good feel is the main thing I enjoyed. Nice well kept gardens

Good place to stay for pretty well any type of holiday really",Puri Saron Seminyak
31,Favorite hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2020,"After coming here for 2 years, the hotel staff has become like our second family ‚ù§
The location is perfect with the beach only across the road,rooms are wonderfull, food has a wide selection with different daily specials, swim-up bar is to die for and the list goes on and on.
We love this place and we will continue coming back here every time we are in Bali!!!!

Jason & Egita",Puri Saron Seminyak
32,The perfect spot in Seminyak,50,March 2020,"First time stay at Puri Saron and it was beautiful with graceful and quite Balinese style ambience. The location is awesome, just across a small road to the beach and the busy, full of fun, afternoon Seminyak beach sunset beach bars. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool is beautiful and big enough to allow everyone their space, the swim up bar is a must for a couple of refreshing afternoon ales! Definitely stay here again and highly recommend.",Puri Saron Seminyak
33,Another 50th Birthday party,30,February 2020,"We too where staying at Puri Saron with a group of 20 for a friends 50th birthday. The grounds, rooms, location and room service cannot be faulted. The staff where always friendly. On day 1 the poolside bar ran out of spirits and on day 2 ran out of Bintang Radler beer none of which was restocked for our entire 7 day stay despite numerous requests from our group. This left people to drink the more expensive cocktails or as we did go across to the supermarket and buy our drinks and bring them back which I might add they where only to happy to put on ice and serve to us. The bar staff where constantly fishing bees out of the cocktail mixers which found their way in through the open pourers which didnt make them very appealing either. Then the restraurant and poolside kiosk ran out of certain foods advertised and again these where never restocked either. Very poor management the hotel lost out on a lot of money as our group ate and drank eleswhere.",Puri Saron Seminyak
34,Nice hotel,50,February 2020,"I stayed in this hotel 7 years ago and this time decide to stay here for few days. There are several categories of the rooms, I highly recommend Villa. Friendly staff and very beautiful Villa. Floating breakfast was amazing! Thanks for that!",Puri Saron Seminyak
35,50th Birthday celebrations at Puri Saron,50,February 2020,"We stayed at Puri Saron for my birthday along with 26 of our guests. The hotel is older than most around the area, but the Balinese style and gardens were gorgeous. It's tranquil and has a mix of different tourists. The swim-up pool was used and abused by us and the cocktails prices reasonable, and they have happy hours and various events each day that quests can join in. The location was fantastic, close to everything. All the staff were excellent and went out of the way to help in any way. A special thanks to Gede Alit Merta, you were terrific. I will come back here next time in Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
36,Puri Saron best service by far,50,February 2020,"We came on a get away, and tried this resort, we have been to Bali many times and the location is perfect. Every single staff member, from gardeners to security were amazing. The staff were continually ensuring we were ok and even going above and beyond expectations, following up on different conversations. Best place we have stayed in ages, we will be back for sure.",Puri Saron Seminyak
37,Beautiful place lovely staff,50,February 2020,This hotel is right on the beach. Its also walking distance to shops restaurants. The rooms are spacious and bathrooms shower were clean and nice. Breakfast was lovely. Pool clean and lovely had a swim up bar it was really handy. All the staff in the hotel were really friendly especially this lovely lady called Rai she was so kind and helpful we met at reception. We will be coming back to stay here again.,Puri Saron Seminyak
38,BEAUTIFUL AND VALUE FOR MONEY,50,February 2020,"We took a deluxe room in a chalet type accommodation. Excellent reception to this place right from the reception desk to the actual room. Welcome drink non arrival and bouquet of flowers and fruit in the room. Fresh bottled water daily. Private swimming pool and exotic sunbed for relaxing. the hotel has an excellent bar area and really large public swimming pool for guests. Exciting was floating breakfasts for IR300000
the back entrance is a 2 minute walk to the beach. one of the best beaches. warm friendly staff. Excellent buffet breakfasts. highly recommend",Puri Saron Seminyak
39,Good Spot,40,May 2019,"Loved the pool swim up bar and the location - right by the beach and La Plancha. Our room was clean, The food was good. Breakfast was nice. Great cocktails and the staff were friendly. I would stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
40,Oasis in the Middle of Seminyak/Kuta Bali,50,January 2020,"We ended up picking this hotel because of the reviews.
We weren‚Äôt disappointed!!
Right from our check in process to the Rooms to the Dining room. Normally we have found the prices at the resort hotels higher than the surroundings but it was the opposite here with Amazing service from all staff including check in.
Special thanks to Mr. Alit and his team as well as the breakfast and dining staff Wei Weit, Priska, and trainee Sayu who
truly care about their guests.
The grounds are immaculate and face the beach. But far enough distance to be Not be bothered by traffic noise or loud party noise from the beach.
The beach was warm and safe.
The pool is amazing.
Great vacation.",Puri Saron Seminyak
41,True Bali authenic experience and hospitality,50,January 2020,"Great location an service, very hospitable and friendly staff especially Wiwik.
Room service and extention of check out hours were accommodating and flexible.
Will definitely return and highly recommend it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
42,Super friendly and helpful Staff! Great atmosphere and awesome location!,50,January 2020,"Just got back from staying at the Puri Saron for 8 nights. The staff were extremely kind and helpful. They upgraded us for free to a Deluxe Chalet and then we experienced an issue with the toilet in that room they discounted the rate and we upgraded to a Deluxe Superior Room. They were very gracious and kind about this and the bellboy was extremely friendly and helpful and refused to let me carry
My bag even though we moved rooms a few times. Throughout our stay we were always greeted by all staff members with warm smiles and hellos. There was security at both the front entrance and beach entrance so you always felt safe. The pool bar staff were great and always played song requests and had smiles on their faces. The pool had a fantastic atmosphere! The hotel is a traditional Bali style hotel and whilst some rooms are a little dated the staff, facilities & location make up for this. On our last day we left for the airport only to find out our flight was delayed 6 hrs. So we hopped back into a taxi and headed back to the hotel hoping to leave our bags for a few hours. We were blown away when they let us check back into our room as they said checkout wasn‚Äôt till 12pm & then on top of that let us stay in the room until 2pm free of charge. They had already cleaned our room & still let us go back in. The manager personally came out to chat to us and we were very very grateful for this as we were both feeling unwell so were very appreciative to be able to check back into a room. If you‚Äôre after warm Balinese hospitality this is a great pick for a hotel!",Puri Saron Seminyak
43,In need of a total upgrade,20,January 2020,"This is the fourth time I have stayed at the Puri Saron and the place has gone down hill.
Great location with the beach at the back but that it all. There is not enough lighting in the bathroom to put your makeup on. Breakfast is supposed to be served from 6-10 but on two occasions we went early due to going on tours you couldn‚Äôt get hot food, once was at 6.40am. Also sent at 9.40am and nearly everything was empty, couldn‚Äôt even get a glass for juice. We ended up having breakfast out most days even though it was included in the room because the choice was very limited.
The air conditioning in our room kept on leaking and by the last day the bathrooom smelt like sewerage from the smell coming out of the drains.
You can hear the music from the beach when trying to go to sleep if you are early to go to bed.
I would not stay there again unless they spend some money on the place",Puri Saron Seminyak
44,Great location and hotel,50,December 2019,"I stayed here for 2 nights over New Years Eve. From the beginning until the end of my stay, the staff were just wonderful. Always a welcoming smile and hello from all that passed you. Happy to organise your trip. They just made the stay easy and fun. The location is just fantastic. Right by the beach and walking distance to shops and restaurants. There's even a free shuttle to Kuta if you like. New Years Eve on the beach was fantastic with all the fireworks going off everywhere. The rooms were lovely. Can't complain about a thing. Would book there again without hesitation.",Puri Saron Seminyak
45,Bad service,10,December 2019,"This hotel is old and need a total renovation. This hotel has no soul and no creativity at all. Poor service, poor bathroom functions like poor working taps, no water pressure and hardly any hot water. Breakfast was very much below standart of a star hotel in Bali. The only nice place was the Italian pizza restaurant Warung Bola, which was not even part of the hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
46,Nice location,50,November 2019,"The resort was nice. Rooms were neat and clean. Very close to the the market. It's a beach property.

Negative
The restaurant have a very limited food.
Swimming pool was not every clean.
The food menu at the hotel was expensive.",Puri Saron Seminyak

Great service in all aspects.
Will go back again",Puri Saron Seminyak

50,Surprisingly Lovely hotel right in the beach!,50,January 2020,"After several emails asking for payment via a ‚Äòlink‚Äô even though booking.com had my credit card details, I was wondering if it was a ‚Äòphantom‚Äô hotel, glad to say it is real and although dated, it has nice rooms, friendly staff, lovely pool, garden, breakfast area & is kept clean and tidy and good value for money too!",Puri Saron Seminyak
51,Great Location,50,September 2019,This hotel was lovely! It is a large property extending from the beach a long way back to the street frontage on the other side. On checking in we were upgraded to a better room at no extra charge which was on the second floor overlooking a peaceful garden area. The room was large and had a large ensuite as well. The facilities were great and loved the pool with a swim up bar. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. A beautiful western breakfast was included in the restaurant and we found the staff there to be delightful. A great location for walks along the beach or through to Seminyak or Legian. Would definitely stay here again.,Puri Saron Seminyak
52,Happy holiday,50,December 2019,"We stayed for four weeks at this hotel and had a fantastic holiday - mainly due to the staff being so friendly and helpful. great location by the beach, local shops across the road and bars and restaurants easy walking. Highly recomend",Puri Saron Seminyak
53,Good and bad,40,December 2019,"We stayed for 6 nights and had 2 rooms between 4 adults. 6 nights in December. Perfect location for young families with small children, couples and young adults. Plenty of restaurants in the area but the hotel food is excellent too. Staff and customer service couldn't be faulted.

My only problem is the room we had 1112 had a musty smell the entire stay which got worse through the night. Not sure if it was from the bathroom or the noisy old air conditioner.The room was dark and in need of extra lighting. However, our sons had the room next door 1114, no musty smell, the room was light and bright. Both rooms were large with spacious bathrooms and ours had a very comfy king size bed. These rooms were on the ground level with a courtyard.

We will stay again at this property",Puri Saron Seminyak
54,Little gem,50,August 2019,"Love this hotel. Traditional Bali hotel in a great location opposite the beach and beach restaurants away from the busy streets. The rooms are clean, spacious, the beds are comfortable, very quiet and private. It has great pool with swim up bar, good food and the staff are amazing. I have stayed here many times and look forward to staying here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
55,Attention by management would lift the property!,30,December 2019,"We stayed 2 nights at Puri Saron on transfer north.  The hotel is well located on the edge of Seminyak towards Legian and across one road from the beach with beach clubs, other hotels and local restaurants adjacent.

To be fair Puri Saron is an ageing property but one that is still comfortable in its own skin. The property is generally maintained and the garden is a credit to the many staff involved.  However in our room the door to the fridge ""cupboard"" was damaged and the rain head in the shower/bath didn't work. During a stoem the air vent above the toilet deposited a heap of gunk on the seat and floor.

There is a largish pool complex built around a swim-up bar with space for the littlies and another for older kids.  During the day a small grill bar is also open near the pool and a pizza bar (perhaps privately run) nestles at the rear of the property (besides the road).

Our room was upstairs not far from reception (and quite a walk to breakfast and the pool).  The room was large as was the bathroom with a tiled floor throughout complete with aircon and a good sized tv.  Most furniture was either built in situ (cement) or built in, a dated concept.  The bed was a genuine king size and very comfortable with good reading lights.  Outside on the balcony were seats to sit out.  Towel rails or hooks (presently neither) would improve the bathroom.

Breakfast satisfied our requirements (with juice, fresh fruit (great papaya), cereal, toast and pastries, hot choices complete with an egg station with tea/coffee) but might have had more generous dishes with a couple more choices replenished more frequently.  Disappointingly, on our first day the muesli appeared stale as were the croissants!  Proper supervision would have noted the criossants were sub standard! Not nearly good enough.

So whilst you were aware of the age of the property and it was satisfactory to our needs and the pricepoint, improvements could be undertaken with minimal cost to achieve great improvements

Like most Bali destinations our stay at Puri Saron was made complete by the pleasant, polite and efficient staff particularly the housekeepers, gardeners and restaurant staff.  Thanks to all.",Puri Saron Seminyak
56,Wonderful stay,50,December 2019,"We stayed at Puri Saron for 6 nights.. The swimming pool with swim up bar was fantastic.. Very friendly staff, clean rooms.. Lovely breakfast which differed slightly every morning.. I'll definitely stay here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
57,Perfect stay -again,50,December 2019,"Puri Saron, located right on the beach at Seminyak, has the perfect location, beautiful gardens, nicely appointed rooms, fabulous breakfast and friendly, charming staff.
We‚Äôve stayed here many times, highly recommend this property, and will certainly be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
58,A very nice hotel for holidays or business,50,December 2019,"Puri Saron Seminyak is a real gem! The view from the outside is particularly inviting, and when stepping through the main doors, you are immediately struck by the beautiful, marbled reception area. Light and airy, and very spacious - very welcoming. The staff throughout the hotel were very professional, friendly and extremely helpful. The breakfasts were amazing, a wonderful selection, and again, the staff were very efficient and helpful in making the breakfast times enjoyable. The location of the hotel is great - right in the middle of most attractions, which are within walking distance. The room I had was very spacious and well equipped with all essentials. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to visitors to Bali. Thank you Puri Saron Seminyak for making my stay so special.",Puri Saron Seminyak
59,Nice hotel for couples and families with great service and kind employees,40,November 2019,"We stayed 3 weeks in this hotel and was of all the hotels we have stayed in, the most pleasant so far. The staff and employees are very kind and helpful. We really felt at home. The initial room that was booked for us was at the third floor and because of a severe accident prior to my holyday it was not convenient for me to walk 6 stairs all of the time. Without any arguments the hotel room manager gave us a bungalow room upgrade at ground level at no extra charge!

The rooms are clean and beds are good, in the other comments I read that they are dated, and they are here and there. We have stayed in very expensive hotel rooms and they are not perfect as well.

The hotel is situated directly near the beach and just separated by a small street. On the beach is plenty of entertainment, bars, restaurants etc.

The hotel garden is neatly decorated with ornaments, ponds and a large swimming pool. The bar in the pool offers a variety of drinks, cocktails and delicious food at reasonable prizes.

We had an excellent buffet breakfast in the morning with European and Indonesian food, fruit‚Äôs and serials. At wish you can have a variety of fresh baked eggs, pancakes or French toast.

The hotel is very quiet at night, and we did not experience any soundly party guests.

We will surely return to this hotel next year!",Puri Saron Seminyak
60,Excellent,50,November 2019,Amazing service and good people very helpful .. clean room.. hotel just in front of the beach and in the center of Seminyak .. location perfect... my son Amir really enjoy ...food so tasty... thank you so much,Puri Saron Seminyak
61,Bali trip Aug 2018,40,December 2018,"Love,love,love Puri Saron Seminyak.
Great hotel, great staff, great pool area and excellent position right on the beach. Close to everything you could want.
Stayed here lots of times and also tried some other places, but always end up coming back here because we miss it so much.
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, some of which have become dear friends. Looking forward to coming back in Aug 2020. Booked already!",Puri Saron Seminyak
62,Puri Saron Seminyak,50,September 2019,"Great place to stay, loved our breakfast and dinners at the restaurant. Rooms and surrounding gardens are lovely. Alit and his staff were wonderful they couldn't do enough for us, Alit was always on hand for a chat and make sure everyone was enjoying themselves. This was our second stay there and we would go back there in a flash.",Puri Saron Seminyak
63,Puri Saron Seminyak,50,September 2019,Puri Saron has become our home away from home. The Manager and staff are like family to us. It‚Äôs a good sign when the same staff are there year after year. This stay was our sixth consecutive visit and we plan to stay there again next time. Clean safe rooms. Trustworthy staff. Great central beach front location. Excellent hotel restaurant. We‚Äôre very happy to keep coming back to Alit and his team.,Puri Saron Seminyak

67,Relaxing stay,50,November 2019,"We found Puri Saron to be very well located, right on the beach with lots of nearby shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself had a great pool and a magnificent shade tree to park yourself under for a read in the shade. Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a very relaxed feel about the whole place. This helped by the garden setting and the old Balinese presentation. Highly recommended for a relaxed stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
68,Home Away from Home,50,November 2019,"What can I say about this hotel.... I have lost count on how many times I have stayed here, the staff make sure they go out of their way to take care of you and make your stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. The pool bar is the best place to hang out or if you want the beach it is right their in front of you. It is located in an amazing area so close to everything. I have never stayed there and left anything other than totally relaxed and feeling sorry to leave. If you want to be treated like royalty then you can‚Äôt go wrong.",Puri Saron Seminyak
69,Room 1117 - 5 night stay,30,October 2019,"Sadly the hotel only gets an average from me. My biggest issue was the internet. At times I needed it for work back at home but tbh it was non existent in my room for the whole stay. I had to go sit by the pool at 10pm in the night loads of times due to the time difference back at home. I complained twice but couldn‚Äôt seem to get it through that it was the signal from the hotel and not my phone as i had 3 devices and none were picking up signal.

The breakfast was ok, it had all the standard buffets breakfast options that you expect from a hotel.

There were 2 restaurants I noticed and a BBQ stall to order food during the day time. I only ate at the BBQ and the food was good.

The room it‚Äôs self was basic but comfortable and it was cleaned every day. Although it was a little early in the mornings.

The hotel had a party at the pool during one of the nights and posted a letter under our door saying it may be loud and they hope i will be understanding. As it happens I was woken up about 10 times that night by noisy drunken people outside my room. But other nights it was quiet.

The location is right on the double six beach and there are a few nice restaurants within 2 minutes walk but all the more desirable places are about a 30 minute walk or ¬£2 in a taxi.

The grounds are kept in perfect condition all the time and the staff all work hard.

There‚Äôs nothing massively wrong with this hotel but the WiFi was a huge issue for me.",Puri Saron Seminyak
70,Return visit very pleasing,40,November 2019,"On a return visit to Puri Saron, we found renovations and improved customer care.
The rooms are bright and clean
A welcome plate of fruit was a lovely touch.
We were also invited to the complementary Thursday afternoon tea for ‚Äúspecial guests‚Äù, as returning customers, we were invited.
The afternoon tea was delicious and the staff used this opportunity to chat and mingle in a more connected way, including the general manager.

The location is of course excellent, right on the beach and close to all that Seminyak has to offer.

We have had many Hotel buffet breakfasts in Bali....this one was the best for fresh, hot, and different everyday.

Definitely will stay here again next year.",Puri Saron Seminyak
71,Experience,50,November 2019,The staff at Puri Sharon made our trip memorable. From the moment you step onto the property and until you leave they are making sure everything is to your satisfaction.

72,Customer service at its best,50,November 2019,"5/5-Resort had everything we needed.

76,Great Location,40,October 2019,"i recently stayed at Puri Saron. The hotel has a fantastic breakfast with a good selection and is good quality food. The evening dining was good and value for money. We had complimentary afternoon tea which was very enjoyable and some staff members did a traditional dance which was lovely to watch. and a pizza. One night a week the hotel hold a dinner with entertainment near for pool $25aud which is good value for money. A very nice pool and bar with plenty of sun lounges also nice gardens. I do think the bath towels and some of the linen could be replaced. My bed was to hard for me but of course that varies with peoples preference, i think mattress toppers would be a good idea on request but staff did everything to make me as comfortable as possible which was very much appreciated. The location is excellent with the beach across the road also restaurant, bars and close to shops. the hotel runs a free shuttle service into Kuta. All the staff were excellent, ready to help and very friendly. A big thank you to Juni from reception she was amazing always there to help in anyway she could a credit to the hotel as is Juneady from housekeeping I can't thank him enough when I needed his help he was there. i would recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing stay and is close to a variety of interests and the amazing staff.",Puri Saron Seminyak

The hotel boasts a great restaurant and a pool with swim up bar, very tidy and clean rooms. If something is not right, report it immediately and it gets fixed.

The staff are the best, especially Wiwik Hermawati, Sasmitha Putri and of course Alit Merta.
Our every whim was catered for and they went the extra mile to help.
A big thankyou to management and staff for the cakes and gifts, well wishes and of course to Arik, our room attendant for making beautiful decorations for our bed.

The room was basic, very clean, cold aircon, clean sheets and towels, had tea/coffee station and a mini fridge too. The grounds are immaculate. The staff are lovely, the location is excellent. Rear exit to right you can walk via beach to Seminyak square. La Plancha is to the right also. There is a huge selection of beach bars and restaurants and everything is within walking distance. It is older style but we loved it. The pool area is great, swim up bar and cold beer and cocktails. Lovely BLT and fries for $5.

84,Puri Saron - Pure Bliss,50,October 2019,"We have just spent 2 weeks at this beautiful hotel in a perfect location right on Double Six beach. There are many shops and restaurants all within walking distance from the hotel.
The staff at this hotel go out of their way to make you feel at home. Everyone always has a greeting and smile for you. Nothing was ever too much trouble for any of the staff.
Two members of the staff namely Juni, Guest Relations Manager and Wiwiki always stopped to have a chat and enquire how things were for us. We really appreciated the friendliness and attention from all the staff but Juni and Wiwiki in particular were fantastic people and a pleasure to talk to.
This is a great hotel in the perfect location. But what makes this hotel really great are the staff.
Highly recommended.*****",Puri Saron Seminyak
85,Bruce Jordan,50,October 2019,"Staying in Villa 5 awesome spot
30m to the beach and restaurants.
Own private pool is magnificent as are Alit and staff.
Nothing is too much trouble.
Would highly recommend Puri Saron to anyone.
The rooms are neat tidy and airy and the gardens are beautifully manicured.
A wet bar in the pool makes predinner drinks great fun.
I will be staying here again for sure.",Puri Saron Seminyak
86,Excellent,50,October 2019,Stayed in a 1 bedroom villa. Location right on the beach. Alit and his staff are fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and everybody was extremely friendly. The floating breakfast was fantastic and a great way to start your day in Bali. I have stayed elsewhere in Bali however will be returning here again without hesitation. Great location and great facilities. Highly recommended.,Puri Saron Seminyak
87,Wonderful,50,October 2019,"Can not fault this hotel. Great staff run by Alit and his team. Stayed in a 1 bedroom pool villa, clean modern and very well appointed. Have stayed in a few places in Seminyak, this hotel is the vest by far. The Birthday cake a wonderful surprise.",Puri Saron Seminyak
88,Tired,30,October 2019,"We stayed in a super deluxe room and I must say the only deluxe aspect was the location to the pool and beach.
The room was very tired, damaged tiles around the bath, bath drain wouldn‚Äôt drain bath, shower was not the best.
3 .5 star
Dining area was lacking cutlery on each table, very strange. 4 place setting with forks missing on two places. Food acceptable.
Nice pool, shame the statues around the pool were crumbling beyond recognition.
Grounds staff have made the grounds look pleasant, well done.
Other than location to beach I probably wouldn‚Äôt stay here again.
Check in was 2pm, turned up around 2-30 or 2-45pm and room wasn‚Äôt ready. Waited another hour for room to become available. Disappointing",Puri Saron Seminyak

91,Pleasantly Surprised,50,September 2019,"We recently stayed at Puri Saron with 2 other couples and had a fantastic time. I don‚Äôt think there is one thing I could complain about. The location is fantastic, right on the beach, without being hugely overpriced. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel completely at home. The staff were amazing, especially, Wiwik (probably spelt wrong). She was so warm and friendly and greeted us by name every time she saw us and would have a quick chat. The front desk staff were also lovely and had upgraded us on arrival. The pool staff were so much fun, very jovial and relaxed. Our rooms were always serviced and always clean. The breakfast had many different foods to choose from, one being, crepes, which was very popular. We would definitely stay at Puri Saron again. 100%.",Puri Saron Seminyak
92,Chilled Out,50,September 2019,"We enjoyed sitting on the veranda amongst the lovely, well kept manicured gardens. Great location for a family or friends holiday away from the hustle n bustle of the beach street. But close enough to enjoy the beautiful sunsets and beach ambience. Deluxe suites featured very spacious bathrooms n king single beds!! Accommodating staff met our needs and were very friendly and welcoming as they had remembered us from a previous visit!! BBQ shack was a highlight especially the Satays and Spring Rolls- quick, delicious food!! Good variety of buffet breakfast food to start our Bali day!! Was lovely to be invited to afternoon tea on the Thursday!!",Puri Saron Seminyak

94,Best value Hotel in Seminyak!,50,October 2019,"This beautiful hotel right on the beach front at Seminyak would have to be one of the most relaxing well located and best value for money hotels I have ever stayed at. I have travelled extensively experiencing accommodation at all star levels. The staff here are polite, super friendly and always ready to accommodate your wishes. After 4 return visits we do not look for alternatives. While it is older with a 'colonial ' style, it is quiet, free of the brass and glass pretensciousness of new quadruple the price resorts that are often full of noisy 'bogans' . If you are looking for a superbly located hotel for your lover, family and friends, that is spacious with beautiful gardens then try this spot. You wont regret it! Chips : Australia",Puri Saron Seminyak
95,Family trip,50,September 2019,The staff really make you feel at home here... we had a fabulous stay for two weeks they could not be more accommodating to our needs replaced our family together and there was 10 of us ! the hospitality staff are happy to put tables for us outside and book any reservations we required. Alit and staff congratulations on another wonderful holiday.,Puri Saron Seminyak
96,"Thankyou, Puri Saron!!",40,September 2019,"We have recently spent 5nights at Puri Saron in a ground floor Bungalow/Deluxe Chalet. This is an older style hotel, with beautiful gardens & pleasant pool area overlooking the beach. After reading some negative reviews, we were not sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised. Our room was large & cleaned to a high standard every day. Staff & guests were friendly. Breakfast was adequate & had plenty of choices. We will stay again for the price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
97,Extremely disappointing!,10,September 2019,"We booked Puri Saron as a beachfront hotel with hopefully average to nice rooms for a budget part of our Honeymoon and we were SO disappointed. The room was extremely small and cave-like, smelt mouldy and damp and the doors didn't even close properly, leaving us feeling very unsafe as the room was on the ground floor and the door led right out to the courtyard. The pool and grounds were unkept-looking, breakfast was dismal and the service was terrible. The hotel was also extremely loud with lots of people constantly yelling and screaming in the courtyard area, which most rooms seem to be located on. The rooms closer to the front might've been quieter, but there was also a convention when we were there and that area was also packed and loud, even late at night. Overall we were so disappointed that we got up the next day and after exploring the hotel further, decided to abandon our reservation for three nights and move to another hotel. Would never go back and would not recommend this as a place to stay in Seminyak. There are SO many better places to stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
98,Warm welcome,50,September 2019,"I was really impressed with the hotel, the staff treated me so well, and gave me a really warm welcome, i immediately felt comfortable, sometimes when you travel alone you can easily feel lost, but this hotel made sure i had the best time and helped me with everything i needed. Great rooms too, clean and exactly what i was looking for.",Puri Saron Seminyak
99,"Large room, quiet, easy access to beach",40,September 2019,"The room was very comfortable. Breakfast service was very good; good variety too. The grounds and service were very nice, lovely. The only issue, and one I had read about, was the tap water. It is very hard and has a bad taste You have to use bottled water to brush teeth, which I do anyway. Other than that, which others had mentioned in their reviews, this hotel was great. I would definitely stay here again. But note that upon check in, they want to see the actual print out confirmation. I showed them our confirmation in my email but they requested I forward that email to them. Not sure why seeing the confirmation wasn‚Äôt good enough. A desk manager over ruled that request. But it was a little odd.",Puri Saron Seminyak
100,Traditional Bali Style,40,September 2019,"We selected this hotel to get away from the more westernised style of resorts popping up around Bali. Low set buildings, pool which actually is in the sun and best of all, 20 metres from the beach. Staff here are very friendly, the rooms are comfortable and I think we will be staying again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
101,"Friendly staff, good location but Old Hotel with that needs updating, lots of European Students!",20,August 2019,"Staff were friendly and very polite.Hotel is well positioned near beach but needs updating.Bed was hard and bathroom taps were rusty.
We paid $50 extra per night for a junior suite,total waste of money as the room pictures were not the room provided,we had a communal patio area with no privacy.Be careful what you book!We were told the hotel was busy and that room wasn't available but they had taken the supplement already.
Also,there is a hotel being built next door...very noisey when near the pool.
The hotel is regularly used by European students,Scandinavians were polite,Germans not so and the French were rather rude,took over the pool area!
Breakfast was average,best thing was the fresh cooked eggs and toast you made yourself, The spa was very expensive and next to noisey pool so didn't use it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
102,Ms Kiona Willis,40,August 2019,"The staff at Puri Saron are wonderful, always greeting with a smile and going that extra mile for visitors.

The hotel itself is stunning, fishponds everywhere, manicured grounds, swim up bar, huge pool. The breakfast at a hotel is a big deal for us & Puri Saron might be the best we've tried yet. In addition to full hot & cold buffet, the chefs will also whip you up pancakes, eggs any way or omlettes on request! Good location to walk to shops or beaches. Most of all, the staff are genuinely caring, kind & delightful. Special thanks to Wiwik for making sure we knew about all the activities (don't miss fridays balinese dancing), remembering our names & always ensuring we were happy. Arik for his lovely smile & keeping our room clean enough to do surgery in. Finally special thanks to Juni at front desk for her gracious help when we accidentally broke a key! We will definitely be back!",Puri Saron Seminyak
105,Amazing hotel,50,July 2019,We stayed at the puri Saron for about 4nights.. the rooms are decent and spacious.. amazing hospitality received by the management. The staff are too friendly and helpful. Breakfast is amazing too.. I loved the beach.. especially waking up at 6 in the morning and having morning walks there.. at nights we used to chill at la plancha.. amazing vibes. I would definitely come back to this hotel again !! Thanks,Puri Saron Seminyak
106,Underwhelming,30,May 2019,"Old and outdated, the garden area by the pool is overgrown. Pool bar faces the west so it's too hot to sit at to enjoy an afternoon beverage. The throw cushions on the bed smelt really bad, as did the rest of the room. The cushions on the pool chairs were filthy. We had to ask for the breakfast buffet to be replenished on more than one occassion. The staff just weren't on the ball. This place has so much potential to be amazing, but it just isn't.

The only thing that we enjoyed was the location and the BBQ by the pool.

Overall a really disappointing experience.",Puri Saron Seminyak
107,Bali bliss,50,August 2019,Once again at the Puri Saron. The staff greet us with wonderful smiles. It‚Äôs is so relaxing and within reach of plenty of eateries. The ocean in right there with it‚Äôs refreshing breezes. One can do a lot or nothing at all. Each guest is treated with respect and care. Will we come again..... of course!,Puri Saron Seminyak
108,Third Holiday,50,July 2019,"Puri Saron is a great place to stay. With buffet breakfast, beach and swim up bar. The staff are helpful and rooms are comfortable. If our baby grandson cried they came to the rescue. Well recommended.",Puri Saron Seminyak
109,The pool was great!,30,June 2019,"We were taken to our room near the pool only to find it hidden behind a brick wall. It had slippery tiles which I fell over on when coming from the pool. My partner fell in the bathroom that night on the tiles. I cried in the bathroom as this was NOT the room I saw on the brochure. We were moved upstairs where there was wooden like laminated floors. The shower had to be turned on 10 mins to get hot water and it literally trickled from the shower head. Our friends whom we booked our rooms together were in a room with no bath which gave them a bigger area. I asked and was told that they had the only room with no bath üò≥. All the rooms have a different layout which to me is rubbish as you are booking a room the same as the brochure. It DEFINITELY needs a major overhaul and replace the pillows with decent ones. I had to pay after my first night for a neck massage as I had done my neck!
On a plus side the pool was great, the staff very friendly but we will not be back!",Puri Saron Seminyak
110,Average at best!,30,June 2019,"What you see is not what you get! We upgraded to a Super Deluxe room. Disappointing resort - the room was dirty, the sheets were stained, the bathroom smelt of sewage.
If you book this suite, ask for the room with the balcony! It's the best room they have!
Despite being warned by our friends, we still went ahead and tried the breakfast. It was awful! They have limited stations, nothing was fresh, and the two boys at the egg station had no idea what a fried egg was. Hence to say we went for breakfast every morning elsewhere, despite having this included in our package.
Unfortunately the lovely view of the beach from the balcony, and the friendly and kind staff are not enough for us to ever want to come back to this resort. I would rather pay more for a 5 star and feel safe knowing everything is clean, sanitised and hygienic.",Puri Saron Seminyak
111,Five Star Stay,50,June 2019,The staff in this hotel including the amazing manager made our first trip to Seminyak and absolute fiver star experience. The location was perfect food was gorgeous and the pool area was lovely and large with a swim up bar. We had a lovely private villa so we could use both areas. Thank you we will be back :-) Marina and Alistair,Puri Saron Seminyak
112,Great stay ...... again,50,May 2019,"Second visit to Puri Saron and once again it was great. Staff were fabulous, grounds immaculate, pool clean with fresh towels available and buffet breakfast was lovely with great choices.
We noticed a few things had been updated since previous visit which is good.
People say it‚Äôs ‚Äúdated‚Äù but if you‚Äôre looking for modern there‚Äôs plenty of other places to stay !!!
Bedding and towels were changed as requested and we love that we were able to leave our phones charging and no fear of anything being stolen.
We could also arrived prior to checkin and could leave our luggage locked safely to allow us to wander Seminyak
Location is great to our favourite shops and restaurants and right near Double 6 and La Plancha to watch the sunset
My only complaint would be that the bathroom needed a bit of an extra clean but this is minor in the whole scheme of a holiday.
Great value for money and will be back again in 2020",Puri Saron Seminyak
113,Tired and dated,30,June 2019,"This motel has so much potential to be great. Location is perfect, right on the beach with good restaurants out front and a short walk to shops.
Unfortunately, it needs a lot of renovations in the rooms and outside buildings. Our room had multiple electrical issues which staff rectified. The biggest bugbear was the water supply for bath, shower and sink is salt water (desalination broken?) And we often had no hot water. Food was fair. The pool was good with fresh towels supplied daily.
Bed was comfortable and clean but the rooms are old and dated requiring modernizing, especially the tiles and lighting. Wifi was good and so are the staff.
With a bit of effort in sprucing this hotel up, it could be so much better.",Puri Saron Seminyak
114,thanks again Puri Saron,40,May 2019,"Thanks again Puri Saron for another lovely stay, Special thanks to Alit for his help with our booking and assisting with the change to a Villa.
This time we stayed in our usual bungalo but decided to go to a villa for our last few nights. Both rooms were great. Breakfast was lovely and has improved since our last visit. The poolbar was fab as usual. Love this hotel and the close proximity to the beach warangs and great reasurants that are all within walking distance.",Puri Saron Seminyak
115,Great location,40,June 2019,"My second visit to Puri Saron ...... everything is pretty good here .... love the satays around the pool area .... staff are friendly the only bad service this time was the service in the restaurant during the day ... ie wanted a coffee one day & another day a cocktail & a bit later lunch & every time we had to walk up to the bar to get the attention of one of the 8 staff standing behind it talking...... amazing really that they see straight through you!
Great location!
Bathrooms are looking pretty old though ... on the surface they look great just don‚Äôt look too closely. Also not sure what they mop the tiles with in the rooms but they are slimy & slippery when wet or the weather is humid!
I requested the same room as I had 2 years ago 1103.....& that seemed a real battle to get & quite a few emails when I was told on checkout to request it & all would be fine ...... funny what they tell you when you‚Äôre across the reception desk in person! I want to book 2 rooms next July 2020.... Room numbers 1108 /1110 .... be interesting to see what happens this time!!!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
116,Fabulous Location and amazing Resort,40,May 2019,"This Resort is awesome. The property and gardens are amazing. The pool is absolutely fabulous. Staff in all areas are so friendly and always smiling and willing to help. The location is perfect opposite the beach and close to everything. The beds are so comfortable, however the bathrooms do need a complete renovation, although very clean they are very old. Highly recommend this Resort and would definitely stay here again without hesitation ‚ù§Ô∏è",Puri Saron Seminyak
117,Rooms are old,20,June 2019,"We booked 3 deluxe rooms for 1 night. Whilst the room is spacious, the floor is sticky, the room smell damp and the bathroom needs a major facelift. Something was wrong with the tap water as it taste salty and muddy. Our hair felt sticky after washing and brushing teeth was hard. We complained and we request for more mineral water to wash our face. We learned that it problem has been ongoing for the past 2 weeks or so. Also the bed was not very comfortable.
The garden and the pool was well maintained and looked beautiful. Breakfast was very good with Western and local varieties. The staff from the reception, restaurant, housekeeping to concierge were very polite and helpful. Location wise, the beach and La Plancha was just 2 min walk away. Potato Head Beach about 25 min by taxi. Shops were 10-15 min walk out and quiet a distance. One of the highlight was the 10 min free massage. It was one of our most relaxing massage in Bali. Overall, I don't think we will come back as we prefer a more central location.",Puri Saron Seminyak
118,Great location!,40,June 2019,"Location - 2 min walk to the beach from within the property and 10 min walk to the main street.

Rooms - as described by them, neat and clean bathrooms.

Food - good options for breakfast, also they have a pizza place within the property.

Staff - smiling and helpful.

Good value for money hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
119,Old and horrid,10,June 2019,"This place may have been something 10 years ago but sadly it is now old dirty and horris. The rooms gave several dodgy problems including the wiring and plumbing.
The bed was OK but creeky and pillows made me think twice about actually putting my head on them.

Breakfast is western food mostly, which can be fine but the basic table settings are not clean. :(

Salt water in all taps and pool. This means you can not make a coffee in you room and brushing teeth in salt water is gross. Soap will not come off you skin in salt water making the shower irrelivant.

Positives, the pool is OK. Double 6 beach is right outside. Nothing else.

I would not stay here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
120,Another great stay,50,May 2019,"So third time we stayed here and again puri still ticks all the boxes , stayed for 8 nights from the 7th May , pool still good , so we stayed at two other resorts as well puri was our first stop , breakfast at the puri was better than the other two resorts . One of the other hotels was 5* as well and the breakfast at the puri was better , ok puri see you next year",Puri Saron Seminyak
121,Balinese style accommodation on Seminyak beach,40,May 2019,"My husband and I have just returned from nine days at Puri Saron, Seminyak. To paraphrase Goldilocks, it was not too large, it was not too small, it was just right.
We decided on this hotel as my husband loves the beach. Walk past the pool, dodge motor bikes while crossing the road, and you are there. For me, the pool was the best part of the facility. The shallow part was perfect for preschoolers. Across the shallow bridge and the water quickly deepens to over two meters. We spent a lot of time here every day.
Our junior suite overlooked the pool and beach. The room was looking a little weary and could have used some renovation. We found some tears in the linen and the bed was a little hard. That aside, our room was spotless. I was a little worried about the noise but the only annoying noise came from the musician who sang on on the beach in front of our hotel each evening. Onday 1 we enjoyed the music. By day 4 we were over it. It wasn't a deal breaker though.
The breakfast food catering to Asian and western tastes was OK, but quality varied. The pool food was much better. We loved the corn and pizzas. All our drinks, and I did have one or two, were great! Prices were reasonable for a resort.
ALL the hotel staff members were exceptional. Everyone from the staff who greeted us when we arrived to the team who looked after our room, to the serving staff in the restaurant and around the pool were faultless. This is the reason we will book Puri Saron again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
122,had to book re other booking cancelled,20,May 2019,"Had half hour to book another hotel 30 mins before flying out from oz.
Villia vue our first accomadation send me a sms saying they were having electricity
problems and cancelled our booking , no help to try and find alternative accommodation. The booking was done 5 months prior through Booking.com,so had a rush design to make in under 30 mins.We booked thru booking .com got confirmation
the room and driver would be available as we were arriving at 10.30 pm and through customs another 2 hours.
We arrived at the room and they said they upgraded us (hate to have seen that room)
room was dirty and damp not a 4 star more like 2. out dated wall paper ants and dead bees every were bath clothed up when having a shower and the towels pretty disgusting. The staff were lovely and garden was beautiful pool bit dirty location is good the spa although run down I had my best massage there.Such a shame a lick of paint and bathroom Reno would be great break was good wouldn't stay there against far to expensive for the state of the rooms",Puri Saron Seminyak
123,Disappointing,30,May 2019,"Good Points: On the beach, close to heaps and staff are friendly BUT needs major overhaul! I was upgraded from the honeymoon suite to a deluxe room so I dread to think what my original room was like. My shower didn‚Äôt work for the entire 13 days. The only hot water I had was in the bath and hand basin. My outside light never worked so I had to sit in the dark. None of the remotes worked...just needed new batteries, but really? The room was tacky, cleaned each day but stains on bedding, walls, toilet and floor. Everything is really old, stained, cracked and falling apart. Even scales for weighing luggage were 5kgs out which when travelling and throwing away stuff you didn‚Äôt need to is a disaster. Luckily you don‚Äôt spend a great deal of time in your room when on holidays but even a warm shower at the end of the day would have been nice...very disappointed!",Puri Saron Seminyak
124,Old and really dirty,10,May 2019,"I stayed here for three nights and hated every minute of it. The hotel is horrible. The rooms are basic and badly in need of renovating. The sun loungers by the pool are old and dirty and a number of them are broken. The tables at breakfast are not cleaned in between guests, dirty dishes and cutlery are removed but glass topped tables are not cleaned. When we were shown our room it smelt really bad, like cat urine. I told the bellboy that the room was too smelly, he agreed and offered room spray! I requested a change of room. I could go on and on about how awful this hotel is. I‚Äôd compare it to a backpackers hostel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
125,Great holiday,40,April 2019,"This was our first time staying at the Puri Saron. The location was fantastic, the staff were lovely and the room was big, clean, comfortable and had great aircon. The hotel is on the older side but this added to the charm. The pool was great for kids and the swim up bar was perfect with the best priced beers on the strip. There were great beach bars and restaurants within a stones throw. We will definitely be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
126,Great Hotel,40,May 2019,"Just spent 12 nights here and would come back again. The rooms are not brand new but they are very clean and everything works. Staff are all very friendly (special shout out to Wiwik).
Great location right on the beach and you can watch the sunset from the hotel grounds while drinking a Bintang.
Good pool and pool bar, pleny of deck chairs. Particularly enjoyed floating around on the pool 'beanbags'!
Good breakfast.
Overall very good value for money.
My one and only complaint regards the music being played at the pool bar however this complaint extends to a vast majority of hotels and restaurants in bali and thailand. Repeats of the same crappy pop songs over and over. Not sure who listens to this crap but it is ubiquitous and soul destroying. With streaming services aplenty and an absolute plethora of good music available there is no excuse for subjecting innocent travellers to this rubbish. Obviously music is subjective and everyones tastes are different but there are plenty of neutral play lists (chill, lounge, buddha bar etc) that would better suit the environment. Perhaps an education program is warranted but i digress, Puri Saron is a great hotel and i fully recommend!",Puri Saron Seminyak
127,Well located,40,April 2019,"Our first night was a little bit difficult, we're in the same level of a student group who were celebrating their graduation. We've talked with the r√©ception and they've informed their manager who was really very professional and asked us if we want to change the room. We mooved to a bungalow it was very confortable and very nice. The h√¥tel staff was really great with a very good customer service. The breakfast is good, I've tried the SPA it was an excellent exp√©rience. The location of the h√¥tel is good; near by various restaurants specially the ones on the back not in front of the beach cause they are really very noisy (at least for us) and the food very international.",Puri Saron Seminyak
128,Friendly Staff,40,April 2019,"Traveling with kids can be tricky, but the staff here was incredibly nice and patient for our family. The pool area is perfect for allowing the kids to play, and we love walking to the beach to let the kids run around and burn off some energy before getting something to eat.",Puri Saron Seminyak
129,Best location & staff,40,August 2018,"Love this hotel, have stayed there about 8 times now. Great location, right on the beach. Great pool area and swim up bar.

We will be back for years to come.",Puri Saron Seminyak
131,Most Relaxing,50,March 2019,"This is our place to retire... we love the hospitality and have done for a few years now. The staff are always welcoming and friendly, from the gardeners, the guys at the bar the staff at breakfast ... the pool... my favorite place.

The location on Seminyak beach is perfect.
Thank you Puri Saron xx",Puri Saron Seminyak
133,Still Wonderful,50,April 2019,"I have been staying at this hotel for 8 years. It is old school. Open air breakfast area and the room are not Nuevo Asian like some hotels. The rooms are clean and service is awesome. Management has been great when I request connecting rooms when I bring my children. The hotel has a big pool, plenty of pool chairs and the place is on the beach. All for an affordable room rate. I think some people give lower ratings on this hotel when they have not stayed at other hotels in the area and how expensive they are. It is not the Ritz Carlton nor do they have a hip DJ spinning by the pool but the do have a friendly, welcoming property to enjoy with the family. I will be back as long as the hotel stays the way it is.",Puri Saron Seminyak
134,Great location,50,March 2019,"Great location and very friendly staff, they are very helpfull when you ask something to them. The do it for you ride a way! Also the breakfast and food at the swimmig pool is very good to. The location nearby everthing the beach,shopping centre,supermarket.
It's a great place to spend your holiday!!",Puri Saron Seminyak

136,nice place to stay,40,March 2019,"stayed 10 days ,had a great time good location fantastic pool .staff were lovely,.room was a super deluxe balcony room very happy breakfast was not great ,never changed choices ,became boring. needs more fresh food choices,dinner very good staff excellent/had a few problems with water pressure and hot water was a bit hit and miss but was fixed after the 3rd request to fix it.building is in need of updating.but overall the pool and the staff made up for all it shortcomings.gardens were anazing.would stay again",Puri Saron Seminyak
137,Location is great,40,March 2019,"Four stars to the staff of puri saron, it could not have been better, from the manager Alit Mert to Arik our room attendant and every one inbetween. We are an older couple and Our first impression of chalet our room was not good. Noisy and a bit dark and needed some TLC. We took our concerns to the Alit the manager, as we were staying 2 weeks. He could not be more helpful, he recommended that we move to a junior suite near the pool. We paid a little more but it was worth every penny. We were very happy. Nice and spacious bright and large bathroom. The surrounding gargens were beautiful and well kept. Restaurant breakfast had large selection of choices (noodles and rice delicious) made to order eggs anyway you like. The pool is large and swim up bar. And step out the back of hotel and across a small road you are on the beach and amongst all restaurants and bars. We had a great time and Alit and staff checked on us to see if we were ok or needed anything more. Puri Saron is not a swanky hotel but a Balinese hotel and yes it does need some updates in some rooms. Location and staff top class.",Puri Saron Seminyak
138,Convention and vacation,20,February 2019,"I was there for a convention, it's not that bad.Only what bothered me was that i left my sunglasses on my chair went back and offcourse they were gone.Now the organisation found my sunglasses, i was told to pick it up
later but than suddenly it was gone again.Offcourse it's not smart to take
a 200,- euro sunglasses but if it's found it's weird that it' was suddenly gone again after being found .Also i paid for the entrance but i wasn't alowed to get a towell while
some others did but that could just be a misunderstanding.For the rest, i had a bad experience and the glasses had some sentimental value.But for the rest it's a personal experience.If these 2 things din't happen my score would probably be higher",Puri Saron Seminyak
139,An out dated hotel in a Good Location,30,February 2019,"Puri Saron is in need of some TLC as it is quite basic including the rooms, main areas and pool. The hotel grounds were still very beautiful & traditional balinese just rooms are very basic.
The staff were very attentive & overly friendly and the location is perfect !",Puri Saron Seminyak
140,"Friendly staff, good food, unimpressive facilities",30,February 2019,"Was here for a conference and the staff was humble , sweet and extremely helpful. The rooms were unimpressive and the water was terrible. Wish they would do something about the water and put some lights in the room!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
141,"Awful place, friendly staff!",20,February 2019,"This place is the pits. It is rundown in need of basic maintenance, the only saving grace is the friendly staff who seem to keep a smile going knowing that this place is going to the dogs! The mistake was not reading the reviews before I booked. Only myself to blame for booking into Seminyak‚Äôs version of guesthouse paradiso (if you don‚Äôt get the reference, that was also a dump)",Puri Saron Seminyak
142,Back Again,40,January 2019,"Just returned from a couple of weeks in Bali and again had a week at this Hotel with my wife. We have stayed many times in the past with family and friends. The fact that we keep coming back suggests that we are more than happy with what this Hotel offers. The staff are great. Alit does a great job, Wiwik and the other girls in the restaurant are friendly and happy. The grounds are peaceful and the pool is always good. The location remains a spectacular feature. When you stay at the Hotel you will know what I mean. Right on the beach with bars, restaurants, shopping, laundry, transport and money changers all within easy access. We look forward to going back again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
143,Great Hotel,50,November 2018,"This hotel is right on the beach & just behind a couple of lovely bean bag restaurants.
The rooms are spacious & comfortable. There are also 2 nice bars at the front near the beach with well priced food & drinks. The staff are lovely. Very friendly & accommodating.

145,Run down,10,January 2019,"My family have been coming to this hotel for many years and to say that after 10 days with my family it will be the last. From day one we had aircon troubles and our grandchildren in the addjoining room their aircon was completely broken , so they had to be moved. They kept trying to fix our aircon to no avail after six days and not much sleep we had to ask for a fan as the temperature was warm to say the least. I had to go to reception and speak to the manager as the situation was unbearable so we were upgrade to a delux room for the last four days which was suitable. My thoughts are not enough maintenance is being done but we pay top dollar",Puri Saron Seminyak
146,Great for family holiday,40,January 2019,"The hotel has a great location near the beach, it takes just a minute to reach the ocean. There is a large swimming pool and private restaurant, where you can enjoy free breakfast from 6am - 10am, but the menu isn‚Äôt great, it is very limited and the quality isn‚Äôt the best. Near the swimming pool, you can find the Massage Room and the average price is 200,000 IDR ($15) for 1 hour. The only disadvantage is water, it is too salty and applies to swimming pool, showers and sinks. If you are looking for a calm family holiday, this particular hotel will be the perfect choice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
147,Pitential,30,January 2019,"Nicely positioned hotel with a good pool area. Directly across from beach.
Treat it as a value 3 star offering and you‚Äôll be fine. Rooms are simple and fresh enough. Some have a good garden outlook, others pretty much on to a wall. Breakfast pretty good. Overall solid value for what we paid.

Main issues:
- a European tour group took over every lounger around the pool at 8am to reserve for all their friends for the day (most never getting used). Staff do nothing about this despite prior complaints and a very vocal guest argument.
- we had dozens of flying ants come in from the floor. No idea how or why but they all instantly dropped dead so maybe it was property fumigation.

Wouldn‚Äôt rush back but again not a bad value base for Seminyak.",Puri Saron Seminyak
148,"Older, simple hotel located on the beach",30,December 2018,"I stayed at the Puri Saron Seminyak Hotel for two nights in December of 2018. I found the hotel room to smell a bit. The air conditioner worked well and the room temperature was good. The hotel breakfast consisted of eggs, noodles, breads, small muffins, and other foods. Also, the hotel offers a welcome drink and a free bar to the restaurant. The hotel was quiet but the door and walls were not very thick, so you could hear people passing through the hallways. The hotel was simple, but it was located right on the beach which was convenient. The pool was nice and clean. I was disappointed with the wifi at the hotel, it kept going in and out. There were also not a lot of plugs/USB ports in the room to charge your phone and electronic devices.",Puri Saron Seminyak

No enough light in the room, just a small dusk lights near the bed. Internet was poor. Furniture is outdated. Swimming pool with bar increase the overall value to a 3.",Puri Saron Seminyak
150,Old but clean,30,November 2018,Booked this hotel based on the fact it was reasonably priced and near a villa that we had friends staying at. As others have mentioned this hotel is very old however we found our delux chalet room to be very clean. Swimming pool is clean just looks a bit dirty due to being so old. We did have a look at the newer pool villa rooms and they seemed very nice. Breakfast wasnt great but edible. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Hotel is in a great location near the beach and restaurants. Overall a good cheap alternative if you aren‚Äôt planning on spending all your time in the hotel.,Puri Saron Seminyak
151,f,30,November 2018,"Our first impression of this hotel was not good. We had booked a deluxe twin room but there was nothing deluxe about it. The lighting was poor, there was mould on the toliet buttons and the toilet didn't flush properly. The outdoor area was very dismal with uncomfortable chairs and a view of a dirty wall along with no storage space for our clothes. But it did get better. We complained about our room and were upgraded to a bungalow near the restaurant which was much nicer although no hilton! The breakfasts were very ordinary and overall the whole place is old and tired. But in saying this the grounds were well cared for and beautiful and the staff were all very friendly and happy to help in anyway. The location is good right at the beach at the legian end of seminyak.",Puri Saron Seminyak
152,Relaxing Environment,40,November 2018,"Was pleasantly surprised to find that I was upgraded to a VIP room on the second floor, overlooking the garden. Felt very welcome by the friendly staff, flowers, and fruit basket. There was sufficient variety in all the meals too. My only shock was that the tap water tastes saltish. I had to rinse my mouth with bottled water after brushing my teeth. Was it because the hotel was by the beach? No idea.",Puri Saron Seminyak
153,Holiday,20,August 2018,"Check in time was 2pm my room wasnt ready unitl 4ish, we did get a free upgrade to a one bedroom villa which was nice, I asked room service for some ice I was charged $4AUD for a cereal bowl of ice I wouldnt stay there again I found this place over priced its old and needs an upgrade, the buffet breakfast was ordinary as well. Could drink the coffee as it tasted like old water and the fresh water had floaties in it. Music at the swim up bar was very loud and seem to went all night.",Puri Saron Seminyak
154,Good location,40,November 2018,We have stayed in a few places in Bali and this one hasn‚Äôt disappointed us the rooms are clean and the staff are friendly a nice big pool and close to the beach we have a room with a view of the beach I was a bit worried about the noise from the restaurant on the beach but shouldn‚Äôt have would definitely stay again,Puri Saron Seminyak
155,Amazing staff friendly faces,50,October 2018,"Wonderful place to relax, especially if ur into surfing! They have a large swimming pool, plenty of space for kids to run around, Buffett breakfast was great one Australian had 4 fried eggs can u believe fir breakfast!
Anyway it‚Äôs almost on the corner to seminyak village, but I believe they have there own shuttle bus that goes twice a week into a different shipping complex ,I took a taxi it was about 15-20mins away ,
I had upgraded to a chalet! And had s huge queen size bed, coffee /tea, kettle, and a small fridge
It still uses old fashion keys, I found difficult to use ,because of my athritus!
The beach is s few steps down, across the road, and your sitting on the beach
I loved it! A lot of Australians enjoy it it as well , great Restraunt in the right hand side, but lots of little Restraunt‚Äôs on the beach if u want very enjoyable few days",Puri Saron Seminyak
156,Perfect location with friendly Balinese service,40,October 2018,"This hotel is a go-to for my partner and I when visiting Bali. The smiling staff are a wonderful asset as are the ground staff who are constantly working on keeping the beautiful gardends on point.
The hotel is a bit dated and yes, there is room for an update (which I believe is in progress) but the friendly Balinese service and wonderful location is what keeps us coming back.

If I were to offer any advice to the owner/management, it would be to update the breakfast menu by adding a little bit more of a variety and changing the brand and/or the way they brew there coffee (it really is bad) breakfast sets the tone for the other main meals that people have (particularly dinner) I feel as though if you set the bar high with breakfast, more people would be inclined to eat within the hotel grounds.
I would also suggest to keep an eye on those very ""special"" people who kindly reserve a pool chair for the entire day and come and go as they please, leaving others to miss out.

All in all, this is a grat hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
157,Wedding Bali,50,September 2018,"We have stayed in The Puri a few times now and have never been disappointed, most of our wedding guests stayed here also and every request I made for my guests was achieved by the hotel , we received a fantastic upgrade to a room next to the pool , all our guests were happy at this hotel , we had the most amazing holiday/ wedding . Thankyou Puri Saron once again you did not disappoint.",Puri Saron Seminyak
158,Great place to stay and relax,50,September 2018,"The staff were lovely. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready as we arrived early, so we were offered free drink and food while we waited. Room was great, clean and quiet in the middle of the resort. Housekeeping were thourough and polite. Food from the pool bar was awesome. Breakfast was good. Forget about the coffe though. Overall a great experience.",Puri Saron Seminyak
159,Old & very tired hotel,20,August 2018,"Would not stay here again. It is not on the beachfront.
Room was like a cold dormitory and lighting very very poor, we even had to request a lamp! Bathrooms did not feel clean. Air-conditioner was too cold and smelt when turned down. View was at the units next door. Staff in the restaurant tried hard, but food was ordinary. Girls in the spa did a wonderful massage though! Javanese masseuses are the best.",Puri Saron Seminyak
160,First trip to Bali,50,August 2018,"The Puri Saron exceeded all of our expectations... our first time in Bali with very special friends, the hotel staff went above and beyond ... we had two celebrations and the staff arranged a large table for all of us, made a cake for both celebrations and even sang Happy Anniversary and Happy Birthday... even our hotel room was arranged to make us feel special on our Anniversary....
The staff were always pleasant and so helpful... everywhere was clean....and the location was excellent being next to the beach and lots of choice of bars/restaurants... the bean bags and lanterns on the beach opposite the hotel was a lovely place to spend drinking cocktails day and night... will definitely recommend... we would stay there again without hesitation...
Thank you for making our holiday so special...",Puri Saron Seminyak
161,Tired but good location,30,August 2018,"Spent 7 nights here in a typical Balinese style hotel. Good location as across from beach and easy walk in to most areas. Plenty of good shopping, day spas and restaurants around. Gardens are nice and well maintained. Bedroom was a great size for 3 adults and bathroom was clean and excellent. Good size pool with a swim up bar. A pizzeria and caf√© are located in the grounds near to beach end.
The downside, however, is that it is tired, most staff have poor English skills and didn't respond to or understand requests (they were friendly). Saturday night is very noisy due to the beach club being across the path from hotel-bring ear plugs.
We had 3 adults booked in our room and at the last minute they brought in a small bed to add to the king size one. Breakfast, whilst good and edible, was pretty boring with no changes at all. Crap coffee, but that's the norm for most hotels. The kids playground is very shabby, and the swings are squeaky-please put some oil on them!!! We asked this several times as they were right under our balcony and rug rats were up early and playing on them. never sorted this out.
In short, has no redeeming points that make me want to go back there.",Puri Saron Seminyak
162,Old and tired,20,August 2018,"We stayed here for 5 days and that was 5 days too long. We requested 2 rooms together 3 months ago, and they couldn't even get that simple request right. Our room was dark, dirty and very unpleasant. We spent 1 night in there before we demanded to be moved. Our next room wasn't much better, but we really had no choice but to put up with it. You didn't want to spend any time in the room apart from sleeping. The shower is in the bathtub. The air conditioning is noisy. The water is so hard that it is impossible to get a lather with the soap. It actually hurt to rub the soap over your skin. We sat up at the pool bar and ordered some cocktails, which were undrinkable. My pina colada was not even remotely similar to the countless others which ive had. The breakfast each morning was ok but just basic with nothing memorable. The coffee is undrinkable to an Australian taste. The staff were friendly and pleasant.
My basic summation of this so called resort is that it is very old and in desperate need of a reno. It should be marketed as a budget no frills place, and then you would no what to expect.",Puri Saron Seminyak
163,Run down,20,August 2018,"Our 1st room given was on 3rd floor garden view. We a few of a roof. Shower did not work properly,single beds when we requested double, maintence came to relace light on balcony and left a lot of rusted mess, that no one came to clean. Room had been battered with chips in wood everywhere. Asked to be moved to a ground floor room after 1st night. Room was large with lovely gardens. But still battered and rundown. Pool was nice, except for towels that were left on lounges that no one came to sit all day. Staff were very nice and friendly. Warung Bola at back of hotel on beach avoid at all costs.(separare review) Blue Water cafe was great. Breakfast just average. In desparate need of a revamp.",Puri Saron Seminyak
164,Location location!,50,August 2018,"I spent 1 week here with 3 friends Aug 12-20, 2 stayed in a Deluxe Bungalow and 2 of us in a Junior Suite. I loved my junior Suite, it was huge and had a new bathroom and ocean views. The deluxe bungalow overlooked beautiful green gardens, the only minus that the bathroom had a distinct odour, this however would not stop the girls from booking this room again. They loved their 4 poster beds and private balconies (I'd definitely request the 1st floor rooms as the balcony is more private). Breakfast was great and the pool was awesome, lots of space and you can see the ocean from the pool area, just magic! The pizza restaurant overlooking the beach is amazing as is the other restaurant which serves delicious long island iced teas! You can order from both these restaurants and they will deliver to your sun bed!!!! The location of the Puri Saron is 10/10, so many fantastic restaurants, bars and shopping in walking distance or a short cab ride away. The famous La Laguna being in front of the back entrance to the hotel an added bonus. I will absolutely stay here again, cannot wait!!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
165,First trip to bali,50,August 2018,For our first time this was a perfect place. Our rooms were very spacious clean and comfortable. The bed was perfect. We had a beautiful breakfast every day with more than enough variety. The accommodation was in a perfect place very close to anything. The staff were beautiful and extremely helpful anytime of day.,Puri Saron Seminyak
166,Terrible,10,August 2018,"Stayed one night in the suite. Very old. Tub took 1hr to fill and we has to share the water as it would not drain and the shower had little to no pressure.
Dreadful breakfast. Everything was cold and not alot to choose from.
ONLY good thing about this hotel was the location and restaurants out the front were good.",Puri Saron Seminyak
167,Good but could be a little better,40,July 2018,"We stayed for a week as two couples and enjoyed the Puri Saron. It is close to the beach, walking distance to good restaurants etc.
Staff are friendly and accommodating.
However, during our stay there were a couple of events held that weren‚Äôt advertised well enough for us to know about and be prepared for. The Tuesday ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù that goes for quite a few ‚Äúhours‚Äù with a very loud band is okay if you are at the back of the hotel but as our room was at the front with a pool view it was far too loud and we went out for a few hours. On our return the music was still going and the pool was full of mostly drunk young women carrying cocktails in the water and being pretty messy. So no relaxing by the pool for us.
Another night a satay special dinner was held in the restaurant and tables extended out into the garden. We hadn‚Äôt known it was being held and nor did many others it seemed as there was hardly anyone there.
Better advertising of what‚Äôs happening would benefit both the hotel and patrons.
I‚Äôd like to stay again, however if I wanted loud party ‚Äúdoof doof‚Äù music for hours I would stay in Kuta, but chose Seminyak for the relative quiet.
That said, it is a nice hotel, if a bit dated. I‚Äôd plan around the noise next time now that I know it happens.",Puri Saron Seminyak
168,Choose somewhere else,20,August 2018,"Check in - Terrible. We arrived at 3pm to be told one room would not be available until 8pm. We booked with kids and requested connecting rooms on booking. We were then offered adjoining (next to but not connecting), only to be asked if twin beds for myself and my wife were acceptable. That was given a big NO. I also complained that I was being charged $60US for a 6pm late check out, but couldn't get into my room until 8pm. We were eventually given two rooms at with end of the corridor. From something that was supposed to be connecting. The beds are hard, the shower barely worked and when it did it flooded the bathroom. We were eventually moved to two rooms next to each other but only after extensive complaint to the hotel manager. I am also sure there were items on the bar tab that were not ours, but by that stage I was over complaining and just paid and left.",Puri Saron Seminyak
169,Loud and rundown but good staff,10,August 2018,"Although the staff were excellent, the hotel itself left much to be desired. The toilet in both of our rooms absolutely STANK (to the point that I did not want to go in to my bathroom, especially not to clean my teeth or put my contact lenses in or out), the powerpoint in my bathroom came away from the wall and was not fixed, even though I reported it as soon as I noticed, and one night the air-conditioner (set at 20) somehow formed ice, which started cracking loudly and falling to the floor, which woke me up. With the light on, I could see a puddle of water on the floor, then as the cracking noise started again, I saw lumps of ice fall from the unit. I turned it off, and had to sleep without air-conditioning. I reported this also but they never told me that it was fixed. A few other things ‚Äì my bar fridge stank, wi-fi was erratic and non-existent for hours at a time, some of the taps were rusting, the towel bench was so high, my friend could barely reach hers (I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm taller), the lighting was inadequate, and there was only 1 teabag in each room which had an odd flavour. This was AFTER I had already moved rooms once because a) the first room (admittedly larger and cleaner) was directly above the restaurant so I could hear them preparing for breakfast at about 5.30 in the morning and clearing up late at night b) not only did it not have a balcony, the windows were frosted (therefore opaque) and although they opened, a notice advised keeping them shut because of the mosquitos, and c) although it was close to a large public balcony, this was a smoking area, making it completely unsuitable for me.
Most of the guests were loud and boisterous, and many ""bagged"" pool lounges and didn't turn up for hours. The music was loud and definitely not relaxing. It's probably ok to stay here if you‚Äôre 25 and want to get drunk relatively cheaply, but it definitely wasn't fine for my friend or me who wanted to go somewhere peaceful.",Puri Saron Seminyak
170,Beatifull setting and fabulous pool,40,May 2018,What a plesant surpise this little jem is......Loved my ground floor room which was clean and modern also close for breakfast and a small path way to the fabulous pool that was so relaxing a few steps down to the beach..what more can you need in paradise!,Puri Saron Seminyak
171,Puri Saron Hotel Seminyak Bali,20,August 2018,"Large clean rooms., disappointing breakfasts, little fruit, pastries stale, usual eggs etc.
Pool overrun first few days with drunken bogans, stereo at bar blasting away, no way to quietly relax. Also impossible to find pool lounges free as ignorant people reserve and then disappear for 5 hours.",Puri Saron Seminyak
172,In desperate need of TLC/maintenance,20,August 2018,"Stayed here in in 2011 and was very happy with the place. Got here today and was ogobsmacked at how badly it has been deteriorated. Very disappointed.. had we not prepaid over $800 for 4 nights for a junior suite would just go and stay elsewhere. Won‚Äôt be back or recommending. The only 4 star thing about this place is the price. Due to how rundown it is, I would struggle to give it a three.",Puri Saron Seminyak
173,Very good,50,July 2018,"We really enjoyed our stay.
The territory of the hotel is really beautiful, our room had a lovely terrace. The ocean is just next to the hotel. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
The only disadvantage I found- not enough sun beds next to the pool. At 8-00 all occupied. The first day we didn‚Äôt care so much, as we stayed next to the beach, but when there was no beach, as the ocean came too close, it was not possible to find a sun beds near the pool at all.
Prices in the restaurants are normal.
Breakfast was OK.
I should say that the location of the hotel and the service they provide are excellent.
Nearby lots of massage places, souvenir shops and restaurants.",Puri Saron Seminyak
174,Beach front bliss,40,July 2018,"Have stayed at the Puri Saron many times since I discovered it about 10 years ago. If you like to hear surf and get that lovely sea breeze then this is a great location. The

re are lots of interesting eateries nearby. The pool is big and well designed and the gardens beautifully maintained. Staff couldn't be friendlier. It does seem fair to name particular staff because the guest is number one for them all. I have always found Lisa very helpful and this latest trip met Alit who came rushing to help in a minor crisis!",Puri Saron Seminyak
175,Good hotel but has flaws,20,July 2018,We arrived and were told they over booked and couldn‚Äôt have our garden bungalow as booked. We were upgraded to a bigger room for 2 nights but then had to move which I was annoying but ok. Big room was above the pool close to the beach and REALLY really noisy. Base music until 2am. Not what we came to Bali for. Really frustrated after we moved to garden bungalow as that‚Äôs what we had booked and was quieter. Pool was nice. Bath towels were stained. Cleanliness was very average but breakfast was great.,Puri Saron Seminyak
176,Good location,30,July 2018,This was a good place for our first night in Bali. Central and easy to find. Short walk to lots of food options. The rooms are a bit tired and could use some love. But very clean and comfortable. Mixture of couples and families staying.,Puri Saron Seminyak
177,Puri Saron Hotel,40,July 2018,"Staff are absolutely fantastic.. We were up graded to a Villa on our last night..With private pool and only metres away from Seminyak Beach..
Great facilities and access to restaurants/ shops. Looking forward to going back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
178,Great location and friendly staff,40,July 2018,"+ The Hotel's main asset are its genuinely friendly helpful staff. Special shout out to Setiwhan (unsure of spelling sorry mate) at the pool bar.

- Wi-fi in our room had extremely poor strength and dropped out every few minutes. Its not what we came to Bali for, but it helps with small kids. Some of the facilities are getting a little old and needing a fresh paint.",Puri Saron Seminyak
179,Excellent location and staff,40,July 2018,"Older style hotel with excellent location, staff and an ok breakfast. We stayed in a 'deluxe' room on the third floor overlooking the garden pond, the rooms were comfortable but best described as a bit tired with cupboard doors misaligned, towel rack hanging off etc. Certainly not enough to spoil our stay and we seen work being carried out on other rooms so maybe a bit of an upgrade underway.
Hosting an approx 600 seat graduation lunch and taking over half of the grounds and pool area without notice was a bit different but we chose to go out for the day so no real drama I suppose. We would stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
180,GREAT PLACE TO CHILL OUT,40,June 2018,"Puri Saron never fails to please. The Assistant Manager (Mr Merta) was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.
All the staff were very pleasant and lovely to deal with.
I would like to thank Cherista for looking after us during our stay she made sure everything for us was taken care of and new our names right from the get go which makes you feel special that staff take the time to remember your name.

Mr. Merta the Assistant Manager runs a great relaxing place to stay and chill out.
The breakfasts are really good with a big variety to choose from. The staff who serve are mostly trainees so are still learning, but are a delight to deal with.
The housekeeping is good, the whole place is kept spotless.
It has a swim up bar and the pool also has a shallow end for toddlers.
Plenty of sun lounges that don‚Äôt need to be saved like other hotels.
The hotel is within approx 20meters from the beach which is very handy.

They also have a shuttle bus that leaves from the lobby at 10am each morning to take you to Kuta.
While we were there on the Thursday night the Management put on a meet and greet for patrons and staff. They served finger food and some cold non alcoholic drinks.
It went between 5-6pm and was great to chat with other travellers and staff.
They also showed us how to make the little floral arrangements that are made to put out for offerings or taken to temple, which was very very interesting, and may I say a challenge.

The music that you hear from the beach stops about 11pm so you get a good night sleep without the worry of the loud noise going all night.

All in all this is a good place for the price you pay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
181,Bali Holiday,20,June 2018,"Whilst Puri Saron is in a great spot, right opposite the beach and walking distance to plenty of great eating places do not expect any luxury in the room. We booked a deluxe bungalow and what we got was nothing like what was pictured on their website. The room was very basic and sparse, the floor coverings were laminate boards, the lighting was poor, the tap ware needed replacing and the towels thin and well worn. There was also an odour coming from the bathroom in the morning and night time. We were very disappointed and had booked 15 nights here. We could also here all the activity in the room above us.
The staff were very helpful and friendly but aside from the great position if you are wanting a little luxury I would not recommend staying here.",Puri Saron Seminyak
182,Puri saron - not my cup of tea,10,July 2018,"I was not impressed with the overall hygiene of this place. Bed sheets were stained in blood (?!) and took the staff 2 days to swap them. Roaches running around in the bathroom. People slamming doors in the morning...sorry no my cup of tea. Staff friendly, location nice",Puri Saron Seminyak
183,Great location and fantastic staff,40,June 2018,"We spend 7 days here at the ens d of June 2018. First of all, the staff at this place is outstanding. Always smiling, polite and ready to be at your service. The location is also a great location in seminyak. More or less located on the beach with great places to eat, drink and see the sunset close by.
Breakfast is OK. Pretty standard in Asia. + for omelettes and pancakes made on the spot. Otherwise nothing special, but still good.
The rooms were big, and cleaning good. We would have given it 5 stars if it was renovated or newer.
The pool area was nice with a nice poolbar.
I would recommend this place and come back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
184,Beautiful hotel,40,June 2018,"Puri Saron is a large and open hotel with beautiful gardens and large outdoor pool.
The rooms and toilets were clean , bed was very comfortable and air condition was working well.

Breakfast menu was average but the restaurant food was amazing . (Satay's were the best we had). The pizza restaurant near the pool was also very good.

Check in and out was fast and easy , staff are very attentive and friendly .
House keeping was great

Location is next to the beach and also close to restaurant , bars and shops .

The hotel is old , the tap water and pool water is salty which I did not like .

Overall very happy with my experience except the salty water .",Puri Saron Seminyak
185,great location,30,June 2018,"stayed there for 8 days in june great location good staff, linen was hard towels etc, beds were also hard water was a bit hard to get a lather not sure if it is bore water. Breakfast was ok usual selection. the pool area and outside eating grill are a good place to relax",Puri Saron Seminyak
186,Relaxing Week at Puri Saron,40,June 2018,"My wife and I had a very relaxing week at the Puri Saron. We were greeted by very friendly staff who took care of check in with ease and quite quickly. We were lucky to have one of the private Villa's near the beautiful pool area which we found to be excellent. Room was clean, comfortable and serviced each day. AC was cold and room was always at a pleasant temperature. Cant really fault the Villa for our stay. The pool area and swim up bar were great with plenty of lounges and close amenities. Drink prices were reasonable along with the bar food, especially the fresh cooked BBQ options from the little BBQ kiosk. Gardens and grounds were well kept and very nice. Breakfast was buffet style each day with the main buffet foods and some changes each day along with and egg, waffle & pancake station who would cook to order. Location is great with only a 50m walk to the main beach and a 5 - 10 min walk into the main part of Seminyak for all the shopping and bars / clubs and food options. All in all we really enjoyed our stay, certainly the villa is the best option but the rooms look fine (depending on where in the facility I guess but cant really comment). As per some other comments the resort does have some age on it but we found it good value for money and we would definitely stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
187,Puri Saron Hotel Seminyak,50,June 2018,"If you want a tranquil setting right next to the beach in lush grounds, then this is the place, the staff are always friendly and helpful. And there's lots to do or do nothing and relax by the pool all day.",Puri Saron Seminyak
188,To noisy (loud bass noises all day every day afternoon and till late),30,June 2018,"I stayed for nine nights recently (I have stayed there 4 or 5 times over the years)
so I mostly knew what to expect dated rooms,smelly lav, worn towels etc.
I have stayed here because of the location and the serenity however this time around
The noise from neighboring hotels,pool bar,and the so called restaurants on the beach
out front was I felt overwhelming at times so no serenity during the day and onwards
towards 10-11 pm.
So I feel that it is no longer worth the money they charge and will not be returning to this
hotel which is a pity because it was once value for money.
It is now a classic case of 'caveat emptor'",Puri Saron Seminyak
189,most enjoyable stay in a true Balinese setting,40,June 2018,"My husband and I booked this hotel and then read the reviews. Some sounded quite unimpressive so we were rather hesitant about our week here. We knew the area well so knew the location was good. In fact it was, in our opinion, an excellent location . From front entrance it was a 2-3 mins walk to the main road but in that short walk was a laundry, money changer and 24 mini mart.
The hotel is an older style Balinese hotel with really lovely Balinese style gardens, statues , water features etc. From very front of the hotel to the back is about a 2
min walk and you are right
on the beach- close to lots of action and eating houses.
There are a few sections to this hotel. At the front ( where we stayed) were the deluxe bungalows( or chalets). Superb! Very spacious with your own private courtyard.
Then there are rooms going across like a T junction. We saw inside one of these while we waited for room to be ready. Very nice but there are ground, first and second floors and NO lift. Bell boys carried the luggage but better for the younger generation. Once past these there was a long path with beautiful gardens on either side and bungalows either side, each with a balcony. Then came the restaurant and opposite were the villas. These were beautiful indeed . Then came the
pool with swim up bar with a few rooms nearby. The closer to the front of the hotel the quieter it was. Across from the hotel on the beach the bars played
loud music from around 5 pm until late so I imagine guests would definitely hear this noise. Again I think the young would like this area.
Staff were lovely and friendly and if there was a complaint it was handled extremely quickly and efficiently.
Breakfast was buffet style and certainly adequate but not as extensive as other hotels we have stayed at. There were eggs of all varieties , pancakes, pikelets and french toast, muffins, cold meats and salads, sausages, bacon, hash browns, vegetables, some Asian dishes, toast( white or brown bread) choice of three cereals plus muesli and fruits and yoghurts as well as juices and tea and coffee. My only disappoint was that baked beans only appeared once in the week. Would have liked that to be a daily occurrence as Aussies love their baked beans. Other complaint was that there was only one kind of milk- unlabelled, so if you couldn‚Äôt have full cream , there was no alternative . I brought
my own low fat from the supermarket.
Spa treatments were very reasonable and enjoyable.
Would definitely stay here again and would again choose the deluxe bungalow( downstairs unit).
Just one thing- these bungalows have a shower over the bath which maybe a problem for those with mobility issues.",Puri Saron Seminyak
190,Not bad at all....,40,June 2018,"This is a nice resort with reasonable charges. It's by the beach, good eateries, convenient stores and spas within walking distance. Property is clean and the pool is huge with a swim up bar. You have basic rooms to villas to choose from. Staffs are courteous too. Those who like to hangout and watch the sunset, no worries... there are a few beach cafes with bean bags.",Puri Saron Seminyak
191,Awesome Pool Bar!,30,February 2018,"After our Ulun Ubud Bali adventure, My friends and I booked a room here for 3 nights and 2 days. They do really have an amazing pool bar, and a wide and big pool. However, the room was so average, something I did not expect for a resort in Bali. and the food was good but a bit expensive. and not to mention, no elevator in this resort. Though, their in house spa/massage parlor is a must try. :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
192,"Beautiful pool area, beach front, good location, average quality accommodation",30,June 2018,"We checked in around 01:00am, the night porter at Reception was slow to check in six of us. On entry into our rooms, we were happy to see our room was spacious, beds were comfortable and aircon was good. There was a smell like disinfectant in a male urinal in our bathroom which was off putting. The shower and overall bathroom was good. Friends of ours at Puri Saron had a terrible smell of sewerage from their bathroom.

Breakfast was included in our stay. The kitchen is due to open at 6am, I arrived at 6am for breakfast as I needed to leave the hotel early, and the kitchen was in darkness, it was 6:30am before it was up and running properly. Later in the morning, the kitchen staff don't appear to keep on top of stocking up the breakfast food, drinks, glasses, plates etc. Waiting for tea / coffee in the morning while seated having breakfast was a bit of a joke. The food was good for breakfast.

The pool area was lovely, clean and enjoyable. It's beautifully located close to the beach, and in the mornings, you can hear the ocean from the pool area.

The hotel itself is spread over a large area, beautiful gardens, and greenery. On Sunday morning we were woken by the sound of construction from the side of the building. Staff are friendly and helpful when asked.

We paid Australian prices for this hotel and were a little disapointed overall.",Puri Saron Seminyak
193,Puri saron Hotel Seminyak,40,June 2018,"Nice hotel lovely friendly staff and an amazing pool area and pool bar. The rooms are a bit dated but have everything you need hot shower, comfortable bed, in room fridge and lovey balconies. The breakfast is also very good lots of variety for all tastes. It is right on the beach so there are a lot of restaurants and beach bars with live music every night. We enjoyed are stay here very much.",Puri Saron Seminyak
194,Excellent pool cillas,50,June 2018,Puri Saron was our first stop in Bali on our honeymoon. Very relaxing and peaceful despite being in the busy Seminyak. Our pool villa was lovely and secluded but we had the benefit of being really close to the main pool and beach. We loved the lunchtime BBQ and having cocktails at the pool bar late afternoon. Staff were all so friendly and attentive. Thank you! :-),Puri Saron Seminyak
195,OK Accommodation,40,June 2018,"12 of us stayed at Puri Saron (in separate rooms) for 5 nights. The rooms weren't bad, could do with an update however they immediately need towel hooks in the bathroom and a door on the shower. The breakfast is OK, with lots of it. Drinks are OK, bit pricey for what they are. Superb location, right on the beach with tons of eateries and watering spots to pick from! It could definitely do with some TLC however it's cheap and cheerful so no complaints!",Puri Saron Seminyak
196,In dire need of a major shake up,20,June 2018,"In Line with some other reviews I can only agree as to my findings.
Rooms are shabby and adequate at best.
The place badly needs a make over although they are upgrading some rooms at the expense of paying customers putting up with the noise of the builders.
WiFi is very hit or miss. Sometimes you got, sometimes you haven‚Äôt.
Room towels should be burnt and a new ones procured their use by date has long past.
The last straw is the pool bar... why play very loud rock music when the mixture of guests age ranges from 20‚Äôs-70‚Äôs plus.
It started out as a quiet relax by the pool and then at 2.30 it was decided to crank up the volume
Come on, be considerate of all your guests.
We ordered food and beers after lunch. Food took a while, but we had to ask for drinks a hour later.
Surely the staff should be trained to keep up the liquids, that‚Äôs the way the place makes its money.
Poor list of drinks at the bar as well.
Place should shut down and do a major refurbishment and retrain staff.",Puri Saron Seminyak
197,Adequate!,30,May 2018,"My wife and I stayed at Puri Saron Seminyak for 7 nights in May. This is an old resort that looks tired and is in need of extensive renovations. Our room was very dark with limited lighting and difficult to see at night. The corridor and often our room had a distinct smell of blocked drains. The bathroom was mouldy in places with discoloured tiles. The water from taps was very milky looking and very salty. The only Restaurant served an adequate breakfast and prices were reasonable. The pool area was maintained well. Although this hotel was advertised as ""accross the road from the beach"" , there were many bars and restaurants between hotel and beach. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. Although our 7 night, stay was very reasonably priced, would we revisit again? Probably not!.",Puri Saron Seminyak
198,My Trip to Bali was for pleasure and business. I intend to live in Seminyak in the near future.,50,September 2017,"Spacious with very clean facilities. My single room with a queen sized bed was very comfortable. The grounds were beautifully kept. The pool was great with plenty of room to suntan. This hotel has excellent facilities and the staff are most obliging. Shopping is a short walk away. The hotel food was excellent with copious breakfasts al a carte. The beach is five steps from the hotel garden. There are many great restaurants and clubs in a short stroll.
I really relaxed and loved every minute of the two weeks I spent exploring Bali and being pampered. The Balinese people are some of the most hospitable in the world. It truly is an Island Paradise.",Puri Saron Seminyak
199,Shabby & Overpriced,20,March 2018,"The staff @ this hotel are lovely and did what they could to resolve issues however a bigger issue is @ play.

The rooms for the price are poor value.

We got an internet special and were not expecting much. Upon arrival we were greeted by mouldy mattress leaning in the hallways. The room was chipped & bashed up with dirty curtains, so worn with poor ambience.

We asked to be moved and we moved to a deluxe villa (which was just passable but in no way worth the $300 US list price).

Serious Maintenance and deep cleaning is not happening.

It could be a jewel as it‚Äôs traditional feel & top location is what what we were after.

The pictures speak for themselves.

Having said all of the above we had a great holiday as we were upgraded. (Yes the photos are the upgraded $300US a night room!)

Management try hard and want you to directly tell them of the issues.
On an international level this would be a 2 star hotel in a 5 star location.",Puri Saron Seminyak
200,Nice Hotel,40,May 2018,"We found the Puri Saron to be great value for money.

Like many of the hotels in Bali the rooms were a little dated but very comfortable and have everything you need.

Our particular room 4102 had a very hard mattress and the power point in the bathroom wouldn't hold an adaptor. Almost as if the fitting was too large.

Our mums room had no hairdryer and a leaking aircon so she ended up changing rooms. The staff were very accommodating about it.

The grounds are lovely and well kept. Great location backing right onto the beach. Room service menu was a little limited but the food we did get was nice. The drinks arent great but I do recommend a nearby speak easy bar called 40 Thieves.",Puri Saron Seminyak
201,Disappointed,20,May 2018,"Resort is very tired needs update painting.very disappointed for the money stayed 8 nights bathroom has mould needs a good clean.
Breakfast dirty cups
Pool service very poor.
Wanted late check out $60 US üò´
Much better resorts for price wouldn‚Äôt recommend this resort",Puri Saron Seminyak

203,Puri Saron Seminyak,30,March 2018,"Over rated, adequate resort, not what I would class as good value for money. Room spacious hotel needs updating tired looking. Staff friendly / helpful. Breakfast Ok. Location OK beach 200m from hotel boundary.",Puri Saron Seminyak
204,"Good location and friendly, helpful staff",40,March 2018,"First visit. Staff very helpful. Breakfast average. Location good, close to beach. Only setback is the constant smell of cigarette smoke coming through the air conditioning vents. A bit dated but clean.",Puri Saron Seminyak
205,Back once again,40,March 2018,"Came over to Bali to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday, and once again chose to stay our 17 nights at Puri Saron. Usually we stay in the deluxe bungalows, however during our stay we also had 5 nights in the 2 bedroom villa as my 94 year old mum came over for party and I was able to look after her closely. As recent reviews for Puri Saron have stated, the bungalows are a little tired, but on writing that, renovations are under way at this time, which is good to see the hotel owners are aware and continuing improvements. Also management is happy to hear from guests any suggestions that will improve their stay. The 2 bedroom villa was very nice, 2 large bedrooms with lovely bathrooms, nice pool and an amazing alfresco. Great for family and friends to meet. A ceiling fan and fridge in the alfresco area would make it perfect. My daughter stayed in the super deluxe room on the first floor overlooking the pool. This is a lovely and very spacious room and balcony. The Puri Saron has lovely gardens and large shady pool area which backs onto the beach and is excellent value for money. It is in a good location, with restaurants within walking distance. Staff are always happy and ready to accommodate any request. We always enjoy our stay here and look forward to our next stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
206,Puri Saron - 2nd visit. Not as good as the first.,10,March 2018,"We came back to Puri Saron in 2018 after a great stay in 2015 but unfortunately it was not as good.
Poor wifi, room change due to serious plumbing Issue, poor attitude by some staff and indifferent room cleaning staff.

The wifi is a major problem as it changes from locations around the resort. However constant dropouts and reconnection a regular requirement drive you mad. You tell staff and nothing happens.

A wrongly shaped sloping shower floor on a refurbished room left us on the first morning swimming in the bathroom and toilet area. We complained and got moved to a lesser standard old style room with no real apology. After all we are only here for sixteen days!! Why should we get equal or better treatment??

Then we had a challenge every morning with bottled water. We asked for more than two little free bottles and you get four. Next day? Two. You ask again and you get three. Huh??
If you want a coffee or tea you have to go to the kitchen and beg for extra water and tea bags as the cleaning staff don't update the stock in the room after constant requests and mentions to management.

Some staff are great but a lot are young and untrained with limited skills in customer service. I blame this on senior staff and management.

Memo to owners. If you want to keep customers you need to make your lunch and dinner meal prices inclusive of taxes. Very few restaurants nearby charge the 21% taxes on a meal. That's why no more than four people eat in your restaurant at dinner time.

Rooms old style. Gardens lovely and pool great. Oh yeah I just remembered. On our last night I went for a swim in the pool at 8.10pm (the pool hours are till 9.00pm) but it was closed so they could treat it.
What's wrong with doing that after nine pm when we expect it to be closed??

Poor grasp of customer needs and entitlements.
Think twice before booking at the Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak
207,OK but rather tired,30,February 2018,"This hotel was recommended to us as a place to stay which is accessible to the airport. It is a large resort hotel, maybe built in the 80s or 90s and now showing its age. The sense is that maintenance has been cut back and there is no willingness to invest to try to upgrade the place, so slow decline seems its likely fate. The hotel stretches right through from the road to the beach on what is a very large site. Architecturally it is rather uninspired, perhaps a little Brutalist. It has a nice pool and lounging area, and easy access on to to the beach and to nearby beach restaurants. The rooms were basic, OK, but showing a lack of maintenance in things like grouting repairs.",Puri Saron Seminyak
208,2nd Visit and very happy,40,March 2018,"This is our 2nd time we have stayed at this hotel. It is in a good location with beach access and a large selection of bars/restaurants which are great for sunset drinks, with live music on the beach. We had a few lunches along here and they were mostly good.
The staff are very friendly. We booked a Junior Suite close to the pool and it was great. Beautiful bathroom and sitting area included. Comfortable bed.
The aircon did break down one day and on contacting the front desk they were straight on to it and it was fixed that day which we were very grateful for.
The pool is amazing. It is huge and the swim up bar is good too.
The grounds are mostly good especially from the street entrance as you are walk towards the restaurant area. Around the pool and villas it was a bit neglected.
The breakfast is ok. Toaster was a joke but they did say they have ordered a new one. Young guys at Egg Station were sometimes getting orders wrong, but large clean area. Overall we enjoyed it and love this hotel and would probably stay again and recommend it. Hubby had a few massages which he said were excellent.",Puri Saron Seminyak
209,good hotel close to everything,40,March 2018,"great place in a great location,great pool with swim up bar and good breakfast with very friendly staff,beach bars out back for meals and sunset bingtangs and small walk to great dining at double 6 or legian beachfront",Puri Saron Seminyak
210,Affordability and Location Wise,50,March 2018,"A Balinese style resort. Location is great, close to everything you need from spa, shopping and restaurant. Great value for money, don‚Äôt expect the plushy and fluffy linens as this hotel/resort offers true Balinese style. Lovely garden, good size bedroom and bathroom. Clean and well maintained pool. You do still have to walk down few steps and cross a narrow roadway where bikers passes to access the sandy beach. Beautiful and quiet area and perfect location to chill and watch the sunset while sipping cocktails. Had a great time lazing around and just relax. Friendly staff too! Would not hesitate to come back when i have the chance!",Puri Saron Seminyak
211,OK STAY,30,February 2018,"Not much of a first impression .Entrance of a dark lane but reception was ok with friendly staff. The room given to us was a dissapointment as the floor had a puddle under the ac.and a loverly view from our patio of a brick wall (room 1116).Bathroom was clean and well layed out with good shelving because not much in the room.The noise through the wall at night from adjoining room was ( entertaining).Great gardens on the way to restaurant and a loverly pool with swim up bar although very expensive compared to normal Bali liquer prices.The beach at the back of the resort was a dissapointment with black sand making everything look dirty but a nice restaurant called ""champung"" was great to see the sunset from in comfort .Aband plays on the beach every night in front of the Champung so get in early to get a seat as it is very popular.Ok place for a short stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
212,Great location!!,30,November 2017,"Friends and I stayed for a week here, was a little run down needed a lot of tlc, bathroom flooded every day, air con didn‚Äôt work that well..
Great pool, great location right on the beach and tucked away about 5min walk from the straight of shops/dining.
Didn‚Äôt see or hear much from the staff in the hotel but the cafe out the back the staff were very friendly and great cocktails!
Breakfast buffet was pretty standard but didn‚Äôt get changed up day to day, wood fire pizza out the back wasn‚Äôt great and quite expensive but the pizza IN the hotel cart was lovely.",Puri Saron Seminyak
213,good location - very tired!,30,February 2018,"Avoid the level 3 rooms as they don't have a lift!

The rooms are extremely tired even though we understand that they had a refurb 6 years ago- it looks like they did a halfhearted job and the rooms are extremely DISAPPOINTING

The location is good, and the breakfasts were up to expectation

The pool is pleasant though I am not a fan of in water bar stools- given the number of ""white trash"" staying here and the amount they were drinking - NOT a good combination

It is definitely NOT a 5 star offering though",Puri Saron Seminyak
214,Nice hotel setting for a 4 night stay.,40,January 2018,"Very large hotel with lush planted gardens. Good location for the beach and local beach-front restaurants. Although very windy and rough seas make it not suitable for swimming. Nice clean large rooms with a massive bathroom - lots of wasted space really. Not the luxury that was expected at the price paid even with a free up-grade. Staff very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was well presented, a typical buffet style. Lots a waiting staff but without a purpose. Not sure how they would cope if it were busy......be very clear how you like your eggs cooked!!! Mine were supposed to be soft boiled but after 15 minutes cooking you can imagine the result!",Puri Saron Seminyak
215,Sixth time or is it seven!,40,January 2018,"Back again and enjoyable again. Just returned from 2 and half weeks in Bali and spent 7 nights at this Hotel. We were a small group of family and friends and we were well accommodated in 5 Bungalows that were clean and tidy and all with outlooks to the well maintained gardens, close to the restaurant and pool. I have said in previous reviews that this is not a 5 star hotel but it makes up for that with its location on the beach and close to many restaurants, bars, shops, laundry and money exchange options. It also rates highly for the quality and friendliness of the staff. We have never had an issue of any consequence in the times that we have stayed but any matter raised has been promptly dealt with - we asked for a couple of extra pillows on this visit!! This hotel is a great choice for a relaxing break. Enjoy.",Puri Saron Seminyak
216,Many Happy Returns,50,January 2018,"So good to be back again at Puri Saron, Easy checkin, happy friendly welcome as always. Here this trip with family and friends all staying in comfortable clean bungalow rooms overlooking immaculate gardens. Good breakfast selection and thank you to Wiwik again for welcoming us to breakfast everyday. Thank you to the wonderful staff for the birthday cake and singing they provided on my 60th birthday. Also Mr Alit, the hotel manager for welcoming us back. Nothing is too much trouble for him and all his staff, all requests are addressed happily and promptly. Location is great, by the beach, walking distance to many great and good priced restaurants and shopping, great pool and swim up bar.. We love this hotel and after many stays can't wait to return. Many thanks Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak
217,My suitcase was damaged while i left it locked at the room.,10,December 2017,"First time i stay in puri saron, this hotel is very bad!! I find My suitcase damaged when i return to the hotel and then i report to the manager on duty about this incident. But the manager didn‚Äôt seem to be very concerned about this. Didn‚Äôt even said sorry, and just said that he will let us communicate directly to the one cleaning our room. Which leave us kind of speechless.

Air conditioning is not working very well, tap water smells like its mixed with sea water.
The room also smell bad and felt very humid.
The hotel doesn‚Äôt seem to be well maintained.
Totally disapointed!
I will not come back in here again!
Totaly not recomended for people looking for a holiday. Not worth the price. Doesnt stand up for its reputation being a 4 star hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
218,5 Night Stay,40,December 2017,"Nice and close to the beach. We booked a Super Delux, the room didnt meet the same requirements/pictures on the website but they changed rooms for us upon request, thank-you.
Room - Nice and spacious, poor water pressure for the bath and shower. Beds where hard, but we had a lovley room service attendant. Rooms where clean and 2 sml water bottles provided daily.
Pool - Nice and big + swim up bar. Towls provided & you can see the beach. There are 2 close good restaurants that you can use, both great!
Breakfast - If you go nice and early, no worries. If you have a sleep in and head down around 9.30am the food is mostly gone and not refilled. However there is a chef making eggs, we had omletts and they where great!
Staff - All round fantastic staff! Thanks for the friendly welcoming service.",Puri Saron Seminyak
219,"The resort was quiet , gardens were immaculant and the staff are very friendly",40,November 2017,"I cannot express enough our many thanks to the staff and managers at the resort. This is our second visit and it has been very relaxing as always. The staff are most helpful and are very welcoming and smiling as you wander around the resort.The rooms are clean and large and spacious. Alit (the smiling manager) you have welcomed us again and thanks for checking on us and our friends daily to make sure we were comfortable.

Overall the food is good especially the way the guys are very eager to make you eggs anyway you like and fresh pancakes. The breakfast bay marie is allways different each day with a variety of different food available. The resort is right on the beach and a skip over the road and the water is fresh clean and inviting.

Or if you wish more importantly the pool is large and has various depths to suit the kids and adults. Swim over to the guys at the pool bar sit in the water and have a nice cold Bingtang or Cocktail !! Or just lounge around on the sun lounges and watch the world go by under the umbrellas.
In a nutshell you wont be dissapointed.",Puri Saron Seminyak
220,Near the beach,30,November 2017,"Recently stayed here for 2 nights . The location is awesome--just a few steps away from the beach and La Plancha bar. The hotel staff is very thoughtful and surprised us with a birthday cake for my husband. Room is quiet, simple and nothing remarkable but was ok bec we didn't really stay there as we were always outside for tours. Breakfast is average and almost the same menu. The only downside was the towels--very dirty and smelly.",Puri Saron Seminyak
221,Great resort,50,November 2017,"Spent 8 days here with family and friends, awesome pool and pool bar, great food, lovely staff, clean rooms, top location, accessible to the beach, restaurants and shopping, highly recommend for families, groups or couples",Puri Saron Seminyak
222,Another quick 1 night stay,40,November 2017,"Great hotel, great price, great location on the beach, quick walking to shops/ stalls, lots of restaurants around close to hotel!.I wasnt expecting the rooms to be so nice for the price you pay, I requested to be changed to a ground floor room as I had a bike packed up with me and that wasnt a problem.
Enjoyed the pool area with nice swim up bar, grounds were pretty also.
Breakfast was good, nice big eating area.
I would go back again for sure",Puri Saron Seminyak
223,SEMINYAK STOPOVER,40,October 2017,"We stayed in a bungalow and it was just perfect for what we required. Bit hard to watch the tv through 4 poster bed with netting. Very large bathroom with a safe. Very quiet but would suggest you get the ground floor if possible. Mozzies are a little fierce if you wish to sit outside, bring the bug spray. The gardens are beautiful and the pool area is very good but could do with some extra sun lounges. Breakfast is a little ordinary but i am sure you can find something to suit your appetite. All in all it met all our expectations and we would stay there again",Puri Saron Seminyak
224,"2-3 star hotel, great location, breakfast limited but OK, rooms average - AVERAGE",30,November 2017,"I stayed here for a 3 night stay with some friends and the two main reasons we stayed here were that it was across from La Plancha which is on the beach, and the hotel has a swim up bar.
The hotel is rather well priced, perhaps a little over priced for what it is, as ive stayed in better places (Dash Hotel) with better facilities and the entire hotel way above average,!

Checkin was easy and simple, and the team picked a room based on our requests which was good. Ground floor and adjoining. Thanks.

The rooms are rather noisy though, you can hear anyone in the hallway. So if at 7am a few kids are about they will surely wake you up as it echoes throughout!

The rooms are OK. Beds are a little hard, but not to bad. Limited water bottles in the room, just two very small sized ones, perhaps giving some more bottles would be good since we cant drink the dirty water!

My aicron started leaking with water everywhere, but maintenance were quick onto this and repaired it, thanks boys!

The towels in the bathroom - they're meant to be white, but because theyve been used so many times, and are very old, they're an off white / grey colour. I did notice other people reviewed the same on this! A good overhaul of the towels is very much needed.

The pillows on the bed need to be replaced too. Room 1108, noisy, pillows have seen better days.

We had a room down the end of the corridor, 1108, and the internet was hit and miss ALL THE TIME. It would connect and work in some parts of the room, not in other parts, always dropping out.
Not ideal when you're trying to book flights and organise life! Surely this can be fixed?!

The hotel only gives you one key for the room, so you're unable to keep the aircon running whilst youre out. i see why, they want to save money on electricity. However, if the room is warm, this attracts mosquitoes! I noticed a lot in the room at times and there wasn't anything to keep them out or to kill them with! Perhaps some spray in the room would be good! or give us two keys so the room is cool which mozzies dont like!

The breakfast is very simple. Chef available to cook some eggs or an omelette is you so wish. Not to many other choices, and if you're 1 min past 10am, you miss out!

Coffee at breakfast is terrible! horrible! don't rely on this! Go elsewhere for coffee.
Breakfast was included in the room, so its OK , but if you had to pay i would skip it and go for a walk elsewhere for a feed.

The rooms have a balcony / terrace door. The door on room 1108 is very heavy, hard to close and isn't on rails! You can't lock it from the outside as its a key'd door and no key for the room is provided.

On departing the hotel i had to print my boarding pass. BUt i was told the printer and internet area was not working. Great! To top things off i couldn't get my boarding pass.

Overall its an OK hotel. Dont expect to much, and try to get this on the cheap and it should be OK.

They do need to spend some money on maintenance, towels and the general upkeep of the place, but i think in the future on my next bali holiday i will look elsewhere.

The pool is large, and very good with the swim up bar, thats probably the highlight!",Puri Saron Seminyak
225,Not bad for the price.,40,November 2017,"Good value considering beach location. Plenty of eateries out front. Nice breakfast. Room was spacious. I understand people saying ""tired"" our sink tap was rusty on top, water pressure low but ok, toilet seat discoloured but no big issues.",Puri Saron Seminyak
226,Great Staff but outdated & Tired,30,November 2017,"We stayed in a private one bedroom villa which was cleaned beautifully everyday and the pool was awesome. The only setback was the TV was in the corner of the room which could only be viewed from one side of the bed and the garden was messy.
Staff were very nice and helpful and breakfast had a great selection. The grounds were definitely in need of gardeners. The pool lounges were mostly old and tired, the pool was large and well cared for.
Enjoyed our stay but not sure if I would book again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
227,This is the second time staying at Puri Saron. Loved it both times.,50,October 2017,"4118 was a Deluxe room. Room was large and spacious. Furniture matched the decore of the room. Very comfortable.
The service was very good, polite and friendly staff who actually remember your name which is a bonus.
I liked everything about this hotel, the big trees and massive gardens are beautiful. The street entrance to the beach and not far from the markets to do shopping.. The pool, pool bar, the restaurant and all the staff.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Well worth the stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
228,We have stayed here twice and have been happy both times.,50,October 2017,"The service from all staff has been second to none.
The room was comfortable, with all you need for your nights in the room. After all you only need a place to lay your head and freshen up for your next outing.
The pool bar was a good place to unwind after a days outing, or a hop,step and a jump to the beach.
Puri Saron is a lovely family friendly hotel which I would recommend to anyone who may be looking.",Puri Saron Seminyak
229,"Very tired hotel, wouldn‚Äôt recommend",10,November 2017,"After a five night stay at this hotel I can safely say I will never return and I would never recommend this accommodation to anyone travelling to Seminyak. The staff were relatively friendly and responsive which was great, however I struggle to bring any other positives to light. The negatives were many:
Upon arrival at 3:30pm we were told we would need to wait for our room.At 4pm we were led to our room, floor still soaking wet from the cleaner. The strong smell of sewerage in the room was overwhelming at numerous times throughout the day. The towels were more of a off white colour with various stains on them from previous use. They were very hard and looked very much like they were in need of an update. Mosquitoes were consistently in the room, although room doors were closed. Wifi was patchy depending on where you were in the room. The toilets looked very unclean, potentially hadn‚Äôt been cleaned efficiently for some time. There was a stain at the bottom of the toilet for the entire stay. The toilet seat itself appeared stained and dirty. Walls had marks all over them.
This accommodation is at a lower price and accessible part of Seminyak but if I am to return, I will be paying extra to stay somewhere nice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
230,Part of 2 week Bali Holiday,30,October 2017,"Our ""Deluxe"" room was large but had minimal furniture, but all the basics. This is an older style hotel that is very much in need of a refurbishment. Wifi was extremely slow and frustrating. TV with Fox , CNN, etc - many channels. Surrounding gardens and pool area are beautiful and the location is very convenient for beach and restaurants. Breakfast was included and the range of food offered would satisfy all requirements!",Puri Saron Seminyak
231,Loved this hotel so much we extended our stay.,50,October 2017,"Pros - Our room 4114 was large & clean with a large bathroom, excellent staff, the location on the beach in between great beach bars, the buffet breakfast with lots of variety, the beautiful gardens, large social pool & pool bar.

Cons - Non

We will definitely be back, hopefully soon.",Puri Saron Seminyak
232,Awesome family holiday,50,September 2017,"We had 2 weeks here in Puri Saron , 6 adults and 2 children , check in was quick and friendly , the rooms are large and bathroom was nice and big , air con was on constantly which was great., balcony overlooked the gardens leading to the restaurant and the pool, beautiful and quiet views. Breakfast was good fresh eggs , pancakes and plenty of hot food . Pool was huge and you never felt like it was over crowded. Swim up bar was good with good selection of drinks , we drank Bintang :-). the hotel is right on the beach where there are surfing lessons going on in the day and beanbags and sunsets at night , great place to relax have a drink and watch the sunset. I would recommend this hotel to anyone , there was a good age range , couples , families, singles. This hotel accommodates everyone and the staff are amazing. we will all be returning to the Puri , thanks for a great holiday !",Puri Saron Seminyak
233,Another puri saron holiday,50,October 2017,This time at puri we stayed in a deluxe bungalow no.4209 up on the first floor with a private balcony.Our room was lovely with king size bed and seperate bathroom with bath and shower.The staff cleaned our room daily and did an amazing job.All the staff felt more like family than anything else.Great pool with swim up bar and great choice of food which was served to us on our banana lounges.We ate and drank at the pool every day for twelve days and the tab was only $240 australian dollars which we thought was very resonable.Close to shops and all the restaurents.Walking distance.We will be back for sure.,Puri Saron Seminyak
234,Puri is the BEST,50,August 2017,"This hotel has been my home away from home for several years now, the staff here are welcoming and helpful, the manager Alit has always seen to my requests, we love the location as there are many surf breaks from the beachfront location, and some of the best shopping in Bali. I've read some bad reviews about my hotel, as a longtime visitor to the island (26 times) I've stayed just about everywhere, if you want 5 star you will pay ALOT more!! Puri has everything you need for an unforgettable Bali holiday",Puri Saron Seminyak
235,Needs updating - great location,30,September 2017,"Stayed here for two nights with my partner and I can't complain about anything considering how cheap the rates are...pays to remember that you can't live a champaign lifestyle on a goon bag budget.

The room was outdated but very clean. We didn't have hot water but I still can't complain because neither of us worried about informing reception as it was hot out and we were fine having ""cold"" showers.
The hotel is in need of some upgrades but again, you get what you pay for.

Buffet breakfast was substantial - they offer everything you come to expect.

The location is absolutely fantastic! And the gardens are beautiful - credit to their gardener's, they do an amazing job.

The party that was happening a few doors down on both nights was a little bit out of control and probably should have been stopped but we just closed the door and couldn't hear them so it wasn't a big deal for us....I did feel for the people who were in close proximity to them though.

All in all, if you're looking for friendly, affordable service and a hotel that is located a meter from the beach, this hotel is for you.",Puri Saron Seminyak
236,Unhappy,20,September 2017,Still in house been here 7 days so far but tonight takes the cake it's 10:15 I've complained to reception in person and by phone nothing has been done!!!!

237,"Great location but the bed SQUEAKED, which made sleeping impossible.",30,August 2017,"We booked to stay in a Deluxe Garden Bungalow. Sounded lovely, and upon arrival staff were lovely and friendly, beautiful garden setting and so close to the beach. Unfortunately, our room was on the ground floor and there isn't a lot of soundproofing between the floors, as we could hear everything from the floor above - even them just walking around. Our actual room was a real let down too. The bathroom was clean, but peach coloured - very 80's, and the towels were a dirty grey colour & you had to chase the shower nozzle around to get wet. Then there was the bed - it was a lovely looking four poster style. But as soon as you moved it squeaked. It was funny at first - until it was time to go to sleep! We tried to sleep ramrod straight and not move all night, but this was impossible. It was just so noisey! We checked out after two nights and found alternative accommodation. Would not stay here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
238,Just terrible,10,August 2017,"We visited the hotel in Aug 2017 for holidays. The hotel is nicely located, with a nice garden and on the sea but that's about it. Many complaints from our side. The room was quite large but not too clean. Bed lining and towles are very old and grey. Breakfast is limited and boring. The pool area is large but with very few sunbeds that are occupied early in the morning with towels, so after 09.00 it is not possible to find any. Wifi/internet access is terrible with many disconnections. Rooms over the restaurant smell ""fried egg"" each morning from cooking just below (inside/no-ventilation in breakfast/egg-frying area). Bad room service: opposite room had dinner in room and their plates were left on the floor just outide their room for 30 hours! Not recommended overall.",Puri Saron Seminyak
239,Old and tired,20,August 2017,"I last reviewed Puri Saron Hotel Seminyak after our stay in May 2015. We decided to stay there again this year because the location was great and our experience was generally positive.

However, this visit was less enjoyable!

I booked the hotel online as usual. No problems there. I organised airport transfers via email through the hotel front desk.
They debited the entire stay on my ccard upon check-in?? This pissed me off. I thought they must have lot's of guests leave early or do 'runners'?? Not a good sign.
In my experience, payment $$ for the hotel stay is settled upon check-out!

Reservation 5/10

This visit we decided to upgrade to a Superior Delux Room. The room was located above the dining room and closer to the beach/ pool entrance. The only difference between this room and a standard room was 1. it's location and 2. the shower was not located over the bath tub (this meant there was no tub). There was also access to a large verandah overlooking the grounds, etc. Unfortunately this space was communal and not private!
The room was dated, the fridge tiny, curtains ripped, woodwork and tiles fractured and the decor dated.
We had no hot water for 24hrs and the shower would not drain (we had to call maintenance to repair both issues).
Problems like these are unacceptable when guests are paying approx $200 a night.

Room 2/10

We enjoyed a complimentary breakfast daily in the dining room downstairs. Upon check in we were told breakfast was served from 6-10am.
On 1 morning we had an early excursion and went for breakfast at 6am. The kitchen and and floor team were not ready for service and we had to wait until 620am to have breakfast.
Breakfast selection was limited with minimal variety. Hot dishes were never hot!!

Food 2/10

All hotels in Bali have security! I have visited Bali 10 times and always rejoice in the thought that hotel security are keeping us safe; not at Puri Saron!
On 3 separate occasions we left and re-entered the hotel late at night only to find the security guard asleep on a poolside lounge hidden in a dark corner. We deliberately walked directly past them- nothing! Passed out cold.
On 2 other occassions I noted non-guests wonder from the beach into the pool area, pull up lounges, layout their own towels and enjoy the facilities; these facilities I was paying for!
It was completely obvious to us, after our 8 night stay, that hotel security was non existent.

Security 1/10

We awoke 1 morning to find a large section of the poolside grounds stripped of the poolside lounges. In there place were stacks of dining chairs and a framework for a marqi. It was obvious there was some kind of function about to happen. Unfortunately this meant that 1/2 the poolside area was unavailable for guests to use!
I made inquiries and found out the whole poolside grounds were to be used for an outside private function. It would take 2 days for the event to be setup and dismantled. This meant paying inhouse guests would be unable to use the area for 2 days.
I come from hospitality. Hosting a private function in a public space is a no no!!

Everyday we saw guests scambling for poolside lounges. Every morning guests had to wake up early and reserve a poolside lounge just so they had somewhere to hang out during the day. We witnessed 2 separate arguments between guests fighting over the sun beds because there simply were not enough!

1 morning we decided to have a later breakfast and literally walked into a war zone in the dining room. The hotel was obviously at full capacity which meant there were not enough tables and chairs to seat their guests for breakfast. It was a very uncomfortable experience!

Facilities 2/10

Overall we were really disappointed with service and facilities at Puri Saron. We decided to give the hotel a 2nd go in 2 years and were left w regret. The staff provided mediocre service, the facilities were few and old, if available at all and generally the hotel was over priced.

A low 3 star rating here.

Overall experience 4/10

We won't be back üòì",Puri Saron Seminyak
240,Great location but just have breakfast elsewhere,20,August 2017,"Great spot on the beach handy to everything. Rooms are clean, gardens are lovely.

All the other meals I had outside of breakfast in the resort were very good.

However, The breakfast is one star above awful. I don't think anything is cooked fresh from the servery, definitely frozen, and all the pastries come out of a bag. The staff in the breakfast restaurant don't speak English, are definitely not Balinese, and don't know their job or don't care.
So wouldn't pay for breakfast again with the room, probably the worst I've had compared to all the other resorts I've stayed in Bali, and that is quite a few.

241,"Great location, average accommodation",30,July 2017,"The best part about the stay was the location, the resort is just minutes away from the beach, restaurants and shops. The quality of the accomodation was average to say the least. The bath room appeared to have been renovated recently but with out a doubt was the worst job I have ever seen, a child could have done better. We were given a plate of fruit on arrival which was nice how're the dirty plate was latter picked up by staff and placed beside the villa entry door were it stayed for the next 5 days before being collected. The included buffet breakfast was just ok but nothing special. Overall a bit disappointed given the price we payed for the villa pool accomodation. Not sure we would stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
242,Not recommended,10,July 2017,"Be simple and cheap doesn't mean be dirty and abandoned, as you can see at the photos of the bathroom. Location good but not worth at all. Breakfast very poor and a bit dirty. Safety box broken. Toilet paper holders broken. Water tap of the bathtub broken. The bottle to warm up the water to make a coffee with mustiness.",Puri Saron Seminyak
243,Good Location & Great Staff....And that's about it.,30,July 2017,"This was my first time in Bali and I did very little research before undertaking the short-notice trip. After exploring the Seminyak-Legian-Kuta area during my week-long stay, I can safely say that there are much better options in the area than Puri Saron‚Ä¶

As the title of my post infers, this hotel has an excellent location directly onto ‚ÄúBeanbag Beach‚Äù, and amazing staff who are always friendly and helpful. The hotel grounds are massive and extremely well maintained, and there‚Äôs a nice pool with a swim-up bar. The main pool also has 2 adjoining pools for kids, so well-suited for a family stay. Aside from these pro points, there‚Äôs nothing else which makes this hotel stand out.

I can‚Äôt help but think that this was a totally amazing place 15 years ago, because it looks and feels like it‚Äôs still stuck back there in a time-zone. The fittings in the rooms are super-old (save for the LCD TV) and the bathroom is one of the worst that I‚Äôve had after many trips across SE Asia. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs dirty ‚Äì on the contrary, the staff are on point with their daily cleaning ‚Äì but it‚Äôs just that everything is really, really old and hagged. Even the towels were crusty and had taken on a grey hue after clearly been laundered repeatedly for so many years. Aside from the general upkeep of the grounds, maintenance work on the buildings and the actual rooms themselves seems to have been kept to an absolute bare minimum. The breakfast ticked all the main boxes (juices, fruits, bacon, egg station, local dishes) but here again the offerings were in general quite drab and basic at best.

If the daily rate was much lower, then I would say that this is a value-for-money place, but there are definitely other accommodation options in the area which are comparative in terms of cost whilst also offering much more bang for your buck. The hotel obviously leverages the prime location, but had I not pre-paid for the stay, then I would have moved to another location. A few extra quid and a slightly longer walk to the beach would have been worth it.

It‚Äôs a pity, though, because I liked the overall ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the hotel, but there‚Äôs clearly no investment being made to help keep the place even mildly modern. The efforts of the amazing staff is probably the main factor keeping this massive dinosaur alive, and primarily for this reason only I‚Äôll rate the Puri Saron as average at best.",Puri Saron Seminyak
244,One of Bali's best,50,September 2016,"I love staying at Puri Saron. Located on the beach of Semiyak there is no walking to the beach here or the nightly entertainment on the beach or restaurants. The staff are super friendly and although older style they take extreme pride in this beauty. Love the swim up bar, the pool area is large enough for everyone to get a sun lounge. Breakfast has a huge variety to choose from and there is a wood fire pizza and a restaurant at the beach end of the hotel. I recommend the Nutella Pizza - my kids loved it",Puri Saron Seminyak
245,Another excellent stay at Puri Saron!,50,June 2017,"Arrived at the Puri Saron which would be our 4th visit and we were offered an upgrade to a ground floor bungalow! This was an excellent start to our week long holiday. The bungalow was excellent, quiet with an lovely verandah overlooking the gardens which we enjoyed.
As usual the staff were excellent, always happy and attentive.
The pool area is lovely with the swim up bar and lunch options.
This hotel has a great mix of Australian and European travellers and has a great location with beach bars directly in front on the beach.
Reception staff were excellent booking restaurants etc.
We will definitely be back again.
Hank you for an excellent holiday!",Puri Saron Seminyak
246,"Nice hotel, but noisy",30,June 2017,"We have just returned from Puri Saron hotel. We liked the grounds, gardens and staff, but the hotel is not what I'd call 4 star. Like lots of hotels in Bali , the bathrooms were a bit old and need a good clean. The bath tub under the shower, dodgy power points ,grey old towels and slippery floors.
Breakfast was ok, but not too much variety of hot foods. The main thing we disliked was the constant music coming from the beach bars, night and day. No relief. When trying to relax , music was coming from the pool bar, and 2 other cafes onsite as well. Became quite annoying by the end of our holiday.
Location on the beach is good , easier to walk along the beach and see great sunsets. Or to walk into Kuta instead of grabbing a taxi, as the traffic is terrible. Close to many good restaurants, shops and bars. Heads up ,a big hotel in process of being built next door . The Seminyak we once knew is changing, not how we remembered. Shame.",Puri Saron Seminyak
247,A Pleasant Escape,40,June 2017,"This hotel have a great location (Seminyak beach is behind this hotel and La Plancha also behind this hotel), great staff, breakfast was delicious, great pool and calming ambience.I stayed in their Villa for 3days. They have 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom villa. We rented both. The villa have a small private pool,it was a decent pool if you just want to play with your family. The villa located near their restaurant and public pool, quite near from the beach. Plus they give us a complimentary waffle in their cafe,it was delicious!",Puri Saron Seminyak
248,Outdated but great locationn,30,June 2017,"Firstly this resort was highly recommended to my partner and I for a 6 night stay in Seminyak. Both of us have been to Bali many times before and had a fair idea of what to expect although we have found that we could have stayed in much nicer, cleaner accomodation for similar pricing.
The location of the resort is good, its right on the beach and walking distance from a lot of cool little restaurants and bars - we are a younger couple so the music of la plancha didn't bother us one bit, we spent a lot of our time there.
We arrived to the resort reasonably late and after getting to our room we found - 2 power points did not work, the bath/shower and toilet were dirty and a dead cockroach had laid to rest next to the bed side table. Immediately we rang reception and they changed our room there and then.
The second room didn't have any dead insects or un-workable power points but it did have a terrible air conditioner that made a horrible mechanical sound constantly. Without wanting to be real nuisances we put up with the sound ( we found if we used it on a lower level it wasn't as loud ).
The room was made up daily - the towels are a dirty grey colour and felt as though they were as old as the resort and the complimentary bottles of water given in the room you can take about 3 sips from before it's gone.
The grounds of the resort are absolutely beautiful and kept neat and tidy, but perhaps more should be put into the rooms.
The Buffett breakfast is by far the worse we have both ever experienced whilst in Bali. There is little to no choice, the bacon is drenched in oil and fried into rubber. The fruit was not fresh and their was one choice of yoghurt - natural which tasted sour or a condensed milk/custard type liquid which was also no good. The egg station was ordinary, but sufficient.
The coffee was terrible, burnt every morning and was filled way to high in the cup to add milk even when asked not to.
We ate out on 3 of the mornings to avoid the breakfast.
Albeit the staff were always lovely and friendly and went above and beyond to help their customers, it just seems this resort could be so much more if a little more was put into it and a few upgrades to the rooms were made.",Puri Saron Seminyak
249,Beach side,30,June 2017,"Lovely old hotel. Close to the beach but very tired, a good refit would help. The staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive. We felt very comfortable and ""at home"", overlooking the age of the place as you do when visiting family. Grounds are pretty the beach is at your door and there is good dining nearby.",Puri Saron Seminyak
250,Overrated place,20,June 2017,"The place is old and damp, breakfast is no where a 4 star hotel
Room had a musty feel all the time and since ours was located above the restaurant, all the cooking smells gets in the room

Rooms not insulated, so crazy drunks guests can be heard yelling and shouting

And the beach was open to public,, with large speakers blasting away

Not an idyllic place at all",Puri Saron Seminyak
251,Lovely staff but hotel needs upgrading,30,June 2017,"Having stayed at another hotel in Bali ony a week before for a similar price it was most disappointing to find the state of this Hotel which had been well recommended to us and we had tentatively booked to return to at the end of August with friends who have been regular guests over a number of years. The staff at reception were lovely and we were quickly shown to our room with luggage. As it was late afternoon we had a rest and then ventured into the gardens and down towards the pool area and two concession restaurants in the gardens. We opted for the Italian one on the left hand side and chose our food and drink. Soon after getting them, a large rat ran across my partners foot, which managed to kill the evening and the rest of the stay dead! It appeared a second time and although we mentioned it to the staff they expressed no concern or interest in the episode. At night the lighting around the resort is poor and in our room you could hardly read a book by the room lights. Sadly also the bedding and towels were grey so you felt you were drying yourself down with a towel that a whole army had used. At the back of the hotel on the beach are two bars, one La Planchia and the other whose name i am not sure. Every night there was a competition as to who could be the loudest and most unpleasant so you couldn't even really enjoy the Blu Wave restaurant and Bar which was pleasant and had lovely attentive staff and good food. Quite disappointing.",Puri Saron Seminyak
252,"Great location, lovely staff",30,June 2017,"The resort is quite dated and in need of some basic upgrades including decent lighting in the rooms and dealing with the damp problem. The breakfast is ordinary and the coffee is terrible. Despite this, it is in a great location for a reasonably priced beach holiday and the staff are friendly and welcoming.",Puri Saron Seminyak
253,Great little traditional Balinese Resort,50,June 2017,"From the time we checked in we received a warm welcome and upgrade to a Junior Suite.

The staff of this resort are warm and welcoming. Any requests are actioned quickly and without fuss...
All with warm Bali smiles!

I had the pleasure of meeting with Made Sukarsa and Ms Liza. Thank you both for looking after us

The pool swimup bar is fantastic.

Had dinner our last night in the resort restaurant. Lovely food ans quieter than the beach restaurants

We would come back to Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak

255,Another wonderful stay,50,May 2017,"Have just returned from another three week stay at Puri Saron. This is my go to bali accommodation. The staff are wonderful always remember your name. Nothing is ever a problem when arranging the room via email before arrival. Lovely fruit basket on arrival. Staff are kind and honest, always happy to leave my belongings just in my room. Housekeeping are all so friendly and cannot do enough to help. The breakfast is always good. Right on the double six beach, one minute walk to bean bags at sunset. Awesome pool and pool bar with friendly waiters. Rooms are spacious and any issues always rectified very quickly. Love this place will be back again soon",Puri Saron Seminyak
256,Good location is about it,20,June 2017,"Good location, right on the beach!! They were doing renovations when we were there and we had to call reception at midnight to ask them to stop as we couldn't sleep!!! Our drain in the shower wouldn't drain so had to keep turning the shower off every 2 minutes!!! Said they wouldn't do the renovation work that late anymore, but then it started at 6:00am. Just an OK place to stay, might have been better without the noise, who knows, wouldn't stay here again!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
257,Old but lovely,30,May 2017,"We stayed for 10 days and although it was old in some aspects, it was everything we needed. The staff were fantastic and friendly, food was good, straight off the beach and close to the main area of Seminyak. I would stay here again!",Puri Saron Seminyak
258,Loved it!,50,July 2016,"Puri Saron in Seminyak was beautiful, highly recommend for everyone from couples to families.

Staff were extremely friendly, rooms were clean and a decent size.

Has a massive pool and bar overlooking the beach.
You can walk across the road to Laplancha beach bar and chill on the beanbags all arvo.

Definitely be staying again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
259,Great Location,30,May 2017,"Pros: Great Location-backs right on the beach and close to shopping area and nice restaurants/bars, friendly staff, nice pool with swim up bar, pretty gardens.
Cons: Rooms were very dated, crumbly walls, bathroom wasn't overly nice and the toilet was stained and unclean looking. Towels were grey and old some with stains on them, we stayed on the 3rd floor in one of the superior rooms- no lift. I don't mind walking but I felt sorry for the bell boys hauling up luggage. Breakfast got boring very quick and the tea and coffee was terrible.
Overall- Would stay again, maybe in a nicer room and if you got a good discounted rate. Definitely would have been more disappointed if I had paid more.",Puri Saron Seminyak
260,Love this hotel,50,May 2017,"After a week of hustle and bustle of Kuta for a family 18th birthday celebration, it was so nice to return to our favourite hotel on Seminyak beach. The relaxing pool overlooking the beach and beautiful grounds were the perfect way to end our last week in Bali. We always stay in the bungalows which are roomy with large bathroom. The beach has a lively atmosphere with cafes and their colourful lanterns, beanbags and live music to watch the sunset. Only short walking distance to a wide range of restaurants. The staff at Puri Saron ensure you feel as though you are their most important guest, no matter how busy they are. We love it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
261,Nice even for a bigger hotel,50,April 2017,"I'm not much of a fan of huge hotels, but for a bigger sized one, our stay was still pleasant. The pool was a decent size, and the location was amazing. Basically beach front. Decent distance from the airport as well, although there is often traffic getting there seeing how you have to use the only main road. Would definitely recommend.",Puri Saron Seminyak
262,Great position - sea front,40,February 2017,"We had 3 nights here, just a short stay before heading to Ubud. Chose this hotel for its position on the beachfront & being close to Double Six. Open air dining for breakfast, which was very good buffet style, different food each morning. Reception friendly, rooms spacious, ground very well kept. The pool was rather warm & some wooden planks needed fixing as they were a trip hazard. We reported to Reception. Lots of shopping close by, bean bags opposite on the beach, which we loved. Overall a great stay. Would stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
263,Not the best visit.,20,May 2017,"Staff nice. Grounds very nice. Room could have been cleaner. We had to sanitise and clean the vinyl couch. Bathroom shower mouldy. Door was dodgy and concerned us a bit. The room safe could be removed by a 3 year old with minimal force. Didn't get face washers and towels were not the cleanest with stains, they smelt clean but its a bit if a turn off. 3 Staff at restaurant were working hard to squeeze a blackhead or a pimple on a staff members face which was it in the food department for us (no eating here). Drain blocked in shower but staff did fix quick however the small lingered on. Main positive was location.",Puri Saron Seminyak
264,Good experience.,40,May 2017,"This Puri Saron (Seminyak) is a great hotel in comparison to it's sister hotel in Lombok, Senggigi.
The rooms are clean and comfortable but a lack of shelf space in the cupboard meant that most clothes had to stay in the suitcase. The overhead shower worked fine after cleaning out the nozzles and the absence of a shower door had a bit more water outside the shower than necessary.
The WiFi is free with a connect speed of 65Mbs and signal strength of 75 dBm (fair-poor) with frequent drop-outs. Could do with an upgrade.
The dining area is open plan and has a wide selection. Does cater for Western & Asian cuisine. Quality is excellent and staff are very pleasant & helpful.
There is a large pool with bar service and is well maintained. Beyond the pool is the access to the beach with chair & umbrellas for hire. Numerous sellers ply their wares on the path between the line of hotels & the beach, also necessitating some Keanu Reeves moves to avoid the scooters zooming up & down the path. The beach area is fairly well pack with tourists most times of the day and the sunset view is worth the wait.",Puri Saron Seminyak
265,Just like coming home,50,April 2017,"We have just returned from our 6th stay at Puri Saron. We didn't go to Bali last year, so 2 years since our last stay. We went to breakfast and were greeted personally by the staff. They not only remembered our names, but showed us to our favourite table. They have employed a new chef since our last stay, and what we thought was good food before is even better now. We love relaxing by the pool and sipping fresh juices. Ardika who works in the pool bar greeted me with my favourite juice and welcomed us to Puri Saron (also knew our names) We actually had a couple of hiccups with our room this time - nothing major. The problem was solved nearly before we had time to hang up the phone. Each day the manager would talk to us to ensure we were enjoying our stay. All of the staff from management to gardeners to kitchen staff make a point of saying hello and asking if we are ok. Just love this place, just like going home.",Puri Saron Seminyak
266,More than we expected,40,May 2017,There were three staying at Puri this time.From the moment we arrived we knew we had selected a great holiday destination.Easy check in on arrival by a smiling and helpful staff.We stayed in a Deluxe Room with garden view room 2111 which looked up to the restaurent and small walk to the pool.Breakfast was great every morning with a great choice.We had pancakes or eggs most mornings but something for everybody.The pool area was great with a great swim up bar which was very reasonably priced which you can order food from which is delivered to your sun lounge beside the pool.There is also three restaurants on the property.2 at the back that overlook the beach and the Puri restaurant.Our favourite was Blue water excellent food and service and amazingly cheap.All service pool area.You can hire a motorbike from the front tourism desk for 70000 a day or 7 australian dollars.Excellent choice of restaurants within walking distance from the resort.Along the beach laneway or up into the main street of Seminyak.Our favourite was Mozzerellas.There is always the beach bars with their been bags and live music every night and drinks and food and of course.Would recommend to anyone for a great holiday experience.We are going back in October.Says it all.,Puri Saron Seminyak
267,Great,40,April 2017,"We have just returned from a eight night stay at puri saron
It was great , not a new resort but it has everything you need plus more
We stayed in a bungalow room facing a really beautiful garden , the room was large enough with a very big bathroom
A little run down but everything works and is clean
I would have liked a small table and chairs in the room instead of the large uncomfortable chair that took up far to much room
Nice and quiet at night which is exactly what we wanted
Breakfast was good , there is plenty of it but I would have liked to see more fresh fruit varieties
The staff where wonderful , so polite and helpful
Pool was good also , my only complaint would be that there needs to be some shade available in the water , maybe a shade sail or two
Right on the beach front with access to at least six different eateries , if you didn't want to wander to far it's all right on your doorstep
The beach really is wonderful at night , with all the eateries having bean bags on the beach with live bands every night
This resort boasts some really beautiful gardens and they are maintained on a daly basis
All in all this is a three star resort so for what we paid it was great and would probably stay here again",Puri Saron Seminyak
268,Great Location,50,April 2017,Very warm welcome. Great staff and great swim up pool bar. We spent 7 nights with friends and found the location great. Far enough from Kuta and legian but still close enough to enjoy restaurants. shops and sight seeing.,Puri Saron Seminyak
269,"Great location, but could do with a bit of TLC",30,April 2017,"Four of us arrived at Puri Saron from the UK, so we were tired and hot when we arrived. We were shown to our deluxe rooms and were very disappointed. The rooms smelt damp, were sparsely furnished and the laminate flooring was lifting. I rang reception and they very promptly moved us to a garden room which was a big and and spacious.

On the whole, the hotel was nice, the staff very helpful and friendly, breakfast was plentiful and the location is perfect as it is right on the beach at Seminyak. My only criticism is that certain parts of the hotel look tired and could do with a bit of a refurb, but it was fine for the four nights we spent there.",Puri Saron Seminyak
270,Great location.,30,April 2017,"When we arrived in the middle of the day the aircon wasn't on so the room was extremely hot , was disappointing to arrive into a hotbox. The pool area was a little tired but plenty of shade to relax in . Breakfast was ok , disappointed the pastries were stale . The location was great . Possibly revisit but look at upgraded room without breakfast included .",Puri Saron Seminyak
271,"Quiet, relaxing hotel",40,April 2017,"My mother and I spent 9 nights in this hotel. It was very quiet and relaxing. The rooms are well-furbished and clean, albeit very humid. The walls are very thin too so you have to pray for quiet neighbours. The breakfasts were delicious: I advise you to make the most of the cooks who are there to make cr√™pes, eggs and such. The omelettes and pancakes were especially tasty. The pool bar was also very convenient and pleasant: there's nothing like enjoying a fresh coconut while sitting in the pool. The new Bluewater restaurant is also very tasty and cheap. The location of the hotel is amazing: right on the beach, which is perfect for long walks with amazing landscapes. It is also very easy to walk from the hotel to the ""city"" part of Seminiyak, with restaurants and shops. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and we have enjoyed both the tours we booked through the hotel. It is definitely a very nice place for a family or couple holiday.",Puri Saron Seminyak
272,Relaxing Stay,30,April 2017,"Our 11 night stay was very relaxing. The hotel and lovely gardens are traditional Balinese style, all staff were very friendly and courteous. The pool area and pool itself, whilst in need of some maintenance is in a great spot overlooking the beach which is just across the motorcycle/walking path. Lounges were always plentiful with choice of sun or shade. Swim up bar and food prices were reasonable.
We stayed in a junior suite which was huge but had disappointing decor consisting of ""flat pack"" cheap contemporary style furniture. The room safe was small so take note if you're expecting to lock away any device larger than an iPad mini.
The biggest let down for this hotel are the towels. Each day we were supplied with putrid smelling, grey/yellow towels often covered in stains. The worst towel we received had dark brown stains (faeces or self tan lotion perhaps) which my husband personally took to reception. House keeping then delivered two newer looking white soft towels. The next day we received the old towels again.
The pool towels are also old and smell of sweat once they are wet.
Our shower looked modern with a ""rainfall"" style shower head but there was barely any water pressure. My daughter and I both have long thick hair so showering took us double the time and none of us ever felt entirely clean.
Breakfast at the hotel was adequate with a selection of all the basics but we missed having a variety of fresh fruits and good hot coffee. The coffee here didn't smell great and was lukewarm at best. After a few days we didn't look forward to breakfast any more and on day 12 (our last day) we went out for breakfast elsewhere (Dusty Cafe - best breakfast we had).
The hotel is a few minutes taxi ride to ""Eat Street"" and Seminyak Square, we never paid more than Rp20,000/AUD2 (always insist drivers turn their meters on) or when the tide is low you can walk along the beach approx 30 mins. Go 30 mins the other way and you will end up at Jl Padma, Legian where you will find cheaper market style shopping (go to Garlic Lane and Jl Melasti).
It is unfortunate we can't rate this hotel higher. The towels here are totally unacceptable and management should look at replacing them as a matter of urgency. Even if we were staying in two star budget accom, we would still expect clean towels.",Puri Saron Seminyak
273,Ideal location on the beach,40,March 2017,"Puri Sarong is a ideally located on the beach, surrounded by many locally owned restaurant and bars. The hotel, although it is starting to look a bit dated and needs a bit of TLC. The hotel has character and the gardens are well established.
Staff is very friendly and helpful.
The rooms are larger than most and clean, although a must , damp smell was around most times, this appeared to come from the water in the bathroom.
The pool is excellent , with a swim up bar.
It is also a short walk to the shops and bars.
This hotel is well worth considering for the next stay in Bali",Puri Saron Seminyak
274,"Quiet, great setting",40,April 2016,"We really loved this hotel. It retains the traditional Balinese feel, is quiet, tranquil and very welcoming. The staff are very friendly and always courteous and helpful.
A great feature for us was the ability to sit in one of two open walled restaurants within the grounds and watch the hustle and bustle in the roadway below, or relax on a lounge in the hotel and look across the roadway (lane) to the beach and the open sea.
The hotel is only a very short walk to plenty of shops and restaurants, a great spot to stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
275,Enjoyable Stay,40,March 2017,"Overall very good value for money. We stayed for 5 nights with friends and enjoyed it immensely, particularly the pool bar. Room we had (4701) was nice, whilst starting to get a little tired in spots it still had a lot more ""character"" than the newer rooms around the pool area. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The location is sensational - right opposite the beach with all the bean bags at sunset. Shopping, restaurants and bars are all close by, and we also walked to Kuta along the beach in about 40mins. Gardens are beautiful and well maintained. Only suggestion for management is to update the towels in the room as they were stained and old.",Puri Saron Seminyak
276,Perfect position by the beach,30,March 2017,Friendly welcome and greetings by front desk staff whenever we passed through reception. Pool and gardens old style Bali but photos don't do these areas justice. Rooms very large and always clean. All linen looked new (some reviews stated linen was discoloured and old). We had problems with the airconditioner but prompt response fixed the problem. Perfect view of pool area and beach from our verandah is not found often in this hotel's price range. Great central position with all you need in walking distance. Breakfast is very basic but all you need with many dining options close to the hotel if you wanted something different.,Puri Saron Seminyak
277,BEAUTIFUL,50,February 2017,"Great ground floor room, quiet and well appointed. Clean well serviced rooms. Comfortable beds. Excellent breakfasts, amazing well kept gardens leading to the beach. Nice swim up bar and pools. We really enjoyed our stay. Close to the busy part of town but tucked away and quiet.",Puri Saron Seminyak
278,Beautiful Hotel by the beach,40,January 2017,"We arrived at our room at 00:00 after a long flight and the staff were at reception ready to welcome us. They took us to our room and sorted us out. We had expected a room with a balcony as all the super deluxe room pics had balconies but turned out they didn't all come with one. We were disapointed and the manager said he would assist in trying to move us to a deluxe room with one.

The room itself was large, clean and very neat with a huge double bed and a tv and bar fridge. The bathroom was also very modern and well renovated. The shower drain was clogged up the first morning and there was a bit of overflow but they came and fixed that the next morning.

We spent new years eve there and went to the gala dinner which was in a hall and very nice. The food was abundant and very good. The breakfast in the morning was a highlight as they made the eggs on the spot to your order and there was a whoe array of different breakfast items from continental to hot foods.

It was my mothers birthday on new years day and the manager organised a birthday cake sent to the room which was very thoughtful and delicious. We really appreciated this kindness.

The pool was beautiful and large with a swim up bar. We spent quite a lot of time there. It rained quite a lot due to it being wet season, however it was very hot. There is a pizza restaurant right on the premises as well as a very fancy (expensive) one as well looking over the beach.

There is a small dirt road between the beach and hotel. The beach was a disappointment as the sand was black and filled with rubbish, which may be due to the time of the year and the parties. There were tons of restaurants along the beach with vibey music. A really good atmosphere.

All in all, a very convenient, pretty hotel with good food and very friendly staff.",Puri Saron Seminyak
279,Great value for money,40,February 2017,This place is good value for $$ yes its basic but rooms a large .. yes there is mould in the bathroom so has most other places in Bali... could do with a can of mozzie spray in each room... breaky good and pool great ... lovely lovely staff will bring me back,Puri Saron Seminyak
280,Amenities great for Seminyak. Rooms need serious upgrade.,30,February 2017,"Having used our room as a launch pad to explore Seminyak and visit friends in the area, this hotel was perfect for us -- lovely pool and garden area, filling breakfast, beach access across the motorcycle path, and terrific beach cafe. We were in our room to sleep and change clothes/shower for two nights, as we were visiting friends in Canggu (highly recommend!). The hotel had two negatives: a) the rooms, which are very, very basic for a ""resort"", yet work if okay with no frills accommodations, and b) the staff, which could be trying for anyone with limited patience.

We checked in very late due to a flight delay, and were given ""welcome drink"" coupons to be used at the pool bar. It being Bali and a vacation spot, and the fact that we were encouraged to use at the pool bar, we made a calculated effort (i.e.. adjusted plans) to put these to use. What a disappointment to learn this drink consists of apple and cranberry juice... we could have easily gone elsewhere and paid less for the drinks we eventually ordered, and perhaps received faster service.

The hotel did provide a fun delivery of a valentines day tart when we arrived -- even very late -- which we got a kick from.

Breakfast was great, yet ends at 10AM sharp.

...Just be careful in the bathrooms in the breakfast room. Like most of Indonesia, humidity is an issue, and a woman got stuck in one of the stalls as the lock wouldn't turn due to the moisture in the air! Fun times.",Puri Saron Seminyak
281,Family trip tp Bali.,30,February 2017,Enjoyed the old Bali style and gardens were beautiful. Pool was great and the beach was close. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was a little ordinary but may improve in high season.,Puri Saron Seminyak
282,Well positioned,40,February 2017,"I had reservations about booking this hotel from the reviews but booked it anyway because of its position. I was in a ""deluxe"" room which might have been deluxe some years ago but now a bit tired - let down mainly by the floor and the bathroom. Many reviews mentioned ""dirty"" At first that was also my impression of the bathroom until on closer inspection, I noticed it to rather be a very unfortunate selection of grouting colour rather than dirt or mould on the lower tiles. Breakfasts were good. There are many good restaurants in the area especially along the beachfront. This is not as bad a hotel to stay in as you may get from some of the reviews. I can't say I was disappointed in any respect.",Puri Saron Seminyak
283,Accommodation/Location at Puri Saron,40,October 2016,Great location. On the the beach with restaurants out front. Accommodation very comfortable. Close to both centre of Kuta and Seminyak. Pool bar with lots of poolside seating. Great breakfast buffet. Will stay again.,Puri Saron Seminyak
284,Very disappointed,20,January 2017,"I booked a ground floor Deluxe room for my family (2Ad & 2Ch) and unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with this hotel. The room had a terrible mouldy smell (which did not go away) and the bathroom flooded EVERY time we took a shower. After notifying the staff of this issue (and expecting to be moved to another room), they simply offered to come and clean the bathroom after our showers. I felt it necessary to take a photo of our supposedly ""clean"" bathroom after the staff had attended to our basin that was not working (see attached photos).
The staff were always very friendly and helpful but this hotel is far from ""4 star"" as rated by ""Hotels Combined"".
In the end, we decided to check out a day early as we couldn't bear to be here another night. We will definitely not be returning to this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
285,Fifth time,40,January 2017,"This Hotel still rates highly for its location and the staff. Alit, Wiwik, Priskila and the other staff always make your stay friendly and welcoming. Its location right on the beach with restaurants, shopping, banking, laundry, transport and other facilities very close by gives you just about everything you need. My wife and I have stayed here many times as have family and friends. There has never been an issue with cleanliness, noise, smells or any other issues raised by others about the Hotel. Depending on the time of year you visit Bali the beach can be a little dirty due to weather/tidal conditions. This is not the fault of the Hotel and the beach is cleaned daily by local workers and other volunteers to make it as presentable as possible. Locals and visitors have no problem swimming and surfing out the front of the Hotel and late in the afternoon locals and visitors have no problem in congregating to watch the spectacular sunsets, play a quickly arranged game of soccer or to sit in a bean bag on the sand with a drink. Great fun to watch and witness and right on the Hotels doorstep. It is not a five star Hotel but it suits my needs very well. It appears to suit the needs of many other people from many other countries as well. will be back for a sixth visit this time next year.",Puri Saron Seminyak
286,Very Sad,20,January 2017,"This trip for me reminds me of the movie 'Return to Oz' I have stayed at Puri Saron (many years ago) and as my partner and I were stranded in Bali for one night decided to stay here again!

Well how sad - this place has gone to ruin! What was once a magical oasis is now old and dreary! And we stayed in one of the premium suites!!

Swim up pool bar still has the coldest beer you will ever drink which is good!

Towels and linens need a wash!

Fireworks and two restaurants both on the water (with differing live entertainment) kept us awake all night!

If it wasn't so close to the beach which allowed me to go for a nice run up to Kuta and back I would have given it zero stars",Puri Saron Seminyak
287,Disappointing,20,December 2016,"This is in a great area and has some lovely staff. However the hotel is very run down, the rooms smelly and the pool area quite old. I am so glad we only stayed one night.... and we only stayed at the hotel to sleep (it was not a place you wanted to hang out)",Puri Saron Seminyak
288,Hotel Near Beach,40,January 2017,"Close to beach, awesome pool
Beach (like most in the area) is not worth visiting as very dirty with a lot of garbage.
Nice hotel, clean and has a safe for valuables.
Near beach restaurants (overpriced) but 20-30 minute walk from shopping area.",Puri Saron Seminyak
289,A Grand Old Lady,40,January 2017,"A grand old lady
Full of charm and character despite showing a wrinkle here and there.
Location, location, location!
Reasonably priced
If you want to sit by the luxury pool with the ‚Äúbeautiful people‚Äù at Cocoon next to Double Six with your ears ringing from the Doof-Doof music then Puri Saron is not for you.
Gorgeous gardens and space. Excellent pool area overlooking the beach. An amazing, gigantic tree by the pool/beach area
Our room (super deluxe) on second floor was clean and spacious with a balcony with lovely outlook.
Rooms near the beach/pool are probably nicer. The Super Deluxe rooms are spacious and new. Those on the second floor are a better idea.
Excellent wifi! Great air-con.
Breakfast is the usual fruit, juices, omelettes, pancakes etc - very nice.
There are a dozen beach-front restaurants just out the door and 200 metres either side of the hotel. You‚Äôve got to have a sunset dinner at one of them.
Staff are helpful and friendly.. The area is always clean and swept by a busy team.
If I had to list cons - sometimes the water pressure is low, the white bathroom towels are a distinct shade of grey, sometimes the music from the poolside restaurants is a tad loud if you‚Äôre having an afternoon nap.
Nearby restaurants worth a visit: Champlung - Beef Rendang, K Resto - Seafood grill & Nasi Kampur, Warung Bola - Pizza, Red rice, Satays,
Plenty of Bali shopping within 300 metres.
Overall the Puri Saron is a rare gem, well located and well priced.",Puri Saron Seminyak
290,Cozy Evening,50,August 2016,"There's nice hotels, i love the pizza. stunning gardens, and the pool it's very nice. so Close to the beach and can see the great sunsets over there with a bottle of beer...
it's nice to bring family here. :-)

ps :
hope the beach can free from litter and plastic bag someday! :-D",Puri Saron Seminyak
291,Really nice and cozy place,50,December 2016,"Not hard to find this hotel. It's in the middle of a really nice place. You can find many cafe, restaurant, shopping place, or any place that really interesting. Also, you can go to the beach directly from this hotel. I believe this hotel will win a scenery award because they really have a nice spot to watch sunset.",Puri Saron Seminyak
292,Filthy beaches,30,January 2017,The hotel was very pleasant with stunning gardens and pool and so close to the beach but sadly the beaches are full of litter and plastic. You had to see it to believe it. We were in Bali in 1989 and had a wonderful time. We returned to enjoy the surf and warm sea. But after two days we read that people get sick swimming in this filthy water and so we swam no more. We would not recommend Bali for a holiday if you are going there for a beach holiday. The water for a bath was only hot in the afternoon and I live a hot bath. The internet was not good.,Puri Saron Seminyak
293,Family Christmas Trip to Bali (2nd Villa),20,December 2016,"This Hotel was in the perfect location in a beautiful country, but the standard of the hotel was lacking, the entrance was quiet run down, the rooms were not very modern and had a lack of cleanliness, the breakfast was a big let down too, on most of the reviews we saw that the breakfasts were amazing that turned out not to be the case the eggs were soggy, the pancakes were inedible and the french toast was a disaster. But on the upside the pool was great and the pool bar I thought was amazing. The one thing that I think could help this hotel is it needs some modernising.",Puri Saron Seminyak
294,Adequate. Showing its age.,30,January 2017,"Location is convenient with Circle K just outside and some good bars and food nearby. Pool is nice and big with a swim up bar. Breakfasts are the same as every hotel breakfast in Bali. Hotel staff are helpful with any bookings like travel and restaurants etc. Overall its nice, but aged.",Puri Saron Seminyak
295,a standard hotel like many others,30,December 2016,"Rooms are ok even if they are called bungalows and they are not. Breakfast ok but not amazing. The location in very good, just a couple of meters from the beach that unfortunately during this period was full of garbage. An Italian place for dinner is available almost on the side of the pool. Very bad is the organization of transfer to other places on the side of the entrance (road opposite respect the beach): the only way to go out is walking or accepting the unfair tariffs of local abusive taxi. Not even allowed regular taxi. The hotel should be better organized and inform the customers. Better to walk outside and get regular taxi at the main road.",Puri Saron Seminyak
296,Amazing!,50,January 2017,We love this hotel. Older Balinese style with beautiful gardens. We come twice a year. The staff are so nice and can't do enough for you. The rooms are big and clean. 20m to Seminyak beach. Purwi the manager is wonderful and always fulfills our requests. If you want sterile western style accomodation this is not for you. This is homely bali style. Room 6201 is amazing with view of beach. Fantastic breakfast served daily.its not 5 star but worth every cent. Give it a try üëåüëåüëå,Puri Saron Seminyak
297,Xmas and New Year Stay,50,December 2016,"We have stayed at the Puri before and that is why we go back....the staff are great ....always happy and helpful.....although one of our favourites is longer there ...Wayan Sumerta.....who we missed as so did many of the other guests...‚ù§‚ù§
The position of this resort is the best ......rooms are great.........food is great
But it is the people that make the place......
Thanks again guys for a great time
We will be back
Cheers

298,On the beach & very friendly,40,December 2016,"Although the hotel has been around for over 8 years& there are some minor maintenance issues, the location is great, the staff are great, we don't go on holidays to stay in our rooms, so this location for the price you pay is awesome.... Book it, you will not be disappointed, unless you want to waste your money on a resort where they try to keep you within thier walls, come & walk the beach, watch the sunset from the pool bar, what else can I say.",Puri Saron Seminyak
299,Location is perfect!!!!,50,December 2016,"We stayed for a week at the Puri Saron and had a very relaxing week.
The rooms were very clean and spacious and the air con worked perfectly keeping it nice and cool.
The hotel had a swim up pool bar which was a must for our stay and it and the pool was perfect and very clean. plenty of pool loungers too.
The Hotel is beach facing and just a short stroll to heaps of bars available outside the hotel grounds.
Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and always made us feel welcome.
Breakfast was great each day and offered some Balinese style dishes on top of the normal western options.
Reception staff were always very helpful and friendly.

I would highly recommend staying here and would choose to stay here next time we come to bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
300,Great location,40,December 2016,"Excellent location, right at the beach.
Stayed at the bungalow chalet and the room and bathroom was spacious.
We loved food, breakfast, and the in room dining meal was delicious and at a good value too.
Was surprised that when we arrived there was this cute white-brown cat sleeping at the room terrace, but since I love cats, I really enjoyed its company :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
301,See you next year!,40,July 2016,"We return to Puri Saron year after year. Perfectly situated right on the beach. Great pool area and pool bar. Rooms are comfortable, I especially like the deluxe chalets that overlook the lush garden. The best part about Puri Saron is the staff, some of which have become good friends. They are all so welcoming, helpful and attentive. Nothing is too much trouble. The staff here are the main reason we keep coming back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
302,Like going home,50,July 2016,We just love this place. The staff are just wonderful. They all have a way of making you feel very special. Breakfast is great - lots of variety. The pool is huge and always able to get a sun lounge. Right on the beach. The staff at the pool bar go over and beyond. They also make coffee.,Puri Saron Seminyak
303,Lovely hotel,40,December 2016,"breakfast good!
room spacious!
air con cool!
perfect location!
large pool!
swim up bar!
nice restaurants on site and its on the beach.
perfect locations for any occasion
top of everything staffs are helpful and friendly",Puri Saron Seminyak
304,Nice stay,30,December 2016,"The location is as good as you could wish for, opposite the beach and beach side restaurants.
We enjoyed our stay at the Puri Saron, apart from a couple of yobs around the pool.
Our room was always clean, the breakfast was ok.
There are so many places to stay in Bali will try somewhere else next time.",Puri Saron Seminyak
305,Puri Saron - You Never Let Us Down,50,July 2016,"We are regular visitors to Bali and have frequented quite a few Resorts on the Island. We do however keep returning to Puri Saron in Seminyak. It has great location, fabulous ambiance and most of all excellent staff confidently led by Elit Merta. Not too much to fault about the Puri Saron. We stay in the bungalows. Cleaning staff are great and gardening staff are inconspicuous, but turn out a great amenity. Our only gripe is the breakfast which is quite plentiful and abundant but is very mundane. Sometimes we even venture out for a change up. We highly recommend the Puri Saron and think that the pool bar staff are fabulous and capably led by Ardika. Paul and Tracy, Busselton WA",Puri Saron Seminyak
306,On beachfront- Great Breakfasts,30,November 2016,"One of the mid=range hotels but the gardens are very spacious. Pool near beach is quite nice and the buffet breakfast was good. Only downside is the inter-connecting doors between rooms allowed noise to travel and air-conditioners were noisy.
This hotel is for the younger set or groups of friends or families who want to visit beachfront venues which are right out the front.",Puri Saron Seminyak
307,Under whelmed,30,October 2016,"Thought we'd try 2 hotels in Seminyak , usually stay in Legian. Stayed at Puri Saron for 5 nights. The location on the beachfront was nice, you could stay off the beach & enjoy people watching & sunset etc. Walk out the back & along the walk/scooter track it's a short walk to Double 6 & all the restaurants along the front.
I booked a deluxe chalet, thank goodness the hotel rooms were a long walk from the pool & beach. The room was ""ok"" but maintenance is lacking in room & around the resort. Rooms were cleaned well but the toiletries were awful.I was particularly shocked at the amount of flies crawling around the milk jugs, cups & cutlery on the tables at breakfast.
Also on a jug of possibly pancake batter on the kitchen ledge.
Mould in pool tile grout & under the pool bar was also a concern, considering the room rates I expected better. Pool was good size & you could usually get a lounge but that's a problem everwhere.
When checking out we were only going a short distance to next hotel & they wouldn't call a taxi, we had to walk to the end of the road (away from the no taxi zone) .",Puri Saron Seminyak
308,Totally what we needed,40,December 2015,After a booking stuff up from my self. We were lucky enough to get in a chalet. First impressions were ok. But after one night and waking up and walking down to the beach. We soon realised this was us. A laid back easy going hotel right on the beach with friendly staff once they get to know you. Perfect location for walking the streets and shopping eating out on eat street. Quiet relaxed staff and two great beach cafes with live music every night and bean bags to chill on. Oh and the pool bar is a great way to start the day after a surf. Throughly enjoyed our stay and we have just booked again to take the kids for their first bali trip.,Puri Saron Seminyak
309,Long weekend,30,October 2016,"The hotel is fair for the price , however beware of the spa. It's right next to pool (bar) so not very relaxing listening to van Morrison blaring out. Secondly we booked a aroma massage and an Ayurvedic, only after the treatment did the staff say, "" the lady this morning got the booking wrong you had two relaxing! She knew it was wrong but just got on with it. When we complained to reception they put us through to the spa, and after discussing For a few minutes, and the spa basically stating you got a treatment , but not the right one. When we pushed back about the fact it was wrong treatment the lady hung up the phone. Additionally she had a phone call half way through the massage with her Husband. That should not be happening for the price paid. You can go down the road for less than half the price where you might expect such treatment. Finally the spa lady came into reception and starting making a scene.",Puri Saron Seminyak
310,Good location next to the beach.,40,October 2016,"Good location next to the beach. Rooms are comfortable and were cleaned daily.
Wifi in the rooms was quite poor. Breakfast had limited choice for Vegetarians and overall choice was limited .Staff were generally very helpful.
Poor lighting in the compound at night made walking to the garden facing rooms quite a challenge.
Overall a reasonably good experience on our first visit to Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
311,Less than ordinary,10,October 2016,"Very old and out dated hotel, location is good. Staff don't seem to happy, they may be as tired as the hotel. Food is horrible. Would not stay here again and certainly wouldn't
recommend staying here. tripadvisor rating at the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.",Puri Saron Seminyak
312,Not recommended,10,October 2016,"I would not recommend Puri Saron at it's very old and cleanliness is a big issue.
The only good things to mention is the location right by the beach and garden which is nice. Staff at the reception is ok but not very helpful. I asked for my room to be cleaned properly as it was gross when I checked in, I had to clean it before I was able to touch anything. The asked cleaning did not happen.
The pool and breakfast area are the same, not nice at all.
I had booked and paid for 4 nights and was happy to be able to leave once these were over. I would definitely not come back nor recommend this place.",Puri Saron Seminyak
313,Ok,30,October 2016,"We have stayed here several times and are very happy to see that the showers have been updated!
The lighting in the rooms is however gloomy at best.
We really only use the rooms to shower and sleep so we manage.
Breakfast is not amazing but you won't go hungry.",Puri Saron Seminyak
314,Very pleased with this property,40,October 2016,"We have just returned from staying for 6 nights at this property and we were very happy with it. Room was large, bed comfortable and housekeeping efficient. All staff in all areas of the hotel were friendly, happy and helpful and the property is in an excellent location, right on the beach behind some very cool beach bars and restaurants. The property is an older style .........but it is clean and still attractive and well maintained.....not perfect but if you want that then you'll need to pay around 3 times the price for this amazing location so it all comes down to budget.
The pool bar has a friendly vibe and is a great place to meet other guests.
There is a resident cat who you may find curled up in the garden or on your outside chair. A previous review had suggested going to the Bintang Supermarket on the main road and buying some cat food which we did and she hungrily consumed so if you're a cat lover perhaps you could do the same!
There is great shopping all in walking distance of the hotel and a fantastic leather tailor called Michael who you can find in front of the Jayakarta Hotel on Werkadara Street. We had a number of items made and all fantastic - leather jacket, handbags and computer satchel.
This is our favourite area of Seminyak where you can escape the crazy traffic yet enjoy the beautiful sunsets and music right from your own hotel and there's great shopping and restaurants right on your doorstep also. If we return to Bali this is where we will be staying. Would suggest requesting a ground floor room as you have a lovely garden aspect.",Puri Saron Seminyak
315,we loved puri,40,October 2016,"10/10 for location. We stayed two weeks in Bali and stayed the first week at Puri Saron. We loved where we were situated right on the beach with la plancha (beach bar) right at our door step.
The pool at puri saron is very relaxed with a great pool bar. The staff were very friendly! The rooms were ok... pretty basic and wouldn't rate the cleanliest place I've stayed.
The room was cleaned every day but there was some things they forgot like behind the curtains which were dusty and seemed like there was mosquitos in them
When we turned on our shower a bad smell of sewer came up (maybe the room hadn't been used for a while) but we were out and about more then we were in the room so we didn't care so much. But in a great spot and had a lot of fun whilst staying there. :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
316,Mixed Feelings,30,October 2016,"Deluxe room on 2nd floor with balcony. Very spacious, clean enough but nothing special. Bathroom just ok, not inviting. However, good location, lovely pool area but could do with an ice block the size of a car! Right next to beach & beach restaurants, beautiful at night. No doubt you could get a better deal elsewhere.",Puri Saron Seminyak
317,Puri Saron - not recommended,10,October 2016,"Was booked here for seven nights but on arrival I checked out after seeing the pool, room and general facilities.

It's is very run down and it would struggle to rate as two stars.

Staff were friendly and accommodating of me checking out within an hour of arriving.

Checked into the Marriott - interesting same price for both rooms except Marriott is five star and Puri is a very very low 3.

Would not recommend to anyone wanting decent facilities- lounges around pool are so dirty and old it feels like a run down back packers. Rooms are super basic- eventhough I booked the delux bungalows.

It's cheapish, close to the beach but that's about it!",Puri Saron Seminyak
318,Location location location,30,October 2016,"Situated Right on Seminyak beach. pool was clean but way too warm. Breakfast had great pancakes and French toast, they will even give you a pot of tea with English breakfast T bags instead of those weak Bali T bags. We had a deluxe room which we regret. So noisy, kids screaming in adjoining room and balcony at 5.30am. Should have booked a bungalow room which open onto garden. Staff are sweet and polite and helpful. If you want an affordable hotel in good location, this is the one.",Puri Saron Seminyak
319,Great Pool,40,October 2016,"We spent a week here and absolutely loved it.

Staff: Amazing! Always smiling and very attentive.
Grounds: Beautiful gardens. Balinese style decor.
Pool: Fantastic. An area for kids, an area to swim and a separate area with a bar for the adults!
Bedroom: we stayed in the deluxe chalet. The bathroom was a bit dirty, shower was old, however the bed was lovely and the room was big.
Beach: Literally steps away. Mostly clean, BIG waves, probably not good for small children.
Food: Breakfast was fine. Not extravagant but certainly enough with cereal, egg and pancake station, breads and pastries, fruit, and a selection of Asian and Western hot dishes. Food can be ordered from the poolside bar during the day or the pizza restaurant. Not cheap cheap, but ok.

Overall, we loved this place. Very relaxing and we would definitely come back.

HOWEVER I would say if you are looking for a modern, pristine hotel then this probably isn't for you.",Puri Saron Seminyak
320,Dirty and old,10,October 2016,"The Puri Saron has a great location however it is old and dirty. We booked a two bedroom villa for $400 per night. The bathroom shower area was disgusting and looked like it has never been cleaned. The private pool was dirty, there were only two towels for four people. The outside lounge is old and the fabric is filthy dirty as well. I would not recommend staying here for $400 per night - there are a lot more villas with private pools that are a lot nicer and a lot cleaner than here. We had to wait an hour when we arrived as they had lost our booking.",Puri Saron Seminyak
321,third stay at Puri Saron,50,October 2016,"I am soon heading off to Seminyak again, and will be staying at the Puri Saron for the third time in a row. It is a small boutique hotel, absolute beachfront at Seminyak. The location and the staff service are the winners here and the reason I always go back. Very attentive staff who take the time to learn your name, thus making you feel like a personal guest rather than yet another tourist. The rooms are basic Balinese style, the pool is big, clean with a great swim up bar. Gorgeous gardens. I would recommend the deluxe chalet rooms as they are on the beachside right near the pool and beach, and only two levels high so relatively quiet.",Puri Saron Seminyak
322,10 days,30,October 2016,"Not a good selection for breakfast good location can order snack food at pool bar which is suitable for lunches or a light dinner
not a really great atmosphere around pool they have speakers for music around pool but only put it on every 3rd day.
.. bit run down,cleaning around pool not so good our lunch plates which we had around 12ish still there at 7pm ..reception and room service very attentive",Puri Saron Seminyak
323,Good for a stop over,30,September 2016,"We spent 2 nights before heading off to Gili Air, When we arrived we were upgraded and wow we couldnt have asked for a better room with private pool. In the morning the breakfast area was directly in front of our complex which made it easy.
The breakfast selection wasnt the biggest or best selection I've had in other hotels.
We returned to complete our trip with another 2 nights but no upgrade this time :(
The room was still spacious but the mozzies were bad.
The staff were attentive and willing to help.
The location was good with it being on the beach. About a 15-20 walk from the heart of Kuta.",Puri Saron Seminyak
324,Could care better for the elderly and infirm,40,September 2016,The hotel was beautiful.We couldn't have had a better room right by the pool.The room cleaner Aryk was great.It was quite a walk to the reception area and a small shuttle or golf style buggy woul have been appreciated.the reception would not allow us to get a taxi and we had to use their cars which cost twice the price.The strange thing was when we returned in a taxi from outside they would allow it in to drop us off.Also we booked a car from the hotel to pick us up at the airport and it just didn't show.We waited for one and a half hours before organizing our own transport.Very disappointing.Probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again,Puri Saron Seminyak
325,Elegance and Tranquility,40,September 2016,Stayed for 9 nights. Perfect location. Elegant Architecture. Lovely facilities and beautiful pool. Needs small upgrades but still unique hotel at the area. A splendid landscape gardening and old trees like at the garden of eden.,Puri Saron Seminyak
326,Good location for beach,40,September 2016,"Good location for beach ,
Breakfast has good choice .
A few more sun loungers would be perfect !
Slight mix match of furniture in room , however room was clean and comfortable.
Only negative reception did put through a scam phone call to our room which was little annoying!",Puri Saron Seminyak
327,"Great location, sensational pool, lovely gardens.",50,August 2016,"Puri Saron was the hotel pick of a friend of mine who has stayed here several times previously. I didn‚Äôt particularly care where we ‚Äì a group of girls ‚Äì were staying as it was my first child free holiday in eight years. The hotels is easy to find (if you ignore Google Maps and don't listen to Siri).
Very welcoming staff and the rooms were huge (room 1118). Two king single beds with clean linen, just warm enough for the aircon rooms. The hotel itself is a little dated but it adds to the charm. Gorgeous gardens and quiet.
Breakfast was included every morning and while not the best food you can get, it was plentiful, fresh, cooked well and certainly did the job and we never went without. Staff were also happy to cater when we brought in our own bubbly for breakfast (don't judge - it was my birthday and a champagne breakfast was in order!)
The location - that is the main factor of this hotel. Right next to the beach and also right where the beanbag bars are, it made getting to sunset beach drinks a breeze. The pool is big and warm, with varying levels to swim and lay in, along with a swim up bar. We never had too much trouble getting sun beds and while half our group moved to follow the sun, a huge tree between the pool and the beach gave sensational shade, as did the pool side umbrellas.
It is definitely a 3 star hotel in the grand scheme of all hotels but it is a top notch 3 stars and a fantastic, big, quiet hotel, perfect for relaxing and using as a base to get around Seminyak and other areas. Snacks are available all day - the mixed satay was delicious. The hotel also left me a complementary birthday cake in my room, which was both very thoughtful AND delicious!! All in all, I will definitely be returning.",Puri Saron Seminyak
328,Great and quiet location (*) but need little improvements here and there,30,September 2016,"I like this hotel and stayed here few times already. Located in quiet part of Seminyak with direct access to the beach. However, past few years there has been little disturbance due to construction works from a neighboring (big) resort.

I think the next door project is almost finish so nothing really disturbing.

The lobby looks the same, I wonder if they can upgrade the lobby a bit as this is the first impression of the hotel. Whenever there is a plan to upgrade, please maintain the traditional look and feel. The check-in was taken care very efficient by the front office staffs.

I got the room very close to the pool, next to the Spa (Super Deluxe Room), very spacious and has its own verandah. Clean. The bathroom is equipped with bath tube and separate rain-shower. The rain-shower, however, was not strong enough and needs checking.

The breakfast is nothing spectacular, simply fair. I would say it could have been better. This is the area that they need to pay more attention, apart from the room, breakfast is really important.

The garden is generally good and pretty much maintained.",Puri Saron Seminyak
329,"Perfect location, perfect ambiance",50,September 2016,"We're returned to Puri Saron, Seminyak for the brilliant beachside location, the clean rooms, and the perfect setting. We've searched for somewhere that matches up to this hotel, and not found it, so return again to enjoy this little spot of paradise. The beach bars are fun and lively and from Puri Saron you can spectate or participate - the best of both worlds. The pool is spacious, breakfasts are ample, and the staff friendly and accommodating. It's a Bali owned hotel and is without fuss.",Puri Saron Seminyak
330,Terri,40,September 2016,"Welcoming and courteous staff. Allocated room not satisfactory. No outlook, too much noise due to proximity to dining and entertainment area. Staff accommodated our request for more suitable room. Good breakfast. Gardens beautiful. Dated rooms but clean and adequate appointments",Puri Saron Seminyak
331,Over priced,30,September 2016,"We had a good stay at Puri Saron , the location is great with the beach directly across the path, the rooms are only average and a bit smelly ( we did ask for a upgrade, but they were fully booked) and the breakfast was fair.
Overall it was a nice place but needs a little work on it for the price of $145 Aus per night.",Puri Saron Seminyak
332,Dirty place - not good value for money,20,August 2016,"We stayed here for a few days in August. I'm not a very demanding one when it comes to accommodation as long as it's clean and location is good. It would not bother me that the furniture is old - it actually has its charm sometimes. But when it comes to cleanness, it has to be good standards. This one was well below average. To list a few - stained towels which were probably white at some point but are grey at best now (changed 3 times during our stay, they always come back stained anyway), pubic hair in the bath tub (disgusting!!!), toilet was very old and brown-ish... Internet connection was very poor as well.
Location is good, close to the beach across the road but not really on the beach as some websites suggested as there is a road to cross to get to the beach.
Pizza place they have in there was very-very good though - they make nice Roman pizza. Breakfast was also good, quite rich buffet. Overall I would not stay there again just for the cleanness point - there is much better value for money you can find on the coast.",Puri Saron Seminyak
333,Very happy,40,September 2016,We went as a family with one child and absolutely loved puri saron! We stayed in a standard room it was very clean and quite. The staff were beautiful and trustworthy. The hotel food was great and only a step away from the beach food. Very happy stay we would definitely return,Puri Saron Seminyak
334,"Great location, Great Staff.",40,August 2016,"Stayed for 6 nights and absolutely loved it! Staff are so friendly and couldn't do enough to help, awesome location so close to everything. You do have to get down to the pool early to get a sun bed but that did not bother us as we loved going to the beach. We will be back!",Puri Saron Seminyak
335,50th Birthday Celebration,40,July 2016,"Stayed at the Puri Saron back in 2009 and decided to do it all again to celebrate my wife's 50th Birthday. 8 of our family stayed this time and had a fantastic time.
Upon arrival they messed the rooms up and we had single beds. For one night it didn't bother us a bit. Changed our room a day later and we were fine. Shower and basin in bathroom became blocked two days later, spoke with them about it and was fixed that day. A/C didn't seem to be cold enough, spoke to them about it and they fixed it straight away. Rooms probably need a bit of maintenance but never bothered us a bit. Rooms were clean and the grounds inside the resort were always kept clean and tidy. Brekky was a bit drab but bread was fresh and the omelette's they cooked each morning were delicious. Didn't eat lunch or dinner there because we were always somewhere else however a few of the others did and said that the food was great. Staff were amazing! Friendly, courteous, always willing to get things done for you, always said hello and good morning with a big wonderful happy smile.
If you want the location, and you want a cheapish rate and you are happy to put up with a few little things that might go wrong (and if they do and you can speak with these people in a polite and courteous manner to get things done) then this is the right place to stay. Pool bar staff were fantastic. Spent a lot of the day there. One of the gentlemen remembered us from back in 2009 because he had to run up the street in the afternoon to the store to get us some more rum. He was a trainee back then and now he is one of the bosses. I'd love to go back to Bali again in the future, and if I did, I'd stay there again!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
336,Need to Improve,20,August 2016,"This hotel is quite old and need some improvements....when I entered the room, it was smells like a place that never been used quite long...the pillow is also smells...otherwise they have a very nice staffs with their hospitality and helpful",Puri Saron Seminyak
337,Great hotel in a fantastic location with attentive and friendly staff!,40,July 2016,"This is our 3rd time staying at Puri Saron. The staff in reception are always very courteous and helpful. A special mention is deserved for Wi Wik who remembered us from our previous visits and always took the time to chat and look after us. This is one of the reasons that makes the hotel so special. Breakfast is always fresh and plentiful, especially love the egg station. The pool area is amazing being near the beach. The pool bar staff are always nice and friendly. The location of the hotel is ideal, right on the beach with the bean bag bars to enjoy the sunset and a short walk to shops and restaurants. The lunch time barbeque around the pool is delicious. Overall a wonderful hotel and extremely relaxing! Thank you.",Puri Saron Seminyak
338,A yearly visit!,40,July 2016,"My family and I visit Bali every year and have stayed at this hotel each time. I love it, staff are very friendly and accomodating.

I have a read a few poor reviews on here and can't help but think these people were a bit prissy.
While yes the rooms aren't a 5 star hotel quality they are reasonable for the price and who spend most of their holiday in Bali in a hotel room?
As for the pool bar, it is fantastic, only problem being you have to get down early for a pool lounge. Obviously not the hotels fault, I seen many guests leaving towels on lounges in the morning and not returning til the afternoon. The staff can't exactly move them then have guests complaining about that?

The gardens are beautiful and the hotel is right off the beach so you can go down and do a bit of beach shopping whenever you want!

All in all, if you are looking for a relaxing holiday close to everything... This hotel is for you!",Puri Saron Seminyak
339,Lovely quiet location,30,July 2016,"We stayed in a bunaglow on the ground floor. The hotel is in a relaxing and quiet location with lovely gardens. It is located on the beach front which we loved as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds...ok so you never actually get fully away from the crowds but it as peaceful as it gets in Bali. The room itself was fine although the air conditioner was noisy. The food at the hotel was not great. A buffet breakfast was served between 6am and 10am ... it was fresh at 6am...being on holdays we were getting to breakfast around 8.30am or latter by then it had been sitting for a couple of hours. We ordered eggs as they were cooked to order. Timing the use of the single toaster which required the bread to be put through 3 times to make it resemble toast...not very practical. In the end we settled for muesli, fresh fruit and a couple of boiled eggs each day. Extremely friendly staff and very helpful. Any issues brought to their attention were dealt with very promptly. (Except the food...it seems that it doesn't matter how many poor reviews they get on their food...it stays poor). Would I stay there again...probably not but only because I want to try Kuta next time rather than Seminyak. Would I recommend it...yes but don't expect it to look bright and shiny new. It is an older hotel but we really liked it and it was affordable and on the beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
340,Great location & family friendly,40,August 2015,"We moved here after a not so good villa experience down the road. We stayed near the pool which was great for the kids and general vibe. Room service was good and pretty quick. Staff super lovely and accommodating. Buffet seemed to fit most tastes with fresh fruit, yoghurt croissants coffee.. They offered omelettes made fresh. The room price was pretty high for a 3 star.. But as in seminyak it's expected I guess. We would say that they could improve the kids playground. Made of metal and a bit broken in places. Maybe offer some kids club or kids activities? We loved la plancha right across the road. Spent a lot on this holiday in seminyak and that would be the negative.",Puri Saron Seminyak
341,Friends week,30,June 2016,"It's fine - right on the beach (behind la plancha ) staff are reasonably friendly .
Rooms and complex are a little outdated but you get what you pay for - who stays in their room in Bali ? It was still very clean. Beds are large and comfortable.
My friend stayed on ground level - her room was great. Ours was upstairs in the middle of the complex and a little dated (but still ok)
Heaps of food options by the pool (reasonable hotel prices).
Downside - Pool bar prices overpriced for Bali. (And they're not exactly quick at service) . Though they did let us stay up later than opening hours and weren't worried about us being a bit rowdy (there was a big group) so that was a plus.

Another downside was we only were allowed 1 room key per room which was a real pain as we had to coordinate what times we would be back etc...

Breakfast buffet could have a few more options .

Other than that, can't really complain. If you want a reasonably priced hotel in a good position - it ticks all boxes.",Puri Saron Seminyak
342,"12 months later, stayed again....",40,July 2016,"We are a family of 5 with 3 teens who stayed at this resort 12 months ago. We love the location of this resort. Right on the beach with all the beach bars out front and restaurants all along the beach. The bed is very hard. I asked for a mattress pillow top which certainly helped. The breakfast is good but not a huge variety. After 5 nights, we had certainly had enough. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The resort is a little tired but we love the authentic Balinese decor and lush gardens. If any renovation is done, we fear the cost of this resort would increase and so it is an affordable option on the beach in Seminyak when so many around us are so very expensive. Worth the stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
343,Good for families üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß,30,July 2016,"This was our second stay at Puri Saron as it's a great location right on the beach (pool overlooks the beach) & walking distance to shops & restaurants.

The staff at the Hotel are all lovely & very attentive. Our rooms were absolutely immaculate everyday after being made up & I could not fault them at all (even our boys room with surfboards & goodness knows what everywhere!!!).

We booked 2 Junior Suite rooms for our family of 5 as we wanted ocean views & balconies & then after we checked in they upgraded my husband & myself to the Honeymoon Suite - fantastic!!! We could lie in bed & see the pool & ocean - perfect!!

The staff are all very friendly & helpful, the pool is huge & the rooms are lovely (older Bali style). The only downside was the breakfast buffet!! We came in July last year & the breakfast was very good but this year it seemed to lack variety but that is my only very minor complaint.

Thank you Puri Saron for another lovely stay & see you next July üòÄ",Puri Saron Seminyak
344,You will be disappointed,30,September 2015,"We stayed there for 6 nights (9-15 September 15) It was an old and neglected place. The room we got for $135/night was worth $35 - I have not seen such a poor and run down place before.
We asked for an upgrade and got it for free. There were not many guests in this big place. Our bed was so hard that after the first night I have asked for an additional blanket and put it in top of the mattress.
Breakfast was really funny - very limited choice of everything - unless you like fried rice or Asian style noodles for breakfast.
At the pool there were 12 sun loungers on one side and 14-16 on the other. If you were late you did not have a place to sit. Although the sign informed that the pool was open till 9pm, after 6pm pool attendants rushed to remove the cushions from sun beds and you could lie down on the timber frames....
On one occasion we asked the receptionist to call us a Taxi to go to a Pharmacy, as it was about a 15 min walk to the shopping/restaurant area. We were advised to go to the streets and catch one.
It is just a snap shot of our experience with Puri Saron but enough to be disappointed. It was not our first trip to Bali but for sure the last one to this place.

I liked the most the short distance to the beach. That's all.",Puri Saron Seminyak
345,Recomend,50,July 2016,"Just spent 15 nights (with wife and 16 year old daughter) excellent value, great location, clean and will visit again. The beds are sensational, firm mattress. Prompt room service and air conditioning stays on 24 hours ensuring cool room with no associated noise.",Puri Saron Seminyak
346,"Lovely staff, close to beach but...",30,June 2016,"The staff are amazing, the gardens are nice and it is close to the beach. However, breakfast is average at best, the swimming pool was cloudy for the 10 days we stayed there and the hotel itself is very tired and in need of a renovation. We stayed in a junior suite near the restaurant which had a shared balcony with nice views of the ocean. The room itself was huge with not much in it. The hotel photos show a sofa and 2 armchairs which were missing from our room. Probably in need of repair and never returned. Great location with some amazing restaurants and bars close by, also beautiful sunsets on the beach. OK if you can get a cut price deal.",Puri Saron Seminyak
347,Pretty good - reviews are all accurate!,40,July 2016,"This hotel is nice I really liked it. Some may think it's a fairly simple style room but I like the Balinese style open plan accommodation with common stairways open to the elements but indoors. Great pool and pool bar and direct access to a really lovely beach where people flock to every afternoon for subset drinks on beanbags at a variety of restaurants. Live music on the beach is great and cocktails, beers and food available.
Brekky is a little limited compared to the really amazing buffets we all know and love, but the bacon is good, as is the egg/omelet bar options.
Staff are friendly and the large grounds are lovely and well maintained
Really enjoyed it and great if you can get a budget price!",Puri Saron Seminyak
348,Average accommodation but great views,30,July 2016,"Our room overlooked a neat tranquil garden however the room itself was very average, we payed $180 a night which is quite expensive.
The beach life was an amazing view from the resort both during the day as well as evening. The music wafted through the air adding a joyous atmosphere.
The staff were all attentive and friendly especially Budi who was very helpful and thoughtful when my husband misplaced his phone and money in a cab.",Puri Saron Seminyak
349,"Great value, great position on beach",40,July 2016,"Great Balinese style hotel...fantastic position on beach where can either sit around the pool or walk 20metres and be at centre of action/entertainment on the beach. It's not a 5 star place, but really relaxing, everything works well, plenty of shade around the gardens and pool and the staff are friendly, attentive.",Puri Saron Seminyak
350,very good!,40,June 2016,"Puri Saron is great value for money. The staff are wonderful and very attentive to their guests. The hotel is in a great location, right on the beach with lots of restaurants and shopping very close by. Is you don't want to spend a lot of money but be in a great location with great facilities then Puri Saron is perfect.",Puri Saron Seminyak
351,Get what you pay for,30,June 2016,"Not a bad place, just wood not stay again. Great location for the beach, nice pool. Average breakfast & room a bit old. But you get what you pay for. We booked a room with a bath, which was not available when arriving.",Puri Saron Seminyak
352,Not bad.,30,June 2016,"The Puri Saron is fairly good value for money. The staff are warm and welcoming and happy to assist e.g. When we arrived our towels were a very drab grey colour but were quickly replaced with a whiter version when we kindly asked. It is a quiet hotel with lovely manicured gardens. Whilst there have been some cosmetic changes to modernise the rooms I feel the owners need to spend some more money upgrading, especially the bathrooms. Breakfast is fine and there are local restaurants on the beach where you can sit and watch a lovely sunset. Don't get too excited by the complementary drinks - it's only orange and pineapple juice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
353,Beachfront bliss,50,June 2016,"This hotel is located in perfect beachfront access! Rooms are clean comfortable and great condition super comfy beds and 24hr room service!
Will stay here again!! Food has q great range and free breakfasts are quality!",Puri Saron Seminyak
354,Great location makes this hotel worth a visit although there are a few issues.,40,June 2016,"We paid extra for a Super Deluxe room which as expected was very large, but it should have had a bath, and a private balcony with a pool view. We did not get either. Our balcony was shared with three other rooms and also included a smokers table for people from other rooms without balconies. We felt ripped off as it was nothing like the photo that the hotel uses to show these rooms. Our room was also very noisy as it was directly above the kitchen. The noise started at around 5am each morning.
The room was extremely well cleaned and the bathroom was good - despite the lack of a bath. The room lacked a comfortable chair so after a week I was really looking forward to sitting somewhere comfortable.
The staff are mostly very friendly.
We found the pool area was very satisfactory.
A safety issue that should be addressed by the hotel is the lack of hand rails on the stairs. There are no lifts and to access or exit our room we had to go up or down 22 very steep steps! This could be quite unsafe especially for elderly visitors.",Puri Saron Seminyak
355,Terrible experience,10,June 2016,The room was smelling like mould although I had a flu & couldn't stay more than 15 minutes inside the room without having a headache .. & the hotel is not as is shown in photos it's very old & far from the main road ! The beach was horrible ! We couldn't see the sand due to locals having umbrellas & selling goods .. We booked the hotel for 3 nights but we stayed for 1 hour.. & we left without even asking for refund ! We just wanted to leave :),Puri Saron Seminyak
356,Great Staff,40,June 2016,"Stayed during my sons birthday and they made him a cake and sung happy birthday which was great! The grounds and pool are fantastic and really close to all the beachside bars and restaurants. Room was clean, however avoid rooms with interconnecting doors as noise from next door could be heard easily",Puri Saron Seminyak
357,Great Location - felt comfortable here,40,June 2016,"Had booked a standard room for $120 pn - stayed in this one night. Big room but quite bare and balcony had the airconditioner on it and faced on to a rooftop nextdoor. Nothing wrong with room but had just come from 5 star and wanted something a little nicer as I was staying for a week. Saw reception the next day - they very happily showed me the next level room which is 4 with stairs in middle - two ground floor and two above (so you do not share walls with another room). More traditional furniture with big four poster bed and good bathroom. Really enjoyed this room.
Breakfast is the usual and was a good start to the day.
Resort is right behind La Planchia on Seminyak beach. Walked to Gago-gado for dinner - delish!
Cannot fault the location - and room was quiet.
Staff exceptional.
Only thing not happy with was that the pool did not seem to be overly clean - unfortunate as it was still hot and a little humid whilst I was there.
I know others that have stayed and did not see this problem. But water was a little cloudy and seemed to have oil slick in one corner!!
Apart from this would definitely stay again. Loved the location and the very genuine smiling and happy service.",Puri Saron Seminyak
358,Great value for money for a beach front Hotel,50,June 2016,"Have stayed here many times now, friendly staff, excellent service. Traditional Balinese hotel, nice pool , very relaxed as usual. We stayed in villa one and other family stayed in a super deluxe room and a bunglalow, all rooms were excellent and cleaned well every day.
Location is perfect for walking to the good restaurants that are 5 mins south of here. Lots of beach bars also in this area. More laid back and relaxing than the madness of Kuta.",Puri Saron Seminyak
359,Good old-style hotel,50,May 2016,We travelled with two other families and had a nice time at Puri Saron. The breakfast was ok - both western and asian. Pool is huge and clean. Nice staff. They would not confirm adjoining rooms until we arrived with was really annoying and one family missed out on an adjoining room until night 3 of their 5 night visit. We stayed in the older part (room 2110/1) and it was located well both close to reception/main entrance and pool/beach. I'd recommend hotel for a budget holiday. We paid under AUD$100 per room per night including breakfast.,Puri Saron Seminyak
360,Old hotel on a beach location,30,May 2016,The Puri Saron is a beachfront hotel in Seminyak. The hotel staff are very welcoming and the large pool is great. Buffet breakfasts are good. The hotel rooms are quite dated and in need of a facelift or renovation.,Puri Saron Seminyak
361,Great beach front location!,50,June 2016,"My husband and I stayed here for a week! Overall the hotel was great, it offers an amazing location and everything you need for a nice holiday! Front door to the beach and down a back street off the main road, we felt perfectly safe walking around at night, even down the alley to the main entrance.

Rooms: We stayed in a bungalow room facing the main garden area, it was a great location, close to the restaurant and pool area and away from the reception area. Make sure you spray your room with mozzie spray before you go out and when you come back you have no worries, this is only if you happen to be traveling in wetter months. Overall the room was great, comfortable and had everything you need for a holiday.

Breakfast: Buffet breakfast was included, compared to other places we have stayed at the breakfast was a little disappointing for me, my husband though he loved it! I found the food to be sometimes cold, no one wants cold pancakes, and not a big enough selection of fruit, the eggs though are amazing! Location of breakfast was amazing, nestled in the palms trees by the pool.

Staff: Always a delight staying in Bali! The people are always the most gorgeous people to be around and this hotel was no different! They always are polite, courteous and would do anything to make your day!

We will definitely stay here again! If you are looking for a 4 star ultra modern place with perfect finishes than this place is not for you, it's an older resort and it shows a little, it rains too much the drains smell, but what do you expect your in Bali, it's part of the experience, none of that however takes it away from having an absolutely perfect holiday, in an excellent location and value for money!",Puri Saron Seminyak
362,Puri Saron Hotel - suitable accommodation,40,June 2016,"The rooms were quite good and the hotel grounds very large. The hotel is adjacent to the beach - black sand (ugly), heaps of people (as far as you could see) on bean bags/umbrellas drinking, no one in the sea water. So I retreated to the nicer ambiance of the hotel grounds and the pleasant poolside beds. Staff were very good and breakfast was plentiful and varied - quality fine but coffee terrible. On one evening there was a noisy band party on the adjacent beach and my room was near this.",Puri Saron Seminyak
363,Not our cup of tea,20,June 2016,"To be fair, we had traveled around Bali and had stayed in small Balinese 1 or 2 star hotels. Our travel agent had booked us into Puri Saron for the last nights of our vacation because we wanted something a bit more luxurious.

The room in this 4 star hotel was more basic and tired than any of the rooms we'd stayed in. Definitely needs renovation.

The pool was bigger, but there weren't enough chairs or sun umbrellas. The pool was dominated by Australian families hanging out in the pool bar area drinking beer. Music was coming from the pool bar and the two restaurants surrounding it.

The beach is right there, which is a plus. But with high tide you can't stay on the beach in the morning. All pool chairs had been reserved with towels.

We decided to go back to the small Balinese hotel we had originally stayed at when we arrived in Bali.

This hotel was not for us. But if you want pool, beach, drink and food at your finger tips, it may be the right place for you.",Puri Saron Seminyak
364,Lack of systems,20,June 2016,I love staying in Bali and we decided to try a new hotel. The staff are beautiful and friendly however from day one we were taken to a room with 2single beds as a couple...then told we had been given a free upgrade to what I believe was what was supposed to be our original room we paid for any way. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and decided to rebook after 10 days away. We paid for our booking prior to leaving again and were promised the same room ...on our return they had completely forgotten we were coming although we had booked and paid. We then waited in in the boiling hot foyer for 30 minutes whilst they found a room which was not what we had paid for and was smelly. Again giving them the benefit of the doubt we sat it out but the pool area was filthy after a recent conference and the pool water was warm and slimy. We then paid for our transfers to the Airport when we left only to be asked if we had booked a transfer... To finish it off we were chased down at airport security by the driver who brought us to the airport ...after we gave him a genorous tip...he was told by the hotel that we hadn't paid them...not having time to pul out our receipts to show him we repaid to avoid a major embarrassing scene at airport security... We are not worried about the money but the Oporto driver having to sprint around the airport for us just demonstrates a total lack of communication that leaves All involved out of pocket and a disappointing end to a holiday.. Normally we would leave Bali with very little balinese money and chose to use what's left for tips...we are just lucky we had enough to pay the driver whilst we had hundreds of foreign travellers lining up behind us....,Puri Saron Seminyak
365,Dissapointing,30,June 2016,"I will be as objective as possible with this review, keeping in mind the Tarif charged at this resort is not expensive given the location.

To start the location is great the swimming pool, pool bar and casual dining warung are right on the beach. The resort itself has been around for a long time and is showing its age. The buffet breakfast is not exciting, just plain simple food but with some imagination could be made much better. The staff are very friendly and courteous but appear to lack any formal training in hospitality and in most cases do not fully understand their job. A good percentage of the staff can not speak or understand English. Keeping in mind that the greater majority of the holiday makers staying at the resort are of western origin being capable of speaking English is important. On a number of occasions we gave up trying to ask for things or had to be referred to another person.

Our personal issues with the resort centred around things such as having no hot water in the room. The shower was cold which was not a huge issue when the temperature was over 30 degrees. But a hot shower in the morning and evening are always welcome. This was reported but not acted on. The room we were allocated for our stay was an upgrade but I am not fully convinced it was for the right reason. From experience whenever I have been offered an upgrade it was for another reason other then in my interest. The room we were given in this case was close to the swimming pool where they were running a large party for a conference on the first night and the noise in our room along with strob lights flashing through the poor fitting curtains was not acceptable. We complained and eventually this was corrected. But there was never any formal apology from management and it would appear that their take on the matter was to bad so sad.

Overall we enjoyed our stay mainly because of the location. Could this place be made better the answer is yes. With more attention to detail. Would we stay again or recommend to others probably not as I don't think things will improve in the future. But as I stated from the outset of this review ""you get what you pay for in this world""",Puri Saron Seminyak
366,Great hotel perfect spot,50,September 2015,We have stayed at puri saron hotel 6 times now.Staff are gorgeous very friendly.This is not a large hotel but it is in a great spot backs onto the beach with a walk path right down as far as Discovery Mall in Kuta.No traffic outside the hotel.The service in the hotel from all the staff is excellent.This may be an older hotel but it has character.Lovely pool and great pool bar.We love this place & will continue to go there & prefer it to the new hotels that just don't seem to have the atmosphere.Puri Saron is close to great restaurants.Hope you enjoy as much as us.Penny,Puri Saron Seminyak
367,Very very tired hotel,20,May 2016,"Definitely need a lot of renovation, cracks everywhere and when it rains the sound is amplified by the thin roof. The breakfast is very basic, don't expect much. We arrived late at midnight only to find that our room was a disaster: bed covers very dirty, floor is dirty, we called to change and clean everything. The next days we would supervise the cleaning to make sure its done properly. The sofa was an old dirty uncomfortable piece of furniture so useless. The rating takes in account the only positive point: location on the beach. Nothing else to like.",Puri Saron Seminyak
368,Great Location nice resort,50,May 2016,"We arrived on the 13th of May stayed for 12 nights , we were upgraded to a bungalow room , wow the room was nice the bathroom was quite big, the staff are lovely, great location close to the restaurants and the beach, bands on the beach at night time, the pool bar was great Thankyou to sumerta , Adika & Setiawan, the pool is great!! Nice size plenty of sun beds, the resort is quite big , breakfast was good maybe more variety but fresh everyday which was great!! Talk to the staff on things do and where to go and eat if your not sure, puri saron great resort nothing to complain about!!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
369,Okay - On Beach - Getting Tired,30,May 2016,"This hotel is getting tired and I think when I visit again I would try another hotel.

The hotel is very close to the beach though (basically on it) which was great and on the beach are lots of beach bars. It was also quite close to the bar / shopping strip in Seminyak.

A number of other guests who I met complained about their rooms and had got a better room either for free or for a small additional fee.

The rooms itself was basic but clean and comfortable. That said, the bathroom needed an immediate upgrade.",Puri Saron Seminyak
370,Beach hotel,40,May 2016,"We had 2 nights stay at this place, we were upgraded to a higher category, which was a nice room. I really loved the bed :) The bathroom is huge, with a closet area. The hotel has a nice pool, several restaurants, the food was good, drinks at the pool bar were refreshing :)
The hotel is on a beach line, just across an alley. There are many restaurants and bars with live entertainment, we had a nice walk on the beach from Beachwalk shopping mall back to the hotel, it took us 15-20 mins only, but we saw many interesting things happening in the beach. There are many shops to buy souvenirs and so on.
The negative part: my fiance gave some cloth for so called ""express"" laundry which was not ready after promised 3,5 hours, more over we had to call 4 times and even after 4,5 hours it was not returned.
Another thing: please fix the door locks... they are not safe enough.
Apart from that we had a nice stay, planning for next year visit.",Puri Saron Seminyak
371,I really like this place - Second Visit,40,May 2016,"The reason why I like this place is that it is on the beach. There are lots of things to do around the area and the staff seems to be very very friendly and attentive. Some might say that the hotel is dated. Yes, it is not a modern nouveau hotel. Don't book here if that's is what you want. I kind of like the old-school hotels that are classic. Given the price of the room, (@ $60 usd), and the fact that I like the pool, the easy access to the ocean and the beautiful grounds, I do not mind staying here.

On this particular stay, I am in one of the standard rooms which is fairly basic but nonetheless a good size. Bed is not too hard and for the most part, the room is clean and quiet.",Puri Saron Seminyak
372,Stay out of the Room,40,April 2016,"As soon as we entered the room at around 2230h, I could make out that it was a dim lit room even with all available lights ON. During the day it was not an issue due to the sliding french window.

Excellent service, helpful and prompt staff.
Location is the STAR * value of the Hotel , next to beach.
Brilliantly laid out hotel with beautiful Stone carvings/statues,trees,mini ponds with fishes,gardens all around the Hotel. It was has a mini swimming pool for relaxing and a pool bar.
Also proximity to the market at 5 min walk where you can find anything/everything.
Hotel also provides currency exchange and arranges tours/travel.
It has a shuttle service once in a day for Shopping lovers to City and back by afternoon.
We had tours scheduled for most part of our stay at the Hotel, so we only spent our evenings here.
We had complained about the Air conditioning, apparently it was working fine( as per the engineer) although was not able to cool the room( which I assume is because the room was too big). We were reassigned and upgraded to Bungalow Category room which was not much different from our previous room except for a default mosquito net and extra tea/coffee sachets.

Overall it was a good experience and will recommend the Hotel who plan to visit the island during the daytime or have scheduled visits during the day.",Puri Saron Seminyak
373,Great Location,40,April 2016,"Stayed 4 nights. Can't beat the location and the pool is amazing. While the drinks by the pool bar were a little expensive the staff were amazing. They greeted us with smiles and were always willing to help out. This is a great resort, with fantastic gardens and an old-school Bali theme. Would defiantly come back next time I'm in Seminyak.",Puri Saron Seminyak
374,Holiday stay,40,April 2016,This was a lovely stay. 6 nights. Gardens are beautiful. The pool is great. The staff were lovely. They left cake for my birthday. Totally loved it. Only small thing would be some towel racks in bathroom. First time staying. Definitely will be back.,Puri Saron Seminyak
375,Value for money,30,April 2016,"Just arrived home after a 9 night stay at Puri Saron. This resort is ideally located on the beach in Seminyak - which for foodies is the place to be.
The staff are friendly and the resort is so convenient with nice grounds and large pool with bar and 3 on site choices for food.
The rooms where very clean and air conditioning was whisper quite - we had it running at night and slept so well.
Rooms are basic and overall you get the feeling that they will soon need a makeover to keep pace with the competition but you cannot argue that you don't get value for money here.
This is my second time here and would go back again without hesitation and recommend to friends.",Puri Saron Seminyak
376,"Decent hotel, good location, nice pool",30,March 2016,"We stayed at this hotel for a few days over Easter and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel grounds are beautiful, very lush and tropical, while the pool and swim up bar are good and very easy to spend hours relaxing near. The pool itself was decent...a little worn but clearly well used. The room we stayed wasn't too bad...it was a little tired and the bed was very creaky but the mattress was good enough for us to sleep soundly on. Our friend stayed in another room closer to the lobby which was more modern and updated than ours so they may be working their way through the hotel with the updates.
The beach in front of the hotel was great. It was much more crowded than I expected but very wide with great surfing.
Overall this hotel was a good place to stay for a few days and gave us what we were looking for: beach access, swim up bar, good location and friendly people.",Puri Saron Seminyak
377,Amazing,50,March 2016,"Loved our time here. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean and nicely presented. Great service at the swim up bar. The breakfast was good but you need to be there at 6 so the food is fresh. The reason I say this is, the pancakes, crepes etc were stuck to the serving dishes at 9am. I had a massage and it was great. Lovely restaurants just 2 mins away down the beach! We will back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
378,Nice stay!,40,March 2016,"Close to beach restaurants and bars on the beach, good stay for a comfortable mid range accommodation option. Nice and views of the beach, breakfast options were quite limited however food was nice! Bathrooms weren't fantastic, sufficed for our 4 night stay though.",Puri Saron Seminyak
379,Great Location...Huge Room,40,November 2015,"This Hotel is located a few steps away from the beach and great beach bars. Not far from good restaurants and shopping. Our room was really large, clean with good air conditioning. We would stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
380,Disappointed,30,January 2016,Long story short..Dont stay in a standard room and pay the price that is advertised as it is definitely not worth your $$$. Very tired and dated you can easily find better acc for the price. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was more to the standard that was expected. Location is fantastic and the staff were lovely. Breakfast was just ok and I mean just. The pictures on the net do not give a true picture of the rooms. Look around before committing here.,Puri Saron Seminyak
381,Great hotel,50,February 2016,An amazing hotel situated close to beach front bars and restaurants. The rooms are large and very clean with good aircon. The pool is beautiful and looks over seminyak beach the sunsets are stunning. I would recommend staying here the breakfast has lots of options too.,Puri Saron Seminyak
382,Maybe good for families or groups looking for a good spot in the area but needs some work,30,January 2016,"First the good: The location is ok for the area- you're not directly on the street, but are just across a short footpath (with moto traffic) to the beach, and theres a large pool at a raised edge to the beach (no view as such unless you're out of the pool). It's a relatively short walk to a main beachside street with some shops and restaurants before hitting the other resorts to the south. There are also a bunch of OK beach bars (wouldn't recommend the food) out front, with live acoustic music every night..

This is where it starts to get a bit of a problem though - noise until at least 11-12 most nights from these bars, where the live and recorded music from the beach comes through as if it's outside the door of any of the front rooms. The problem is the front rooms are the only ones in a ""niceish"" sort of state (ie the bathrooms aren't as smelly and the fittings are more modern than the rest of the hotel's rooms and bungalows).. These rooms also seem to feature woefully underpowered airconditioning for the sheer size of them too.. So the rooms are big yes, and there is a nice view from some of them, yes, but they are hot, noisy, effectively under furnished (maybe they're able to be setup for large families and second beds, but a couch or dining table wouldn't go astray!!).

And in terms of service, they have some lovely staff who are trying to be sociable, friendly and helpful, so I applaud that (still nothing on some of the places we've been, but trying counts for me)..

So then, the real issue, even as discussed and agreed with their management, is expectation management, or as we saw it, ""value"". As in, it's not very good for the price, which is probably where our opinion differed from the managers.. When we first checked in at a previous stay, we were placed in the ""Bungalows"", which were already at a fairly high price for the area (not double six prices, but close to say *double* prices from a similar class hotel down the same stretch of beach we checked, which appeared to us to be a much better basic standard than Puri Saron's). So this time we paid more again, for the ""junior suite"" rooms, and lo and behold, hot, noisy, not great rooms for the price.

We were originally booked to stay 8 nights, but I was going out of my head by 4 nights with the sweaty and noisy room, and asked the hotel and our travel agent for assistance. Got nowhere with that, so checked rates at a very well known resort in Jimbaran instead, where I got nightly rates *cheaper* than here, so checked out and abandoned our booking.

They did give us their room with the best view out the front (pool, ocean etc), but again, the heat and noise were just too much to cope with - see our room tips.

As it was our honeymoon, we wanted something just a bit more special I guess - this is not that place. I feel they need a serious deep refresh to justify the pricing and to meet peoples expectations for value. We spoke to a few other couples during our stay who were having similar experiences, but we could also see some larger young groups and families who were having a ball, so all power to them. It's not a bad or the worst place, I think it just needs to meet the standards it's prices aspire to...",Puri Saron Seminyak
383,Many vists still love it,50,February 2016,"This is our 7th time to puri saron ,and still love it ,traditional look bali hotel not super flash like the newer concrete monsters being build around the area. Thats why we love, the service is very good in all areas ,keep up the good work....Ardick cool...",Puri Saron Seminyak
384,Desappointing at best!,20,December 2015,"My teen daughter & I were due to stay for 2 nights in December 15. Check in was smooth & the staff seemed lovely. The room was clean & quite good. I was told we were given an upgrade so that was a nice touch I thought. To be fair, I can't really fault the room. It was clean and basic, but not bad. Bathroom was ok-ish!
We went for a walk around the resort and were a little shocked at the state of disrepair. The pool area was rather decrepit. However we were there for 2 nights so we weren't overly concerned by this. It was right on the beach so that was a plus.
We decided to go for a walk around the area & go for a bite to eat. By the time we returned it was dark and the place was totally deserted. It felt completely unsafe & like a ghost town. There was hardly anyone staying there & absolutely no one in the area that we were staying in. Having travelled throughout South East Asia for many years both with my family and on my own, Europe 2ce on my own, United States with my family, I would consider myself a seasoned traveler. I have never felt unsafe staying anywhere, but this place felt horrible.
Walking back to the hotel down the dark street at night also felt uncomfortable & we decided that this was definitely not the place for us to stay. According the advertised address, the hotel was on Jl Camplung Tanduk. The taxi driver couldn't find it, because this is not the address. Jl Camplung Tanduk is a main type of street of Jalan Legian. It's advertised as an Upscale lodging with a swim-up bar. It is definitely not upscale and the photographer who has taken the pix on the website is a magician!!
We contacted Booking.com & told them of our experience & said we would like for them to arrange for a refund based on the misrepresentation of the address & we were not at all happy. Many phone calls back & forth with Booking.com who were contacting the hotel, a visit from the manager - who offered to move us to a room where there were a few other guests staying - and we finally said that no, under no circumstances were we staying there. Given the address was false, I didn't think they had a leg to stand on!
I would have forgone our 2 nights that we had paid to go elsewhere. It was just a really horrible feeling being there. However, after an hour of negotiation they finally agreed to fully refund our money. I have to say, I haven't actually checked the statement to see if the refund has been given, but Booking.com sent an email confirming this so I'm sure it was all taken care of.
I booked this holiday all very last minute, so didn't properly look at the address & double check on the map. Lesson learned big time!",Puri Saron Seminyak
385,Very nice,40,January 2016,"We just stayed at Puri Saron for 8 nights.

We organised transfers from the airport which only cost $25AUD for two people, and made our lives a lot easier. Be careful of the people offering to carry your bag as they will expect a tip. The staff were so lovely and friendly during our entire stay, and could not fault them on anything! The pool, outdoor area and chairs are very nice and really well maintained. The pool bar is also good value, with cocktails costing around $10 with mainstream spirits, but Bingtangs, milkshakes and smoothies all under $3. The chicken satay meal from the grill around the pool area was our favourite, for only $5. The WiFi isn't the fastest connection but does the job well! The shuttle to Kuta every morning for only $5 return pp was also good to avoid the local taxis.

The only things that were average were probably the breakfast, which would've been nice to have more fresh fruit/cereal options. We didn't mind the traditional Indonesian breakfast but by the end of our stay we were craving some basic items. Also as other travellers have advised the toilets do get a little bit of a smell. Another guest advised us to pour some water down the small drain on the floor next to the toilet, which helped a lot. We also left the door closed with the fan on in the bathroom to help, and it didn't bother us. The bathrooms are under going upgrades so hopefully it isn't a problem for much longer! The linen/towels also could do with an upgrade. All in all, Puri Saron is great value for money in a great position right on the beach but still close to all the markets and restaurants you could explore! Their staff are the best asset to the resort and all did a wonderful job during our stay!",Puri Saron Seminyak
386,dissappointed,30,January 2016,"We arrived early hours of the morning due to delayed flight, we had organised transfers and they waited for us which was a plus. When we arrived our welcome was what you would call rude. I booked 4 rooms for the family and the configuration were incorrect. Next day had to pay for an extra room ...so much confusion. Our bathroom was not overly clean and the towels smelt. We never received welcome drink or the massage which was supposed to be included. The location was good and most of the staff were great. Pool staff excellent. Would not stay at this hotel , overpriced for what it is.",Puri Saron Seminyak
387,Amazing 5D4N,50,December 2015,"Me and my girlfriend family stayed here from Dec 26th to Dec 30. It's been an amazing experience staying in there. Great swimming pool, AMAZING BEACH VIEW, friendly staff.
However, the bathroom was a little bit smelly when we flush the toilet, I think because of the drainage. But overall, I'll make sure we stay here again next time.",Puri Saron Seminyak
388,Slight hiccup but very pleased,40,January 2016,"We had a slight hiccup with not being given the room we booked however the staff were very apologetic and gave us a refund,which doesnt happen very often. The staff were very understanding of our complaint and were very quick to rectify the issue. Very professional and great to deal with, especially Liza.

The room we did get was large and the bathroom was massive. We took our 1 year old so the big space was good for him to crawl around.

The hotel grounds are really very nice, especially walking through the resort at night, it has a lovely feel.

The breakfast buffet was good and had plenty of choice. The pool and pool bar was really cool, one of the highlights.

The wood oven pizza that you can order at the pool was to die for. Best pizza in bali without a doubt. Worth a visit and try for sure.

Cant fault the staff. Every one of them were lovely and very welcoming and always interacted with our baby with was really nice.

Overall, despite our initial hiccup I would definitely recommend this reaort and would happily stay there again. We really enjoyed our stay.

Thank you to all at the Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak
389,Friendly staff!,30,January 2016,"The pool bar and facilities were good. They have darts and chess available!
The staff were extremely friendly and attentive especially as we were quite sick they brought breakfast free to our room as we could not make it down.
Easy access to bars out the front walking right on to the beach and the sunset is directly in front.
Recommend walking 3 minutes to cocoon beach bar for dinner and drinks. 10 minutes walk to main market street but we often got a taxi back from the other end as it was so HOT!. Make sure you ask for the metre to be turned on you will pay about $2 to get back to the hotel and that's with a tip!!!
$5 trip to Kuta in taxi! But free shuttle available twice a day through the hotel

The room was ok, good size but found the pillows too hard for our liking. We had the deluxe bungalow.
The bathroom was HUGE but it had a bad odour at times (sewerage smell) but luckily the door could be shut and it doesn't protrude into the room.
Great air con!

The mozzies are insane so make sure you bring some repellent! In the bungalow there is not screen so we found ourselves trying to catch them
Before bed in the room. Made for entertainment!
Good TV available lots of movie channels

Late check out available as our flight was at 10:30pm but it did cost is about $80 and the latest was 6pm. Still worked out well as we could have dinner then get picked up.

The best thing is the staff, they are so friendly!",Puri Saron Seminyak
390,Overall a great experience!,40,January 2016,"The Rooms were of a good clean standard with an in-room safe. The BBQ Grill 'till 5pm daily was delicious. The Pool Bar was of a good standard and services by some great staff. The complex had access to the beach in Seminyak. The Hotel was in a great position - close to 'Eat Street,' and was situated in a quite part of Seminyak. We will be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
391,Great stay,50,December 2015,Just returned from 5 nights. Great stay. Very clean. Air con was nice and cold. Rooms were big enough. Location great. Big pool. Breakfast had a few different options. Staff very helpful. Will return again to this hotel,Puri Saron Seminyak
392,Great location and fantastic staff!,50,December 2015,Has a great pool bar and our room was clean with a really comfortable bed. Location is perfect and can walk to Seminyak or Legian for shopping and dining. Huge thanks to Alit the Front Office Manager and Sammy at the pool bar! Fantastic staff and will definitely go back. Thanks for a fantastic time!,Puri Saron Seminyak
393,The hotel's best resource: It's Staff!,30,December 2015,"The hotel could be so much more if the management chose to maintain the hotel well. I found the hotel to be relatively clean but pretty sure it's possible to find other hotels of better value at the price we paid.

Pros: The staff! (The sewage smell in our Deluxe rooms were really bad and they upgraded us to larger rooms with no additional cost - thank you for that). Room service and housekeeping were extremely accommodating and responsive to our requests. Even front desk and concierge were efficient.

Cons: You have to walk a distance to get to the main street. Breakfast - limited options and not very delicious. Fresh towels in our rooms were stained.

- Bring mosquito repellent especially if you'e staying in the Deluxe Chalet/Bungalows.
- Transport arranged by the Hotel is affordable @ 70,000IDR for a 7 seater to Seminyak Square",Puri Saron Seminyak
394,Nice and on the beach,40,August 2015,"We was testing this Hotel in 2 times Okt. and Nov. 2014
it was very good and helpful sevice.

395,Restaurant within the resort,40,November 2015,This small restaurant which opens onto the main street was very good value for money and the food was great. There was plenty to choose from and a great place for a lunch time meal and it is open for breakfast and dinner. It is a good place to stop either going to or coming home from the beach. The staff and service were very good.,Puri Saron Seminyak
396,Good hotel for everyone in Seminyak,40,October 2015,"good quality. Rooms are big, clean, with all facilities. The bed is very comfortable, The food of the restaurant is good but a bit expensive. The hotel is situated at a few kilometres from Seminyak center, but just in front of the beach, which have good bars and restaurants with live music every night. Ambience is very good. perfect for surfing. People there were nice but a lot more ""occidentals"" than in the mountain places, and worst in the service and politeness. The pool is also beautiful and good. Perfect for families.",Puri Saron Seminyak
397,Best service to keep customers happy,40,January 2015,"We stayed here as a family of four and had booked for two weeks. Upon arrival there was major construction work of a new hotel going on next door and was a lot of noise at the front of the hotel. The first room we were taken to did not have a king bed as ordered and was near a main walkway which would of been noisy and we were wanting a holiday with peace and relaxation. It was also not very big. We requested another room and they obliged. The second room we were taken to was much bigger, had a queen bed, but the balcony faced out to the construction work and I could hear the banging of hammers so was still not overly happy for a two week stay which staff could see on my face. They then said to wait and they would arrange something and upgraded us to the front of the hotel, huge room, king bed, ocean and pool views, quiet and was absolutely wonderful at no extra cost. Could not have asked more for a two week stay. If we stayed again we would book same rooms at the front of the hotel, ground floor where you could go straight out to the pool or sit on your little veradah and watch the kids in the pool. The front rooms are more luxurious and the back of the hotel clean but more basic. Their breakfast buffet could do with an overhaul but overall a great stay, good swim up bar, good shallow pool for little ones to swim and easy walking distance to great beach restaurants and shopping. Wifi had great connection. Thank you Puri Saron",Puri Saron Seminyak
398,Great location.,40,November 2015,"I'm not one for fancy hotels, so this fit my needs perfectly. We stayed 4 nights.

Cons:
-We had a room on the 3rd floor, was quite small. There were 3 of us, so we paid extra for an extra bed/cot which made the room feel even tinier. There were also no drawers or anywhere to store clothing/belongings. All our stuff ended up spewed all over the floor.
-Wifi was slow.
-We noticed you could smell sewage from the bathroom sometimes.

Pros:
-Great location! Right on the beach. If you go out past the pool onto a little street, there's plenty of little shops to go to.
-The complimentary breakfast buffet was great! We woke up early every day and they were always open.
-The staff is wonderfully helpful and polite.
-The pool! There's a cute little swim up bar. It's a decent sized pool so it never felt too crowded.

All in all, it is no 5 star resort, but I enjoyed staying here and would again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
399,"Great Location, better than expected",30,November 2015,"We stayed here for 4 nights and my initial expectations were sceptical due to some trip advisor reviews & photos, but was pleasantly surprised.
We booked 2 rooms - 1 Superior Chalet for hubby and I and 1 Superior twin for our children. The Chalet is a little tired and the bathroom door would not close. It was ground floor with garden views and patio area for sitting outside. The superior room has been updated but the bathroom had a terrible sewerage smell. Kids were happy with wifi in their room.
The pool area was great with plenty of sun beds. We thought the drinks at the swim up bar were quite expensive compare to our previous accommodation in Kuta.
Location was good, close to some great restaurants and shops",Puri Saron Seminyak
400,"It's not 4 star, don't go off the photos.",20,November 2015,"My partner and I booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and pictures on the website for 3 nights. It was meant to be a 4 star hotel in Seminyak. We had been staying in 4 and 5 star resorts in Legian and Ubud.

I'll try and make this as short as our stay there. Cons: Sewage smell, dark, old, stained sheets and towels in every room we were put in. Very tired hotel, very old. You can't get a taxi out the front and the staff ask the guys waiting out the front how much to take you up the road, it's too much so they point and tell you to walk out the front to find a cab. Not 4 star. Not what it looks like in the photos.

Pros: The location is great, right on the beach. The pool area is nice, breakfast is ok. The manager was friendly and nice. Tried to help as much as he could. The young man who helped with our bags was lovely. The grounds of the hotel were nice.

Don't make the same mistake we did going from the nice pictures as that's not what you will find.",Puri Saron Seminyak
401,"Great Location, friendly staff",40,November 2015,"My friends and I stayed for a week at puri Saron and it was the perfect location for both hanging around the hotel and chilling at the beach as well as going for day trips out to Uluwatu, Ubud etc.
one of my friends I was travelling with slipped on a tile in the hotel lobby on the second day and hurt her foot. Staff were overly accomodation and upgraded our rooms so we could be on the bottom floor so she didn't have to climb stairs and also gave her crutches. Very sweet and accomodating. Would recommend and would stay again!",Puri Saron Seminyak
402,Great Location / terrible wifi,40,October 2015,"This hotel is located right near some shops, restaurants and its on the beach. The pool is awesome and has a swim up bar...sometimes its open other times its not... we couldn't figure the schedule out. The breakfast was very good considering it was included in the price. Restaurants on the beach outside the hotel had live music and entertainment, was great for a relaxing night.
One down side was the room had no dresser or drawers. Basically we lived out of our suitcase and it was very frustrating to stay organized.

The bathroom sewer or water also smelled terrible, it seemed most rooms had this problem so we didn't bother to try to change rooms.

The hotel grounds is nice and big and great to stroll and walk around and we felt very safe.

The wifi was TERRIBLE. They seem to have multiple wifi connections but none of them worked properly it was extremely frustrating and the biggest downside to staying here. Being from the States we relied on wifi to contact friends and family and it was just absolutely awful.

All and all good value for the price we payed to stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
403,Great hotel,50,April 2015,"I stayed for 6 nights with my family and our friends family and we loved it! The hotel was pretty good! The beach was nice however it took too long to walk to the water! Breakfast was good! The rooms were very clean and presentable! The internet connection was really weak from my room but if you go to the end of the corridor, the connection is much stronger!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
404,Great Location,40,October 2015,"Resort is on the beach, perfect location for the beach lover / surfer & Sunset watcher. Handy location to beach bars, shopping & caf√©s. We stayed in a garden ground floor twin share room, the room was clean, air conditioner worked well. While the resort is aged and could do with a refurbishment it was clean and reasonably comfortable. The pool is large with varying depths, one section suitable for young children, swim up bar, reasonable amount of sun lounges although you always get one party that reserve the sun lounges with their towels and exit the resort for several hours. Breakfast was included and not the best, the bacon was ordinary and tasteless (think it was shoulder bacon), although could get by on a light breakfast with their other breakfast offerings. All in all I think I would stay again",Puri Saron Seminyak
405,Will be back,40,October 2015,"This was our third time at this resort and we love it. Though not flash the resort itself and the location is perfect for us.

The only thing I would suggest is that staff wander around the pool area more offering food and beverage especially when seated down the front under the tree as I found I had to always go to the bar to order then they would bring it which is no problem but a thought that not only would it benefit guests im sure the resort would benefit also, im sure this is a suggestion that could be made by management, other than that the staff behind the pool bar are awesome and very friendly.

Thanks again for a wonderful stay we will be back",Puri Saron Seminyak
406,Disappointed,20,October 2015,"We spent 9 days at the Puri saron & will be our last. We found the staff not overly friendly & breakfast was possibly the worst I've ever experienced whilst on holidays. The selection at breakfast was poor to say the least and very rarely did we experience anything new to eat. Mash potatoes, rice, soggy French toast etc etc.
The rooms were ok but try and opt to stay away from the side of the resort where there is a lot of construction going on.
Pool was good but no music or entertainment around poolside which was a little disappointing.
The resort does not allow for taxis to pick you up from there. This is there way to get you to use the resorts transport which is 3x more expensive then a blue bird.
Do yourself a favour stay clear of Puri Saron & check out the Breezes !! We stayed there last year and it was faultless !!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
407,3.5 Stars probably.......,30,October 2015,"Let's get the worst thing out the way first, the wedding groups staying at the hotel when we did. It became a schoolies break for the 25 - 40 year olds and to be honest the way they acted round the swim up pool bar was disgraceful, no regard for anybody else and yes both groups from Australia. The other travellers from other countries just watched on in horror. Maybe we were unlucky but it really effected our stay.
When they were not around the pool area was lovely, great breeze but be warned, sun beds with brollies are at a premium and get reserved before 8.00 am. The pool has seen better days and really needs a good clean but was still great to swim in. Service at swim up pool bar a bit hit and miss but still nice to have a drink at.
Right on beach front and good choice of beach bars to both left and right hand sides when walking out of the hotel.
Room good size with great air con and good choice of TV channels in English. Bed king size and very comfortable. Very little wardrobe space though and the shower one of the worst, as others have said water goes everywhere and very poor water pressure.
Be careful as the closer the beach your room, the more noise you will hear from the beach bars until early hours of the morning.
Breakfast not the most options we have seen but always good, the egg station though needs sorting as some mornings the guys behind it didn't really know what they were doing, even frying eggs took three attempts.
Had dinner a few times in the hotel restaurant and was always very good, good choice and something for everybody. The Italian restaurant that is on the premises by the beach front has closed down and is becoming a bit of an eye sore as everything is covered in dust and sand. This really needs sorting out and quickly before it really impacts the guests staying at the hotel.
Overall had a good time but not sure we would stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
408,"Very tired, dirty & lacks attention to detail",10,September 2015,"We stayed here for one night before we returned to the UK having spent two weeks in Ubud and Gili Air. We originally booked this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews but when we arrived to the hotel we were so disappointed and actually thankful we only had one night here.

Our room was of a good size but was so tired and shabby inside that it made the huts we were staying on in the Gili islands seem like the Ritz. Our room also had a connecting door but no lock to stop the person in the other room opening the door and walking in! We ended up having to move all the furniture in the room in front of the door to barricade ourselves in so we had some security. I'm sorry to say the walls were also so thin we could hear everything going on in all the rooms around us.

The food at the hotel was also of poor quality and was either undercooked or overcooked and the menus lacked choice as well. We found that it was much better to take a walk out and find somewhere else to eat.

Other than the lobby the rest of the hotel seemed very tired, perhaps of a good quality ten years ago but as and when maintenance needed doing the jobs haven't been done properly. Sadly this really detracts the overall image of the hotel and it appears very shabby as you walk around. The standard of cleanliness around the hotel was very poor, notably the swimming pool. From the photos the pool area looks wonderful with a nice seated area around the bar in the pool BUT when you are in the pool you cannot help but notice the green slime all the way round the walls. This was the whole way round the pool. There is simply no excuse for this low level of cleaning. The staff were very friendly but sadly all the issues surmount to poor attention to detail and thus poor management.

The hotel is in a good location next to the beach and close to the airport but sadly this hotel lets itself down and for the price there are much much better places to stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
409,Great location and great pool area,40,October 2015,A nice hotel in a great area. Nice staff. Breakfast was good. The rooms could do with an update however the bathroom was spacious and great. Nice swim up bar and large pool area. Easy walking distance to shopping and great food.,Puri Saron Seminyak
410,Seminyak Sunshine,30,August 2015,"Everyday the sun shined in Seminyak. The hotel location was convenient to the beach. The hotel services were basic. The staff were helpful and friendly. I like walking and so it was ok for me to take the long hike into Legian and Kuta, but if you didn't like walking the location is quite a way out of the main places.
I have been to Bali at least 6 times and if I go again I wouldn't stay in Seminyak again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
411,It started badly and ended well!,40,September 2015,We arrived at 1 in the morning and were given a room on the third floor. There was no hot water and the plug stuck! After maintenance tried to fix it the manager upgraded us for free to a ground floor nicer room...and from then on it was great! Breakfast is a comprehensive buffet. The pool is situated between the rooms and the beach. The location is great. Outside the back entrance is a path leading to some lovely restaurants. Scooters use this path as well so it is interesting to people watch. The staff are helpful although I found the tour desk lacking.,Puri Saron Seminyak
412,Great hotel location,40,May 2015,"This was our first time staying in Seminyak as we usually stay in the busy parts but this was such a great change. The hotel is right on the beach with a beautiful view of the sunsets and a bean bag restaurant right on the steps. The rooms were nice, air conditioned, old decor and a good sized bed. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful, they called and booked restaurants for us on our request and helped us with transport. It's really close to one of the main streets in Seminyak, close to popular places such as Frankensteins. The pool was amazing, it was always warm and it has private little cabanas you can lay in during the day and a swim up bar. The breakfast buffet in the morning was always great with a good selection of food. We will definitely stay here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
413,Nice position .,30,September 2015,"We have just arrived back after staying five nights at this hotel , at checking in we were taken to a room next to a building sight which I said was not to my liking at all , so we were upgraded to a delux garden room with a four poster bed and large bathroom .The drains were smelling and I was forever running hot water down them , my feet were forever black walking in the room , don't think they were easing them . The gardens were lovely ,and the beach was fantastic with the biggest waves I have ever seen , you can walk into Kuta about 40mins very nice .Breakfast was lovely ,and very pleasant staff were excellent ,lots of choice , The only big down side was the pool very worm and very dirty ,it could do with a good clean around the tiles ,we didn't like it there so went to beach , good nightlife on the beach ,live music from 6pm till about 11pm .",Puri Saron Seminyak
414,Outstanding hotel on beach,50,September 2015,"What an amazing find. This hotel is right on the beach, provides excellent accommodation together with outstanding service. The breakfast offers great variety and the barbeque at the poolside is fabulous and reasonably priced. The front office manager Alit was very friendly and helpful. He ensured that we were comfortable and that everything was to our satisfaction. Our room was spotless and all the staff were helpful and pleasant all the time. A real jewel amongst beautiful gardens with the beach in the background.
Tip: The taxi to the hotel from Seminyak Square was only $3",Puri Saron Seminyak
415,Ticks the boxes,40,October 2015,"If you want clean, comfortable accommodation in a prime location for a great price this is it. Rooms are basic but clean, comfortable and very spacious. Aircon is excellent. Pool area is lovely and overlooks the beach. Grounds of the hotel are lush and immaculate. Service is exceptional. Bonus is that the pool is open until 9pm",Puri Saron Seminyak

417,Great welcome to bali awaits,50,October 2015,"Staying here the first few days of me and my fiance first trip to bali. What a lovely hotel I have to say. The rooms nice, spacious and clean. The grounds with all the plants and landscape are very pretty and the pool is perfect for a few bintangs late in the afternoon and the staff are so friendly and always smiling.If you like big waves and a good beach luckily enough it's only about 5 metres from the pool. To top it off its my birthday and they left a cake in my room. What a lovely touch. Thank puri saron

418,Recently stayed here,30,September 2015,"The room was quite large very clean, modern furniture and king bed over looking the pool area very nice. It was the first hotel we have been in that you had to lock the door from the outside we also had trouble closing and locking the door. The water pressure was unacceptable as was the length of time you had to wait for hot water. The towel fell off the wall and cut my wifes forearm, the cleaning staff were very good they told maintenance and it was repaired nothing from management. We also noticed other rails being replaced. My wife is recovering from a broken ankle and walking was a struggle trying to get a taxi to go out entailed walking to the main street as they dont come to the hotel to pickup only drop off. Check your bills as we paid twice for room service after bringing it to there attention they refunded the money. They kept saying sorry the staff were all good that was not the problem. The problem was their system allowed it to happen after we had already paid.",Puri Saron Seminyak
419,Hotel in Seiminyak,30,September 2015,"We were upgraded to reasonably new room. It is clean and modern and close to the pool. The breakfast which was included in the tariff was quite good and was in a great location. Heaps of Australians stay at the hotel and many are return clients. Overall the place was clean and very close to the beach. Don't go to AJO's restaurant which is beachside within the hotel complex, what a disaster.",Puri Saron Seminyak
420,Recent stay,30,September 2015,"Hi, we have just returned from Bali and we stayed at the Puri Saron and would like to share my opinion. Firstly on arrival, it was asked for us to pay the full amount for the stay and we refused offering to pay only 4 nights which they eventually accepted. We were taken to the room which cost about $170 after exchange rate) which consisted of a king size bed and a super large bathroom which was really nice. The bed was comfortable but the room smelt mouldy and clearly it was old, just old. Doors didnt lock properly, others didnt have hot water and rooms smelled of sewerage. We complained to the Manager about the room the next day and all three groups were upgraded to one of their larger and more modern rooms above the restuarant, these were really nice but our door didnt lock and the water wasnt hot.

The pool area is great, the breakfast wasnt varied but sufficed, staff were good, the price for a couch on the beach was 200 thousand ($20.00 AUS) whereas just 80 metres up it is only 30 thousand ($3.00 AUS) and generally the grounds were nice.

But what you see on the website is certainly not what you get sadly. Its very difficult to get a taxi and you must walk up the back street to get one. We asked for them to call one and were told that taxi's were not permitted to enter without passengers?

The manager handled our complaints quite diplomatically but mentioned several times it was about ""our perception"". I have to agree but we usually stay at Kumala Pantai for $100 and it is way way better value and atmosphere than here.",Puri Saron Seminyak
421,Balinese Charm in a Perfect Locstion,40,August 2015,"I've been staying at this location since 2004 why??? Quality of the staff and location. The hotel has the charm of Balinese traditional design, no sleek concrete here, and the gardens are well maintained plus it sits directly on the beach. Buffet breakfast is included with your room. The rooms have been upgraded over the years, i had a queen bed which was comfortable, amenities in the bathroom, large TV, a comfortable stay overall. The pool is large and staff accommodating. I love having a morning expresso in the little restaurant sitting on the end of the property overlooking the beach. I enjoy spending the mornings on the beach and having a late afternoon swim in the pool. The Italian Restaurant by the beach serves delicious home made fresh pasta and is run by a charming woman who really knows how to cook. WiFi is often not working by the pool but was good in my room and the lobby. My room was a garden room.",Puri Saron Seminyak
422,"Great location, typical Balinese hote. & amazing staff",40,August 2015,"We stayed for 9 days in August. It was the most relaxing holiday I have had for a few years. The staff are so welcoming & helpful. If you are looking for a trendy hotel with all the glitz & glam, this place is not for you. Its for people looking for a more authentic Balinese hotel. Rooms are of the older style, but very clean & cleaned every day. The beds are also comfortable. It's location gets an A+ from us, right on the beach & a short walking distance to mini marts & bars. A short taxi ride to Seminyak Square or Kuta. Our host Alit (FOM) was always showing up somewhere we were to check if we were happy or required anything. A guy that truly loves his job & its shows. Can't wait to return in the very near future....!!!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
423,Good location & pool,30,August 2015,"Stayed here for 1 week. Hotel was ok. I would definately recommend getting an upgraded room. The deluxe rooms are very very average. Bathrooms old & bedding wasn't the cleanest. Also very noisy area. We were upgraded to a bungalow room which we appreciated. Much better room, however still not the cleanest. The breakfast was just ok, however the pool area was good. Always in the full sun, so is always warm. People put towels on chairs really early, so difficult to get a pool chair. Location was great as it is right on the beach & close to shops.
The old saying 'you get what you pay for'
Staff were always friendly.",Puri Saron Seminyak
424,Puri Saron Seminyak- A rewarding experience,50,August 2015,"We are frequent visitors to Bali and have stayed regularly at this resort located just up from Double 6 in Seminyak. It is not your typical concrete and sterile environment and is supported by vacationers from all demographics. The management is attentive and very hands on and are welcoming in the extreme. We book the bungalow rooms which offer delightful creature comforts and nice ambiance looking across nicely manicured gardens and water features. With the A$ struggling against the US$ it is a little expensive coming in at circa A$140-$145 per night. Pool staff, front office staff and reservation staff are very accommodating in typical Balinese fashion. Breakfast is a varied and plentiful buffet and casual food partaken at the swim up bar is inexpensive and nourishing. Pool Bar prices are reasonable with a reduction during ""happy hour"". The warungs on the beach are a nice alternative and the sunset drinks on the beach are a delight. The resort is located close to all restaurants on the strip and we have taken the beach walk from La Lucciola, Potato Head Ku De Ta on many occasions. We do highly recommend this resort.",Puri Saron Seminyak
425,Authentic Bali Hotel - Puri Saron Seminyak,40,August 2015,"As ""seasoned"" Bali goers we have stayed at many popular hotels and Villas.

We have chosen to stay at Puri Saron several times, we feel like we are returning to our Bali family.

I agree that the infrastructure is dated, however it does ooze charm, has authentic Bali design/style and is not cluttered with concrete and clunky westernisation.

We choose to stay in the Bungalow rooms, situated close to restaurant and pool, we enjoy the tranquility of the bali garden views and the native wildlife.

We highly regard all staff in every sector, from the management team to the garden lads....each and every team member strives to provide exceptional service, they are genuine, sincere people who readily meet their guests needs with friendly banter and a good senses of humour.

The disparity of the Aussie dollar v US dollars is hurting us Aussies at the moment, as hotel Tarif is set at $US

Thankyou -Alit Merta and the Puri Saron staff, we will be back to see you all soon.

426,Good value,40,September 2015,"Easy access to the beach, nice pool area, polite and attentive staff, breakfast was a bit ordinary, rooms were basic and lacking a bit in amenities, overall this is a pleasant stay and quite good value for the price range.",Puri Saron Seminyak
427,Great Hotel Great Location,50,September 2015,"My husband and I stayed here for eight days and thoroughly enjoyed our time here.
The staff were excellent and were more than willing to help us anyway they could.
The Manager Alit helped us with a problem we had trying to confirm a booking we had with a tour company, he managed to make contact and all worked out well.Thank you Alit.
Our room was a bungalow room close to the restaurant and close to the pool. The rooms are clean and spacious and lookout onto beautiful tropical gardens.
Breakfast buffet is delicious.
You can catch a hotel shuttle bus into Kuta at 10am and book a return shuttle for 2.30pm which is very handy.
The whole hotel is right on the beach which makes it perfect for watching those lovely Balinese sunsets. You don't hear any noise from the beach area at night which makes it better still. They whole complex is really relaxing and the staff make you feel very welcome and always have lovely smiles.
My husband and I will be returning next year again.
You can walk along the beach to Legion or Kuta, or the local Bintang market.",Puri Saron Seminyak
428,Overall Good Hotel,30,September 2015,"Overall I enjoyed my two night stay at the Puri Saron Hotel.

The pros: very friendly and helpful staff who helped me book surf lessons and massages. The room was a good size and the air conditioning worked well. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The hotel pool and swim up bar was fantastic. The location is great, bordering Legian and Seminyak. The beach is at the hotel's doorstep.

The cons: I was on the third story of the hotel and there didn't seem to be any lifts. This was pretty tiring climbing up and down in 30 degree heat. The bed wasn't that comfortable compared to a previous Seminyak Hotel I'd stayed at. I wanted to keep the air conditioning on at night, as it was so hot I couldn't sleep. However, you needed to keep the room card key in the slot next to the door and it turned on a light at the door that you couldn't turn off. I had to sleep with the light on all night and wear a sleeping mask. I mentioned it to the hotel staff, but unfortunately there was no way to turn the light off. The hotel was a bit pricey for Indonesia (NZ$148 per night).

It was a nice hotel, but a but dated. I'll most likely try something else if I come back to Seminyak.",Puri Saron Seminyak
429,Great location but......,30,August 2015,"Took the family to Bali for the first time and decided to stay at the Puri Saron Seminyak primarily for location. While the location is very good, i.e.. close to shopping and across from the beach the hotel itself is old, in need of updating and repairs and generally not a 4 star hotel.
Checkin was simple however no site map, information was provided so that a guest could find things in the area. The hotel itself was quite run down and it was quite visible to missing bricks in the driveway to paint etc. etc.
Breakfast was provided but often cold and flavourless. Staff were friendly enough however you would only get one coffee and then you had to chase around to get a refill. The restaurants on the property used the same paperwork but were separate from the hotel itself so you could not charge to your room. Forget trying to keep a tab at the pool bar, even though you giver your room number, you had to pay after you order.
No activities were planned or offered even though the hotel was full and plenty of families were staying there.
The beach bars were very close and very noisy on some occasions into the early hours. However on the plus side, the staff were very friendly and the location was great as there were many options for restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance of the hotel. Our favourite was Kuali restaurant just past Cocoon nightclub. Excellent food, excellent price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
430,Better than average üòä,30,August 2015,"Booked for just one night, got a ground floor bungalow for $164, and breakfast included. Right on the beach, perfectly situated between Seminyak and Legian, this is a classic, relaxed Bali style resort. Affordable for families, well kept and maintained, perfectly adequate, just lacks a fitness centre, though there are a couple within a 5 minute walk. Boasts a beachside Sardinian restaurant called Ajo.",Puri Saron Seminyak
431,Excellent Service and Very Friendly Staff,50,August 2015,This is the second time I have stayed at Puri Saron. The service is outstanding!! The Manager Alit will do anything to help. All the other Staff are so friendly and helpful. Most speak good English. Location is perfect right on the beach. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Always upgrade to a Deluxe Bungalow being closer to the beach and pool. No negatives about this place at all if you are looking for a 4 star hotel in the best location.,Puri Saron Seminyak
432,Fourth time at this Hotel,40,August 2015,"Just returned from our fourth stay at this Hotel and the location still can't be beaten. It's a comfortable and relaxing place with a great pool, great gardens and excellent staff. Priskila at the pool bar does a great job and she is helpful and friendly. Alit will do what he can to make your stay enjoyable. Everything you need is close at hand. Across the road from the main entrance and down a small lane is a laundry (100 metre walk max.) that do a great job very cheaply. A further short walk will get you to transport where you can barter with a driver to take you wherever you want to go, hire a scooter or a little further on down at the corner, you will find plenty of taxis. Around the corner you will found Circle K stores with ATM and money changing faclities and where you can top up on supplies. All of these are within a 5 minute walk of the main entrance. The best money changer we have found is up on Legian Road. It is diagonally opposite(by about 20 or 30 metres) and just past the entrance into Bintang Supermarket with always a good exchange rate. Out the back of the Hotel you virtually step straight onto the beach with plenty of great restaurants/bars/cafes within easy walking distance. The construction site next door is still ongoing but I have never found it to be a problem with noise. Wifi works fine, breakfast is good and changes everyday, never had a problem with mosquitoes, noises or smells. We had a great time at this Hotel and we will be back again in the not too distant future.",Puri Saron Seminyak
433,"Beachfront, clean and friendly hotel",40,August 2015,"Friday evening checkin was quick and efficient. All services were explained including free 10min free massage, welcome drink, and wifi. Deluxe room booked and we were put into garden facing room on top floor. Large room and balcony. Bed was good and room clean with plugin mozzie repellant . Bath leaked and small room cleaned and floors mopped everyday. Not first time to Bali we were not surprised by the usual smells and noises associated with beachfront. Only that the first night the bar had a disco going with the bass up that high all the glass was vibrating and didn't stop until 5am. Lucky not light sleeper and the disco party moved down the beach the following nights. There are no lifts so if you are elderly or can't do stairs then let staff know when booking room. Breakfast buffet good and staff attentive. Free shuttle to Kuta twice a day and one pickup (need to book) pool very good with swim up bar . Usual at any resort around the world the reserving of beds for the whole day only using late in the afternoon. Ugly male from England even tried to tip elderly male off a lounge he considered ""his"". Get a life pal move to the beach where you can buy a lounge for the day. Noticed bungalows near pool were regularly mistaken for toilets and people walking into enclosure or knocking on doors. Good restaurants nearby and great surf beach. Great pizza at warong bola at beachfront of hotel but not part of hotel so need cash. Good spot for young and young at heart. very busy pathway at beachfront with motorbikes and service vehicles . We will stay at our preferred sanur side of the island for the quietness and no motorbikes on pathway at beachfront and fewer hawkers. . Still LOVE Bali",Puri Saron Seminyak
434,Good location but won't come back,30,August 2015,"Review of our 7 night stay in deluxe bungalow chalet

PROS:
-location - right on the beach, la plancha beach bar at your doorstep, cocoon, double six etc, short walk is the main shopping precinct
- mosquito nets on beds - needed as they are everywhere
- staff are lovely & helpful, rooms are clean
- restaurant 'warung bola' is located next to the premises with amazing authentic wood fired pizza made by a local Italian.

CONS
- can't open the door for fresh air as Mosquitos will come in - hotel needs to invest in fly screen.
- the bathroom STUNK of a stale sewerage smell. We called house keeping a few times who promptly came but the smell would only come back. Unable to open the door (due to Mosquitos) or windows in the bathroom made this worse.
- not good for light sleepers- the beds are squeaky
- there are not enough pool chairs for everyone to use when hotel is busy
- the pool is very warm

Conclusion: The sewerage smell bothered us the most and really let the place and our experience down and because of this we won't be back. Yes its a great beachside location but if you have no problems walking, taxi or even hiring a scooter then you can definitely get a better hotel for less $$ .",Puri Saron Seminyak
435,Did the job,30,July 2015,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Puri Saron the whole two weeks we were in Bali and found it to be a nice hotel. To start with, we were placed in the styled hotel room that we had booked (a twin deluxe). The room was quite big with a balcony over looking some lovely gardens. The aircon did not work and the bed was horribly uncomfortable. After experiencing some issues with the floor boards, reception kindly offered to upgrade us to a deluxe bungalow which we found a lot more accommodating. The aircon worked but the bed still wasn't all that great. We enjoyed our stay at the Puri Saron based on the money we paid for it. Facilities were good such as the pool and the breakfast was satisfying. Perfect location in seminyak as well!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
436,GREAT LOCATION - TIRED BUT CHEERFUL,30,September 2014,"Selected this hotel on position (between Legian & Seminyak) and price. We stayed in the two bedroom villa (Villa 5) for 7 nights then a one bedroom (Villa 3) for 4 nights with friends in garden room (4110). The resort grounds are lovely - mature gardens with plenty of grassed areas that are well maintained. Villa 5 is located at the beach end of the property - the villa is tired & very basically furnished - could do with a complete redecoration (over $400US/night). Both bedrooms have king sized beds (web site indicated twin beds in second bedroom) and as mentioned by other reviews bed linen was not quite white, very large bathrooms that could do with a make-over & clean. The villa pool was not heated and was quite cold (compared to main pool), but very useful after a run on the beach, the pool area was in shade by 2ish. The key situation was interesting - separate electronic cards used to open the doors of both bedrooms - which meant you could not enter the room without a card, the doors could not be left ajar - alarm, which was a pain when relaxing around the villa, also the gates to the compound didn't have a latch, so it was just blowing in the wind (slamming endlessly and so were the other villa gates), which meant people from the restaurant next door following the 'Toilet' sign were able to easily walk in. The Villa pools are not suitable for small children - only one 60ish cm step into pool, then another 60ish cm drop to the bottom - the main pool would be more suitable - many many levels. As Villa 5 is adjacent to a restaurant (not the resorts), the resort pool (loud music) and near the 'bean bag' doof doof restaurants there is quite a bit of noise until 11.30pm. Also a development site on the southern wall of the villas provides continuous 'works' noise during the day, which was more intrusive when we moved to Villa 3. WI-fi was frustrating - extremely slow (think elderly snail) and only available outside the Villa. Breakfast was the usual same-same, the lunch/pool BBQ satay etc were very nice & handy!, we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant. The staff were lovely, particularly reception - booking us various restaurants - Sardine, Sarong, Cuco and the list goes on, as well as arranging transportation and various other recommendations.",Puri Saron Seminyak
437,One of the best in seminyak,50,June 2015,"Had a great time. Room was amazing, close to everything and the staff were fantastic. Spent 12 amazing days and had a blast. Wifi worked well, food was awesome, pool was great with 3 areas and a swim up bar too! Thanks to all the staff but special mention to Alit for making a birthday even more special. Will recomend to everyone.",Puri Saron Seminyak
438,Lovely stay,40,July 2015,"Excellent location on Seminyak beach. Lovely pool and could get a lounger at any point in the day. Breakfast phenomenal! Very friendly staff. Safe, TV and balcony/terrace. Very clean. Close to all shops and amenities. However we had a room on the bottom floor close to the main walkway through the hotel which was pretty loud. Very basic bathroom and poor wi-fi. Paying for location. Expensive for Indonesia.",Puri Saron Seminyak
439,"Really, not bad at all",40,July 2015,"This hotel is pretty good location..but still i consider to have a car or motorcycle, its kind of hard to find taxi..

Behind theres a la planca bar and many more..just a step away from the hotel...

Interior a bit old, still enjoyable..

The bathroom isssss hhhhuuuggeeeeee....
i stay at bungalow...

Minus? Please find a way to reduce the mosquito insdie our room and the garden..or maybe a renov for a fresh look exterior and interior

The rest? Enjoyable

Not bad at all",Puri Saron Seminyak
440,"Great location , average hotel value.",30,July 2015,"Hotel in general in need of refurbishing and for the price paid you can do better. Great staff , huge pool with bar, breakfast ok, usual difficulty with lounges by the pool , mainly Aussies at hotel who put towels, books, etc on lounges early morning to save then for later sometimes very much later after shopping etc , meantime people have to sit on grass etc. Pool staff and security man not interested to take action after I pointed out a gazebo that had been "" saved"" for about 4 hours . Not good enough.",Puri Saron Seminyak
441,Location Location..at reasonable price‚Ä¶stayed here heaps of times,40,October 2014,"You simply can't beat the location..smack on the beach‚Ä¶nice walk to some great restos ‚Ä¶Gado Gado‚Ä¶Cocoon new brand new Double Six not to mention the hip beach bars.
Hotel itself is friendly with a nice big pool plenty of sun beds ‚Ä¶rooms are fine for the price‚Ä¶staff always helpful.
I have recommended friends and family if they want to stay in Seminyak without it costing a bomb‚Ä¶
If you want a bit of entertainment a stroll to Jln Dyana Purah will amuse.:)",Puri Saron Seminyak
442,i went last year in agust and i will come back this year fantastic hotel,50,August 2014,"My stay last year in Agust was really the best possible and i will come back this year. The beachfront location is a top, the rooms arevery largeand very clean, i booked a luxury with terrace on the garden. The service is great as well as the swimming pool area. Guests from all over the world very fiendly and polite. I reccommend really this very nice hotel for a stay in Seminyak",Puri Saron Seminyak
443,Great location,50,June 2015,"Was more than happy with this 3& half star hotel. A little tired, but lovingly maintained. Beautiful, traditional Balinese style. Staff are great. Breakfast was good, restaurant overlooking pool. We had a room overlooking the beautiful gardens, very quiet. Location fantastic, walk straight out to beach,which is wonderful at night with the bean bag lounge bars creating a great atmosphere. A couple of minutes from the front of the hotel to shops & restaurants. Pool area great with lots of loungers & shade. Complimentary massage was great, but was put off getting another due to the cost. Think they should lower the price to make it more appealing, rather than having their staff standing around doing nothing. Much better value at Grandmas Hotels down the road. Enjoyed yoga before breakfast at Prana just a 5 min taxi ride away.
Would definitely stay here again & have already recommended it to lots of people. Think the odd person who has found this hotel lacking may have overlooked the fact that they have paid for a 3 & half star hotel, love it!",Puri Saron Seminyak
444,Feel so at home here,50,July 2015,"Puri Saron is the first hotel we stayed in and coming back feels like being at home!! All the staff are amazing especially Alit , the pool bar team and room cleaners. We will never go anywhere else. Thank you all once again for making our holiday so enjoyable. We miss you already and can't wait to come back. Perfect location, literally minutes from anywhere",Puri Saron Seminyak
445,Good location to beach,30,June 2015,Stayed for 7 nights in June. Was given a ground floor garden view room in the new wing as requested.(After reading trip adviser reviews) Card reader didn't work for air con and lights maintenance came to fix it. Soon after went out for awhile came back again card reader not working... again fixed Then went out for dinner again card reader not working .... Now I was starting to get a annoyed surely there is a problem so after a big fuss and 4 maintenance men in our room they decided to replace the reader. Hurray!!! The rest of the time was really good breakfast was average and sometimes if you are late things don't get replaced but it gives you a start to the day. Very grateful for there baggage scales which they bought to the room.Enjoyed our stay. Nice spot to base yourself not too far from anywhere.,Puri Saron Seminyak
446,25 years since last visit and just as good,40,June 2015,"We are a family of 5 including 3 teenagers who stayed at Puri Saron for 3 nights late June. My husband and I last stayed at this resort 25 years ago on our first visit to Bali.
It has not changed at all and has been well maintained for it's age. Our teenage boys loved the buffet brecky. The pool is clean and open early so a swim after a long and early walk along the beach is good before brecky. It is in a perfect location in Seminyak, walk straight out the front to many beach bars and restaurants. The staff are friendly, the grounds are well maintained and we will definately be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
447,Feels like home,50,June 2015,"good value for money, our 3rd stay here, right on the beach, we stayed in a deluxe chalet, 4 poster bed with net, and you need it coz mozzies do find their way in, breakfast wasn't to my liking, but my partner loved it, you will need to bring your own Vegemite . the manager of the hotel is very accommodating and prompt at returning emails. Can't wait to return.",Puri Saron Seminyak
448,We just love it,40,June 2015,"We have stayed here many times and we just love it..though you have to keep in mind it is not a five star hotel ... So if your looking for a fancy, trendy, modern, updated hotel ... This is not for you...this place is tired, and some of the finishing are a little unusual and the linen is not always pure white.. But that's not to say that's it's not clean and lovingly looked after ....the gardens are relaxingly beautiful and spacious, Bali style, which is something we love and look for...the staff are amazing...and add to the incredible charm of this fabulous place, breakfast is something I can't wait to get to..every day is a new menu though it is a limited menu but what is on offer is excellent ..and the staff here are friendly and welcoming",Puri Saron Seminyak
449,Tranquil inside mayhem outside,30,June 2015,"The hotel was nice but in need of refurbishment in some areas,our room was comfortable but there was a sewage like smell in the bathroom which was unpleasant at times.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful,and the pool area was good with a small bar in the corner close to the beach which serves excellent snacks.
The resort of seminyak however I found very disappointing ruined by thousands of mopeds and seedy shops I certainly would not recommend seminyak to anyone.",Puri Saron Seminyak
450,Great hotel,40,June 2015,"Hotel had a great atmosphere , friendly staff and close to shops! If your into sitting by the beach, the hotel is 3 steps away from Seminyak beach! The pool bar was awesome especially the staff in the bar and the gardens are well looked after! Check in and check out was a breeze and if we needed anything they were there to help! Downfall would be the rooms definetly needed a fresh coat of paints Aswell as the shower was weirdly position with the bath however that didn't both us as much cause we eventually found a way for the shower head not to spray all over the bathroom floor thankyou for making us stay feel welcome and I would Definetly reccommend this hotel to others",Puri Saron Seminyak
451,Pur saron,30,August 2014,"Nice hotel right on beach.. close to eat street as well.. staff were friendly and polite great Pizza at there restaurant.. don't be confused with the Italian one to the left as your looking out to the beach...I say again puri,s restaurant .. great food.. would stay there again..",Puri Saron Seminyak
452,Amazing Stay,50,June 2015,"This was our Third time to Bali and Puri Saron was by far the best place we have stayed at .Excellent value for money very friendly staff ,nice clean rooms and a ideal location next to the beach cant wait to come back Roger And Debra Crouch",Puri Saron Seminyak
453,ARDIKA COOL.....,50,December 2014,"Ardika Cool.... is the best and his pool bar staff are all great even Dodik when he is monkeying around the place, or making funny cocktail animals the Monkey one is the best. We have stayed 5 x at this Hotel and each time is great that's why we love it a real Bali felling to the place , And we also come to see Manis the little ginger Cat hope he is still there when we come back again in Dec.",Puri Saron Seminyak
454,A Nice Stay,30,June 2015,"Best for: location, pool and garden area and comfortable bed.

Improvements needed: upgrade of cracked tiling and paint and quicker cleanup of balconies/ sitting areas by staff - many plates / bottles around outside super deluxe rooms.",Puri Saron Seminyak
455,Good value for a hotel right at the beach...,40,June 2015,"Nice, fairly clean hotel with a very good position right at the beach - you walk through a large garden with the hotel restaurants and pool to the back entrance and step right out to the beach (crossing a small back street at the foot of the entrance). Make sure you inspect the room before paying for anything at the arrival, as we first got a room adjacent to another one through a locked door and had to switch after the first night, as the noise level from that room was unbearable (basically, you want to pick the person who snores next to you, don't want the hotel to arrange that, right?). The hotel changed our room, but was resistant to any compensation for the first night... Otherwise - nice pool with a pool bar, good breakfast buffet, quiet. Oh! Unless you are a party animal, insist on a room as far as possible from the beach. There are beach bars one next to each other, each with some music production and they go till late night...",Puri Saron Seminyak
456,Very average,20,June 2015,"For $110 aud a night you can get alot better for your money in the area... the room was outdated and the bed linen was brownish not white and the bathroom had a shower over bath with a plastic curtain, drains always stunk so badly so had to keep the bathroom door closed :( not many options at brekfast. Staff were lovely and accomodating though. Over all though wouldnt reccomend this to anyone",Puri Saron Seminyak
457,Don't Judge A Book by it cover!,40,June 2015,"I made the cardinal sin of doing just that ""Judging a book by its cover"" on arrival at Puri Saron Seminyak on our recent holiday. My wife and her girl friends booked the accommodation on line some months earlier and as males do, I just went with the flow not researching any of the proposed accommodation that the ladies booked!

Having stayed at the Padma twelve months earlier I had commented on arrival at the entrance of the Puri Saron ""it's certainly not the Padma"" !
I've been eating those words ever since, the Resort is one of the original resorts in Bali and let me say it is extremely well presented with lush manicured gardens, three levels, large king size rooms all with balconies or 2 bedroom villas with there own pool. The staff are friendly, more than helpful and obliging! The resort has it own restaurant and the morning buffet breakfast is amazing with abundance of choices . The resort pool is huge with its swim up Bar and friendly service from Wyan! The pool is located over looking the beach and directly opposite the bean bag beach front bars to watch the sun set!
Directly set on either side of the beach front of the resort are both a Pizza restaurant and an Italian restaurant giving you ample dining options with bars and fantastic views of the world renowned sun sets! Over all the Puir Saron has it all if you are looking for a quality inexpensive holiday option then don't over look this gem in the rough! We certainly will be returning!",Puri Saron Seminyak
458,Lovely hotel by the beach,40,June 2015,"Had a really relaxing few nights at puri saron. Enjoyed the food and drinks served by the pool and the staff were all friendly and very helpful. Room was nice with good air conditioning and comfortable beds however there was a bad smell from the plug in the bath. The location was ideal, with some great bars on the beach right behind the hotel with live music in the evenings - great for watching the sunset.",Puri Saron Seminyak
459,First time,30,February 2015,"Spent a week at the Puri Saron in February room was ok. Good access to the beach, Stayed on the third floor with room next door being worked on so no sleep ins for us, had a late check out for 6pm and were locked out of the room a misunderstanding that was rectified. Great pizza nad bars on the beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
460,Totally Love this place.,50,May 2015,"We have travelled to Bali many times and have stayed usually in Legian, but decided to give this place a try. And we are so happy we did. Great position with all the activity on the beach at night, with coloured bean bags and live bands. The staff were outstanding and extremely friendly and helpful. We changed rooms mid stay and moved to a Junior Suite near the pool and it was fantastic. The pool is amazing. Highly recommend this place and it is good value too.",Puri Saron Seminyak
461,Convenient beachfront location close to fancy tourist area,40,May 2015,"The Super Deluxe room at Puri Saron is spacious, has a balcony, and in the bathroom you will find a bathtub and a separate shower. I had no issues with the AC. Although the room is quite a few steps from the main entrance/reception (no stairs/steps along the way) it is, in my opinion, better located as it is closer to the beach, swimming pool and restaurant. Also consider the fact that most times you will take the back exit which gives you direct access to the beach promenade (5+ Km stretch along Kuta-Seminyak) where you will also find plenty of beach front sunset restaurants.

Not much can be found walking out through the main entrance (no bank, convenience store, laundry, money exchange), 10 min walk minimum before you find anything interesting so, if walking, take the rear/beach exit anyway and your stroll will be much more enjoyable (slightly longer though). Once on the city center/tourist zone, plenty of shops, restaurants, supermarkets, stands, etc (high-end mostly, hardly anything typical/traditional). Note that at night there can be quite a bit of traffic so be patient if going/coming by car.

I found the breakfast to be below average but as it is a buffet you're likely to find a few items you can fill yourself on. The swimming pool with a beach view is very pleasant and the swim up bar stays open late (until 11pm I believe). The staff is friendly and courteous as it's customary in Bali. For those with business-related concerns, the provided WiFi is reliable most of the times and has an acceptable speed.",Puri Saron Seminyak
462,nice location,40,June 2015,"We had a 4 night stay with a super deluxe room. Room was great right in front of swimming pool. Breakfast was goid buffett, lots of bars and warungs on beach in front of hotel. location on the the beach",Puri Saron Seminyak
463,Trip began in Seminyak,30,May 2015,"We shared a king size bed in a clean spacious room. 3rd floor. Facing towards pool and ocean. Garden views. Balcony well situated. TV had poor reception. Pillows too soft.

464,3 nights was not long enough!,50,May 2015,"We arrived about 10.30pm Friday night, and loved our deluxe chalet bungalow, aircon was cold enough that you snuggled under the covers all night in the big 4 poster bed. Breakfast buffet changed slightly with its options each day we were there, enak Sekali, yum, the pool was big and far enough from the restaurant that you didn't feel like you were on show, heaps of sun beds in the sun. The location was awesome, via the street and you walked passed amazing restaurants, including frankensteins, on the beach side amazing little beach bars, win win .. Again 3 nights not long enough, we will be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
465,"Great staff, lovely gardens, typical 3.5 star property",30,May 2015,"I wanted to love this place and after intially feeling a little disappointed I reminded myself it is 3.5 star and an older style resort. On par with other 3.5 star resorts I have stayed in in the past.
We stayed in the deluxe bungalows. We were in the block closest to the restaurant.
The staff at the resort were wonderful. Reception staff helpful in relocating one of our rooms so we were next door to each other. The staff in the restaurant, particularly Priskila, terrific. They cooked specially made pancakes for my daughter who has a food allergy.
Gardens were lovely and very well looked after. The fish pond provided entertainment for the kids. The kids playground could do with an upgrade.
Good wifi in our room, the restaurant and by the pool.
The towels and linen could do with a freshen up.
The hotel has a problem with pool chair hogs, especially near the childrens pool. Annoying to have to sit on the concrete when there are 6 reserved chairs that are empty for hours on end. I think the pool staff should monitor the chairs and remove towels.
I guess my main disappointment wasn't the hotel itself but the fact that there is nothing out the front (the non-beach end) of the hotel. We had to walk to a main street to get a taxi, change money, buy groceries, eat out. Not a big deal but we had little kids to cart around.
Overall a good experience at this resort.",Puri Saron Seminyak
466,"Location is great, everything else not so",20,May 2015,"We thought we would go 3 star accommodation but won't do it again in Bali. Air-conditioner didn't work and had to ask 3 times before they moved us to another room, towells were a brown colour, they only gave us one door key, forgot our pool Towell cards, they charged 25$ US For one airport transfer and didn't tell us it didn't include a return transfer and the rooms were really badly musty smelling. These might seem like little things but I wouldn't stay there again. Location was the only good thing and the pool area was really nice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
467,Consider carefully,30,May 2015,"maybe I am used to a higher standard, but I was dissapointed. Its great being on the beach but the hotel let us down. Breakfast was limited, pool bar drinkswere a shocker. Wifi was sketchy at best. We booked the deluxe chatet, one of our friends booked a standard room. Their room was much better! Two of the three power points in the room didnt work (we fix tomorrow). This hotel had no ATM nearby, no laundry nearby. I am annoyed that my travel agent talked me into this placeinstead of the Padma",Puri Saron Seminyak
468,Puri Saron Seminyak,40,April 2015,Great hotel with really friendly and Amazing Staff Breakfast variety is really good. A really good place for families with smaller children. Backs on to the beach for those that like to surf or build castles. Room service meals were great as was the poolside bar Plenty of lounges to chill in. All in a great location.,Puri Saron Seminyak
469,Fantastic Location!,50,May 2015,"Recently stayed here for 6 nights.
Positive:
-Fantastic location. Literally walk straight on to the beach. In front of the resort is The Champlung and La Plancha which are great at sunset.
-Pool looks out on to the beach. Plenty of sun lounges in the sun and shade. Great pool bar.
-Plenty of options for buffet breakfast.
-Pool side lunch time BBQ was delicious and affordable.
-Room was comfortable and clean.
-Staff were friendly and helpful. Spoke fluent English. All fantastic.
-Gardens were luscious, beautiful and well maintained.

Negative:
-Bathroom floor flooded easily due to the placement of the shower head.

I would definitely stay here in future holidays to Bali. The location is 10/10. And price is reasonable for this area.",Puri Saron Seminyak
470,Great location,30,April 2015,"Take this hotel for the great location, right at the beach. The pool is also great. But the rooms are just ok. Nothing special and not bad either. The rooms are spacious. They could be cleaned better. Breakfast is good with a lot of choices and staff is friendly. They put a birthday cake in my room on my birthday. Highly appreciated. There is a building site next door, but while we were there, it was quiet during the evenings and nights.",Puri Saron Seminyak
471,Love thi Hotel,40,April 2015,"Puri Saron is situated on the beach front, within walking distance to many great restaurants. There are also the small beach cafes(all being upgraded) which give a vibrant feel to the area - different to anywhere else in Bali. The hotel has recently upgraded their restaurant and there is now a new Italian restaurant and the Pizza restaurant on the beach. The gardens are immaculate and the hotel still has the Bali feel, we all crave for, not the glitz that is being built all around. Breakfast is adequate, would have to cover most tastes, though not extravagant.Has a fabulous pool area with beach view.We love the hotel and will be staying once again in January.",Puri Saron Seminyak
472,Another Beautful Stay ÔøΩÔøΩ,50,May 2015,"As always the staff are ever so friendly and make your stay the best it could be. Pool bar staff are absolutely delightful.

We always have the same bungalow room which we love. No complaints there.

Food there is ok. Breakfast was great though and any fruit they didn't have we mentioned it to them and the next day it was there. Very accomodating.

We had New Years eve here and the effort they went to was incredible. A Beautful room, music and entertainment and the gorgeous staff. It was amazing!

Thank you again and see you soon. Xx

473,Fabulous,50,May 2015,"Puri Saron is a great hotel, fantastic location, pool, room and massages fabulous! Highlights for us were friendly staff very accomodating! No problems with noise and the bed was very comfortable we slept very very well! From the moment we met the driver at airport we knew we would love the place we had chosen! We will be back and cannot wait to book our next getaway! With or without children this hotel will not disappoint!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
474,Friendly hotel a stone's throw from the beach,40,April 2015,"The Puri Saron has a fantastic position right next to the beach and close to all the shops and restaurants. The staff were always so friendly and accommodating to our needs as a family with young children.

The villas are good value and the private pools are a real plus. If you are looking to book the two bedroom villas, you should be aware that they are not interconnecting, but two separate units which isn't favourable when staying with young children. But for us the hotel were very helpful in changing our villa to suit our needs.",Puri Saron Seminyak
475,Family holiday!,40,April 2015,"We enjoyed this destination. The location did it for us- easy access to the beach for our surfers and away from the mayhem of Kuta where we stayed on previous trips.
Our room was clean, serviced daily by Admana (he did an awesome job and took a lot of pride in his work). Breakfast was included and more than adequate- anyone who complains needs to spend more on their accomadation- plenty to choose from and service was good, even when busy.
Mozzies weren't a problem- take repellant and use it in the evenings- don't leave doors open at night with lights on! This is something us kiwis are used to- expect to sit outside in the evenings and get bitten if you aren't prepared!!
Shopping, supermarket, ATM etc was a few minutes walk. A taxi to Kuta averages out at about $4- totally dependant on time of day and traffic- Bluebird taxis were dependable... clean and always metered!
Lobby staff were always happy to help book trips and transport.
Very comfortable accommodation.
Restaurants on the beach convenient.
Our family, older married kids and younger 12 year old all nagging to book again for next year!",Puri Saron Seminyak
476,Good mid range hotel,40,June 2014,"This is a good mid range hotel right on the Seminyak beach. We have stayed there for 3 nights and overall hotel services, room size, room service and staff is good. Most of the rooms has balcony. If you are staying there then you are not short of options to eat out as there are plenty of restaurants and beach shacks on the beach (Seminyak and Legian) around the hotel. There are very good restaurant just out side the hotel on Seminyak beach those offer nice view to the ocean and beach is clean and good for surfing. In week ends most of the restaurants organize live band / DJ and beach side became the place to dine out and enjoy the music.",Puri Saron Seminyak

478,2 nights Seminyak,20,March 2015,"Steady Edi from Tumlamben to Seminyak 3 hours about 600000 + on meter gave him 700000.
This time I asked him to come to this hotel in a few days and take me to the airport via Sukawati.

Reception no hassle to room which was big on the ground and back from the pool and beach.
Soon found my own bathroom pool. Restaurant open on two sides menu was a bit odd food was good and not so good. Breakfast also not good and not bad. Noise from pool bar. Lots of noise on the beach. Lots of plastic on the beach and in the sea. Pool water too warm.
The black rat that has not been killed by the ginger and white cat made a B line for a recently vacated table. The rat a tat of my foot sent it back to the check in pulpit where it sat.
Seemed like the Balinese architectural aesthetic theme had faded away some years ago. It was still there but somehow put into the background. Seemed that mass Aussie presence has swamped any local contribution spiritually and physically.
Bed lights were not sufficient to read by.
Reception helpful they charged the video camera for me and were keen to use English.
It seems that not many British English speakers go to Bali.
There is a small road to cross over to get to the beach, the hotel beach front was about 40 mtrs long. As in all the hotels I stayed at the staff made up a lot for the problems encountered in the hotel. I often felt reluctant to criticise or complain because of the good nature, professionalism and English proficiency of the staff.
The ginger and white cat was friendly as I looked, it meowed and sat.",Puri Saron Seminyak
479,Puri Saron,40,March 2015,"We stayed here in early March, I liked the hotel, especially the location, just steps from the beach.
Our rooms were the standard, ground floor, and we had three for our group.All were nice , clean and spacious My daughter had a problem with her neighbors, very loud at night, but the hotel moved her.
We did find, as others have mentioned, the placing of the shower heads are bizarre. Such a slippery wet floor after a shower.
The staff are nice and the gardens are lovely.
I had great WiFi.",Puri Saron Seminyak
480,Resident Cat ÔøΩÔøΩ,40,April 2015,"We are staying at your Hotel and having a lovely stay, we are particularly fond of your little ginger resident cat who we have looked after during our stay.

481,Great spot,50,March 2015,"Fronted the beach. Good Pizza Bar, great pool with swim up bar. Very quiet at night with great air-conditioning. Excellent breakfast, but suggest getting a table beneath a ceiling fan. Everything you need from double rooms to apartment blocks of four to private villas. The more you pay the better it is, and the front of office staff excellent. If upstairs try for a garden view side of building.",Puri Saron Seminyak
482,"Great Resort & Staff, Birthday surprise",50,March 2015,"Myself and a group of friends stayed here in mid march for 10 nights for my birthday, it was a beautiful location so close to everything in Seminyak and only a few foot steps to the beach. On my birthday we went out for a beautiful day and upon return home was a Birthday Cake in our room!! Even with my name on it! How sweet! They must have discovered it as they took copies of our passport when we checked in, a lovely thoughtful surprise and great end to the holiday. Deffinatly recommend, great value for money! Will return :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
483,Don't discount the Puri Saron,40,March 2015,"Recently returned from an 8 day visit at the Puri Saron and was pleasantly surprised. This was a last minute holiday and booked with a budget in mind. Previous reviews were mixed and we were unsure just what we would get as far as accomodation goes. We (4 adults, two couples) have been to Bali many times and have stayed over most of the island, in all types of accom. The last time we stayed up this end of town was before the Hotel Legion was built and we actually watched La Lucciola being built and were one of the first to eat there, so you could say we are Bali savvy, however the mixed reviews on Puri Saron made us unsure what to expect.
We did not have to worry, the hotel is 'old Bali style' just what we were looking for, lovely gardens, old Bali type wooden furniture, and the room we had (superior, ground floor) had a large bathroom, netted four poster king bed, and looked to have been recently re tiled. Tea and coffee making facilities also in the room. Air con. worked well.
I was really concerned about previous comments that the hotel is swarming with Mosquitos, yes they are there, you should expect them in a climate such as Bali, but as long as you keep your room door closed we did not have any trouble being bitten, although I did always keep spray on hand. also other reviews talked about holes in walls where mozzies could get in the room, but as I said earlier I think our room may have had a bit of a makeover, as certainly no holes in walls. Hair dryer worked ok and the usual bathroom amenities were available but I did go and buy some liquid soap in the local supermarket as I found the soap that was supplied just had no lather, but that's just me and not a criticism of the hotel. Also some previous guests had complained about the shower head being on the long side of the bath so when you took a shower the floor got flooded. Our room had the shower on the end of the bathtub so we had no issues with a wet bathroom floor.
The hotel is very friendly, pool and pool bar was clean and quite large, swim up bar was well used. We ate lunch most days round the pool and the ribs on the b b que were to die for. Breakfast is adequate, they have the usual buffet complete with egg station. The drinks in the hotel were not overly expensive, but this hotel is right in the middle of the beachside bars, and within walking distance of some of Bali's up market rests. such as Gado Gado, (highly recommend) and if your budget does not run to Aussie prices there are still lots of local cheaper rests within cooey.
There is a major build happening next to the hotel but we heard no noise, in fact the hotel staff told us that the workers at the site were not allowed to work thru the night as can sometime be the case in Bali. There is a daily shuttle from the hotel to Kuta square but we opted to beach walk if we deceided to go to Kuta.
There is a new wing which has been open about 12 months on the side of the hotel, which also incorporates the massage area, we did not look inside these rooms but were told by other guests that they were modern and comfortable. We did look at upgrading to the two bedroom villa with private pool, the villa was another step up again from our rooms, but we deceided as we were more than comfortable in our rooms that we would not upgrade for 200us. per day, but if you prefer a little more privacy you may want to consider the upgrade.
There were a mix of guests from young families, a group of young women up for some retail therapy, to older guests in their 60's .
We loved this hotel and we will certainly be returning again in the future, its not in the same class of hotel as the Legion or the Oberoi and the price reflects this, but if you are looking for a good, clean, friendly Bali styled hotel be sure to consider the Puri Saron and you may be like us pleasantly surprised.",Puri Saron Seminyak
484,Traditional Balinese style resort.,50,March 2015,"Beautiful gardens, lovely helpful staff, backs onto the beach. Rooms are nice, very clean, and tidy. Air conditioner great. Very relaxing place. Breakfast staff wonderful. Breakfast was ok. Best meal of our trip was the poolside barbecue at lunch. Wow cooked to perfection, Satay chicken, with peanut sauce and salad. Definitely a place to relax, and not noisy. Wifi being available good. About 5 minute walk to street with restaurants and supermarkets. A bit away from the madness of the markets and other shops, but all in walking distance, or with a taxi.",Puri Saron Seminyak
485,3 Day Break,30,March 2015,Had a girls weekend with my mum and sister. We booked a tripple room. We were very disappointed when we saw our room it was a Deluxe room with a fold out bed. The fold out had exposed mattress that wad dirty and had cob webs there was no was any of us would sleep on it. The room itself was not up to standard it looked dingy especially for what we paid. We went straight to reception and asked to be moved we. Reception was very helpful and upgraded us to a Deluxe challet which I recommend when booking. Only problem was we had to all sleep in one bed which was actually fun and we didn't mind. Breakfast was great lots of variety. The day spa was good loved my facial and massage. It was also Nephi Day the hotel was very accommodating we really enjoyed our stay.,Puri Saron Seminyak
486,relaxing beach side resort,50,February 2015,"We stayed for 14 days. The beachside location is fabulous, walk to shops & restaurants. Walkable to Kuta & Legian or use the free shuttle bus. Rooms are clean & tidy and ample for a holiday. Would rate as a 3 1/2 - 4 star by Australian standards. The staff were all friendly, even the gardeners. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Would definitely stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
487,Best staff,40,January 2015,"First time Bali and loved it because of this hotel! Staff are amazing, especially Ardika and the crew around the swim up bar.

Close to good shops, taxi services and awesome bars to eat and drink.

Bars on the beach right in front of the hotel which are amazing at night when sitting on the bean bags enjoying a beer.

Rooms were clean, and comfortable. Defiantly going to use them again!",Puri Saron Seminyak
488,Beach front location,30,February 2015,"Great location on beach front and sellers not allowed into resort. It has a swim up bar with cold drinks and ice that doesn't upset your tummy. Sumerta at swim up bar is a gem, great English and friendly. They run a shuttle bus into Kuta daily, be sure to book. Breakfast choices are good, rooms are dated so ensure to upgrade.",Puri Saron Seminyak
489,this place grew on me,40,February 2015,"We stayed at this hotel at the end of february for 5 nights. very nice courtyard with gardens. loved the pool area with the swim up pool bar. you can also get some snacks like chicken skewers or wings etc cooked on the bbq at the poolside for a very resonable rate. it is located right on the beach. What an amazing sight when we arrived from sanur. (which is very quiet) The beach was busy, there is surf and lots of restaurants along the beach to eat at or have a drink. before sunset they put out all these coloured beanbags and you can sit and enjoy the sunset over the beach having a drink. I didnt find the bed very comfortable it was hard and the pillow was lumpy as well. but the room was nice and bathroom quite large. We had a downstairs room for a few days but had a problem with the lock, was quickly changed only to find if you lifted the handle and door it slid open anyway and neighbour had same problem. We also had after several days a terrible sewage smell coming from the bathroom, the management moved us to the room upstairs which was fine - good size balconys to relax on. Your will have to buy mozzie spray as they seem to have a big problem there ,whether sitting on balcony or quickly shutting door they always seem to get in. very humid also, you will need to get more water every day. Just a short walk down the path and road out the front (you have to watch all the motorbikes coming along, even though i'm sure it was a path) and you will find ATM's on the corner and just nearby a mini mart you can get supplies from. Lots of good restaurants down there as well. Breakfast was included, quite nice ,same as most places omlettes cooked for you, fruit, yoghurt, pancakes, pastries. The only thing was we were spoiled at the Mecure, there was no cappachino, the coffee (brewed) was horrible. Luckily there is a pizza bar on the end of the property before the beach and their coffee was quite good. Went to seminyak markets, was difficult batering price down, everyone said only pay $5 for simple dress but we couldnt get anyone to go that low, purchased a nice patchwork bag after batering price down, only to see it in nearby shop with price tag and was cheaper, oh well. Ended up having a very pleasant time here and met a lot of great new zealanders and Aussies to talk to at the pool. Very central to legian and kuta.",Puri Saron Seminyak
490,Lovely Relaxing Christmas Break,40,December 2014,"We booked a late minute Christmas package through travelonline.com and Puri Saron was the accommodation.

Great location right on the beach front with nothing to block your view of the ocean if you are relaxing in or by the pool.

We upgraded to a room closer to the pool area which was very handy.

We aren't a fussy family, so as long as the rooms have enough bed space, bathroom amenities work, everything is clean we are happy. For a 3 star location Puri supplied all of this.

Plenty of restaurants on the beach in front of the hotel, so no lack of choice. Awesome pizzas from the restaurant on the premises on the beachfront.

A 5 minute walk to Legian and all it has to offer.

No mini mart close by which I think the area really needs.

Good pool, both shallow & deep ends, swim up bar. Not a great cocktail menu and pricey.

All in all we had a good experience here, lovely grounds with an old style Balinese feel to it which I prefer over concrete accomodation.",Puri Saron Seminyak
491,Good Value for Money,50,November 2014,"We went there for Honeymoon and I find this place perfect. It was situated on the seminyak beach and close to airport as well. Room services were good. There were lots of good food options available outside as well. Luckily I found one Indian restaurant which served the best food in my whole Bali trip. I will suggest travellers to explore good food outside only as it is much cheaper than resort food. Though resort food is also not expensive. We enjoyed resort pool, pool side drinks and food and it was good. DO NOT shop anything from seminyak market if you are planning to go to UBUD. Ubud has lots of shopping options and it's cheap as well. But remember Bali is all about bargain. Do bargain upto 70-80%. Enjoy Bali",Puri Saron Seminyak
492,Ok location!,30,March 2015,"Secluded from busy streets so good chill out resort with a nice swim up bar. Direct access to beach if you like swimming with plastic bags but unfortunately that is the state of the majority of the coast line.
It is definitely due for a renovation but the staff did their best to dress it up.
Pizza $10-$15 AUD at the Italian pizzeria attached (one is enough for 2) and its $3.60 for Bintang at the swim up bar including 21% tax and services charge... Not much beer choice in Bali unfortunately...
Good pool..
We paid 135000 irp ($13.50) for airport taxi fixed price from the DPS.
Good breakfast.",Puri Saron Seminyak
493,This was ok,30,March 2015,The rooms were clean however they smelt like the open sewers and it wasn't just my room. No Wifi for three days was disappointing. Breakfast was ok. AC worked well and the gardens are amazing. Super friendly staff and a great beach front location,Puri Saron Seminyak
494,fantastic and good value for money,50,February 2015,4th time in Bali and 1st time in this motel. Right on the beach and very clean rooms and grounds. Staff fantastic and very helpful with all requests. Midday pool BBQ is fantastic. Motel located right on the beach. and close to everything.,Puri Saron Seminyak
495,Never again! Puri Saron does not deserve loyal repeat customers,20,February 2015,"Third time at Puri Saron and our last!
1. They ignored our request for an upstairs room with a view over the gardens near the pool and restaurant. We got an upstairs room at the end of the garden, with no view just a thick mass of overgrown trees and bushes directly in front of our balcony. There were rooms available in the area we requested, seems if you make requests you will be put in the worst room for your trouble.
2. WIFI is only available in the lobby. They falsely advertise WIFI is available, we found poor or no service around the property, with absolutely no service at all in our room.
3. Only 2 English speaking TV news channels BBC and NBC amongst the many channels available in Indonesian. HBO movie channel dubbed in Indonesian with no English subtitles. Its frustrating to constantly flick through channels in the hope of a miracle, we did on one occasion discover an HBO movie in English. There should be many more choices available to cater for guests needs.
4. Reading a good book? no chance as there were no bedside lamps or lighting sufficient to read, just 2 very dimly lit pendant ceiling lights.
5. Shower over a very narrow bath, pools of water all over the floor each time we had a shower as shower head in wrong position.
6. Puri Saron is very greedy. We were asked to pay $25US (over $30 Aust) for airport pickup, we declined and paid 100,000 Rupiah or $10 Aust for our own taxi from the airport.
7. If you wanted a taxi from Puri Saron we chose to walk to the end of the street rather than pay the exhorbitant fares charged by Puri Saron provided cars.
Tariffs have increased substantially over time and there is no evidence of any improvements which one would expect, we only noticed a decline in standards. The place is in need of a major revamp, it is ideally located but so much more is available elsewhere for better value. Its not all about the money Puri Saron, seems to be your only focus.",Puri Saron Seminyak
496,Good location but otherwise disappointing,30,February 2015,"The disappointment started at the check in itself. Though we had booked two rooms well in advance, on arrival around noon we were told that one room would be available at 1-30 pm but the other would be delayed. Though the room had been vacated by the earlier guest it was made ready only by 2-45. Apparently the cleaning staff have a lunch break from 1 pm which is silly if the check in time is 2 pm.
The room was reasonably furnished but a couple of lights did not work and closing the sliding door to the veranda was a problem with the result that you had to cope with mosquitoes in the room. The AC which appeared undersized for the room was also, one wonders why, placed in one corner so the beds were outside its range. Luckily it was not too warm but this could be a serious problem in the hotter season. The bathroom had a bathtub with a shower , here the shower was placed not at the head of the tub but at one of the sides with the result that if one was not very careful with the curtains, the bathroom floor would be wet with water.
The breakfast was quite good with a lot of variety though some more fruits would have been welcome. The in house restaurant was reasonably priced but had very limited menu options. The hotel also boasts an Italian restaurant run by an Italian family but we found this really disappointing. It had a very restricted menu, was overpriced and too oily. Best avoided.
The saving grace is the location of the hotel which is right on the beach but so are many more along that stretch of beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
497,"Drinks by the pool this afternoon, to swim we were asked for 100,000IDR",10,February 2015,"We have stayed here twice before, the last time totally unimpressed. This time, while staying elsewhere, we were close by, it was a very hot day, and as we have done in many hotels in both Bali and Thailand, we went and sat by the pool and bought drinks. We thought that by buying drinks (spending money at the hotel), that would mean we were able to have a swim. As we sat there one of the towel attendants (we had our own towels)' came to us and said if you want to swim that will be 100,000 IDR. If we hadn't spent any money at the hotel then that would seem niggardly and miserable and definitely not have you thinking about staying there in the future. Having spent money on drinks, the two of us who are in our 60's thought the money request to be a very poor promotion of the product, the Puri Saron. No thanks, we will stick to the Puri Santrian.",Puri Saron Seminyak
498,Bali paradise!,50,December 2014,"Love this resort! Have stayed many, many times. Great location, pool bar is fantastic as is the pool bar staff. Especially Sumertha. Ardika and Dodik Breakfast is great, lots to choose from. There were certain things they didn't have, we mentioned it and it was there the next day. Nothing is to much trouble. The Reservation Manager Alit is amazing and looks after you. I love this place. It's what's special about Bali and so are the staff :) we have stayed there with and with our son and would again. ~ Kim Cook",Puri Saron Seminyak
499,Awesome stay!,40,January 2015,"Stayed 4 nights here with my 2 sisters and a friend, our rooms were across from each other and my room was facing the pool (ground floor). Overall, the hotel was lovely, friendly staff and beautiful hotel grounds. The ground staff were constantly cleaning and maintaining the plants etc.Our room was nice and spacious. The only negative thing I can say is the shower curtains...they are not effective to go around the bath tub and water tends to escape onto the bathroom floor. Loved the beach on our door step, especially listening to the live band whilst the sun the setting. The pizza place near the pool is a must! Went there twice! :P",Puri Saron Seminyak
500,The Beach Is Your Back Yard,40,February 2015,"This was our first time to visit BALI
My wife and I enjoyed the location of the Beach directly behind the swimming pool
We traveled here with a path of 8 Adults
1 Teenager, 1 Infant and a 1.5 year old baby
Very children friendly Hotel and Pool
Has a great swim up bar for the BIG KIDS !
Service is good
Rooms clean but you need to buy Mosquito spray and spray your room daily, the joy of visiting a tropical country

Hotel is a short stroll 5mins to great Masages, money exchange convince store and markets

Double Six roof top Bar is about less than 5mins walk from hotel along the beach
A must to visit

Seminyak Square is a short Cab ride about 10mins and cost about $2.50-$3.00 AUD or 20,000-30,000 info rupea
Great for restaurants bars and shopping

AND ALWAYS ASK WHEN YOU CATCH A CAB TURN METRE ON AND CATCH BLUE TAXIS OR BALI BLUE

Kuta will cost about $2-$5AUD depending on traffic

Potato head Beach Club about $3 AUD
GREAT DAY OUT

This hotel is good value for money but remember there are much nicer hotels around but will cost more",Puri Saron Seminyak

Cons
-No hot water and bathroom smelt of sewerage

Tips

Ask for a room close to pool and buffet area. Pay extra for the deluxe chalet.",Puri Saron Seminyak
508,Over priced,30,January 2015,"My boyfriend and i stayed here in January. The room was nice, but small and dark. The buffee breakfast was ok and had western alternatives which is always commendable. The pool was nice and clean as well. If you are a person who stays at their resort or hotel the whole holiday, i would NOT recommend staying here.",Puri Saron Seminyak
509,Have stayed before and will be back again.,40,January 2015,"Its not 5 star but it is comfortable. My wife and I, family and friends have stayed at this Hotel in the past and we are booked to stay here again in August. We accept the Hotel for what it is, appreciate its comfort, pool and location and aren't bothered with comparing it to other Hotels and Villas we have stayed at in Bali over several visits. The staff are great and always have a smile. The building site next door has been ongoing for 2 years now. It still has a fair way to go. Work is not ongoing 24/7 as others claim. I have stayed at the Hotel 3 times in that 2 year period staying in bungalows right next door to the site and have only ever heard work during the day (surprise, surprise) and never to the point of distraction. The last of the workers are actually trucked off the site around 9pm.Visitors to the Hotel should concentrate more on enjoying themselves rather than listening for the occasional sound that may eminate from a construction site. Visitors to Bali should remember that, it is BALI. Not all the facilities and creature comforts that many of these tourists may usually enjoy at home, are available in Bali.
The Puri Saron offers comfortable accommodation at a great location with friendly staff, good facilities at a reasonable rate. It has the occasional smell and there probably is a bit of chipped paint here and there but I go to enjoy myself and relax. I can quite easily do that at this Hotel and I actually even venture outside the Hotel grounds to experience the other sights, sounds and smells that you get in Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
510,Not for me.,20,January 2015,"Deluxe room was approx 30sqm.
Balcony door had open holes where the glass met the wood which meant mosquitoes had easy access 24/7. When it rained the pipe next to the toilet would bubble which also meant the scent of sewerage in the room would increase. Pool + surrounding area was lovely and in regards to location, if bali is your thing it is not far from lots of nice places. Quite overpriced for what you expect. Also major hotel being built adjacent my balcony with machinery and working building 24/7.",Puri Saron Seminyak
511,Good beach location. Great staff,40,November 2014,Good budget hotel. Great location. Great pool bar. Would happily stay there again. Staff were all very friendly and food and drink was reasonably priced. Good little beach bar just outside of property,Puri Saron Seminyak
512,Dissapointed,20,January 2015,"We stayed at the Puri Saron at the end of our trip for 3 nights. I booked this, having cancelled another booking due to the Puri Saron reviews being great.

Unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. We had a Deluxe room, which in terms of size was all we needed, however there wasn't a very nice smell coming from the bathroom and for the life of me I just couldn't figure out why the shower head was positioned the way it was, when you turned on the water it went straight onto the floor, you couldn't adjust the head up or down so had to have a hand held shower. I spoke with reception about this and asked to be moved but the lady told me all of the bathrooms were like that and she would give us an extra bath mat for the water.....thanks :/

This was not my best trip to bali due to previous happenings on the holiday so by the end of the trip I had had enough and just dealt with the shower head and smell. I just couldn't be bothered anymore! The bed was comfy, that's really my only positive. The breakfast was not very nice and not much variety, I think the freshness of the food could be better.

The pool area was ok, literally impossible to get a lounge due to the selfish people who put a towel there all day and don't even use it! As I have said in my previous reviews, hotels cant pick and chose who stays at their hotels, but I was made to feel quite uncomfortable by a group of older people in he pool who were blatantly staring at me in my bikini....GROSS! The pool water was also murky which makes me wonder what I'm swimming in!!

The beach was so littered, we went for a walk one day and it was so upsetting to see how much rubbish was on the beach, this is not reflective of the hotel, just really sad to see the bali kids playing on the beach literally in the rubbish not blinking an eyelid.

The last day we were there my partner got very sick, I asked for an extended check out by an hour because he literally could not leave bed and I was told no because other guests were coming, so he had to lie by the pool from 12pm-7pm until we went to the airport sick as a dog. There was no care whatsoever in this instance which was also upsetting.

I have stayed in beautiful hotels and villas in bali, so maybe thats what im comparing it to, but I really was disappointed in my stay at Puri Saron and wouldn't stay here again or suggest it to anyone. Pay the extra and you will see the difference.

I don't like to write negative reviews, but this is my honest opinion, possibly a upgrade on the hotel could do it some justice such as new furnishings and bit of paint and an all round overhaul.",Puri Saron Seminyak
513,Poor,30,January 2015,"5/10...We have been to bali 10 + times and We expects something cleaner as we paid $110 per night. The room are dated with thin paint, poor bathroom grouting, and a dirty shower curtain which didn't stop water from flooding the bathroom. The day spa is a hotel room with 3 beds. The breakfast is nice and pool relaxing but many guests missed out on a sun bed if they came in late. It's on the beach which is nice but there's probably better places to stay in seminyak. We were also placed on the 3rd floor, which is okay for us, but we saw parents with strollers and prams lugging their children up 3 flights of stairs, as they had no lifts.",Puri Saron Seminyak
514,Puri Saron Seminyak,40,December 2014,We spent 5 nights at this hotel in early December. Initially we had a problem with hot water in our room. We approached the Manager Gede Alit Merta regarding the problem. Following attempts to fix the problem to no avail The Manager was quick to upgrade my wife and myself to a super deluxe room-which we appreciated. The hotel is well located with the beach front easily accessed. A quick taxi ride will take you to the best restaurants and bars in Seminyak. The hotel represents good value and we can definitely recommend the super deluxe rooms.,Puri Saron Seminyak
515,Mc Donald's of hotels,20,January 2015,"I don't understand all the good reviews, my only assumption is that they haven't experience the amazing hotels that's Bali has to offer. The location was good but don't be fooled by the pictures, it's so so so average. I won't even go into the details but take my word for it - there is a lot better hotels within a 10 min walk for half the price. I moved to a 5 star private villa ten minute drive away for the same price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
516,Not what we paid for...,10,December 2014,"We booked over the phone for a beach view, Super Deluxe with inter-connecting rooms. We arrived at Midnight and was told we had been undercharged and there was a mix up with the booking. We said we will sort it out in the morning. Went to our rooms and it was so bad. Our windows were frosted and when you opened them they faced a ugly brick wall. Not sure where the beach views were but not in this room.

We complained on the spot and was given another room which had beach views from the communal walkway but at least this one was in better condition.

In the wash up we ended up getting what we originally paid for but had to pay double the amount. We overheard a few conversations and this is what they do. Get you into a crap room and then make you upgrade. Stay clear of this hotel is my advise.

Breakfast was awful.",Puri Saron Seminyak
517,"Location, location",40,December 2014,"Stayed at this hotel Christmas/New Year, although Bali was packed with tourists this hotel always provided a quiet sanctuary at the end of the day. Although modern the hotel still retains it's Balinese feel. I have to say the management and staff at the hotel are the most friendly and accommodating that I have experienced in Bali. No request or concern was overlooked. We had initial problems on our arrival but these were quietly and efficiently taken care of. The hotel has been mostly renovated, the renovated rooms are beautifully appointed, comfortable and immaculate. The coffee shop serves excellent European and Indonesian meals at a reasonable price, try their Nasi Campur. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
518,"Great peaceful location on the beach, wonderful staff",40,December 2014,"Lovely hotel located on the beach with great pool and beach-side restaurant (great pizza made by the Roman owner..having lived in Rome for five years I promise this is the real deal!).

Rooms are clean and staff are exceptionally kind and friendly. For ¬£40/night in low season this was great value and free wi-fi is included. Breakfast was nothing special, and if there is one slight criticism it is that there are no free movie channels on the TVs which is usual in Asia, and helpful for those monsoon days. I hope to return!

(note that at time of visiting in December 2014 there was construction work on a new hotel next door. I asked to be moved away from that side of the hotel and noise was minimal but worth bearing in mind!)",Puri Saron Seminyak
519,A relaxing place to stay where everything is available at your fingertips,50,December 2014,"Staff were friendly and helpful, the grounds beautiful and the pool an oasis from the heat (which was still very comfortable). The swim-up bar was great too. Apart from the main hotel restaurant there were also two others just steps away from the pool, and the beach as well. There is also an onsite massage spa which we used several times. Cheap by Australian standards, slightly more expensive
than down the road in Seminyak, but so convenient. My wife, my 11-year old daughter and I loved it!",Puri Saron Seminyak
520,We fell in love..,50,November 2014,"We stayed in a private pool villa for 2 nights in November and it was easily amongst the best 2 days of our lives, couldn't get better. We did a lot of research as we always do; before selecting this property. Semniyak was our first preference and this place seemed like good value for money. We paid for a plunge pool villa what we would have payed for a basic room in a more expensive property, hence it ticked all the boxes! But v dint expect to love it soo much..coming by cab, the road to this hotel and the first impressions of this property are not too impressive..but these were and should be the least important aspects of a holiday..as we were quite blown away by the charm hidden towars the backside of the property having the villas/suits/pool and the entry to the beach/lane. We found our villa to be very cosy, our pool a mini haven, staff warm and friendly, main pool to be fun, and beach to be lively without being dirty or overcrowded - all the ingriedents for a sooper fun, laid back and refreshing holiday. The back lane between the resort and the beach is a straight walk into the legian and kuta area so these three areas are connected by beach/road and can be covered by foot. We walked the entire stretch from the beach and took the lane to walk back passing all the other properties in these areas..Honestly the beach is cleaner and livelier in the area around this resort, with lots of of cozy, beautifully lit bean bag joints that offer good drinks & food and have live music playing right on the beach at night..The sea water is not wow, nor will it be in legian/kuta as its the same stretch, but there are other places in Bali for clear blue seas. This is a cutesy, vibrant and happy place..and we had the time of our lives here! :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
521,Budget hotel with good location in Seminyak area,40,December 2014,"We were staying at the Bungalow room and it was quite spacious, especially the bathroom. The room and furniture were old and rundown though. We stayed for 3 nights and the whole 3 nights we couldn't turn on the channels on TV at all! Fortunately we didn't stay in the room long enough to even remember to ask the hotel to fix it. Hotel's staff were pretty friendly. And breakfast were pretty standard. Excellent location where you have direct access to the beach, walking distant to Dhyana Pura and Double Six where you can find plenty of restaurants and bars.",Puri Saron Seminyak
522,Good value for the reasonable rates,30,November 2014,"Hotel great location right on the beach and close to restarants and bars, clean and tidy rooms but quite in need of some upgrade, showers face outwards so it's impossible to have a shower without flooding the floor, beds are very comfortable, the staff were lovely and polite, breakfast was ok. In all puri Saron is good value, reasonable rates.",Puri Saron Seminyak
523,DONT EVER USE THE HOTELS TRANSPORT SERVICE,50,November 2014,"The hotel was very good, clean, comfortable and had a great location. Staff were very friendly and overall a very pleasant Bali feel.

The transport company that has the use of the puri Sarons lobby is ,albeit a friendly faced young person, a hideous place to organise any tour of trips through. The uncompromising boss would demand payment and send drivers with little or no English speaking skills to take you on a tour. When we spent a whole day of our holiday in the wrong location and never arrived at our planned destination, the boss shrugged his shoulders and advised that it was too bad and we must pay now.

Go down the street and talk to a local driver with their own car and find yourself a cheaper and better run service.

Never use their transport service.",Puri Saron Seminyak
524,Outstanding Resort,50,November 2014,"We just had our first stay at Puri Saron resort in November 2014. Well what can I say, if you are looking for an excellent holiday with outstanding service along with a very clean room and resort. This is the place to stay. We have stayed at a lot of places over the years and this would have to be the best. Nothing was to much for Gede Alit Merta and his staff. The service from all was a Wow factor. See you all again in March .

525,Loved it,50,December 2013,"We stayed here as a family-sisters ,nephews etc for my older sister's birthday celebration last year
The people here were very welcoming and helped us a lot with day trips etc
The rooms were clean and the outlook onto the garden was gorgeous
Cooked breakfast was delicious with a large selection of fruit
The closeness of the pool,the ocean,Seminyak Central,nightclubs and restaurants was great
Just loved sitting on the beach at the bean bag bar having a Bintang poking out to sea under the stars!:)loved it:)",Puri Saron Seminyak
526,"Great location, old hotel",30,November 2014,"Location, location. It is a great spot -right on the beach near all the restaurants etc. The pool and hotel itself are a bit old, and the hotel food and drinks are definitely not worth eating. However, staff were accommodating with our late flight and let us use a shower before the flight even though checkout is 12pm.",Puri Saron Seminyak
527,Puri Saron,50,November 2014,"We will be coming back. Except for the fact that we booked for a double bed and got instead two singles beds, we were very happy with the friendly and helpful staff, the breakfast, the lovely pool the accessibility to the beach, and all the restaurants facing the sea with talented musicians every night. Perhaps more locomotion services to Semynak - other hotels have carts- are needed as the long walk in the oppressive heat could work against staying in this hotel. Overall, very happy.",Puri Saron Seminyak
528,A terrible experience at a terrible hotel,10,October 2014,"We had the unfortunate experience of staying 5 nights in this poor excuse of a resort. Highlights included:

Rooms in a shabby state, peeling walls, holes in towels. full of mosquitoes. Plus a nice sewerage smell in the mornings.

Pool bar was more expensive than the 5 star beach clubs, with one sun lounge per 5 guests

Only one room key, which you can't use at to open your door at night because the lights only turn on when you're in the room!

Incompetent staff - calling at 7am to drop off washing, not helping people struggling with their luggage (staff lying on the grass watching us), then refusing to call a taxi as they wanted us to use their overcharged car service

Don't forget the truly terrible breakfast!

There are many hotels you can visit nearby which are cheaper, cleaner, and offer better service. Don't make the same mistake we did.",Puri Saron Seminyak
529,"Great staff, great location, big rooms",40,November 2014,"stayed here last oct 31-nov 6, 2014. great location on the seminyak beach. the landscaping of the resort makes it a very relaxing place. the pool is also good for relaxing and some lapping. the staff are very helpful, also ready to assist when you have concerns or requests. breakfast food selection is ok.

my only concern is that there is some kind of not so good odor (but bearable) coming out of the toilet in the room on certain times of the days.",Puri Saron Seminyak
530,So glad we came back,50,October 2014,"We have stayed at Puri Saron Hotel Seminyak twice before, but then decided to try other places. We are so glad we made the decision to go back. No other Hotel has been as good. From the moment of check in to departure our stay was perfect! The staff are wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble. A special thank you to Arik who cleaned our room everyday, the restaurant staff, the amazing 4 guys at the pool bar and Alit who took the time to seek us out to make sure we were happy. You all made us feel very special. The Puri Saron Hotel is in a fantastic location right on the beach and very close to great restaurants and shopping. The sunsets are amazing and you don't even need to leave the Hotel to see one. Our room was lovely. We stayed in a bungalow, but the deluxe rooms are every bit as good (the bungalows are closer to the pool and restaurant.) Couldn't fault breakfast - something for every taste, and very attentive staff. Coffee always hot!! The pool is the best we have seen. Again a huge thank you to all. We will be back",Puri Saron Seminyak
531,Great location on beach,50,September 2014,"Was a bit worried staying here in Sept/Oct this year due to negative reviews. Stayed in the bungalow rooms. Room was spacious, bathroom huge, clean and the sheets were changed each day if requested (by leaving sign on bed). The pool was fantastic with the swim up bar. Food was always great. Sunset could be viewed from lounge inside hotel grounds. Perfect! No it's not 5 star but neither are the prices. Staff were helpful, courteous and extremely friendly.",Puri Saron Seminyak
532,Way better than I expected!,50,October 2014,"Best location as far a seminyak is concerned. Beach out the back, short stroll to some good shopping.
I read a few times to pay that little extra for a better room-do! Totally worth it! Bungalow with garden view was perfect-close to pool/breakfast and greenery.
I had also read wifi was average-it was fine!!! Staff-amazing. Nothing they wouldn't do to help. I can not wait to go back to bali and the Puri Saron is the top of my list for value for money, absolute perfect location and standard of accommodation :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
533,Holiday in Paradise,40,October 2014,"This was my 14th trip to Bali, and my husbands 1st . I have never stayed at Puri Saron before, mostly Kuta and Legian. We both loved the hotel, location and staff . Other guests were very friendly, we ended up dining with a few. A great location on the beach, and a lot quieter than Legian. Yet still enough people on beach to do our shopping, have massages and your nails done etc.... We had a couple of beach days, very clean beach. Mostly sat around the pool, a great pool with a swim up bar, the staff are so friendly all over the hotel, and nothing is too much trouble. It was my husbands birthday while we were away, they bought to our room a birthday cake and sang to him.. (how cute). !!!
I wanted to showcase Bali to my hubby , so therefore wanted a Bali style hotel, not a concrete jungle which some are, Great gardens and not far at all to walk to good restaurants. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a deluxe bungalow near reception, which had a private courtyard. They also have villas which look amazing.

534,LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION,50,September 2014,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION
I have now stayed at the Puri Saron FIVE times and each time has been a wonderful experience. The staff are exceptional, always friendly and engaging and nothing is a problem, I have mostly stayed in the bungalows near the restaurant area over looking the spacious manicured gardens, however on my last visit, I was treated to a Private Villa which is a MUST for couples wanting the most special private experience. The hotel is nicely 'traditional Balinese' the rooms are clean, spacious and the beds are very comfortable. The hotel is ideally located on the beach, which allows a beautiful breeze throughout the resort and only a step away from great restaurants on the beach. I've stayed at many hotels in Bali and believe that Puri Saron is the best value for money you can get for its fantastic location.",Puri Saron Seminyak
535,top spot,40,October 2014,"This is our forth time staying at this hotel and as always we loved it. The location, the staff,( hi wiwi) the pool, the gardens all great and the price just tops it off.We always stay in the bungalows so you have the extra space with a large bathroom. Breakfast is good but you can go onto the beach if you fancy a change,I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.stayed with family and friends October. And as Arnie says, i'll be back :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
536,Fantastic Value and Location right on the beach,50,July 2014,"We have travelled to Bali many times. This was our first stay at the Puri Saron Hotel in Seminyak. It is a great 3 star hotel. Fantastic value for money. The staff are extremely friendly and approachable. From greeting us at reception to the breakfast and bar staff - all excellent! The location is amazing - right on the beach with numerous bean bag lounge bars and restaurants to choose from. The pool with the swim up bar is first class and huge. Food and drink prices at the hotel are extremely reasonable and nothing was too much trouble. A short walk down the beach to Double Six street and shopping. Those staying at the hotel are nice mix of families, friends and couples from all around the world. We had absolutely no complaints. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. We are from Perth, Western Australia and have booked again in 2015!",Puri Saron Seminyak
537,Great service and gardens!,40,October 2014,"We just returned from a week at the Puri Saron Seminyak and I can recommend it!
There was a mix up with the rooms but it was resolved quickly and with great customer service - thanks Alit - we ended up with a suite and two bungalows in different parts of the complex but moved the following day to two ground floor bungalows (and kept the suite). We have a 2 year old so the ground floor bungalow in the garden area was perfect for us - our baby was able to run out on the grass and look at the birds, the friendly cat and even the frogs at night. The pool was good for her too with shallow areas but also deeper areas for when you needed to cool off more. The gardens are lovely and the fishponds provided a lot of entertainment for the baby too! The breakfast was OK - enough variety to keep you satisfied and because it is a buffet there is more than enough to eat! The location is good for access to the beach although we didn't go swimming there, and the bean bag places along the beach for dinner and/or drinks while watching the sunset. It is a short walk to one of the main Seminyak streets and a bit of a hike to the ""Eat Street"" area but a cheap enough taxi ride...
Overall, I think it was a good choice and would stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
538,Great value and location!,40,September 2014,"We were at Puri Saron in September staying at the Bungalow room (Deluxe chalet). The reason we selected the place was because of its location which was right the beach (with a small road for motorbike in between). However, to set your expectation right, Seminyak beach has big waves for surfer or body border. The sand is not white but a little black.

I didn't have much expectation as I thought it was an old hotel but it turned out to be quite a charming place.

Likes:
1. Location location location! - right on the beach where you can watch sun down, many bars and restaurants around ... but if you want to go more upscale, walking to Potato Head is also doable
2. Room - one good thing of the old property is that the room was very large unlike the new hotels where having to maximize every square metre. Although it is an old property, it has been renovated and the room is nice and comfortable enough. The Bangalow room faces a beautiful garden with big trees. It is nice to sit outside on the veranda.

Note that the ""Bungalow"" room, it is actually a building with four rooms in total - 2 on the ground floor, 2 on the second floor. They have exact same lay out. Worth the extra money.

3. Salt water pool

Tips:
- Ask for the rooms near the pool - they are the one facing the garden. I prefer the ones on the ground floor as it has better view of the garden and easier to access but this is up to your own liking.
- During my stay, there was a construction next door but they did not work all the time. There were only one or two people working. It appeared it was up to their mood which day they feel like to come to work too - very odd. The noise did not bother me (and normally I am sensitive to this construction noise).
- Pizza restaurant near the beach was very good. Good food and friendly owner and staff :-)",Puri Saron Seminyak
539,Great location,40,October 2014,We had a wonderful stay at the Puri Saron the staff are very friendly and the service is great we stayed in a room in the new section near the pool I would recommend one of those rooms it has a really good pool and pool bar being on the beach at sunset the atmosphere is fantastic there is a lot of restaurants and bars close by,Puri Saron Seminyak
540,Good Bali accommodation,40,October 2014,"Am just at the end of a 15 day stay at this hotel. Top service and very friendly staff at reasonable rates. The location is great, right on the beachfront and close to cheap shopping in Seminyak. Lots of restaurants and little eating places nearby.",Puri Saron Seminyak
541,Great place,50,October 2014,"This was our third time at this hotel, and it was nice to see changes made with the addition of a new wing and restaurant. We we're upgraded to a super deluxe room which overlooked the pool and you could see the ocean from the balcony. That made the hubby extra happy for his daily surfing.
The breakfasts changed daily and there were plenty of choices. The pool was nice and clean with plenty of sun beds. The nightly turn down service was also a nice touch.
We will again be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
542,Perfect,50,October 2014,"We had stayed at the Puri Saron before and loved it , so we booked again to have a better stay with an up grade to a VILLA. The location is great a short taxi ride to Legian an easy stroll along the beach side to fantastic places to eat.The hotel food was very good and they changed the breakfast menu each day the staff are so happy and friendly , the Puri Saron is our hotel of choice !
Great pool swim up bar , happy hour everyday what more could you ask for !( and not a lot of kids)
Fantastic place to stay ....Thanks Alit wonderful host really looked after us .",Puri Saron Seminyak
543,Great value for money,50,September 2014,"We booked one night at the Puri Saron as we could only get one night at the Palangi, which was our preference after speaking to some friends. When we arrived we were told we were upgraded and our room and the view were amazing! We had a room with a king size bed right near the pool on the second floor with a balcony. It was clean and the service and food were good. The location is great as you can hear the waves from the resort and the beach is right there. Recommend to those who are after something more budget and good value. We also liked this more than the Pelangi.",Puri Saron Seminyak
544,A relaxing break,40,October 2013,"We stayed here for our honeymoon. After reading some reviews we were worried about the hotel being run down but we found it to be lovely. The rooms were a little dated but kept clean and in good order. The service was fantastic. The buffet breakfast was nice but needing gluten free limited my options to only an omelette (a little boring) or fruit.

Internet was only available in the foyer, and didn't work for most of our stay.

Overall a lovely place to stay at a reasonable price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
545,Cheap enough but in need of a refurbishment,30,September 2014,"We have traveled to Bali 16 plus times and usually stay in Legian but thought we would give Seminyak a try. We got a fantastic rate for 6 nights in a deluxe Bungalow room including breakfast. The room was clean but needs to be updated, the bathroom was fairly dated but large. I wish we had of upgraded to the Villa they looked great with their own pool. The staff were all friendly and I loved the pool area, fantastic size but need more sun lounges for the size of the pool.
The breakfast wasn't great and like all buffets people are going in all directions and do not use manners, I give up and don't bother with eating breakfast.They didn't change up their selections and I didn't see much choices in fruit or cereal.
I got a 90 minute hot stone massage from the "" Spa "" in the resort and I have to say it was THE worst I ever had, the lady had no idea what she was doing and it varied from one side to the other, beyond painful and it was also the most expensive I have paid in Bali including from proper Spa places. 320 000 for 90 minutes of torture, I didn't want to upset her and up and leave so I kept saying' more softer' and ' too hard ' but she didn't grasp the concept. I know half the lady's in bali have NO training and when im paying $8- $10 or even $20 I expect that but not when I paid $35 ( as she had no change for I had to give her 350 000) .
I also found it too far out if travelling by taxi or car as there is no short cut and traffic is terrible. The taxi drivers around the area wont get in there taxi for the meter on they demand 50 000 to just go up the road 2 kilometres so we had no choice but to walk to dinner every night.
The Beach access is close to everything but no lighting and a lot of bikes riding along I wouldn't want to walk around in the dark out there with all the bag snatchings reported lately.
We ate at the Warung Bola Pizza place run by an Italian couple and the service was great,they were very friendly and the pizza and garlic bread were divine.
Im glad we tried somewhere different but I will stick to my favourite in Legian.
It was good value for money for what we paid.",Puri Saron Seminyak
546,Great Location Great Staff IAN & ROZ,50,July 2014,"Well my husband and I stayed here for 9 nights in a villa that was beautiful.
It was lovely and clean, The villa was serviced every day.
We found it to be very quite and peacefull.
Every day we started our day of with a lovely breakfast,anything and everything you wonted.
If you just wont to stay at the motel and chill out this is the place to book as its pool and swim up bar is great,or if u prefer the beach it right there.
The staff couldn't be more helpful and to the manager Alit we thank you for making our holiday a good one
I recommend this motel to my friends to stay at when they are coming to bali

547,Great location.,40,September 2014,"My wife and I were originally staying in a villa in seminyak but it was too far from the beach. After spending a day at the beach we saw the hotel and decided to stay there for the remainder of our trip. Best decision we made. We stayed in a simple room and yes the rooms are abit dated and the bathrooms could do with a bit of a upgrade however the location is right on the beach close to all the great bars and restaurants. If you like to spend a lot of time by the pool, out and about and just use the hotel to sleep then this hotel is great. The pool is amazing. You could stay in it the whole day and it had a great swim up pool. The price of a standard room is very cheap compared to the other big hotels around it. There's was a good mix of people staying at the hotel as well from couples to families. Friendly staff and good breakfast provided in the morning. Would definitely come back to the hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
548,"Great location, great staff",40,September 2014,"Well this was my first trip to Bali, The staff were great, greating you with a smile, yes it is a little old but clean, the room was cleaned each day. As we went to Bali for my sons wedding which was at another hotel that cost $500 per night, I could not justify paying an extra $300+ so we stayed at the Puri Saron and we are glad we did, so was my son when we gave him the money we saved :). In life you get what you pay for, for us we got value for money. its not 5 star but the staff are frendly, rooms are clean ( old granted but clean ). we started each morning with breakfast nice food and we love the omelettes, a walk on the beach which is on the door step.
As SteveMilan said, you must get a pizza from the restaurant, they are great as is the service, great place for lunch! When I go back we will be staying here again.
All the best Pete and Debbie ( 50 & 42 year olds )",Puri Saron Seminyak
549,Great spot but need to reclaim their entitlement to some peace!,30,August 2014,"We stayed one night on our arrival in Bali and booked a bungalow room directly via the hotel's website. We particularly requested a newly renovated quiet room as we were to arrive late at night. We learned upon arrival that we had been upgraded to a villa. Excellent!

We get to the villa, which was really nice, but the whole villa was shaking and vibrating from the boom of the music from the beach front warungs so there was no way we could stay there. I did remind them at the desk that we had asked for a quiet room but this was not really understood.

After this they took us back towards reception to a quieter room which was on the second floor, and whilst it was quiet it was in the older un-renovated section of the hotel. As we were tired we really couldn't fuss about any more, but for $180 au it was actually not worth the money, not even by Australian standards. We had booked a much better level room, so we felt a bit ripped off.

This hotel is the last hotel right on the beach in Seminyak, so a fantastic location. However the beachside warungs party every night with the doof music you would expect. It is a feature that you're either going to love or hate. A hotel is a place where you should expect a certain level of peace, and I would say this proximity to the warungs would overall encroach on quite a large percentage of the Saron's guest's comfort.

Other than this, it is a really lovely place and I think they should fight for some deal with these warungs so everyone is happy. Music to 3 am every night just because Bali is a holiday destination is not really a good reason.

Further more, it would be sad to see this gem get sold off, torn down and replaced by another ugly hotel which seems to be what's happening to this popular beach front resort destination.",Puri Saron Seminyak
550,Perfect location,40,August 2014,"Four start not at at the hight of the rating but perfect in the location and kindness of staff.
The private villa are on the contrary awesome with private pool .
The italian restaurant with pizza facing the ocean is couzy and the italian owner is very kind",Puri Saron Seminyak
551,Really bad experience,10,August 2014,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Had booked a ""bungalow room"" that was so small, we ended up paying additional for a junior suite (that had nothing to do with a suite!). Breakfeast is industrial, pool is very noisy and we saw rats on several occasions on the ground. The spa was dirty and massage was very poor. We were terribly disappointed and happy to leave at the end! Only good thing was the staff - very friendly and smiling at all times. If you travel with kids - this is not at all a good choice!",Puri Saron Seminyak
552,Second time here and it lived up to expectations,40,August 2014,"This place is the best value beach front property in Seminyak. Pool and swim up bar are a good size and very relaxing (as long as parents keep their brats on a leash), the breakfast is delicious, and the rooms are large and well-air conditioned.
The check-in service was poor and disorganised but we received an upgrade when they finally sorted it out, which was appreciated.
Location is perfect for shopping, beach walks, plus plenty of places to eat nearby.",Puri Saron Seminyak

555,on the beachfront,40,August 2014,"The Puri Saron is situated at the end of a lane with direct access to the beautiful Seminyak beach with the bean bag restaurants and activitites. Its an easy walk to the shops and markets, and an abundance of awesome warungs and cafes offering tasty, cheap food and drinks. The staff are polite,friendly and helpful. The hotel has 3 restaurants on its premises, all reasonably priced and well serviced. We were upgraded to a deluxe room with a big, bright bathroom. Bed was big and comfy, and the room was cleaned everyday. It was our second stay at the Puri Saron and we would definately stay there again if we got it at the rate we did (on Expedia).",Puri Saron Seminyak
556,Unbeatable!! Fabulous!!,50,August 2014,"I stayed at Puri Saron at the beginning of August. It was unbeatable in my mind. When I arrived late one night from Australia, I was exhausted as hadn't had a break for a couple of years and was surprised with an upgrade to one of the new room looking over the pool and the beach. It was a beautiful view and a great start to my holiday. Liza Kristina is the Sales Manager who does such a fantastic job! She really helped make my stay extra special and when my mum and dad arrived for their first trip to Bali they were also upgraded, they also just loved it. We had been very lucky and were very grateful. The food and pool bar and pool are just perfect. You couldn't get a better quiet location right on the beach. I had stayed here on other trips to Bali and it never disappoints. A very big THANKYOU to Lisa and the team at Puri Saron, we didn't want to leave and would have cancelled our booking at the next hotel if we could have. I most highly recommend this hotel. It is fabulous and the staff are so lovely. We will certainly be back to stay for the whole length of our next trip. Regards, Vanessa Australia.",Puri Saron Seminyak

all round its good for families and elderly people but over priced",Puri Saron Seminyak

Would recommend..",Puri Saron Seminyak
559,Great Location,40,July 2014,"We stayed at Puri Saron for 10 nights. We have travelled to Bali many times previously staying in both 2-5 star hotels. The hotel is clean all staff are very friendly and obliging. The hotel is in a great location as it backs onto the beach which is approx 20 metres from the pool and surrounding gardens. A very short distance away on the beach boardwalk are many
cafes/warungs that serve varied seafood,Indonesian and European style meals. There you can also have a sunset drink sitting on comfortable bean bags. Look for the caf√©s that have happy hour for cocktails usually 3pm-7pm (buy one get one free) making it a great location. We found our bungalow comfortable with a large bathroom, coldest hotel bar fridge I have ever experienced, which is great for a cold beer in the afternoon. The breakfast was plentiful with egg station fruits/cereals/toast and a variety of hot foods and French pastries, basic tea and coffee. The hotel has a large clean pool with swim up bar. We will definitely return to the Puri Saron probably next time taking a private villa with its own plunge pool.
For better rates deal with the hotel directly you cut out commission to holiday companies and online booking sites. All in all a nice hotel, albeit getting older now, but comfortable.",Puri Saron Seminyak
560,End of Business Trip Treat!,50,July 2014,"After two weeks in the downtown sister hotel, I transferred here for a few days r and r. The hotel itself is very well-run; clean, cool and with a variety odining options. The pool and its wrt bar complete the hotel complex. However, just across the road is one of the busiest tourist locations on the island. Be ready for helpful and non-invasive, but ever-present beach vendors and roaming abut seemingly docile dogs.",Puri Saron Seminyak
561,Wonderful and Relaxing,50,May 2014,"We stayed at the Puri Saron in April/May for 3 weeks and you could not get a better place to spend you holiday. The rooms are clean, staff wonderful and extremely helpful. Breakfast has a great variety and the poolbar and staff are to die for. Situated on the beach where you will find a lot of wonderful characters. We have stayed there before and I have already booked my next holiday there. Could not recommend this property highly enough. Can not fault the staff they go out of their way to make you feel at home and are so attentive. All in all a wonderful relaxing place to spend time relaxing while being waited on hand and foot.",Puri Saron Seminyak
562,Wish I could have stayed few says more,50,July 2014,"I stayed for 1 night on a business trip. Checked in into a 2 bedroom villa. The rooms was big and spacious and comes in with a private swimming pool. Very clean environment with good service by the staff , who were friendly and helpful. This is place for total relaxation by the seaside and you can hear the sound of the wave at night. I wish I could have stayed for another day to relax in peace and enjoy nature as it should be. They can also arrange a private tour to watch dolphins at sea, something that attracted me to come again. Planning to go again with my wife soon.",Puri Saron Seminyak
563,Great spot but needs some updating!,30,December 2013,"Cannot fault the location and being in the private villa closest to the beach was definitely the way to go.The rooms were spacious enough, but lacked that special feel you get with many of private villa's in Bali. Service was very helpful on arrival (mind you, took us a while to organize ourselves).
Would go again, but only if a cheap deal was to pop up as there is better value for money options in Seminyak. Would like to commend the poolside bar tender as was great to have a chat with and had some great advice to share. Overall an average hotel in a great location",Puri Saron Seminyak
564,"""Perfect location and pleasant staff""",40,June 2014,"We stayed at the Puri Saron for 5 nights. Our room was fine, even though it faced onto the building site when we went out to the balcony. The work didn't start until 8am in the morning and was normally finished no later than 8pm at night. it wasn't that much of a bother, but noise factors affect different people, different ways. Until the building site is finished this could be a factor for some people at the moment.
The location is great, with the hotel being right across the road to the beach. Go out the front and you can go across to a number of eateries located on the beach, or turn left and walk for about 10 minutes and there are a number of places to eat.
The room is fine. We stayed on the 3rd floor accessed by stairs. We had a deluxe room. The size of the room is spacious. The beds were fine. It has a safe in the room. The air conditioner works great. The bathroom is okay, water pressure could be improved. There was a smell every now and then from the drain, but nothing to drastic.
The staff are lovely at the Puri Saron. Each time we requested anything from the staff, they were helpful and assisted in fulfilling the request. The breakfast was fine. A number of choices of hot food and the egg station. They could possibly increase the selection of fresh fruit.
The pool area is great with a good number of sun lounges and sun spots.
We didn't get a chance to eat a meal at the hotel but other people that we talked too all stated that they had enjoyed the food and selections available.
We looked through a pool villa room which looked lovely and also looked at the bungalow room. We saw that the rooms are spacious and decorated tastefully.
All up it was a very nice stay and we will return again",Puri Saron Seminyak
565,Great location and hotel,40,June 2014,"We stayed for 4 nights during a stay in Bali. We found the hotel a little old but nonetheless no problem. The rooms are spacious and with a large bathroom. There is a room safe.
We asked for 2 rooms together which we got. They were 2 rooms upstairs with an adjoining balcony. Fantastic for post sun and swim drinks (before going to the beach for the sunset) with a gorgeous view over the garden.

The hotel is right on the beach where you can go for drinks, food and massages. The pool is great with a fab swim up bar. We didn't use the spa as we went down the main street for this.
You can change money at the hotel and we found the rate the same as the street.

We ate on the beach most nights and found a few little gems - Bali Juice Park (on the beach - great for cocktails and food and the sunset), La Plancha (on the beach, an old fave), Warung Bonita (near Seminyak Square). It is a bit of walk to the main street (it can seem so in the heat!) but there is lots of shopping and places to eat.

When getting a taxi, always ask for the meter to be turned on and not accept the price they offer as it is usually much more expensive than the metered price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
566,I wouldnt want to pay that much!,20,June 2014,"heared good reputation bout this hotel many years before.. Just last week, me n my family booked a villa 5 at Puri Sharon Hotel (i think it was the largest and most expensive room available). Unfortunatelly, for that much amount of money (if we were paying full rate, its around 300 USD). The villa looks empty and poorly repaired..

Room wise, it was ok, nothing special, the tv channels almoust everything are distorted..aircon was awesomly cold. Bed, i expected better than that.

Bathroom side: the shower was poorly maintained, the water didnt come out smoothly, the shower holes were kinda glock by something. And the water wasnt hard enough, it was lack of presure...ive been to a cheaper hotel than that and has better shower than this.

At the Restaurant: the food quality and variasion was OK, nothing special.. And we asked for 3 minutes egg, instead they gave us 5 and 7 minutes egg (2 days in a row)..

But the location was the golden thing, just beside the seminyak beach and near by the pizza cafe (delicious)",Puri Saron Seminyak
567,Terrible,10,June 2014,"We got to our first room which was filled with Mosquitos and a leaky toilet with water all over the floor, (their solution to that was by giving us a less then half can of fly spray)
Next, we had trouble getting moved to another room which had a poo stain and mould on the sheets and that seemed acceptable to them!?!? The buffet breakfast was definitely below average standards which is why we opted for room service only to be served a club sandwich with chicken that could be used as a door stop, when we asked for another to be made up with fresh chicken, we received the same sandwich with different chicken put in, aswell as being stone cold. This hotel has ruined our holiday and DO NOT recommend anyone to stay here.",Puri Saron Seminyak
568,Great Hotel and location,40,June 2014,"We stayed for 5 nights last week. We found though the hotel was a little old we found it offered everything we needed. Great pool and swim up bar and beautiful snacks.

Perfect location on the beach with lovely bean bags on the beach to sit on at night and watch the sunset which we did every night for sunset

Thank you puri saron we will be back",Puri Saron Seminyak
569,Would of been nice 20 years ago,30,October 2013,"We stayed here on our first trip to Bali and brought the deal thru getaway.
On arrival it looked lovely till we entered the room and the smell was like a blocked toilet.
The staff after being told put an afresh enter in the room which did little to cover the smell needless to say it went thrum our luggage and we had to re wash all our clothing, we were booked in for six nights and on day 4after many trips to reception they moved us to a bungalow but we felt our stay had been ruined.
Breakfast was basic and the staff were average for Bali hotel standards, we have since been back to Bali and gone to look at the hotel again and sadly it looks more tired then it was before.",Puri Saron Seminyak
570,"Excellent service, clean rooms and fantastic meals",50,May 2014,This is the second time we have stayed at the Puri Saron and I can say that we'll definitely be back. The pool and pool bar are excellent. Our children (7 and 5) were safe in the swimming pool (lots of different depths to suit all children). The rooms are nice and clean (not brand new) and the staff made our stay so lovely. The meals and breakfast were great.,Puri Saron Seminyak
571,Below average hotel,20,May 2014,"We stayed at Puri Saron for two nights recently and I must say that I'm glad it was ONLY two nights. The hotel is situated right on the beach, which is spectacular and it had a great pool area with a swim-up bar. That about sums up the good parts of the hotel.

We had been upgraded from a standard to a deluxe room, which was a pleasant surprise. The hotel grounds were nice and well-tended, it was spread over a relatively large area. The deluxe rooms were in separate buildings from the standard hotel rooms, they were two-level buildings with no lifts. All rooms faced into the hotel grounds, which was fortunate as there was construction on one side of the hotel but the bathrooms faced the construction side, so we were saved from any noise.

First impression of the bedroom was that it looked worn and tired, would have looked new about 20 years ago. I guess they upgraded the mattress and maybe one or two pieces of furniture, but the light switches next to the bed looked straight out of a 70s or 80s hotel room. Bed and pillows were very comfortable for the sleep though.

Bathroom was very spacious but even more worn and tired than the bedroom. It smelt of sulphur from the drains - which makes it feel like I've just walked into a toilet recently vacated by someone. Shower was in the tub, but the shower spray handle wouldn't stay in the holder (no wonder, as there were no grooves to hold it in place!) and kept spraying water at the shower curtain rather than straight down. Towels were worn and grey, amenities looked like the hotel management had bulk purchased them from the 80s and have been running down stocks since then.

Room door still uses an old key and the lock in the frame was dented, which made (un)locking our door extremely tedious. There was no electricity if the key wasn't in the 'dock' inside the room, which meant that we had to struggle in the dark to lock the door (thank goodness for mobile phone flashlights!) at night. What took the cake was on the morning that we were to leave, the lock decided to give up on us and we couldn't get the key to turn. It took two frantic calls to the reception to get the handyman to our room - in the end, he had to prise the door open with a screwdriver and ripped the door frame.

Already late, we rushed to the reception to check-out and asked for a taxi to the airport. A laidback bellboy looked at us, looked out onto the hotel driveway and said that there were no taxis available. The front-desk staff told us to walk to the main road to hail our own taxi. I'm not sure if it was our shocked or furious faces that prompted him to offer to call a taxi from the comfort of the reception desk. By the way, the 'main road' was another 5-minute walk from the hotel lobby.

Overall, a very poor experience. And we will NOT be returning to this hotel and will NOT be recommending this hotel to anyone, except maybe people we detest.",Puri Saron Seminyak
572,Slice of Paradise,50,May 2014,"This was the 2nd stage of our honeymoon, hotel booked through flight centre for 6 nights, after we had great 1st hand reviews from a work colleague who stayed here in January...

The hotel is set in a perfect location, 10-15mins walking distance to shopping and dining in Seminyak, while also being right on the beach....

Our room was in the centre of the garden area, a generous sized room with a beautifully carved 4poster bed.. (Only complaint about the room would be that the mattress was not the comfiest)
The hotel also offers a great (cheap) laundry service, has beautiful staff, who are very friendly and helpful..

The pool bar has to be the best part of the hotel!! Situated Right in the middle of the complex, (and also a stone throw from the beach)
the staff are amazing, we felt very well looked after!! and for eating there is the choice of wood fired pizza, snacks or the restaurant, meals/drinks can be paid or charged to your room and ordered from the menus at the pool bar, while your enjoying drinks and a swim...

Alternatively, to have an unforgettable Bali experience, you can go for a walk onto the beach and choose an eatery, (they provide waiter service) then relax sitting on a bean bag and be entertained by live acoustic music (can even get up to sing if that's your thing!!)
Oh but If it's a full moon, just sit back from the water to avoid being wet by rogue waves!!

The hotel also offers discounts on tours etc, and they have a spa that offers massages, facial treatments etc.... Very very relaxing (discount also offered for hotel guests!)

For families there is a kiddies play area and babysitting service (we didn't use on this occasion)

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and made many friends from sitting at the pool bar, including the wonderful staff who looked after us!!

One thing that maybe worth mentioning, (for the rooms closest to reception area.)
At present there is a new hotel construction going on right next door, but from our deluxe garden room and while relaxing in the pool....no noise/sounds
affected us at all...

We Would highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.... And we will most definitely return to stay again!!
Suk suma :))",Puri Saron Seminyak
573,Spectacular,50,March 2014,"The title says it all, absolutely spectacular views. From the moment our feet hit the foyer at Puri Saron, to the sad farewell, the service was second to none, the restaurant and the breakfast were splendid.
We had the pleasure of staying in several rooms, but the best of all was our own private villa, private pool, service to the door 24/7. If you are looking for a quite relaxing holiday, then this is the place to stay.
Alit is one of the best professional Managers we have had the pleasure dealing with in our 30 plus visit to Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
574,Perfect!,50,May 2014,"Had the best time at Puri Saron, the staff were SO friendly and helpful - we were so sad to leave! We stayed in a deluxe room (the cheapest) and it was fantastic, really spacious and clean and a lovely warm shower & bath. Breakfast was brilliant with a huge selection - my favourite being the heart shaped waffles. The pool was beautiful and very big and so close to the beach! Really have nothing bad to say, we can't wait to come back!",Puri Saron Seminyak
575,Good Location,30,May 2014,"The place is a bit on the Old side , but the location is quite convenient. Wifi is good , pool was a bit warm. Breakfast is very good. Bathroom is too small. Aircon etc all good. No DVD player , and only two Aussie stations with no Fox etc..
Perhaps the Bungalows are in better condition.",Puri Saron Seminyak
576,bad hotel!!!,10,May 2014,"When we check-out being ask to pay the mineral water which we did not take!!!!
Then we complaint, so hotel ask me to sign document for acknowledgement.
Very unhappy accuse!
My advice don't stay this hotel!",Puri Saron Seminyak
577,great staff,40,May 2014,"more goods than bads,great buffet breakfast,very friendly staff,hotel and rooms were clean and well kept,any issues were fixed promptly,location right on the beach and next to the local bean bag restaurants,in fact the only negative would be that it is starting to show its age,but all in all value for money.",Puri Saron Seminyak
578,Wendy & Kim Williams Perth WA,50,May 2014,"We would like to thank the management and staff at the Puri Saron Hotel for their excellent service. We have just spent the past 14 nights at the resort arriving home on the 9th of May 2014. We stayed in a Deluxe Bungalow, which was very clean and comfortable. When entering the resturant for breakfast you were greeted with big smiles from the staff and they made sure you had everything you needed. The pool area was amazing with happy pool bar staff. The hotel has the beach immediatley behind the hotel where you can hire pool lounges on the beach. You can watch the sun go down either at the back of the hotel or take up bean bags on the beach where you can be served drinks and a meal. Over the past 23 years of travelling to Bali we have stayed in several different resorts. We have stayed at the Puri Saron Hotel at least 6 times and have to admit this is our favourite. The renovations and additions to the hotel make your stay even more enjoyable. Once again thankyou to the Puri Saron for a relaxing holiday.",Puri Saron Seminyak
579,A pleasant and relaxing stay at the beach,40,April 2014,"We stayed here for 4 nights to end our vacation in Bali. The resort is really lush with gardens, friendly staff and great beach for surfing and chilling. Also the mix between beach and pool is perfect. You can get out of the pool and be in the sea in 2 minutes. The pool bar is also a great way to relax while sitting in the water. Make sure you get the pizza from the stone oven to the far left near the beach, it's one of the best we've had! The staff was kind enough to allow us to switch to a bungalow after our initial room had very hard beds, you may want to check this in advance. Overall, the rooms in the older part of the hotel could do with some renovation (some new paint, bathrooms, beds, doors, etc.), but for the price we paid, we didn't find that a problem at all given the fact that the rooms were clean and spacious. Also, we expected more TV channels given what we have seen in other hotels in Java and Bali. The wide range of complementary toiletries was very much appreciated. It's a 10 minute walk to the center of Seminyak where you can find a bunch of shops, spas, restaurants and bars. The biggest selling point is that it is on the beach, where you won't get enough and can lounge with music and a drink during sunset! Furthermore, the daytrip organized by the hotel was great and good value, we had an excellent driver. We would definitely recommend this hotel for couples and families. Despite it's age it has real Balinese character and is a great place to relax.",Puri Saron Seminyak
580,Comfort away from home,40,May 2013,We stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. great food and friendly staff. Always very clean and close to shops of Seminyak. Has a swim up pool bar which my husband thought was great on our rest days.,Puri Saron Seminyak
581,Not happy for what we paid,20,April 2014,"Our stay at puri saaron got off to a rocky start as the first ""delux"" room we were put in was squirming with Mosquitos and the stench coming bathroom was unbearable, we were offered fly spray to try and get rid of the mossies but we insisted that we were given another room which the staff did agree to and moved us promptly. The room was on the second floor and much better in regards to the stench and the mossies, but the one thing bothering both my friend and I was that the bathroom was horrendous, it was clean enough but everything looked so old,worn and half finshed that we didn't even want to shower in there (which was also uncomfortable due to there hardly ever being any hot water). The room itself was tidy and bed comfortable. Other than that we found the pictures to be slightly misleading and believed for the money we should have got something much nicer. The gardens and hotel surroundings were lovely and staff were friendly. In the end we spent minimal time in the room and that was the best way. My friend and I both agreed that although the hotel was satisfactory for our stay we would not recommend it to family or friends.",Puri Saron Seminyak
582,Great rates,40,April 2014,"The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We arrived late at night and found the air conditioning non functional. The first night was miserable but once we notified the staff, it was fixed immediately. There were a lot of Mosquitos and small flies, I think were coming through the drains. We were given a can of bug spray and a candle to help. The cleaning of the bathroom could of been better. The beds were comfortable and breakfast was very good with a good amount of variety. The pool was great. The Italian Restaurant on site was also very good. The location was great. We could walk to shopping and restaurants. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. For the price, we were satisfied with this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
583,Satisfied with this hotel,40,April 2014,"First time back in Bali for quite a while. I read all the reports both good and bad about the Puri Saron and made the decision to stay here after discussing it with surfing buddies who had stayed many a time previously.
Pros: friendly staff, good location right on the beach, nice pool area, WiFi is good, the rooms have a safe, fridge, air conditioning (which worked ok) and the rooms were reasonably clean. The breakfast seemed pretty good as long as you weren't there at opening time, it seemed to take a good half hour to get all the food out.
Cons: the bathrooms within the rooms are a little dated and could probably do with a really good clean but they're not too bad and like everywhere mozzies can be a bit of an issue, but the staff are happy to spray the rooms if need be.
All in all I enjoyed my stay and would happily return.",Puri Saron Seminyak
584,Relaxation amongst the chaos,40,April 2014,"They say a first impression speaks volumes. After arriving late at night, I was pleasantly surprised to find our transport was on time. Staff at check in were friendly and attentive and we even got the rooms we asked for. Within an hour of touching down we were checked in and unpacking for our 6 night stay.
Having spent a ¬º of what most hotels demand on the beach in Seminyak, I was expecting to be staying in a mediocre room in a poor location. Yes the rooms do lack some of the finishing touches that others demand, but they are more than comfortable for the traveler that would rather spend $300 a day on food and purchases, than nice decorations and fittings in their room.
The brief for this trip was relax. The Puri Saron provided this and more. Restaurant was good. Breakfast was varied and ample and the atmosphere was always calm. The gardens were nice and the pool was sensational. Perfect swimming temperature. The Hotel provided cheap mini bar and were relaxed with the fact that most people would buy their own drinks and bring them back to the room from outside.

The atmosphere in front of the hotel on the beach at dusk was fantastic. Great sunsets, bean bags and good music. A short walk along the beach ( out the front of cocoon) there is a local food vendor who will cook you a traditional indonesian meal for less than $2. And yes its clean safe and sensational. I ate gluten free meals there and was left wanting more.(Look for the orange umbrellas).
The shopping in Seminyak is a little more expensive but the quality is so much better in most cases. Shop around. There are loads of bargains to be had.
Overall our 6 day jaunt was a fun relaxing time. Would I stay at the Puri Saron again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Hell yeah!",Puri Saron Seminyak
585,"Location, location, location!",50,April 2014,"The hotel faces the beach directly and there is just a small path with a few motorbikes (no cars) between you and the beach when sitting in the front of the pool area. From here you can watch the ocean as well as the beautiful sunsets of Bali.
The pool itself it nice but really, really hot - but that temperature is super nice around sunset.

The rooms are fine and clean, but not super fancy, and the bathrooms are just ok.

The garden is a nice little walk to the beach, pool area and breakfast restaurant.
Breakfast is good, and even as a vegetarian there a different choices, and of course - lots of great fruits.

There is a pool restaurant serving really good stone owen crust pizzas. Owner is Italian, so what more is there so say - and you can enjoy the sunset from here as well.

All in all the value for money is amazing.
The other resorts situated directly on the beach (unless a very few options in Kuta) are 5 stars and of course 5 stars (and even five star plus) prices.

I stayed one night for relaxing on the beach after a holiday at friends in Ubud, and as a solo female traveller I felt completely safe all over the hotel area.",Puri Saron Seminyak
586,Where do I start?,30,March 2014,"Our stay at puri saron started off quite badly. Our room was like a morgue no matter hoe much we turned the air con up. Which gave my husband a massive chest infection! The air con wS dripping water. There wS massive construction works by the pool, the breakfast was revolting with ants crawling al over the food and hardly any variety. We ate elsewhere. It wasn't the cleanest place either. BUT , on a good note, when we did try to check out early to another hotel, and explained why, they upgraded us to a private villa they have there which is right at the front by the beach! With our own private pool. We were very grateful to them for that. They also made sure there was no more ants on breakfast food. And they also bought a little cake to our villa for my husbands 40 th birthday. While I wouldn't rush back to puri saron, I am impressed at how they did there best to make our stay so much better! It's an awesome location! That is one really good thing!",Puri Saron Seminyak
587,Next to the beach,50,December 2013,Great place with a beautiful poolarea. The hotel is situated just next to the beach. The rooms are very nice and the garden is well kept. We have stayed in Puri Saron many times and will come back again in december.,Puri Saron Seminyak
588,"Nice place, beautiful beach during the evening",40,March 2014,"Nice quiet hotel, its quite big, the rooms are okay and the staff is friendly. Currently some renovations going on (the construction workers kept passing lewd comments at me and my girlfriends but again that is very common in bali and the best thing is to ignore it)
The breakfast is nice. The pool looks great but the edges are sharp and the water is highly chlorinated, so i suggest you dont go in for too long. The location is amazing! the beach is barely 5 feet away and is perfect for surfing on most days, the evenings are also beautiful. Its also very safe, and balinese people are very friendly.",Puri Saron Seminyak
589,Another great and perfect stay,50,February 2014,"In Febrary 2014 we had our seventh trip back to Bali and we have always stayed at the Puri Saron and the amenities and all staff from the managers to the gardeners have made our stays welcoming and enjoyable. It is in a very central spot and backs on to the beautiful beach, has a fantastic pool bar and beautiful gardens. Even though during our last two visits they have been upgrading some of the buildings it did not affect our stay at all. Dining is fantastic too. Definitely recommend staying at Puri Saron Seminyak start with making a booking by contacting Lisa at:

590,"Great Location, Great Staff",40,February 2014,"I stayed at the Puri Saron for 12 Nights in a Bungalow. The rooms are clean, the staff are so helpful and the Location is Perfect. There were a couple of problems with the room ie: the aircon was noisy. But as soon as I advised them of this there was somewhere there within 10 Minutes to fix it. Had one night the water coming out of taps was really dirty.. But again someone there in no time to rectifiy the problem.. Then they gave me free transport to the airport (Value $20). The boys working at the pool bar are so nice and always happy! Always there with a smile and nothing is too hard for them. Only one downfall is there are renovations going on by the Pool, but really it was only noisy once in a while.. All in all would definately stay here again and would recommend this hotel to friends!! A Big Thank you and well done to all the Staff!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
591,Great Stay,40,February 2014,This is located in the quieter part of Bali but the hotel is having money spent to upgrade. The staff and management will bend over backward to see your stay is of A grade standard. Located right near the beach and pool area the garden view villas are my choice. I also have experience the garden view rooms and the up market Pool villas and all were excellent and if there were any problems the staff was quick to fix. Shopping and restaurants are just a short walk and there is a courtesy bus to Kuta. It is probably not the most luxurious of hotels but certainly is value for money. I have been to Bali 17 times over the years and this is a place I have been back to three times and all stays were great.,Puri Saron Seminyak
592,"Perfect location, you get exactly what you pay for",40,March 2013,"Location IMO is adeal - all the best restaurants are close, beach is one of the best in Bali for me, a lot is withing walking distance, and you get direct access to the beach, usually you'll have to pay 3x for that especially in Seminyak.
All the rest is just ok, simply set your expectations right. If you want luxury right at the beach rent private villa and pay 1,5k US per night, or stay far from everything and not at the beach and pay decent price for private luxury villa. Just make your choices, they're quite straightforward. We're staying sometimes in private villas in Kerobokan area when we want serenity and a bit of luxury for good price, when we want to be right on Seminyak beach (given we can't and don't want to afford 300 USD per night) - then it's good ol–≤ Puri Saron",Puri Saron Seminyak
593,Don't stay here. What you pay is what you get. Cheap = Bad,10,February 2014,"I have stayed in Bali many many times and in lots of different locations and hotels and this place would have to be the worst by far. Especially when you can pay a bit extra and get a lot nicer place.

Where to start. We were staying in a bungalow top floor room. The room was small and was riddled with Mosquitos. We sprayed the room over and over and we still had Mosquitos.
I requested to be moved even be down graded and they could not accommodate.

I did state in the booking that I was traveling with a infant when we checked in I had a top floor room. I did inquire about a bottom floor and they still could not assist us.

The blankets were stained and the room smelt and very dated and old.

Air conditioner was broken and It took 4 phone calls over a period of 40mins to have someone come and fix it. Also you cannot lock the door properly as you can just lift the door up and out of the lock and slide the door across.

The daily breakfast is very average and beware when sitting outside there are bee's that are landing on your food. There is obviously a bee's hive near by as there were many bee's. If you are allergic to bee's I strongly recommend not to staying here.

The place is having renovations and extensions which is quite messy.

Hotel is in ok location but for this time of year the beach had dirty brown water that smelt and looked to be raw sewage.

In regards to customer service it's slow and very unhelpful. The lady at the front desk could not speak very good English and wasn't able to offer any solution. If I was staying more that the 3nights I would of left however our booking was locked in.

The photos on the internet do the hotel justice. They are very misleading.

Overall I think this hotel needs a major revamp. I definitely won't be coming back or recommending it to anyone. TERRIBLE

As for location",Puri Saron Seminyak

We always return to Puri Saron, the staff have become trusted and cherished friends of ours. Yes, the hotel is a little dated, but offers wide open spaces with lush gardens, attentive and warm service from all employees who strive to be helpful and accommodating. High Fives to the staff!!!!! Mornings are bliss, an amazing ocean view with your morning cuppa makes every day a great day!!! Great access to legian and seminyak along the beach for super restaurants and shopping. Over the time we have taken family and friends to Puri Saron with us, they to are now regular visitors to the Puri Saron. It's a winner for us and will be returning later this year and yes we will stay at Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak
596,"Musty, dated, poor quality waste of money",10,January 2014,"Puri Saron was a huge disappointment. Granted, it was inexpensive at about $72 per night, had a nice pool area, friendly staff, and the location was right on the beach, however, the room quality was so poor that it cancelled out all the good points. First, the rooms were incredibly dated, and aside from a new TV, obviously hadn't been updated since the place was built in the 70's or 80's. The furniture had chips on it, the lampshades were dirty, and the walls were chipping. My toilet also didn't work properly, my air con had one temperature setting (very cold) and worst of all was the room overpoweringly musty smelling. My sheets also had a bloodstain on them, which was pretty off-putting. And, the breakfast was abysmal: tater tots, packaged waffles, overripe/rotting fruit, toast, cereal, and a few sad looking Indonesian hot dishes. Outside the grounds were obviously once pretty, but now were just a little rough around the edges with plants that weren't quite trimmed properly and grass that was overgrown. I wish I could have checked out, but I paid in advance, so I just tried to minimize the amount of time spent in the room.",Puri Saron Seminyak
597,A Must Stay!!!,50,January 2014,"This was my 3rd trip to bali and I have never felt so welcome. The staff are truly amazing and make you feel like a king.
We were lucky enough to stay in the Bungalow rooms which are nice and close to the pool and the restaurant. The pool staff are there to make sure you are having fun and they are just beautiful.
This resort backs onto the beach which is great not only if you love to surf but at night the entertainment is just fantastic.
There are some renovations in progress which will only improve this resort even more.
Its a great place for honeymooners friends and young families.......its a great mix.
Puri Saron is in a great location with shops, restaurants and bars only walking distance away.
I will definitely be returning to this resort and recommending it to all friends and family.
Thanks for an amazing time.",Puri Saron Seminyak
598,highly recomended,50,January 2014,"felt very well looked after from the second we arrived. We had some late changes with arrival date which were caused by ourselves & this was quickly and efficiently sorted out for us.
Loved the location, being just minutes from everywhere but out of the way enough to enjoy this tropical paradise.
room was clean with plenty of room.
some renovations were being carried out during our stay which didn't affect us, but will certainly add to this place, I look forward to returning when they are done.
I found every one of the staff happy & genuinely cared that I was happy with my stay.
I can see this resort as a good family destination but also would be great for couples as well.

thanks for looking after us everyone at Puri saron......",Puri Saron Seminyak
599,Don't stay here,20,January 2014,"Stayed here for a week. Rooms very dated bathrooms old and extremely smelly. Breakfast buffet covered with flys, hot food always cold have to ask staff for tea or coffee. Pool rather warm and needed a good scrub . Reception staff not very friendly. Bell boy extremely friendly and very kind. Rooms far too expensive much better accommodation elsewhere.",Puri Saron Seminyak
600,Average but Cheap,30,December 2013,"Hotel was average but cheap.
Had issues from arrival with room booked not being available.
Room was clean with a good air conditioner.
Bathroom was dated and a little dirty (but fine).
Breakfast was average (buffet was cold).
Pool was nice and large with swim up bar but no atmosphere.
Location was Ok as it is in Seminyak but not the area you want to be in. 20 minute walk to the good Seminyak area where the nice cafe, restaurants and shops are.",Puri Saron Seminyak
601,Great place !,40,December 2013,"I Highly recommend this place. Has great location ,close to the beach and shops. It's is very nice in typical Balinese style. My boyfriend and I stayed there over Christmas period, so it was definitely better than busy Kuta which is only short distance from Seminyak.
Definitely will go back there again!",Puri Saron Seminyak
602,Good location,40,January 2014,"Hotel having major additions, so building work going on each day and right near the poolside.
Our room was spacious, clean and the breakfasts were fine, with good egg station. Sad to see all the rubbish on the beach, apparently it's common at this time of year due to winds etc. Staff all friendly and helpful.",Puri Saron Seminyak
603,Not ideal with a toddler...,30,November 2013,"We went to Seminyak for a week, it was not good for a toddler in the area. The hotel room we were given initially the WIFI didnt work well at all so our monitor kept cutting out and wouldnt reboot. The room was also dirty. We were upgraded which was kind for better WIFI but it still wasnt perfect but that is just Bali I think. The staff were nice, the breakfast wasnt good and the breakfast area too hot. The cot bed was completely unsuitable as was the high chair in the restaurant. The staff were friendly but overall I dont think the place is very well run.",Puri Saron Seminyak
604,Thank you Puri Saron for a memorable trip,50,December 2013,"Thru this I want to thank Puri Saron and especially Front office Manager ALIT for making us feel at home and the warm hospitality extended. This was my first trip to Bali along with my wife and daughter n making the hotel our base camp and traveling out turned out to be the right decision

Also your hotel is located in the perfect spot near the beach making it special in my view.
My suggestion would be stick to what it is today and don't turn it into a concrete hotel :) as your current homely environment, your sweet staff, location and caring front office manager stands out",Puri Saron Seminyak
605,"""Terrible""",10,January 2014,"Arrived to find our specific request for a double bed and ground floor had been ignored. When questioned the front desk staff just smiled and said ""so sorry"".
Got to our room to find puddle of water on the floor underneath the air conditioner. Despite the air con being set at 16 degrees it was cooler outside! Shower was cold...no help from front desk. Toilet kept almost over flowing with a flush and nothing was going down.
After a shower the bathroom floor was flooded as old silicone over old silicone had been used to stop leaks.
Only 1 channel in English on TV. Breakfast was average and we only ate their one morning, that was enough. After 5 days of below average customer service and poor room conditions we checked out and cut our losses. Booked a beautiful villa room with the most helpful staff! Avoid staying at this hotel if you can!",Puri Saron Seminyak
606,Puri Saron Hotel,50,December 2013,The hotel was in a great location. The rooms were a good size and the cleanliness was great. The staff did a great job making sure the rooms were immaculate everyday. All the staff were very friendly and willing to help. The supplied breakfast had a good range. Would stay there again.,Puri Saron Seminyak
607,Underwhelming,30,December 2013,"We were slightly concerned on the lead up to our trip having read other reports on this hotel, and the building work etc going on. In all honesty the building work from a noise perspective is minimal so this was a pleasant surprise. They are currently extending the hotel by a couple of rooms and those happen to be literally 3m from the pool so there is a bit of banging going on but it is all hand tools and no pneumatic drills or anything so not too bad.

The night we arrived our room literally reverberated from the music coming from the bar area. This carried on until 3am and was awful. We did complain at reception who were friendly and relatively helpful, but said that it was a special night and the music was unusually late and that wouldn't happen again during our stay. Since then it did happen one more time but not as loud and wasn't as unbearable.

We stayed in a standard room which is pretty basic. The bed is ok. Sheets were never clean - every single set we had put on the bed had marks on. The baby cot was pretty battered and old but this is really in keeping with everything else. The bathroom was disgusting and smelly. The toilet whilst clean had clearly not been cleaned properly behind it, the grout between the tiles in the shower was black and the shower curtain wasn't waterproof so the floor was continually wet as the water went through the curtain. Generally it needed a revamp. In the room itself there was no storage to speak of. The 'wardrobe' had the safe in it and a few hangers but no shelves so we spent the week with piles of clothes scattered wherever they would fit. The balcony was ok and had a table and 2 chairs in which to sit and relax.

On the positive side the pool is nice and the pizza place next to it is great. Not so great was loud rock/metal music the bar insisted on pumping out on a few days! Something more relaxing would be better fitting to people on a holiday!

The staff were extra friendly, particularly the guys at the bar who were happy to have a chat and were very sweet.

All in all, not quite deserving of an average score because the whole place needs renovating. Would we come back? No.",Puri Saron Seminyak
608,Stinky bathroom,10,December 2013,"The room sermed nice until we entered bathroom. Seems like the toilets dont flush properly and there is a sewrage problem , disgusting. The air con didnt work and noisy , not what we expected from 4 star. Thr beach was littered ribbish amd we has pay to sit on beach. The free breakfast had insects all over the fruit salad. On the positive side the pool was nice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
609,Great place to stay - relaxing.,40,November 2013,"We had a great holiday - our second time to Puri Saron and loved it each time.
All staff are very friendly and helpful - some things do not always run to plan(hey, it's Bali) but very quickly solutions found and problems solved, so all good really.
Stayed in a Dlx Bungalow again this time - they are a very generous room size with comfortable furnishings - everything works. Bathroom is oversized, huge - but has the wardrobe, drawers and luggage rack at one end of it so literally becomes a dressing room really.
We enjoy the outside terrace with again comfortable chairs and table (also a drying rack) and the lovely outlook onto the garden.
Breakfast is good, with good choices and changes to a few things each day - egg station does a good job and is quite quick.
Love the well-kept gardens and the pool area and the relaxing little thatched gazebos to lay around on and enjoy to relax on the sun loungers overlooking the beach - just the best thing. Great to watch at sunset when the beanbags and umbrellas and coloured lights come out at all the little beach restaurants and bars and the live music starts - great vibe.
The beach out front is great for a swim - sandy bottom, clean water, nice surf and right in front of resort - easy, couldn't be better.
Location is really good - easy 3 minute walk up a fairly shaded little street to get to a main road for shops, water, money changer, bars, and good restaurants and 15 min easy/slow walk up that street then gets you to Jalan Legian.
Yes, there was a bit of construction going on at the moment at the hotel but it didnt bother us.
This time we actually upgraded for a few days to a 1 brm Pool Villa - it was beautiful to have the private pool a step away and just flop in. The villa was lovely but honestly not that much bigger or different from the Dlx Bungalow; just set out differently (considering the price difference) - but it was nice for a treat.
We will return to Puri Saron as we love it - it ticks all the boxes for us.",Puri Saron Seminyak
610,"so so, not my favourite",30,December 2013,"I like the old balinese style of this hotel. located near Seminyak beach offers u a nice view when you have breakfast or dinner. But, that nice atmosphere can only be enjoyed during dry season. It was raining all the time when i visited Bali. This hotel is not designed for rainy season. There is no connecting 'route' between one building to the other. I had to walk through the rain to get to the restaurant which is located pretty far from my room. I did not come to a hotel to get wet!",Puri Saron Seminyak
611,"Perfect location, beautiful rooms and great staff!!!",50,December 2013,"We love this hotel and have stayed here many times.
It's perfect for couples or family's. Its away from the hussel and bussel but still only 5-10 mins if that's what you like.

It's on the beach so you can see a sunset every night.
There's a great pizza restaurant over looking the beach from the hotel.

The pool bar staff are exceptional (Sumertha, Ardika and Dodik) and go above and beyond! They are wonderful to us and our 2 year old son.

The girls at breakfast (Wiwi and Priska) are gorgeous and can't do enough for you.
Buffet for breakfast is ok all though sad there are no fresh banana pancakes anymore or much of a variety of fruit.

It's great value and has everything you need. The Hotel Manager is Alit and would do anything to help you if need be.

There is a great massage place called Ayu Massage just in the street and only $6 but also one in the hotel with lovely staff for around $25

There seem to be a lot of staff training at reception and in house keeping so be patient as there English isn't very good, how ever they are still kind and warm.

This hotel is great. Have stayed in many hotels in Bali and can recommend. Lovely grounds, rooms, comfy beds,
Great staff, location, awesome pool, great Hotel!!!!

Great people on the beach too!

613,Family Surfing Trip,40,October 2013,"We love love loved the Puri Saron Seminyak. Position was fantastic, right on the beach with
waves nearly every day to surf, great restaurants within a couple of minutes walk right on the beach. The hotel was excellent, loved our rooms on the third floor, the pool was big and
very enjoyable. Big scrumptious breakfasts every morning, heaps of lounges both in & out of the sun and the great Pizzeria always open at the beach entrance. The staff were fantastic, attentive, friendly & so welcoming. Special thanks to G'day and Setiawan / Pool Bar, great at their jobs & lovely service to us and our kids !! Definitely a more traditional Bali Hotel, and I would certainly stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
614,Try somewhere else.....,20,August 2013,"I stayed in this hotel on my first visit to Bali in August 2013. I live in Asia and have travelled extensively in the region and I really was not impressed by this hotel and the value for money that I received.

Firstly the good points: The pool was nice and the location is right on the beach (although it is a long walk to the nicer parts of Seminyak). The other guests were really friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. The grounds are quite pretty and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is very quiet at night and we were able to sleep very well.

Now the bad: The room was full of mosquitoes all the time and the answer from the hotel was a big tin of mossie spray and a shrug. The security on the gate is a joke and simply waved through any vehicle who approached without even a cursory check. The locks/doors on the rooms are flimsy and I did not feel particularly secure in the room. The toilet in our room smelt foul for the entire week, the bathroom was old and not particularly clean, the shower was old and not really adequate. The bed sheets were dirty on one occasion.

The staff are not terribly helpful - We had the same experience as the other reviewers whereby the hotel flatly refused to order a taxi for us and instead recommended their own, much more expensive cars - The walk to the nearest taxi stand is a reasonable distance and at night is patrolled by wild dogs... Not ideal at all... On one day I was told there was a laundry problem so no towels were available at the pool at all - On the days when we did get towels there were several occasions when they smelt quite bad.

There is a large building site right next to the hotel which from which hammering, pile-driving shocks and digger and crane engine noise can be heard from 9am-6pm every weekday.

The breakfast was awful, very little choice, the cheapest ingredients and unhelpful staff. This is the only hotel I have ever visited that do not serve orange juice of any kind at breakfast and were unable to provide any when asked. After two days we gave up and ate outside the hotel, despite having purchased a B&B room rate.

Overall if this hotel was really cheap I would say it's just about OK but it's not particularly cheap and together with the dangerously high levels of mosquitoes which are ever present in the room (I was bitten all over my face each night, including on my eye!), the construction noise, the poor food, the questionable cleanliness and the attitude of the staff I would suggest travelers look elsewhere.",Puri Saron Seminyak
615,Recommend,50,November 2013,"It was our first visit to bali and we had an amazing time I would definitely recommend staying in seminyak and also staying at the Puri Saron

Firstly the hotel is in a great location, with beautiful surrounding not just on the beach but also having it's gorgeous gardens leading to the pool. The hotel is also close to many restaurants and shops however far enough not to get the street and traffic noise.

The swimming pool is a great size with a pool bar with lovely staff , myself and my partner Abe would like to thank doduk for his hospitality at the bar , he was very friendly and made us feel very welcome :)

The rooms are just what you need, clean, safe, and cool.
We had no problems the room it was immaculate when we arrived and was cleaned everyday . The only problem we had was we couldn't work the safety deposit box and the air con, however someone was sent up straight away and both were fixed immediately :)

Breakfast was brilliant, again just what you need to start the day.

Overall the staff at puri saron are fantastic, they welcomed us when we arrived and made us feel welcome throughout our stay, very friendly and helpful. Even without any notice brought my partner a surprise birthday cake to his room on his birthday:) great customer service :)

I would recommend this hotel and would definitely go back there .

Thank you to everyone at puri saron",Puri Saron Seminyak
616,value for money hotel,40,November 2013,"Stayed 14th Nov for 6 nights . This is our 3rd time staying here. The staff and location are the best you will get, in the area. The hotel still has that Bali feel. Staff very helpful . Close to lots of nice restaurants and shopping. Renovations to spa and restaurant going on at the moment, but this shouldn't put you off staying here, as you don't notice it too much and will be finished soon.Specials thanks to Iin & Wiwi . Also anyone who moans about this hotel is way too fussy to be in Bali. Looking forward to returning to Puri Saron soon.",Puri Saron Seminyak
617,Still the best affordable beachfront hotel,40,November 2013,"This is our 2nd stay at this hotel..
as usual we book another 2 deluxe bedrooms with additional extra bed.

this time we get to experience the actual deluxe bedroom (last time we got a free upgrade to bungalows)
The rooms are refurnished, with a little glitch.. the AC unit is noisy and not cool enough, so we ask the hotel staffs and they sent the engineer immediately and the AC needs to be cleaned.. Its fine with us as we are about to leave for sightseeing trip while the engineer cleans the AC unit.. by the time we get back to the room.. the AC is now super cool
The bed is very clean and we slept like a log

There a some renovations/construction near the pool area (spa and the pizzeria), but will not generate much noise, although may be a bit awkward swimming in the pool while the construction workers can see us from above.. lol

Breakfast was a bit improved from our last stay here, they re-arrange the buffet table, which are in better positions

Staffs are very friendly, some of them even still remember my name (last visit was June 2013)

Still my no 1 consideration to stay here again :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
618,A good medium standard `old style Balinese` hotel.,40,November 2013,"We just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Concerned about reports of construction noise, but no problem at all. The pizzeria is currently under renovation, so there is a bit of noise just near the pool, but nothing to worry about, and not excessive. Reception staff were very accommodating, pool was nice, AC was good, beds were comfy, and bathroom and main room were clean. The lighting in the room is very low, being just lit by low wattage bedside lamps. Probably not a major deal for most people. Close to lots of lovely restaurants. Quite similar to Puri Raja Hotel. Would definitely consider returning.",Puri Saron Seminyak
619,A Wonderful Trip to Bali,40,October 2013,Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The bunglow rooms that we had were excellent.The resort is tucked away from the hustle of the city and is on the beach. It has a lovely pool bar that is just marvelous. You can walk into the street nearby for all your requirements. There are some been-bag eateries on the beach (not part of this resort) where one can lounge in the evenings. A lovely experience. Would do it again.,Puri Saron Seminyak
620,Don't spoil your holiday by staying here!,10,July 2013,"This is undoubtedly the worst hotel we have ever stayed in Bali, and we have been many times over the last 30 years. Also, we will never, ever recommend this hotel to anyone because of our experiences.

Building sites on both sides make it look like you are staying in the middle of a war zone. Down right ugly outlook.
Our villa, located close to the beach, meant we were kept awake until 3am because of the night club on the beach immediately in front of the hotel blasting music continuously. Not our idea of a relaxing holiday.
Facilities such as the restaurant and pizza bar were uninviting in appearance, quality of food and service. The breakfast was very ordinary and you had to wait an inordinate amount of time for someone to cook an egg!
The hotel in general looked run down and certainly not the star rating advertised.
The hotel refused to call a taxi for us and told us that we could use their transport but otherwise they couldn't help.

We are pretty easy going but do expect to get what we've paid for but this holiday, because of this hotel, was very disappointing. Do yourself a favour and stay anywhere but here, as you can get far better accommodation for your money elsewhere.",Puri Saron Seminyak
621,Great Location,40,October 2013,"I stayed the weekend, between other travel destinations, and enjoyed my time at the hotel. I stayed in a Villa with private plunge pool and cabana and found the vila to be very clean, and the staff were very friendly and helpful, except in the restaurant, where they had difficulty getting my (single) order right. Wrong drink, slow service with and disinterested staff. The place only had two tables full on the night I (attempted) to dine there. Apart from that the service was excellent. There is building construction next door and this went on over Saturday and Sunday, but I had been advised about it beforehand, and received a substantial discount on my Villa, so was not put off by the construction noise.

The shops and restaurants are a bit of a walk, but who doesn't walk in Bali? The beach is right across the road, and the pool area is perfect for familes.

Checking in and checking out was very good, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel does need a bit of brighting up in some areas, but is very good value for money.

The big question. Would I stay there again? Yes, and would be happy to recommend it to friends",Puri Saron Seminyak
622,Average,20,October 2013,"Recently we stayed at Puri Saron for our wedding accommodation. The first room we were assigned had two single beds, the next room the air conditioner sounded like a tractor and then we were upgraded for free. This room however- the air conditioning leaked 2/3days we were in it. We travelled with our 11month old and the cot provided was in bad condition. Posts missing and a blanket folded made the mattress. The beds are very hard also. For our last two nights we upgraded to a Villa for $100USD , I advised that the morning we would check in we would need a 9am check in due to our wedding being that day and needed to get ready in there. The Villa wasn't clean so we had to pay an additional $150USD for the 2 bedroom villa just so we could have a place to get ready in. The staff spoke very little English so when we would phone through to reception, most times I ended up hanging up in frustration. I would not recommend this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
623,Very recommended Hotel in Seminyak area,50,August 2013,"A great place for relaxation !.....come and feel the atmosphere of it.
All staff was really friendly and it's all made my holiday enjoyable.
Next year, I'll make it sure to stay back in this hotel for my holiday.
Thanks",Puri Saron Seminyak
624,Bustling Simanyak,50,May 2013,"Our last hotel was Puri Saron Seminyak. We arrived on another steaming hot day and were pleasantly surprised at the efficient service when we arrived. We were whisked up to our beautiful room with a stunning balcony. Fortunately the air conditioner worked extremely well and we were able to cool down before exploring. The setting is stunning, a narrow road separates the hotel from the sparkling sea. We sat at the Greek restaurant overlooking the hustle and bustle of the road. We shared an excellent pizza and were able to witness the dozens of vendors trying to ply their trade. All of the vendors get to know your first name and where you are from and then constantly try to get you to buy anything and everything. The breakfast was amazing and then we set off each day to surf and then explore. The surfing was superb especially as one can surf right in front of the hotel. The food in the main area in Seminyak was delicious but once again the wine was terribly expensive. I learnt that Hatten wine was quite good and that you could get a good deal at Happy hour. The shopping was a wonderful experience and one could get really good prices if you are prepared to haggle. One good tip is if you are the first customer of the day, you can get a very good price!
The people are so humble, spiritual and friendly and I never heard a raised voice among the locals. There is a lovely mix of tourists in the hotels and Puri Saron had a lovely pool area with a bar that included chairs in the pool. Some of the tourists spent all day drinking ice-cold bintangs in the pool. The spa was also luxurious and the ladies gave the most wonderful massages! We were very sad to leave but were happy to know that we shall be back next year.
One leaves Bali feeling so spiritually fulfilled!",Puri Saron Seminyak
625,Good seafront location but noisy,30,September 2013,"Hotel is right on the beach and conveniently situated right by a great hangout called La Plancha.

However, as per the other review, there is currently a huge hotel being built next door to this hotel, although there does seem to be a lot of development in the area at the moment, it was noisy.

Rooms were standard but clean. Good pool area with a swim up bar. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was buffet style with continental and fry up. It was adequate enough.

There were nice bars and restaurants nearby along the seafront but probably a good 10 mins walk into the centre of town.",Puri Saron Seminyak
626,Great stay,40,September 2013,"Stayed for 6 nights and compared to our last stay 10 years ago (Bali Holiday Resort) no comparison. Right from start checking was quick and friendly, the room clean and prepared, though in room safe did not work it was replaced straight away, breakfast was consistent and good, pool clean... Down sides - need to replace towels grey towels do not look or feel good, also a more reliable Wifi service.",Puri Saron Seminyak
627,Beware - big & noisy construction next door,20,September 2013,"We've stayed at Puri Saron twice previously and decided to book again. Unfortunately we found that right next door (right down to the former bungy/Double 6 nightclub site) there's a massive hotel being built, and when I say massive - I mean MASSIVE. The construction noise was terrible and ruined our time at Puri Saron. We were booked to stay for 6 nights but checked out after 1 and the hotel agreed to refund us for the other 5 nights. They told us they've been losing a lot of customers due to the construction. We also found the hotel had deteriorated since our last stay 18 months ago and was generally dirty and not well maintained. Even the plants in the hotel grounds seemed to be tired & struggling! The reception staff are always friendly, but it seems as though management has taken the hotel's great location for granted and have dropped the ball on other things that need to be done in order to offer a nice hotel. The selection and variety of the buffet at breakfast was awful. The pool is ok (not great) and the location is very good but that's all this place has going for it which is a shame - it should be a lot better than what it is. We won't be going back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
628,Great location with a fantastic pool,30,August 2013,"Stayed here for 10 nights in August. A smaller hotel than we are used to in Bali, however grounds were nice and the pool area with swim up bar was great. Plenty of sun lounges and room and you don't feel crowded whilst getting that Bali tan! We stayed in a bungalow and it was not what I expected; quite a basic room with large bathroom and big enough balcony - clean and tidy. Breakfast is another story; don't bother! Very poor selection and very little variety - don't include in rate; go outside the hotel for a good cheap breakfast with variety! Rooms could do with a little spruce but staff are friendly and welcoming. The central location of this property is great. With a lot of properties losing their ""Balinese"" feel, this hotel offers that feel, albeit it could do with a mini makeover. All in all a good stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
629,recommended place to stay,50,August 2013,"Highly recommend to everyone.The staff are wonderful, they warmly greeted repeater guest,all of the staff go out of their way to assist with any needs.the room and the food is excellent. My kids also enjoy the beach (is much cleaner than kuta), and the pool.. . really loved this pool as we can do laps & even have a drink & lunch at the bar without getting out of the water.

632,Cheap,30,November 2012,Started off bad when the resort vehicle picked us up and the seat was held up with the seat belt therefore no seat belt for myself. Check in service was poor with staff having little English. Rated 4 stars however more like a three star resort. Only saving feature was a good pool. Would only stay there again due to its location otherwise wouldn't recommend it.,Puri Saron Seminyak

Well Recommended!",Puri Saron Seminyak
635,Excelent Location and great value of money,50,July 2013,"At first i was unsure with this hotel after i read reviews in tripadvisor. but then i decided to stay here. What i found is the complete opposite from the bad comment i read in here. they are changing now. The location is near to everywhere. short distance to shopping center and clubs which is i like so much.The breakfast is excelent, there are many variety available and its really good. The sunken bar is absolutely beautifull. Friendly and charming staff deliver a good service to us. Room are clean and tidy, they just change all the television with flat screen tv. The building may look old however it feels like to stay in truly balinese hotel. unlike the most hotel now that adopt modern way but lack of touch of balinese style. The next visit to bali, i will staying again ini this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
636,"Worse hotel, rip off: stay away",10,August 2013,"I stayed at this awful hotel 8 nights, from 16 to 24th August 2013. It was not cheap (145us dollars per night). Very disappointing, the room was not clean, really old and uncomfortable, it was infested by Mosquitos, I was severely bitten, when I complained, the staff just provided me with Mosquitos spray. On the 3rd night, the bed sheets had blood marks all over, when I called to ask them changed I was told there was no cleaners available.
Before booking this hotel, I read the reviews on trip-advisor, I wonder if people who have stayed at this hotel have stayed in other hotel in Bali, it was my fourth time in Bali and I have stayed in much much better hotels at cheaper price. It also says that the hotel is in seminyak, which is not true as it is located in Legian.
The breakfast was simply disgusting, with not even orange juice...and I was charged for water.
When it come to ordering a taxi, the staff would lie and say the road is closed, making me walk to the main road, in fact the road was not closed.
Staff were rude and unhelpful, there is absolutely no security in the hotel, anyone can walk in, which is very unusual for Bali, this made me feel really unsafe.
I wanted to changed hotel on second day, but staff pretended they did not understand, so to avoid more frustration and argument, I just decided to stay and spent all my time outside the hotel, which was not so relaxing.

In summary, this hotel is not worth 145 US dollars a night, if you want to spend that amount of money, book somewhere else as you may end up extremely disappointed.",Puri Saron Seminyak
637,excellent hotel ocean view,50,August 2013,"excellent hotel in front of the ocean, clean and cosy. the service is very good and there is an italian bar where you can eat fresh food while sunbathing in the swimminpool!the pool has also a sunk bar where you can drink tastefull fruit juices and cocktail ginger based.",Puri Saron Seminyak
638,Great for teen/twenty year olds.,40,September 2012,"Beautiful grounds, and staff. Food was lovely, breakfasts were unbelievable. Service was second to none. Even after renovations the rooms are a little 'dirty' with marked walls and unclean bathrooms but, where comfortable overall. The pool bar was fantastic. The only complaint I really have is the lack of control security appeared to have over obnoxious, rude, drunk and rowdy young tourists that affected other peoples stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
639,Go elsewhere,20,August 2013,"Extremely slow checking in and reception was not busy either so no excuses. Unhelpful staff when we wanted them to ring for taxi's. I was told to go out on the street and get myself.
One room for my clients very quickly flooded with sewerage. My room's A/C unit continually drips water so there was a lake of water on the room floor - poor maintenance on the A/C unit I suspect
Rooms are tired and unappealing. The place should be demolished and rebuilt - IMO
Dissapointing way to end our tour in Bali",Puri Saron Seminyak
640,Good budget hotel but could be better,30,August 2013,"We picked this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel we could find near to Sengiggi. Overall the hotel was good value, although there were a few things which were frustrating but as it was so cheap this is to be expected. The hotel has lovely grounds, friendly staff and a nice large pool with lots of sunbeds. Location is ok, literally on the beach but not a very nice part of the beach, we walked into Senggigi (15 min walk) or got a taxi (5 min drive around 7500 Rupiah) to Senggigi beach as it was a bit nicer.

Hotel states it has a gym on its website but it does not have one.

Several things we felt could be improved with minor cost/difficulty:
- Restaurant is expensive particularly drinks so avoided it and ate in Senggigi town instead.
- Breakfast is very basic, mostly Indonesian rice/noodles. There was white bread for toast and a few pastries. Pancakes were offered on alternate days to fried banana. Would be better if cereal was offered. The waitresses insisted that they cook the toast for you, which despite them trying to be helpful, was really annoying because it was never cooked to how we preferred it. It just meant they brought it to our table only for us to have to go back and ask for it to be toasted more or one side was not cooked etc.
- Internet is only available in lobby or restaurant although it was too slow or didn‚Äôt work in the restaurant so was only any use in the lobby. Would be much better if it worked in the rooms.
- Rooms are good for the price (we stayed in a Deluxe room), they are old but have a charming feel, they are clean and the bed is comfortable.
- Free shuttle bus every two hours throughout the day to Senggigi town (5 min drive) was really useful.
Would recommend to people looking for a budget hotel in Senggigi.",Puri Saron Seminyak
641,First stay in Saron,40,August 2013,"I am sitting on the balcony of our chalet/bungalow and it is the last day of our visit to Seminyak. The breeze is wafting by and it's lovely and cool and very quiet and I don't think I want to go back to cold Aussie weather.
Our stay here has been very pleasant- the first one to Seminyak ( as we normally stay in Sanur) and wasn't sure what to expect after reading mixed reviews.
Room has been adequate and clean and only minor issue has been leaking aircon dripping onto floorboards which woke us up a couple of nights.
Buffet breakfasts have been lovely. For those who have stated that they have been sub standard, from Aug 1st the menu has changed and now a lot more variety- plenty to fill up on in the mornings.
Good shopping and nice restaurants close by and you can spend as much as you like here but have found even though still reasonable by Australian standards, it is much more expensive on this side of the island.
All in all would recommend Puri Saron.",Puri Saron Seminyak
642,Could be better,20,August 2013,"The hotel had some troubles fullfilling our expectations right from the beginning. They sell two diffent room types in the internet - one of them a ""de luxe bungalow chalet"". Well it is actually a thight row of two stories houses with four rooms in each ""chalet"". Hard to see the diffenrence from the rest of the hotel and basically the diffence seems to be higher bed posts and a mosquito net ? Do not expect a private free standing house. Choose a room with garden view, it¬¥s a cosy garden with direct access to the Beach.

We arrived at 3 pm, but our check -in was initially delayed to 7 pm and actually not finished untill quater to eight. We where offered some other rooms with a less attractive view. Lousy service or lack of the same.

Right next door is a contruction site, but don¬¥t worry, not much activty is going on, and they do not start until 9. The staff has probably allready woken you up by sweeping the ailes with stiff brooms or noisy carts at 7 am. The whole hotel could need complete overhaul. Everything is worn out from furniture to grey towels and bedlinen, brown ""shadows"" on all porcelain. I know nothing in Asia is spotless, but this is significantly more worn out than our eight other hotels with same rating. Even though we found it at third of the Price as a last minute offer, It¬¥s not worth the Money. A rating of two ""dots"" for the garden and location at the Beach.

About the area, I must for once disagree with LP guide which is calling Seminyak exclusive and hyping it compared to eg. Kuta. I can¬¥t find it - but found a messy fragmented area with a distinct smell of sewers. We transitted in Kuta a couple of weeks ago a that was far less worse than it¬¥s rumour. Everything is a your doorstep in Kuta.",Puri Saron Seminyak
643,Friendliest staff and perfect location,40,July 2013,"Just got back from my second stay at Puri Saron. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The hotel pool, pool bar, restaurant and gardens are fantastic. Located right on the beach with an amazing view of the sunsets. We stayed in a garden bungalow which was just perfect.
The rooms are a little dated but the beds are really comfortable and besides you don't go on holiday to stay in your room all day. The hotel facilities are great and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.
I love Puri Saron and highly recommend it, I'll definitely be going back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
644,"Great pool, good value, but not luxurious.",40,July 2013,"i stayed in this hotel with my husband and son, and another family.

Location is terrific, right in Seminyak and on the beach front. The pool is lovely, really big with a deep area for playing and a swim up bar.
There are plenty of shady sunlounges. Lounging on one of the sunlounges looking over the beach in the shade of a huge tree, with a gentle breeze blowing off the ocean was great.
There is a handy pizza place near the pool, with delicious pizza, although rather over priced by Bali standards.

The room (2107) was clean and adequate and quite spacious, but by no means luxurious. The decor is old. There is an inroom safe. At night the room was lit by 2 feeble lights only, so bring a torch, or use that handy light app on your iphone. Our room faced outwards and the balcony had a view of a building site which was not very inviting. However, it meant that we did not get any noise from the walkways or pool. The beds were clean and comfortable.
The shower was hot and strong, but flooded the bathroom every time we used it, and the towels were old and tired.

The staff were polite and helpful, and we paid about $100 a night for a triple room, so overall we were satisfied.",Puri Saron Seminyak
645,brilliant location- great value,40,June 2013,"I stayed here in June for 11 nights with 2 girlfriends. You simply can't beat the location - right opposite the beach, and you also can't beat it's value for money. It's the best value hotel in Seminyak right near the beach. Our room had 2 single beds and 1 fold-out bed which was fine, as we were hardly in our room. It was always clean and sheets were changed daily. Our room was in the best part of the hotel. We had a ground floor garden room with a nice balcony near the pool. It was away from the reception area. There are very noisy building works going on at the front of the hotel, so best to keep away from there. The breakfast was ok, but a bit more variety would be good. The swimming pool with it's lovely swim-up bar was superb. Overall, excellent value, very pleasant staff, close to shops, restaurants etc, but far enough away so you don't hear any noise. A very relaxing place to stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
646,"Affordable hotel @ Seminyak, Bali",30,June 2013,"Puri Saron Hotel is located at the Seminyak Beach west Bali.We paid about $ 90 for a night, and got a garden view room with Balcony.This hotel is a 4 star ,and the most affordable in Seminyak area.The hotel building, room ,garden and lobby looked old ,maybe dated to the 80's.But we find our room quite spacious ,i think they just renovate our room, so the paint odour was still there.But its ok for us , because we spend a lot of time outside.The hotel has a nice swimming pool with in pool bar, can sit while zipping your cocktail.Children friendly pool , the beach is located few steps away from this pool.Not too crowded, can swim and play on this beach.Staffs and front desk are ok, attentive.Breakfast has not too many choices, but still ok.Value for money is a bit hanging by the thread , but i can say still quite acceptable.",Puri Saron Seminyak
647,"Comfortably dated, best value, right on the beach!",40,June 2013,"Stayed at this hotel last week with hubby and 2 boys- there is building activity on either side of the hotel at the moment - but we were out and about or by the pool/beach so it did not affect us..

This hotel is all about location, location, location ...it is a hidden gem perfect for those who just want to get down to basics and have a great 'value for money"" holiday right on the beach. Staff are warm, professional and caring - they helped with queries and organized tours for us. We stayed in a modest rear end room and found the facilities fine for our needs - the air-conditioned rooms had comfortable beds, were thoroughly cleaned and tidied each day and had a balcony for us to put all our surfing and swimming gear to dry. Next time I would like to try the bungalows close to the pool! The spa facilities offering massages etc were a bonus too.

The ""Champlung"" restaurant on the beach right in front of the hotel offered different entertainment each night and the food was tasty and the best priced of all the beachfront restaurants. The upmarket ""Cocoon"" restaurant and bar is a 5 minute stroll away. Breakfasts are okay - need to offer more variety ie offering muesli and flavoured kids yoghurts would be ideal - but otherwise it was fine. Pool was clean -""has a sunken bar"" and if taking kids I would suggest bringing new pool noodles, beach balls and donating them to the hotel. The gardens are treed, have a small play area and offer running around space for kids. Our room had a combined bath/shower (bath too small for adult to lie comfortably in) but had a small closet, TV, wifi access, fridge, kettle, cups, coffee and tea. The hotel provides new bottles of water daily - but the minimarts along the beachfront offer more affordable and larger bottles.

Great shopping, restaurants and if interested ...Tip for mom's - Tommy's leather handbag shop is a 20 - 30 minute walk away (if you walk along the beachfront!!)",Puri Saron Seminyak
648,Great location,40,June 2013,Staff at this hotel can not do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble . breakfast is ok. Location on the beach is great .Close to many good restaurants in seminyak this was are second stay here and will definitely be going back great value for money.We stayed in a bungalow for two weeks and could have stayed longer,Puri Saron Seminyak
649,Dated..but quite a pleasant stay and good value,30,June 2013,"We Booked 2 deluxe bedrooms for 4 adults, 1 toddler and a baby
Once we got there.. well.. the front of the hotel is not very appealing, you can instantly see a ""dated hotel"" just by looking at the front.. Didn't got the chance to take a photo of the front..
this hotel might be in their glory days back in the 90's...

BOOKING
I booked the hotel through contacting by email and got a quick response, made the arrangements then secure the booking by sending my credit card infos

CHECKING IN
By the time we checked in, we got free room upgrade to Bungalows (aw yeah...)
check in was quick, only one room is ready, and the other one is also ready after half an hour wait

ENVIRONMENT
its a garden hotel, quite clean.. beware of the annoying musquitos, we got our bungalows near the pool and just few steps to the beach.
The beach is nice.. and the famous ""La Plancha"" is just few steps from the hotel-beach access
Staffs are really nice and very quick response also
one of our bungalow's AC is not cool enough, so the hotel sends a technician immediately and fix the problem

The pool is clean..

SERVICES
we got a complimentary welcome drink by the pool, and free 10-minutes massage
Breakfast... i'd give a 3 out of 10.. very limited selection.. the staffs are hiding all the good stuffs such as bacons etc.. seriously they could do a lot better than this
coffee is a no no...(good thing I brought my own coffee and make my own in my room)
long queues for getting the eggs (omelette, scrambled etc)
not a good breakfast, simply just to fill our stomach

oh yeah.. the room is equiped with an Umbrella.. we didn't know that.. at one night we return to our hotel and its raining a bit, we cannot go to our rooms and the front desk ran out of umbrellas..
so we got a bit wet walking back to our rooms

GOING TO THIS HOTEL
its very simple.. you go to Jalan Legian towards seminyak, turn left at Camplung Tanduk and turn left once you see Grandmas Hotel ..
the road is not jammed pack like Double Six.. so its easy to maneuver your car/motorcycle here

OVERALL
its not that great hotel, but still a decent place to stay.. rates are quite low compared to the other beachfront hotels.. the surrounding hotels are a lot cheaper.. but we would like to have a beachfront hotel once in a while and still on a budget",Puri Saron Seminyak
650,Happy holidays,40,September 2012,"We have stayed at this hotel twice now, albeit lovely & the staff wonderful, needed alot of work but the 2nd time it was worse. Great location, walking distance to great shopping & great restaurants, hive of activity on the beach out the back with lots of entertainment at night. Not going back this time but will check it out to see if it has been cleaned up & repaired where needed",Puri Saron Seminyak
651,Put a downer on our holiday,10,April 2013,"First impressions weren't good to begin with... The hotel is located off a side street and the front was not very appealing, but don't judge a book by its cover I thought to myself. That was until we got to our room! Not very nice at all. Definitely not like their web photos!
We were a family of 3 staying, our child only 7 months old. We were given 2 single beds and a cot tapped up with duct tape. Our first night I was woken by a noise in our room, it turned out to be a mouse which we trapped in the bin and took to reception. Reception just laughed at my husband when he mentioned a discount:-/
The bathroom was horrible, it did not function, the shower head is placed in a ridiculous spot! The whole of the bathroom floor ends up soaked!
We had purchased this holiday as a package and paid in full, so we were unable to leave. If it was possible we would have checked out after the first night!",Puri Saron Seminyak
652,great hotel,40,March 2013,I stayed at this property for 13 nights in Feb 13. Great hotel and location on the beach. Exellent staff and good value for money. The property is one of the last Balinees hotels left and is a little run down however I was able to look through that as the hole package was good for us. great pool and bar.,Puri Saron Seminyak
653,Another Pleasant Stay,40,March 2013,"Stayed 10 nights again,march this time including Nyepi Day.
Could use a couple of $ on maintenance but otherwise no complaints.
Inexpensive,nice rooms-we had ground floor""bungalow"",good choice for breakfast.
Good location right on beach,nice pool and swim up bar.
Staff are all friendly.We had to stay in hotel grounds on Nyepi Day but that was no
problem,bar,restaurant and spa were all open.
We would stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
654,Suit me well,40,March 2013,"Hotel a bit dated in my friends opinion. However for me worked very well. Next to beach with good swimming pool and general facilities. Stayed in bungaloves on ground floor. Lizards did not bother me, but if anyone is not animal friendly - why bother to go to Indonesia? Gennerally good priced well located in Seminyak which is for people not for machines to make money on as it is in Kuta. Recommended for general impression and nice relaxend time spend just before sezon to kick off.",Puri Saron Seminyak
655,COMFORTABLE CHEAP ACCOM,30,March 2013,"Puri Saron is in need of a bit of an upgrade but a fantastic cheap place to stay!
Location is perfect! Right behind the 'beanbag' restaurants on the beach. Walking distance to Potatoe Head etc.......
They could make it so much better by just getting new towels and sheets. They are all quite 'grey' and very well worn.
Bathrooms very tired but cleaned every day.
Breakfast was fine.
Pool area nice enough with great staff.
Gardens very green and Balinese.
If a cheap getaway is what you are after this place is perfect.",Puri Saron Seminyak
656,Not bad,30,March 2013,"It is an ok hotel..

Swim up bar is excellent, and due to the 30% occupancy at the moment, we have has the place pretty much to ourselves.

Its not the best hotel, not the worst..

The staff are ok, english seems a bit of a barrier at times

If you want a nice cheap hotel for a quick get away it would be for you... Probably not ideal for party goers",Puri Saron Seminyak
657,Great Location,30,February 2013,"Stayed here for 5 nights and got upgraded to a bungalow which was very clean and comfortable. This hotel is a bit tired but if you like somewhere traditional with friendly staff and good service then you can't go wrong with This one. Rooms are cleaned very thoroughly every day with clean sheets and towels. it looked like some rooms were being renovated as new furniture arrived during our stay. The pool area is nice and relaxing. There is building work going on next door, but you could not hear it from the pool. The location is great for eating out either at the beach which is fabulous at night with cool bars which all sell good food at reasonable prices. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to walk into Seminyak for plenty of bars and restaurants. All in all a very enjoyable stay and we would stay here again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
658,Warm friendly and welcoming,40,May 2012,"Stayed here by myself for 7 nights May 2012. Staff were very friendly, food was great, pool service awesome. Loved my room. Super clean. Pool area and bathrooms could have been cleaner. For the price I was happy and would stay again. Loved being right on the beach. Met lots of awesome people from all over the world. Place was busy but not over crowded",Puri Saron Seminyak
659,Not bad,30,March 2013,"Place is ok, quite run down, pool was dirty and very run down hard to relax when its like this, close to the beach and not far from kuta! If you want a cheap stay this place is good, if you want a relaxful place stay somewhere more upperclass",Puri Saron Seminyak
660,Dissapointment,20,February 2013,"There is always be a time to experience bad hotel's service.
But for the first time in my life after staying in many difference hotels & resorts around the world, i cannot book a taxi from this hotel.
When i approached the reception, the gentleman told be that i am not allowed to book a taxi from the hotel, so I must book their appointed transportation which cost double than a taxi.
To get a taxi you literaly need to walk at least 100m without having any employee from the hotel assisting you.

For sure this is gonna be my last visit to putri sarong. As a hotelier if I can make a suggestion,please ensure you notify your customer about this. So they know what to expect from your service.

With all my respect,

Your unsatisfy customer!",Puri Saron Seminyak
661,Cleanliness needs to be tought to staff,20,February 2013,"Overall the stay at the hotel was ok, except that we did not feel comfortable with regards to the cleanliness. At all places (rooms, restaurants, pool, etc.) staff did only the utmost necessary while in general the impression was not too pleasant. The bathrooms, especially behind the toilets, seemed never to be cleaned and in the rooms the staff just mob once with a water that is black already when they enter the room (seems to be one pale of water per day only).
Very positive is the friendly atmosphere of the staff. They like to smile and chat to each other (if it must be occasionally also to guests) and they pretend to be helpful, which rather regularly will not get put into action.
It would be helpful for the hotel to invest both in maintenance as well as professional training. The good location alone is not a guarantee for ongoing success. I will for sure select another place for my next visit to Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
662,Great beach location,40,February 2013,"Good location, in front of to the beach and very close to the restaurants. The hotel is a bit tired, but not a big deal. Good pool. The restaurant serves a very good nasi goreng. Nice breakfast and friendly staff. Good for cuples or families.",Puri Saron Seminyak
663,Perfect Weekend Getaway,50,February 2013,"My friend and I are so satisfied with the Pool villa that we stayed. It is clean and quiet. It is a perfect place for relaxation. We stayed at the 1 Bedroom Pool villa that was located in front of hotel restaurant. The room is facing to the pool.
The hotel location is so strategic, it is in front of double six beach where all the beach bars are located for example Champlung that is located in front of Puri Sharon.
In addition, All the staffs were so helpful, friendly and nice.",Puri Saron Seminyak
664,Nice but needs a some TLC,30,February 2013,"Stayed for 7 nights, overall really happy and we like this area of Seminyak.
I would say it does need a bit of an upgrade in places, mostly the pool needs a good scrub on the bottom, edges and statues. The pool water is very warm and sometimes not that refreshing. Pool bar good but as always a bit pricey after adding service and tax.
The room was great, comfy bed (not to hard!), spacious bathroom, safety deposit box, good shower and A/C!
Breakfast in the restaurant was good, generally the same each day but substantial, coffee was really good, but disappointed that people are allowed to smoke while people are eating!!
Staff very friendly and helpful with any issues we had.
I just wish hotels would realise that if they made their spa prices more reasonable people would use them more!!!!!!!!!!! I would much rather that than not have to wander out to other spas.
The pizza place at the front of the hotel makes fantastic pizza, a must to try.
Overall really great place to stay!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
665,Home Thats Where It Is,50,September 2012,My family and I had an awesome stay at Puri Saron Seminyak. It was awesome. We had a two bedroom villa. And the rooms are totally nice with our own pool. The common pool was awesome too. The staffs are all super friendly and they were so accomodating. Its so near to the beach and I can even hear the sound of the waves. Breakfast was super nice. Thank you everyone at Puri Saron :),Puri Saron Seminyak
666,Great location,40,September 2012,"Went here last September 2012 Found this Place a bit of a mixed bag the best parts were the location across from the beach,yummy affordable beach restaurants to eat at you dont need to do the Jimbaran Bay seafood thing ""Was a big Rip anyway"" kool bean bag beach bars to sit at of a night,Our twin room was ok comfy beds,bathroom fine,room cleaned everyday,I personaly loved the breakfast and found it one of the best things about the hotel.The pizza restaurant near the pool was the best room service food ok but we ate out everynight. Pool bar was the best as was the fabulous pool we spent nearly everyday at the pool,found the staff to be nice but was a bit of a problem getting correct directions but you can work it out just ask your fellow travellers. We found this hotel to be a bit far out from everything so either walked forever or took taxi's.If your not very fussy and want to relax and stay away from all the action this hotel will be fine and price wise for on the beach its not bad just not a 4/5 star more a 3 star i would stay here again but i like to check out other places as there is so much to choose from. Our room was a deluxe bottom floor looking out to the garden. PS They let us use the spa room on checkout day as we were unable to get late checkout and had to be out of room at 12.00PM",Puri Saron Seminyak
667,Best place to stay,50,February 2013,"we have a great time during our stay here. spacious room with garden view, linen and towel changed daily. a short walk to bars and restaurant. its only take like 30 minutes walk to kuta beach instead of a hour by taxi. staff were friendly and attentive during our stay here. feel like 5 star service even though its only 4 star hotel. the breakfast is okay, with a good selection of food. i will back again!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
668,Good Enough,40,January 2013,"3 family groups arrived to find the rooms not what was requested, after sorting this we were all very happy with the bungalow rooms we were upgraded to. Spacious bathroom, linen and towels all changed daily, ours were always clean and white. We enjoyed the balcony areas with table and chairs. Staff were very friendly and helpful especially ""Gidday""who remembered all our names. Staff/management left a lovely birthday cake and printed message on my birthday. Breakfast was good with lots of choices. Great pool with lots of day beds, always clean as were the gardens. Great location on the beach where there is lots of activity, turn left and short stroll to some great, not expensive restaurants. Out the front of the hotel turn left and another short stroll to the corner for taxis. We did not expect a 5 star hotel for the price we paid, therefore we were not disappointed. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would return to a second floor, garden view bungalow.",Puri Saron Seminyak
669,Great location,50,January 2013,"When I first arrived I was a bit unsure about this place. But, after spending the last ten nights here I am rapt we stayed here. The location is great, right on the beach with a short walk to legian. Great warungs to eat at on the beach all within 200m of the hotel. The room we had, a bungalow, housed our family of 2 adults and one 3 year old and one 2 year old. Room was possibly a bit tight as we had wo cots in with us but we didn't spend much time in our room anyway. Huge bathroom and very comfy bed. Staff were always helpful. Great pool with kids area with a few pool toys for the kids to play with. The playground was the only real let down but all it needs is a few new bits of equipment to fix this issue. Probably not four star but a three and a half star. If you want a hotel in a great location with a super pool and swim up bar, I couldn't recommend this more highly.",Puri Saron Seminyak
670,"Dont ever think, to stay here",10,December 2012,"This place is a big mess !!
Dirty, so many bugs, a lot of mosquito , the staff is not well train, and very very slow respond to anything ..... Even in their ""new"" room ..... Its very dirty, and smell very bad .... So just forget it",Puri Saron Seminyak
671,Staff made our stay,40,January 2013,"We enjoyed our stay here and only really used it as a base, due to being out and about so much. Found it a bit pricey overall, but it is beachfront in Seminyak.

Position - right on the beach, approx 10-15 min walk to Jalan Legian and a 30,000 bike to the Seminyak night club area (too far to walk).

Rooms - Comfortable and clean. It is probably struggling to be 4 star (we stayed in a standard hotel room) but it was suitable for us nonetheless.

Facilities - pool was awesome, so big and the pool bar was super handy, if a little overpriced. Unfortunately for us, 3 of our 4 days here it was blowing a gale straight in from the beach so the pool was unpleasant to be near with sand blasting you if you went anywhere near it. The gardens are beautiful that roll through the hotel.

Restaurant/Food - breakfast was very good, subtle variations to the menu each day were good. We didn't eat dinner here, just ordered one lunch for room service was was OK.

Staff - they were excellent. We had a hiccup with our travel arrangements elsewhere and they assist us sort it out, were super helpful.

Extras - we booked a car and driver for day through the hotel to Ubud and he (Katut) was awesome. Their airport pick up was prompt and easy to see.",Puri Saron Seminyak
672,Location and Pool!,40,December 2012,"We knew this wasn't a five star hotel coming into our stay so we were pleasantly surprised with our stay. As with other reviews, I can't say enough about the great location and the great pool. Down a few steps and you are on the beach and the pool is big, deep, and has a swim up bar. Also, the hotel itself was nice. Our room was big and comfortable (a bit of a strange smell in the bathroom though). The grounds are well maintained and beautiful. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was average, but no complaints from us. There are not many dining options at the hotel itself except for a great little pizza place that opens in the afternoon, but there are plenty of restaurants on the beach and within walking distance. One thing to note is that there is construction happening next to the hotel so a day by the pool is not 100% peaceful, but it didn't bother us too much. If you want a five star location but don't mind not having the five star hotel to go with it, this is your place. I would stay here again for sure.",Puri Saron Seminyak
673,"Disappointed, expected better",30,January 2013,"Although this place was 4 star in the flight centre brochure and looks ok on the website, I found it to be rather dilapidated and tired looking. We had a bungalow, which is one of the better options and it was dark and dingy. Admittedly it was wet season and raining all the time, but this made the room gloomy. There are not enough lights and the furniture and curtains have stains on them. The towels are threadbare and not plentiful. I found it really depressing and moved to another hotel at my own expense. Having said that, the beds are comfortable, the tv also. The air con works well and the bathroom is large and the shower works well. Too bad about the sewerage smell emanating from the drain near the loo.
The pool area is good though. No complaints there. the breakfasts are Ok.
Overall, I dont think this place should be classed as four star, more like three.",Puri Saron Seminyak
674,Pool villa is a good option,40,January 2013,"The 2 bedroom pool villas are a good option if you can afford it as they are large, well appointed and very quiet and private.
The beds are big and comfortable with clean white linen. The pillows were soft. We had to request an extra bed for our son which after some negotiation was reduced to $20US a night. The negatives include poor water pressure and the shower head was clogged with scale which took us some time to clean out with a needle. The hot water is off and on resulting in really hot or really cold showers. We ordered a bowl of ice from room service and was surprised when they charged us 6000 rupiah !
The villa pool is great and very relaxing even when it is near cyclonic outside ( which it was for 3 days during our stay).
We recommend you keep the bathroom door closed at night as it is open to outside which results in a lot of mozzies coming in. Go and buy a can of insect spray and all is good ! The staff were friendly and attentive however the reception staff have some difficulty with the English language. Overall a reasonable stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
675,"Not what we expected, unfortunately",20,December 2012,"Pictures on website are deceiving. Checked-in and were told resturant was still open for another hour. Put our bags on room and walked to resturant. There were staff there but they said they're not serving anymore, ""go and get room service."" We saw a rat run across the floor on way to our room. Room was basic. Shower was terrible. The shower head pointed out of the bath and water went all over the floor. Room felt and smelt musty and wet. Needed to check out early for emergency and they made us pay for another night we didn't even stay there. Will not go near this place again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
676,"Fair hotel, rightly a 3.5 star!",30,December 2012,"We only stayed in this hotel for one evening as we need a break after our long journey.mwe originally had a normal small room, but I decided to upgrade to a Villa as the room was very small and felt clostraphobic. The villa was ok,must nothi magical. The bathroom and furniture was very tired, as was the whole resort,which looks a little past it's time. We stayed during peak December for the night, and the resort was basically empty. Should tell you something from the onset. May review would be that it is accurately a 3.5star, don't expect to much but good enough for a short stop. Biggest positive is its locatio to the beach, but we were thoroughly underwhelmed by the beaches in Kuta/Seminyak in general.",Puri Saron Seminyak
677,***Warning Jack Hammering***,20,January 2013,"We left here on Saturday (04/01/13), and the jack hammering has subsided the last 2 days, however this doesn't mean it has stopped. 11/13 days we had the jack hammer, xmas day included.

Rooms were average, toilet smelt like a sewer, rooms a bit musty. Staff were helpful, food was bad, pool was nice

I wouldn't recommend staying here if you can avoid it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
678,Perfect Location,40,December 2012,"After arriving to find we'd been given twin beds instead of a double No trouble reception could not have been more helpful and we got upgraded. The resort is clean the staff friendly and attentive. Walk out the front onto the beach or turn right and walk down the beach into Seminyak or turn left and walk into Legion or stop off at the many restaurants along the way.
If all you want to do is relax the pool bar or the surrounds are the perfect place",Puri Saron Seminyak
679,Depends on your expectations,30,December 2012,"Just had a marvellous week here but could also see some of the things that attract negative reviews. I think it‚Äôs Balinese owned so you aren't getting a standardised hotel operation like staying at a chain hotel. Whether you like the Puri Saron or not may depend on your expectations of a hotel and what room you book. It‚Äôs more of a lottery than other hotels may be. There are many bodgy things ‚Äì things that need fixing and wonky fittings. But you can‚Äôt beat the location right on Seminyak beach. And the hotel pool is gorgeous, spacious, not packed with people and has a fantastic pool bar. The staff are lovely and it‚Äôs a really friendly place. And try the small pizzeria (Warung Bola) overlooking the beach - best pizza I've had in years. We stayed in a pool villa. Villa Pros: Location! Not many pool villas are so close to the beach. The villa pools are a great size (maybe not for small kids or elderly people though ‚Äì super slippy tiles). The villas themselves are quite nice ‚Äì nothing luxurious; bedroom and bathroom but all very clean (including bedding etc). Villa Cons: overpriced compared with the cost and amenities of other Seminyak pool villas. Not-so-good aircon (leave it on all the time, it needs to be on for a long time to cool the room). And most unfortunately there is a big building site backing onto the villas. It‚Äôs not the fault of the hotel but there is a lot of jackhammering at the moment, plus a nightclub on the beach ‚Äì we only heard it one night out of 6 but the bass thumping was full on.",Puri Saron Seminyak
680,Lots of Potential,30,December 2012,"At first were allocated a twin Deluxe room in a corridor where our two room were the only ones inhabited as all the others were being refurbished! After putting up with that and the bad toilet smells for 3 nights we negotiated with the Manager to be moved to a Garden View Bungalow which was much better. Bathroom huge and very nice. Hotel is in a great location and gardens lovely and staff friendly. It's just a shame about the construction noises going on at the sites either side. Jackhammering all day long. Swimming pool beautiful and breakfast good, beds very comfortable and good airconditioning.",Puri Saron Seminyak
681,Reasonable priced accommodation,40,December 2012,"Positives: stayed in ground level bungalow for 5 nights, good clean room, good aircon, very comfortable bed, extra large bathroom which was nice, nice sized pool with plenty of day beds, next to beach, good breakfast, friendly staff, beautiful gardens and well maintained.
Negatives: construction site next door with jack hammering, no taxi bookings from reception and needed to walk up street to get one. Aircon didn't work in massage room, we werent told beforehand and no warm water for milk bath, much nicer massage at Espace and better value for money.
Apart from the negatives mainly the noise from next door which is beyond their control we would be happy to stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
682,Greatly exceeded our expectations!!,50,November 2012,"My partner and I chose the Puri Saron Seminyak because it was a great location and looked like it had a great pool area, swim up bar and restaurant. Some of the reviews on here claimed that rooms were old, service was poor, grounds were dirty etc. etc. but we went here anyway and all I cannot recommend it highly enough. Not only was the location fantastic and the pool area just as great as we thought, everything else was excellent as well. The room had everything we needed, air con, flat screen with plenty of english channels, big bath tub with shower over, in room safe and lovely balcony overlooking the gardens. It was not dirty, nor were the towels grey and crusty as some reviews claimed. We got given fresh towels every time we went down to the pool and the staff waited on us hand and foot. The breakfast was never the same (some mornings pancakes, others french toast, different types of potato and sausage each morning, and the eggs were cooked however you wanted right in front of you, including an omlette if you wanted). I will definitely go back here and for the price I think it is the best you will find. Walkable to the beach and the main drag in seminyak. $1 cab ride to the famous eat street, $2 cab ride into legian and only $4 into kuta and waterbom park. walk is about 20 minutes to legian but plenty to see and shop for on the way.
In summary, if you go there expecting the Hilton or the Westin then yes you will be dissapointed cause it's definitely not a 5 star hotel but it is definitely better than a lot of reviews make out on here and if you want an affordable, well positioned hotel with fantastic staff and service and lovely surroundings and an amazing pool then stay here!",Puri Saron Seminyak
683,Family getaway.,40,November 2012,"I went on this holiday with my 13 year old and a 12 year old, the 3 of us stayed together in one room (our choice) and had a great relaxing holiday. The hotel is right on the beach where we were able to hire surfboards, boogie boards and get surf lessons.
The staff at Puri Saron can not be faulted, they were kind and friendly & even prepared my daughter a birthday cake.
This hotel is great value with incredibly well maintained gardens, air con & rooms cleaned daily. For a family holiday Puri Saron offered value for money. I would return with my children.",Puri Saron Seminyak
684,Reasonable accommodation in Seminyak,40,April 2012,"Reasonably priced and nice rooms. Great location with the motel grounds backing onto the beach where there are bars, restaurants and bands. Lovely relaxing 5 days. Breakfast was good but boring after a couple of days. Could do with a switchup from the same eggs each day. Forget good coffee, you won't find it there. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and nightlife in Seminyak. The pizza bar down the back had good food and all meals can be delivered via the swim up bar while you relax in a cabana next to the pool.
Don't make the mistake of using one of the hotel staff as a guide on his days off. You will end up paying for all his meals and drinks and then be expected to pay for his time as well. This more than doubled our expenses and he was hard to get rid of. He'd wait for us each day offering to take us places and/or accompany us wherever we were going if we didn't need his service. He even added his cigarettes to my shopping in the local shopping mart. It was a trap that we weren't aware of and this is how they make extra money as the wages are quite low. But they will engratiate themselves, tell you that you are like family to them, hug and kiss you and try to wheedle food, drinks and gifts from you. If you are sharing a guide between a big group then this expense isn't so bad, but as we were a couple having a third wheel with us that we also had to pay for was a nuisance. We ended up hiring a scooter ourselves and going where we wanted to to get rid of this guide. He waited outside the hotel on the day we were leaving to say goodbye and there was an expectation of more money or gifts from him. I'm sure they do this to all the tourists, but just be aware!",Puri Saron Seminyak
685,Puri Saron Seminyak,40,October 2012,"Right on the beach at Seminyak, This hotel is inexpensive & not flash. However the grounds are lovely, the service great & the location can't be beaten.
Accommodation consists of deluxe rooms. Bungalows & villas. The bungalows cost a small amount more, but are the best value due to location, size & furnishings.
The pool is large & there are many good places to eat around the hotel.
You can watch the subset over the ocean from the pool without spending a fortune at places offering 'sunset drinks'.",Puri Saron Seminyak
686,Somewhat disappointing,30,November 2012,"Hotel is located in quiet street, but staff carpark is next to rooms and is noisy at all hours. Their deluxe rooms have recently been renovated, but are still of a poor quality - especially the shower over the bath. Do not stay on the 3rd floor as these rooms are very substandard and dirty. Bungalow is the equivalent of a standard room at other hotels. There are no DVD players in any of the rooms (reception requests $10AUD to hire per night) and 23 out of the 25 TV channels are in Indonesian, which is interesting considering that none of the guests are. Breakast was great, real pancakes, egg station, indonesian options, cereals etc, but be mindful that the hotel uses UHT milk throughout.
Staff are certainly very friendly and will cater to your requests. Swim up bar is well equipped and menu is extensive, especially for pool side. Hotel also has a pizza restaurant overlooking the beach. It's not a bad hotel, but you can definately get much better for your money - shop around!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
687,Not what I expected.,10,October 2012,"Do not disappoint yourself by going to this hotel. Music blaring until early hours of the morning. I kept on answering my door thinking their was someone knocking. That's how loud it was. ""Bom Bom Bom"". First night air- conditioner wasn't working. A very long walk to shops. Staff were not very helpful. I pretty sure they have become complacent by all the complaints. There are so many lovely hotels in Bali. Don't waste your holiday for this one.",Puri Saron Seminyak
688,"Disappointing, very noisy",10,October 2012,"Spent 7 days in Kuta and thought we would spend last 3 days in quiet(?) Seminyak. How wrong we were. First night a party at the beach which was very loud, luckily only went to 11pm. On night three there was another party on the beach, very loud techno music until 3.30am. Slept with head under pillow. Other family next to our room resorted to ear plugs. No lift in hotel and were unable to obtain a room on the ground floor for sister who had injured her leg. Staff were not very helpful. Hotel too far from shops. Very disappointing, not worth price.",Puri Saron Seminyak
689,Great Stay at a Marvellous Resort!,50,October 2012,"Spent 5 nights recently at the Puri Saron resort at Seminyak. An excellent 4 star hotel that is suitable for all ages and for singles or families. Relaxed surrounds, great location right on the beach in a good part of town, and outstanding service. Would definetely go back!

Strenths:
Hotel: Large hotel, leafy tropical surrounds.....very relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. The pool is sensational - cool bar and is very close to the beach. Spent most nights in the pool drinking beer and watching the sun set over the beach. Brilliant!
Service: Everyone was incredibly friendly... couldnt do enought for you! Really counts.
Location: Backs up right onto the beach and has two of the coolest bars/restuarnts in front (la plancha and the champlung). I guinely think it has the best spot on the whole beach strip! Close to everything.
Price: Booked through Asia rooms web site. Was $98 AUD per night with breakfast. I felt it was of very good value.

Weaknesses:
Room: My room wasnt as polished as i was hoping. Was a little dated and damaged sadly. Wasnt a big deal as most of my time was at the beach or in the pool.
Tour Desk: One of the days the Tour Desk was being looked after someone that could barely speak english and seemed not to know much about the tours avaialble. Dissappointed me a little as was seeking solid advice. Other days it was manned by staff that did know what they were doing however.",Puri Saron Seminyak
690,You get what you pay for,40,October 2012,"My partner & I after a long & tiring trip in other parts of Indonesia stayed here. We stayed in a Villa with private pool. Very nice in excellent condition & very clean. Large enough pool. bedroom was great with the largest comfortable bed. There was a separate dressing area. The large bathroom had separate shower as well as a bath. Two wash basins with sufficient shampoo, conditioner & soap. Only gripe was that the TV (also had DVD player) stations tuned out of existence apart from a couple. Usual problem in Indonesian hotels. Management needs to watch this. Close to good sized restaurant. Breakfast was good but like all buffet types can become somewhat boring however the fruit & meals were of high standard and there was always ample good quality bacon. The staff were remarkable. By end of day staff from front desk, restaurant, house keeping & gardeners were greeting us by name. Special thanks to Wiwik & Su Le in restaurant for the quality of service. Our coffee cups were never empty. Grounds well maintained. Pool was good size with swim up bar & after lunch large trees at western end provided welcome shade. I would suggest Management renovate spa rooms, they were grubby & run down. Leaving hotel beach side there are a number of warungs offering cheap good meals. Also at the beach end of hotel there is a place where one can get the most wonderful italian pizza and wonderful in large mugs run by Lombarto (not sure spelling)",Puri Saron Seminyak

692,Forget it.,20,October 2012,"A rip off for what I usually pay in Seminyak at other hotels. Old, run down, grubby bathrooms, unable to facilitate accommodation booking request due to over booking, average breakfast.....simply - well below average and over priced. Forget it! Better off staying next door at the Pelangi.",Puri Saron Seminyak
693,Puri Saron Seminyak,30,October 2012,"We have just returned from two weeks at this hotel my husband and I, with my daughter and husband. We had two deluxe chalets on the ground floor. We were hesitant about this booking after reading previous reviews. The rooms were old as this is one of a few of the old style bali hotels left, rooms were clean, air conditioning excellent except you do get a constant dripping sound, yes towels and sheets were greyish - but always smelt clean and fresh. Room had tv but only HBO and Aust news, if you want all channels or a dvd this is not available in room. The hotel is quiet there are no drunken loud guests here, which is fantastic. Buffet breakfast not the best - same everyday, staff inattentive, had to get own coffee, tea most days as they dont come to the table. Pool big, lots of chairs, but selfish people putting towels on chairs and not using going out until the afternoon, when complaining about that hotel doesnt do anything about it. Check in was efficient, check out wasnt, was asked to pay the entire accomodation costs again even though I had a receipt and it was paid for over a year ago. Most staff overall were friendly. Location is directly on the beach, there is a small pathway but beware motorcycles are allowed to travel here and they dont slow down. Didnt use the spa my daughter did and she said is was ok. We had our own bikes which we could park easily, you are within walking distance of most things. A shuttle service is available I believe but we didnt use it. If you like a bed of nails - this one has it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
694,"Great location,great value",50,September 2012,"puri Saron hotel did not disappoint,great value hotel right on Seminyak beach.The staff were wonderful.We were greeted with a welcome drink and a pizza ,lovely touch?The pool area is lovely .there you can order a good feed from the beachside grill or there is a great little bar over looking all the action on the beach especially in the evening.sit up at the bar enjoy a cold beer a pizza and people watch.The beach is lined with little bars that lay on great music,firewooks and light shows.(book if you want to have a good spot at sunset)We booked a delux bungalow which had every thing you need .lovely comfy bed large clean bathroom ,a/c TV and patio to sit out on.We were very lucky to get an up grade to the villas the next night which was a fantastic treat.private pool in its own pretty garden with alfresco area.The buffet breaki is a little limited to some people's taste but fine for us .There is eggs & bacon as well Bali breaki,pastries and fruit.plenty",Puri Saron Seminyak
695,Great Family Location,50,September 2012,"The older reviews of the hotel made us a little nervous about booking here, however its location to the beach and the look of the pool was what got it over the line eventually. Hence, we arrived expecting the hotel to be, as others have put it, a little tired but in a great location. After staying for 16 nights with our 10 month old, we would need some serious convincing to stay anywhere else around this area.

The Room.
We were given the ground floor of one of the 'bungalows' immediately next to the lobby. It was perfect for us as these rooms have high walls hiding private court yards, in which the baby could safely be 'let loose' while we read, had a meal and privately hung our clothes to dry. Yes, it wasn't a plush Hilton-esque room, however we found it completely satisfactory. Everything worked (although the front door was a little cumbersome) and the king bed was more than comfortable. I would recommend one of these rooms (ground floor with the private court yard between the lobby and the three story block) for anyone traveling with kids.

The pool.
Awesome. A really smartly designed pool able to facilitate all types of swimming abilities. It is actually what we miss the most. The sun lounges were fantastic and the areas design allowed for both full sun, part sun or full shade locations. The guys are the bar are happy for a chat but won't talk your ear off, allowing you to simply slide off your seat and have a swim between sips.

The Restaurant.
We only ate our included breakfasts as, admittedly, the restaurant menus were not the most imaginative. Breakfast was adequate however if you're staying for a while you will get tired of the mostly unchanging options day to day.

Other Facilities.
My wife had a massage which she loved. We had some dry cleaning done which was to expectations. The room service is quick. The free wifi is enough to allow Facebook updates and some news to be read, but could be improved.

The Location.
The restaurants along the beach are fantastic. And the ability to simply stroll from the hotel to out on the beach (watch for motorbikes) and watch the sunset before pulling up a bean bag next to a colour changing table for a beer or two just added another dimension to our daily options. Otherwise it was a nice wander up to the local shops for a meal or some shopping. It's a 5 minute taxi ride to 'Eat Street' and about 15 minutes to Kuta. Otherwise it about a 45 minute walk along the beach road.

The Staff.
Awesome. Helpful, attentive, cared about our wants without being intrusive. Having a baby undoubtedly helped also as the Balinese love kids.

Summing up.
Yes, the place could do with some really basic TLC and modernisation. But honestly, we would much rather have the conveniences and luxuries the Puri Saron offers than a neatly tucked away wire for the light over the bathroom mirror. If you expect the Hilton, you will be disappointed, If you expect basic comforts and some fun, you will be delighted.",Puri Saron Seminyak
696,Beach Front Location,30,September 2012,"I can really only echo the reviews of some of previous people who have stayed here. The location is great, with beach bars on the beach to watch the sunset. 10 minutes stroll along path to Legian where there are plenty of restaurants. We stayed on 2nd floor in the 3 floor block wing, facing the beach, althought could not see the beach from balcony due to trees. The rooms are really tired and need on TLC, however we had no complaints on cleanliness. The bungalows are actually 4 rooms in a block, 2 ground floor and 2 1st floor. They don't have as much privacy as there is no dividing wall between you and your neighbour, on the plus side there is no corridor as in the large block wing which can get noisy with people coming and going but not enought to cause us concern. The buffet breakfast was very nice with enough choice and the usual egg station. The staff we came in contact with were friendly and helpful. There was always spare sunlounges around the pool and the pool itself is a really good size. If you want to catch a taxi turn left from hotel entry and 5 minutes stroll to Jl Camplung Tanduk where there are blue taxis. Using hotel transport costs over 50% more than than the blue taxis. This hotel seems really popular with all ages and I would have rated it higher other than the fact it needs sprucing up.",Puri Saron Seminyak
697,Nice stayng ...,40,August 2012,"The resort is very very well located in Seminyak .
Infact some other resort are nicer but more inside.
This rated as 4 stars ,but i suggest a renovation and a creation of a fitness center .
The staff at the reception was nice and efficient ,not excellent .",Puri Saron Seminyak
698,"Tired, In need of upgrading, but location great and staff service excellent.",30,August 2012,"We've just got back from spending 10 days at Puri Saron. I have read some other reviews, and agree that the hotel is tired and dated. However we were on a budget and it was perfectly acceptable. What did impress me was the excellent, courteous service from the management. Upon checking into our room we weren't happy with the view overlooking the rear of the hotel and dustbin area, I made my feelings politely clear at reception and they moved us without any hesitation to a garden view room (this was what we asked for upon booking)

The hotel is in a superb location for the beach, but slightly disappointed to find that it did not have a private beach, and that sunbeds on the beach had to be hired at extra cost per day, however that wasn't a deal breaker.

Staff were all superb. Friendly and happy in their work, morale seemed good. We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast, which was fine.

It may be somewhat dated and tired, but it is extremely well kept, with staff constantly working on garden and grounds. Nice swimming pool and again, very clean. There was no gym or fitness area, and no spa but that didn't bother us.

If it was a choice of this hotel on the beach or a new place inland I'd go for the Puri Saron again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
699,Nice place to stay,40,July 2012,"Good hotel on the beach of Seminyak. Old rooms, but ok. Unfortunately we had a room with a view on a wall, next time we prefer a room with garden view.
Lot of big waves. The beach is very busy with a lot of nice bars/restaurants. The walking path along the beach has changed into a motorbike way and motorbike parking. When you walk there, be carefull.",Puri Saron Seminyak
700,"Friendly, nice spot, would stay again",40,August 2012,"Tired old hotel, but spotlessly clean, good welcome from reception, welcome drink (just juice), rooms tired but clean, bathroom wasn't really tired more like exhausted, but again, clean. Great beds, very comfortable and really perfectly adequate. Pool bar and plenty of seating in the big gardens, and, it's right on the beach, so only a quick walk to some of the more glamorous spots such as kudeta, potato head, w, etc... Excellent big breakfast buffet. It's nothing to write home about but I would stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
701,Clean Hotel,30,August 2012,"Lovely and friendly staff.
Location to the beach was great, literally 4 paces off the hotel property you were on the beach asking the sun bed supplier for a lounger.
Location isn't the best for nightlife, if your looking for busy surfer bar area, your better staying in the Kuta area, where you will find bars and nightlife aplenty. As the road leading off from this hotel has a few restaurants and bars, it's was generally very quiet. Apart from the 4 gay bars, which burst into life at night.
Rooms are clean but are very tired. But I have to say that the room we had was very very quiet. Pool area was ok with sunbeds usually available. Breakfast was usual fare, nothing fantastic.",Puri Saron Seminyak

708,Clean rooms and pleasant staff,30,June 2012,"We enjoyed our stay at Puri Saron but unfortunately we were given a twin room instead of a double and they couldn't change the room. The location is right on the beach which was very good, but it is a bit of a walk into Seminyak. The pool area was very nice and the gardens were immaculate. Unfortunately breakfast and the food from the restaurant was average at best.",Puri Saron Seminyak
709,Great spot,40,July 2012,"Really enjoyed the location with access to beach without being too crowded.
The Warongs on the beach were very cool and great value.
Look forward to going back",Puri Saron Seminyak
710,"Puri Saron was amazing, we would go back!!",40,August 2011,"We arrived and were met by helpful staff, every time we would walk past the staff, they would great us so that really made the service that bit extra! We were given a room near to the lobby but it was not to my standards, we asked to move to the next section closer to the restaurant & pool which they did the following day and we had a much nicer room, no complaints! The hotel is in a great location and the spa up the road is amazing, I had my nails done, beautiful couple massage & also it offers a hair salon. It is also near the Breezes hotel but I am so glad we booked this place as it was more personable than that hotel. We would go back there again with no arguments....enjoy it if you can. Oh and Pool bar for us was a must and it was amazing, we went there everyday and started at 11am lol",Puri Saron Seminyak
711,"Dirty, bug infestation and not safe",10,July 2012,"I had to change rooms 3 times because of either wrong room type (twin instead of double, when I had specifically requested double), or because of bug infestation. I had bugs coming up out of the bath plug hole and the drainage system. It was pretty disgusting. The bed sheets are grey and they smell. The rooms were pretty unclean, I found long hairs all over the floor in parts of the room as soon as I arrived. Location is in the beach yes, but surroundings are quite dire with dirt and debris all around that area of the beach. Not pretty at all. I was supposed to stay for 3 nights, but I checked out very early after one sleepless night. Oh, the TV didn't work in therooms and the napkins at the restaurant were very severly bobbled and looked like they were about 20years old! The pool area is nice, if you can get there early enough to reserve your spot. All un all a really uncomfortable and unclean hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
712,great location,40,June 2012,"one of the cheaper hotels but right on the beach and rubbing shoulders with lots of newer more expensive hotels.. Close to everything but very quiet at the hotel and the gardens,.Spa was pricey and not so good much better spa across the street and cheap! Rooms were clean, bathroom also bed abit hard but arn't they all. Daily free Shuttle to kuta was great. Buffet breakfast was really good. My son 29 and girlfriend thought it was a great stay. We would do so again and not change anything!",Puri Saron Seminyak
713,no party here!,30,June 2012,"Upon arrival i was pretty unimpressed.. it was not a terrible looking hotel just the photos on the website were clearly taken 30 years ago so i was expecting something new and beautiful. after a few days it really grew on me and to be fair it was clean and tidy and the people were lovely and the pool was well kept. and we had only paid a few bucks per night via an online booking discount. the hotel was right on the seminyak beach which was lovely, filled with bars and restaurants with bean bags that was pobably my favourite part. nice and close walk to the main shopping trip.
probably wouldnt stay tehre again but good value for money. also an older crowd, i went in a group of 4 girls in mid 20s and there was absolutely no party atmosphere but bars are only a few mins away",Puri Saron Seminyak
714,Puri Good,40,June 2012,Great location - renovations underway so upgraded to villa (fantastic) good value - great service - a very happy family,Puri Saron Seminyak
715,Oldie but good,40,May 2012,Stayed here before needs a bit of tender loving care but is in a great position and staff are great breakfast average but for the price ok renovations underway which will improve the standard living areas great pool area but running short of umberellas good eating cafes out front on beach which are cheap and handy,Puri Saron Seminyak
716,Good by Bali standards,30,January 2012,Upon arrival they had our room stuffed up (twin room instead of double) but made complaint and was told that it would all be sorted out the next day and because it was late we agreed. Next day they kept their word and were transferred to not only a double bed room but one of the deluxe style rooms so all up pretty happy good pool and bar and choice of CD's for pool side vibes. Well over eating omelettes for brekky tho lol !!,Puri Saron Seminyak
717,A stay to not repeat,20,March 2012,"Found this hotel online and thought it would be a nice stay for my first time here in Bali. However, the experience here was not as lovely as I had thought it would be. Although, the service was satisfying it felt as though the staff members didn't understand my requests.
The room was standard, nothing special. It had a horrible moldy wet stench in the bathroom, the paint on the wall behind the TV was falling apart from wetness because of the humidity. The bed linen were not very clean. It wasn't what I had been expecting with the price I was paying.
The breakfast buffet was disappointing, there were too many trainees and table set up was extremely close to each other. I felt somewhat claustrophobic having breakfast unless the tables in the more free area were available. The lunch and dinner menu was too large to look at, the club sandwich was somewhat average the mayonnaise used tasted quite foul, which after I remained in the bathroom for the rest of the afternoon.
At night I could hear the beating of the music from the clubs nearby on the beach.
The only thing that I would rave about is the location, it is close to the beach and there are some really nice restaurants on the strip. And if you are gay, this is the street for you! There are loads of gay clubs nearby that really put on a show for you.
Overall, not a very satisfying stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
718,Very nice place to stay in Seminyak,40,April 2012,"A nice resort, clean, good location, good service, great swim up bar and pool. My wife and I stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. My only negative would be it's a little bit tired but didn't effect our stay.",Puri Saron Seminyak
719,SUPER friendly,50,March 2012,"Check-in ~ easy, friendly.
Room ~ clean, fresh, bright. great value for money, lushious gardens outside
Breakfast ~ pretty standard but good choice, coffee was even hot and tasted not too bad!!
Staff ~ a true Balinese welcome, so friendly, nothing too much trouble, polite ALWAYS! EVERYONE!
Pool Area ~ awesome swim up bar... great music, relaxing vibe
Location ~ perfect, right on the beach, a stroll from restaurants, bars, clubs.
Don't miss!~ ~ Seminyak square ~( The junction ~ best nasi goreng, Groce & Grind awesome coffee), Home base beauty treatments salon ~ soo friendly and well regulated.... Benny's restaurant for dinner and trad dancing...
Will return !!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
720,Struggling between poor and average - Puri Saron,30,March 2012,"The Good - In Seminyak and if you don't mind the exercise, it is about a 10 minute walk to get to the main Seminyak street which has all the lovely and awesome boutiques and our favourite restaurant - Warung Made. AND Our room, 4115 - the air conditioning, worked a treat!
The staff were friendly - no real issues there. Slight communication issues, but I guess that is to be expected.
Free WIFI in certain areas of the hotel
Good cocktails by the pool

The not so good/bad - The rooms were small but if you are there for shopping and planning on spending very little time in your room, it was okay. The TV whilst working had limited channels and the remote - i think needed new batteries because after 2 nights, it failed us. The breakfast was passable with a small selection of western and asian choices. It was a staple of rice or noodles and cooked on demand eggs for the three of us in the room. The walk from the hotel to the main street - The street isn't well lit at night. Broken pavements along the way makes it for an adventurous walk. One of our friends had the misfortune of putting her foot thru a broken pavement, thus requiring stitches. Bed was hard and pillows very high. Bring your own pillow if you're a fussy sleeper.

The bad - The bathroom smelt mouldy, the bath towels and linen were stained. Grey, musty (did not smell freshly washed at all) and worn out. The toilet in 4115 (deluxe room) did not flush for 3 out of the 4 nights! We had to call them every day and somedays twice a day to get them to fix the problem. No taxi's readily available. You HAVE to walk about 5 minutes to the bigger streets. Hotel Taxi's - inflated prices. Limited phone reception and free WIFI only available in the lobby and hotel (not always working)

Overall, for a short girls trip where the intention was to have a BUDGET, shop, relax and eat kind of holiday, it was okay. We booked via bookings.com and with triple share it made the stay here bearable.

Would I go back again? NO, not to this hotel. I would look for somewhere else e.g the abundance of villas in the area.

The property is tired and unfortunately doesn't reflect the raising standards in accomodation in Bali. It certainly needs a revamp. A big one.",Puri Saron Seminyak
721,Not the best hotel at all.,20,February 2012,"Would not go back. Much nicer hotels for a similair price in the area.
The staff were'nt very friendly. And although the room was spacious, the bathroom was huge, and bed linen was clean. we had a dirty stain on our bench next to the basin when we checked inn that looked and smelt liked human poo. we alerted staff and they just cleaned it up. we tried explaining what it was, but the language barrier was too hard. could not wait to get out of there!!!!
In australia I would be furious, would have demanded my money back and made a complaint, but being in Bali we had no choice but to see the funny side of it.
The only good thing about the hotel is the location being right on the beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
722,We only dined here-and it was very good!,40,February 2012,"This laid back small restaurant is off the main street and pretty quiet as a result. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our extremely tasty, very nicely presented and inexpensive meal: We ordered fried rice, beef sate, duck steamed Balinese style, had four wines, one beer and very good service for less than $50 Aus. Ambience was good too, a few locals strolled in and enjoyed the evening, to us it felt good to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the main street.
A very enjoyable meal and evening!",Puri Saron Seminyak
723,Good location. Average rooms.,30,January 2012,"I booked this place because of its location and reasonable price (aus $100 a night). The room we stayed in had a nasty sewage smell coming from the bathroom, and the room overall looked very 'tired'. The air conditioning was very efficient. The staff were very friendly, with the reception staff making us a reservation for a nearby restaurant. The breakfast was acceptable, but nothing special. The pool was smallish but nice. My advice is don't book a hotel just because you think it would be nice to be near the beach. The beach itself is, in my opinion, quite dirty and full of rubbish. (at least in this spot).",Puri Saron Seminyak
724,on the beach,40,December 2011,Nice location on the beach. Nice pool area with lots of shade available. Free Wifi. Breakfast was included & was enjoyable. Staff helpful & friendly. Reasonable rates here but the rooms could do with an update & spraying for mosquitoes would be good..,Puri Saron Seminyak
725,Not coming back and not recommending,10,January 2012,"Location is the only upside of this hotel. If you're a surfer, this is a fab location.

We gambled a bit despite the reviews and sadly we proved the bad reviews right. We booked one of the bungalows and we were given a first floor room (4112). Due to some heavy rains, it leaked in the bathroom. It was wet and muddy all over (disgusting) and smelly too. When we went to complain, the staff did not emphatize at all and just casually gave us a new room which seemed to us that these kind of instances are normal there.

Breakfast was terrible, you cannot call for a metered taxi when all their own taxis are busy so you have to walk all the way to the main street, and the spa is beside the pool where the pool bar is playing David Guetta/LMFAO so its not relaxing at all to get a massage.

Pricey for the quality and service you get. If you don't mind all my complains, you can perhaps bear this hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
726,Seen better days,20,January 2012,"we stayed in the Puri saron for 4 nights it what seemed to be the main block. We where on the 3rd floor(there is no lift) which was a bit of a pain. The room was dark, musty and tired. we couldnt use the wardrobe as it made our clothes smell. The bathrooms smelt very badly all the time unlike anywhere else we stayed in Bali. The saving grace is the staff who are helpful and the pool area - though dont expect to relax with the bar men playing awful music very loudly most of the time from 8am. Average breakfast and okay location, a cheap taxi ride to the main bars and restaurants and la plancha in front of the hotel doing good cold beers. We stayed in a lot of places in Bali and this is the only one we felt the need to complain about. For my money this one is well overpriced - I have stayed in better rooms in most hostels for a lot less money.",Puri Saron Seminyak
727,AMAZING!!,50,December 2011,"My friend and I stayed there for 7 nights. We had an amazing time. The staff are so friendly, the breakfast delicious and it is right on the beach. There was never a day we didn't go to the pool bar and chill at the pool. You almost feel like you are the only ones there as it is really quiet however we always met people at the pool. You are close to markets and shops. The rooms nothing special but we weren't there to spend all day in the room. We will be back.",Puri Saron Seminyak
728,Great Stay,30,December 2011,"We stayed here from the 24th Dec for 2 weeks and found this hotel very typical for Bali after visiting the Island for the past 10 years. Probably more a Bali 3 star not 4.
We had a bungalow near the pool which was lovely. Definately recommend that. The room size was good and the bathroom quite large. Had been refurbished so was pleasant. The furnishings were sparse but adequate, no DVD player though. Bed was a very hard 4 poster. Linen changed daily and the towels were OK some even white and fluffy.
Internet access was good with wi-fi in the room.
Breakfast was very basic and not much change over the 2 weeks but from what I have seem quite typical in this price range in Bali. Dont expect Australian big variety breakfasts because you wont get it.
There was noise from the fire crackers but it didnt go on for long periods of time( besides New Years Eve) - Might bother some though. The noise from the local night club seemed louder on the Friday and Saturday night but didnt bother us any other night.
Outdoor seating furniture could do with revamping but you didnt have to fight for a pool lounge which was great.Overall a pleasant stay in an older style hotel.",Puri Saron Seminyak
729,terribly disappointing !,20,December 2011,"the only saving grace was the kind lady in sales - who extended our stay by two nights in peak season - thanks to the rescheduling goof ups by our airline.

we booked the hotel for the fact that it seemed to be on the beach and due to its location in chic seminyak.
perish the thought.

the lobby is dull and unwelcoming. completely lacking in energy and atmosphere. staff is hampered by their lack of fluency in english.

we had asked for a room with a view and were given one facing the offices. the option offered to us was on the second floor with no lifts - only staircase access and with a boring garden view which we refused.

the pool / restaurant were a good four minute walk away. the ocean is just beyond the pool but the beach is dirty and overflowing with local vendors. no private beach here.

hotel cleanliness and service left much to be desired.
we were horrified to return late evening to find our toilet overrun with dead locusts !!

the promised wi-fi did not work in the rooms and there was no mobile network connectivity - unless one stepped out of the room.

breakfast was boring and basic and we had ants for company everyday.

the height of cheapness was the charges they levied for internet usage and print outs !!

am sure there are better options in seminyak. take those. not this one.",Puri Saron Seminyak
730,A dreadful business hotel,30,December 2011,"A pretty average, past-its-prime beach hotel which, though superficially pretty, falls short of international standards. Mould in bathrooms around tiles, dripping taps, ill-fitting doors and peeling paint. Couple this with no wif-fi in rooms (and this in the 21st century catering to business people) , little sound-proofing so I had the dubious excitement of the noise of a drunken party of Australian women, and a knock on the door at 2am and the offer of a massage with a ""happy ending""! Disappointing breakfast, and a bland, tasteless dinner. Checked out after one night and moved to a hotel with in-room wifi. Very disappointing.",Puri Saron Seminyak
731,"dark, musty and shabby",10,December 2011,"booked into this hotel but only stayed one night even though we had paid for 4. The room was apalling, dark and dismal, musty smelling, cheap shabby furniture, stained lampshades. The linen was brownish and crumpled and had what looked like blood stains on it, this was changed, but I did'nt find out until I went to bed that the pillow absolutely stank. The bathroom although it looked clean was very shabby and when the light was switched on full of insects.
The grounds were unkempt and shabby.
Staff when we booked out were not bothered until we were actually leaving when the manager offered us a free upgrade, we declined the offer and moved to the next door hotel which was not much more expensive but wonderful.",Puri Saron Seminyak
732,"This is truly an awful, dirty, run-down hotel",10,December 2011,"Am currently staying at the Puri Saron hotel and really wish I wasn't. The hotel is really run down, outdated, grubby and simply not pleasant.
My room looks like it needs a good scrub and a lick of paint. Everything in the room looks dirty, especially the disgusting grey (formerly white) towels. The bathroom is tatty and is not really clean. The bath leaks water all over the floor. The furnitu looks beaten up and old.
There is only wifi in reception and bar/pool area. 
The pool area is unkempt and looks messy.
The only decent thing is the beachfront location... however, that simply does not make up for the rooms, which are also vastly over priced. Its only a bit better than some of the nicer homestays.",Puri Saron Seminyak
733,Stay somewhere else....they don't care!,10,December 2011,"Booked into the hotel, was put into a room not fit for humans...didnt sleep the first night,managed to get moved for an extra us$20.00 per night..Breakfast was ordinary and at best barely acceptable. Beds were old and dirty....and while staff were Bali beautiful...there was a clear message dont ask for help or complain, we dont care was the catch cry of the day. First and last time we will ever step foot into this hotel. We usally visit this wonderful island two times a year ...and I can honestly say.....don't even consider this hotel. The area is fab though with great restaurants and bars around the place.",Puri Saron Seminyak
734,Friendly staff but needs a serious revamp!,20,December 2011,"Im not usually one to complain but after staying there for 3nights in a musky smelling room was enough. Not to mention the toilet that didnt flush every morning and had to call maintaince about 3 times in 3days-not good! This hotel would be ok as a stop over and to be fair it's in a great location(backs right onto the beach). The staff were very nice, polite but the standard wasnt what i was hoping for and really put a downer on my stay in Seminyak. Ok if your a schoolie, backpacker but i think its probably overpriced for that market. Had an issue with the shuttle bus after in kuta shopping for the day didnt pick us up..waited around for 1/2hr so ended up paying for a taxi back to the hotel. My pillow on the first night was sooo smelly and just felt dusty, dirty and rundown.Ended up leaving very dissappointed as this was my first trip to Bali. On to Ubud which was amazing and definitely got my value for money in that Villa.",Puri Saron Seminyak
735,Not bad for a few nights,30,November 2011,"First time at this hotel, and probably wont be the last. Not for long stays but perhaps 5 nights maximum. Rooms are clean and are being renovated, wouldnt pay the extra for a deluxe room, the standard is fine.Close to beach, and the beers are much cheaper on the new ""bean bags"". Staff are very helpfull and friendly. Breakfast...a bit ""iffie""...not fans on the ceiling to keep the flies away. Overall not bad , not brilliant, but would stay again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
736,"Run-down rooms, but good location for budget travellers",30,December 2011,"Staying at Puri Saron Hotel was fine for one night, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is used to upmarket accommodation. It was disappointingly below my usual standards, but would be a good place if you are a backpacker type, or on a budget. The excellent location right on the beach and the very friendly staff made up for the general run-down feeling of the hotel. My room on the ground floor was old- it smelt musty, there were loads of mosquitos especially in the bathroom which was old (but clean) and poky, there was no main light in the room, and at night, dim lamps were all that were available to try and see in the room. I was very uninspired to spend any amount of time in the room. The buffet breakfast was mediocre. The gardens were nice to walk through, and the pool looked okay (I didn't swim in it). if you get what you pay for, then this hotel is probably at the quality you would expect for this price. Don't set your expectations too high, and if you are on a budget, then this is a good option close to the beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
737,Smelly and dirty,10,November 2011,"We had high hopes as we saw the rating on Trip Advisor sadly we were mistaken.

We asked for a non smoking room and when we entered the room it stunk of old stale cigarette smell.

The sheets had stains on them....

The walls had black marks on them showing the age of the place.

While the price was reasonable I'm sure there is better value for money elsewhere. Good luck with your stay. I did warn you!",Puri Saron Seminyak
738,Very good hotel for a fair price,40,November 2011,"Clean and very nice, great breakfast, in front of the beach and central but quiet location. Definitely recommendable!",Puri Saron Seminyak
739,Value,50,October 2011,"Just back from a few days at this Hotel. This is my second stay here and once again I cannot find much fault with it. The location is great and the Hotel itself, whilst not 5 star, is perfectly adequate for the average person. People will always find fault with something, however, you'll battle to find better value in Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
740,Best holiday!,40,October 2011,We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa! It was very nice had our own private pool. Rooms were extremely clean and the service was excellent! Pizza from the pool restaurant is delicious and breakfast is good to! Heaps of great restaurants just along the beach! The only bad thing is the noise from the music being played on the beach at night! Would definely stay here again!,Puri Saron Seminyak
741,Fabulous beach frontage - Back street location,40,October 2011,"Just returned from 30 days at the Puri Saron. This was our first visit to this hotel , we spend 2 months in Bali every year and have tried most of the Legian beach frontage hotels. We booked on line a Deluxe bungalow with garden view. The room reserved for us had a sewerage smell and we were immediately relocated to room 4211. Aside from a glitch in the aircon one night ( it was fixed straight away) this room was great - the bathroom was large with shower over bath, modern fittings and a large double wardrobe (very handy). Breakfasts are a major disappointment - same buffet foods every day, limited variety. We love to swim in the sea and walk along the shore so the direct beach access was a determining factor in selecting this hotel. On the beach are several restaurants that provide a variety, be warned, at night they scatter bean bags on the sand and attract customers with loud dico music. I am convinced they compete with each other by increasing volume output. This din goes on until late and on Fridays till 3 AM. Recommend ear plugs if you want a sound sleep. A shuttle takes you to Bemo corner (end of Legian) twice dailey. It is a 15 minute walk from there to Kuta square. Recommend you take the shuttle as the traffic in Legian is bumper to bumper all day and night. From the hotel to Bemo corner takes 45 min. The hotel is located in a back street and it is quite a walk to find decent restaurants and shops. We dicovered an excellent Italian restaurant ""Goodys"" on the beach road at Double 6, well worth a try. The Puri Saron offers fair value for money. We wont be going back as we have other hotels to discover'",Puri Saron Seminyak
742,Best thing about resort is proximity to beach and a great pool and pool bar!,30,October 2011,"Seminyak is just a lovely place to be - really chilled out, family friendly, slightly more upmarket with fancy restaurants like Cocoon and Gado Gado on the beach front. The best thing about Puri Saron is its location. It is just a stones throw from the rooms to their outdoor open restaurant, their fantastic pool and pool bar and best of all the back of the resort opens out to the gorgeous long stretch of beach and the ocean. You can hear rolling waves all the time. It is a 10 - 15min walk from the hotel to the lively main road full of shops, bars, restaurants and the gay nightclubs that have non-stop cabaret shows and thumping house music at the weekends! So it is far enough away to get your peace and quiet by the pool or the on the beach but you can access noisy fun when you choose. The hotel staff are friendly if a little clueless. They don't allow taxis to pull up their road and try to over charge you for their own drivers. I suggest you walk out the resort and hail your own cab [make sure they have a meter] to save heaps! The room itself was nothing to write home about. They are clean and sparse. The bathroom and the water stinks - not much we could do about that as there is a strange smell in all the running water [only drink bottled stuff if you want to stay well]. It was disappointing that they gave us twin beds pushed together and not a double as promised. They said they were full and could not change our rooms or do anything about the nasty smell from the loo. Nevermind. We spent most of our time on the beach. Beware the monotonous, unimaginative and poorly executed breakfasts they serve everyday. They import in papaya, pineapple and watermelons which are not native nor tasty and are the only 3 fruits you will see at the hotel. The sausages are made of processed matter that have never been near an animal and I promise you will get sick of eggs every which way how after a while! They do serve a good fried rice [Nasi Goreng] or noodles although I suspect it is all yesterdays leftovers revamped in a stir fry. Best places for lunch is the cheap wood fired pizza place next door on the beach called Champling [thin and crispy]. For dinner try the tapas at la Plancha [Spanish for 'the grill'] which is the coolest beach bar we found - it is on the right hand side as you exit the back of the hotel to get to the beach. Colourful bean bags, fairy lights and lanterns,cool music, stunning sunsets, cocktails and tapas - awesome! Then you can roll right back into the hotel to sleep it off!",Puri Saron Seminyak
743,"great before, a bit ordinary this time, wont go back",20,October 2011,"We have just returned from six days at the Puri Saron - last time we had a bungalow, this time in room 2102. We went with our adult daughter and two kids and our adult son. I booked three separate rooms but was a bit astounded to find that daughter and grandies had been given a connecting room - just keeping the door shut wouldve been offensive to daughter and grandies, and offense couldve been easily avoided if they had just given us each our own rooms... all the rooms were very grubby compared to last time - I wondered if we left money daily if our rooms wouldve been cleaned better, but they were grubby to begin with...I didnt want to be coerced into leaving money...Another factor - shower went all over the floor no matter how you put the inadequate shower curtain - I fell on wet floor and have a broken rib (GP and X-ray yesterday immediately after arrival home)... two towels for two people, given Bali's climate, two each a day more appropriate, very miserable with tea, coffee, creamer, two per room per day... and last time two bottles water free per day - nothing free this time... staff pleasant, food average, awful evaporated milk coffee for breakfast. I like the location of this because it is quiet and Seminyak Beach behind rather than a busy road - but the beach itself is littered with rubbish (many toothpaste tubes??) and there are multiple sewerage discharging streams at frequent intervals... I wouldnt stay at the Puri Saron again....",Puri Saron Seminyak

Reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area.",Puri Saron Seminyak
745,Everything we wanted...!,40,September 2011,"We had only booked our first night in Bali and decided to ""wing"" the rest. We wanted something on the beach, not too expensive and quiet. Puri Saron was all of these, we were lucky enough to get a room close to the pool and restaurant. It cost $125 per night which included breakfast.
Great pool and swim up bar, plenty of shade and pretty quiet compared to other resorts i the area. Fantastic location.
We will definately be back!",Puri Saron Seminyak
746,Excellent location at a reasonable price,40,September 2011,"I have just returned from my 3rd stay at Puri Saron Seminyak and for anyone who wants to know what I really think of this hotel, then read my first review in February 2010 ‚Ä¶ you simply can‚Äôt go wrong by staying there.

In the travel industry, a good indicator of a successful hotel is its occupancy rate. The night I checked in, the hotel had a rate of 104%. Yes, they had overbooked. Fortunately, I secured a (basic) room and needed to be moved the next day to the type of room I had originally booked. That was a Friday evening and after the weekend they were running at about 87% occupancy.

There have been a number reports/complaints on Trip Advisor about sleepless nights due to a thumping noise coming from the local Double Six disco. Well, I have some news. This icon of the Bali nightlife will be closed from 24 September 2011 (big thump on the 23rd).

I hope to return to Bali in about six months and Puri Saron will again be my home away from home (unless I can afford a swim-up bar in my back garden and housekeeping before then).

P.S. If anyone wants advice on how to avoid Bail Belly, then contact me. And if you do get it, drink lots of bottled water and try Imodium before consulting a doctor.",Puri Saron Seminyak
747,Good Location,30,September 2011,"Plenty of bars and eating places just outside on beach side and just as many on street side. Try Delicious Onion - (turn left at Bintang sign opp Breezes Resort) for tapas, Monday night also Salsa night. There is a laneway opp street side entry which takes you through to Bintang supermarket area. On the beach side, lots of bars with beanbags on the beach - great for sunset drinks, dj's and bands on beach too! All the restaurants past Cocoon heading to Legion offer 2 for 1 cocktails...try Mozzarella @ Maharta Hotel on Saturday night, if you enjoy the Beatles, they have a great band playing there, good food, good prices and 2 for 1 cocktails. Puri Saron offer 30% off happy hour sunset bar drinks, however, you need to follow this up or they charge full price. Try writing it on your bill when signing. Hotel older style and somewhat tired, but staff friendly. We stayed in Bungalow, which is really just a fancy name for room. Friends had 'deluxe' which is another fancy name for room with smaller bathroom. Bizzare setup with shower in deluxe - nozzle faces across bath rather than along so room is flooded every single time shower taken. Check out payment extremely frustrating. Paid account in full for 2 rooms days before checkout, received receipt with nil balance. Then new charges going back 5 days come up 2 days later, pay that after much confusion. Then confirm all paid up on day of check out. Assured all paid - then when take keys back 1 hour later more charges on account from days previous. Not sure what they use their computers for but it's not for accounting - clearly all chasing paperwork that has to be somehow reconciled to a room. Was charged for 2 bintangs day before checkout and don't even drink beer so accuracy questionable. However, v cheap on whole scheme of things so not worth wasting time on. Had a lovely 2 weeks there.",Puri Saron Seminyak
748,great location right on the beach,40,August 2011,"It was 9 years since our previous trip to Bali, and haven't things changed a lot. But our guess is that this hotel has not changed much. That does not mean we did not enjoy our time there, it just means parts of the hotel are starting to look a bit tired. Our flight had massive delays and they felt sorry for us and upgraded our room to a private villa with its own pool, so we were very lucky.
The Positives:
1. Location is superb; could not ask for better. Right on the beach at Seminyak with no road to cross. If you want bars & restaurants on the beach they are right there. If you prefer quieter restaurants they are a short walk up the back streets.
2. Gardens are excellent. Well maintained
3. Pool is not stunning compared to the newer resorts, but still excellent with good shade spots, a swim up bar, and views to the ocean
4. breakfast is very good buffet with everything you need in a comfortable setting looking over the pool
5. staff were excellent
The Negatives:
1. Rooms were clean, but needed more than just the standard clean after guests leave; time for a spring clean and good paint job. With our room upgrade to a private pool we could not complain, but if we had paid for it I would not have been happy with the mould on the side of the pool.
2. The whole place needs an update; buildings just starting to look a bit tired.
3. restaurant in evening not that appealing, but with so many other choices within short walk it is not really a problem

Final verdict:
Yes we enjoyed staying there. Gives exactly what you expect from the website with no nasty surprises. If you want 5 star luxury stay someplace else at twice the price. For what we paid we got good value. Would go back again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
749,Be warned if you get sick,30,August 2011,"The superior rooms are just standard but the location is great.
One word of warning my partner got sick with Bali belly and when I asked how much it would cost to get a Dr to come to the hotel I was told about $100 Australian and that we could put it on our bill.
The bill came to $280 and the Dr wanted to be paid in American dollers!
When I complained to the hotel they rung the Dr and it was agreed that they would accept to be paid in Rupier or Aussie dollers if wwe wished and that we could put it on our hotel bill.
We met another person during our stay who had also been ill and had been quoted $100 by the hotel but was also charged the same as we were and again the Dr wanted American dollers.
There are a number of medical centres locally and I would recomend people access them if they are ill or at very least be prepared to be charged around $280 if they get ill and call the hotel Dr.

750,"Nothing special, but was just ok.",40,August 2011,"This hotel is at a dead end street with only one way out, no taxi's outside hotel have to walk about 100m or so to main strip for transport. Check in was smooth. The deluxe room was very average its a twin room with 2 single beds just pushed together. No chairs in room to hang stuff on. Bathroom towels and bed linen are very GREY, the shower over bath was in an awkward position where we flooded the floor after every shower. Bottled water supplied daily. Breakfast was ample enough to choose from. Pool was great, plenty of sun lounges. Found a mixture of nationalities staying there. Best part of this hotel is the location right on the beach. Would stay again but feel there are better options out there.",Puri Saron Seminyak
751,Not so sure... not terrible but nothing to write home about!,20,August 2011,"We (two adult couples) stayed here for 4 nights.

Despite having made a booking months ago, on arrival they had no record of our stay. We had booked a Deluxe Double and a Deluxe Chalet... After 20 minutes (and five staff getting involved), the hotel managed to find rooms - one as per our booking (Deluxe room) and for the chalet booking, they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom villa a for a night. The villa was lovely - new, large, clean and modern.... we could easily have stayed on! The other rooms not so much...

Firstly neither of the 'deluxe' rooms were impressive - the double had two single beds pushed together; these rooms are set down corridors offering a balcony or courtyard off the bedroom. The chalets are two storey and you enter the room from a balcony or courtyard into the bedroom. Allegedly these were meant to be standalone, offering more privacy, but despite costing more, they really weren't much different from the normal rooms....and we felt we actually had less privacy as to sit outside, you are in plain view of the guests!

The rooms are also tired and worn (I assume the new 1 bed villas were the renovation as nowhere else seems to have been spruced up) and the main facilities are just adequate. The rooms offer mini bar, in room safe and limited cable tv along with room service and a spa (at incredibly inflated prices).

As others have said, the location is the highlight of the hotel - right on the beach and surrounded by restaurants, bars, shopping and transport. It was ideal for exploring the area and for sunsets. Be warned though - if your rooms are to the front of the hotel, you will get some late night noise from the clubs on the beach!

We also found the clientele to be pleasant - a nice mix of nationalities and ages. The pool bar is great - plenty of room, clean and has a really good swim up bar, although the prices - as expected are steep.

I'm not sure I'd stay here again - if I did it would be for the location. Unfortunately we weren't thrilled with the service from the check-in staff - especially considering they lost our booking; the rooms were tired and drab and the breakfast was really rather average... for the price ($145 USD p/n for the chalet, $120 USD p/n for the deluxe room), I think you could do much better.

But if you want somewhere to sleep and wash, where you can check out the beach and sunset, then you may enjoy it....",Puri Saron Seminyak
752,Great location..good hotel,40,July 2011,"We went to the Puri Saron on the recommendation of a friend, found this place o be a little haven. The staff were great and the grounds are fairly well kept. The rooms are good (we had a ground floor bungalow which was great, four poster bed and a huge bathroom) @$130 per night AU(published rate $155++) with breakfast is not a bad deal, the breakfast is fairly standard for Bali hotels.

Lots of Europeans as well as a few Aussies which was a good mix, no yobbo factor here, unlike some of the larger hotels further south.

Tip- If you like Indonesian food try the Bakso from the vendor on the motorbike at the beach front @ about 2pm (you will hear him as he taps a spoon on a bowl when he is around) it is fantastic! and costs us westerners 10 000rp (local price is about 4 000rp I think) nice and hot if you like it, washed down with a cold beer makes a great lunch.

Fantastic beach bars with bean bags to sit on in the late afternoon right out the front of the resort, good location for clubs and restaurants also, but be aware, if you want to catch a meter taxi you will have to walk back to the main street, about 300meters as the hotel is at the end of a street with no passing traffic

Overall we highly recommend the Puri Saron as a great place to stay with reasonable tariffs",Puri Saron Seminyak
753,Disgusting!!,10,July 2011,"My partner and i arrived at the Hotel and were very dissapointed in the rooms and also the surrounds. We went to our room and felt like a prison sell no warmth no comfort we had asked for a delux room but had two single beds pushed together. We wanted to see if they had any other rooms available even Villas but had nothing and there was no way i was spending 10 days at this hotel. We decided to go for a walk anfd check out the pool area was nice but very small. After an hour we decided we wanted to move hotels and we were out within the next half and hour to a new hotel in Legian. I read on trip advisor before we went that the rooms had been referbed which we had a ""refurbed room"" i tell what u would hate to see what a un refurbed rooms looked like. The hotel staff were rude and couldn't speak English very well. I would not suggest anyone stay at this hotel very dissapointed, especially for the money!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
754,"Loved it, will go back",40,July 2011,"Glad I took TA advise and got a bungalow (4216), it was lovely. Met others
that said corridors were very noisy in main roms Friendly staff, rooms cleaned daily. Sure breaky wasn't great but chefs in the kitchen were happy to cater for individual needs if asked. Ticked all our boxes, bar pool, beach at your doorstep, clean. Be careful of bar pool bill as we were charged for drinks we didn't have. This also happened at Bennys, very disappointing.Sunsets to die for at your back door !",Puri Saron Seminyak
755,Had a great time,40,July 2011,"We were a little concerned after seeing the negative reviews around the time we booked but we needn't have. There was really very little to complain about as long as you weren't expecting 5 star, but for value for money it is hard to beat.
We stayed in one of the bungalows (request a garden view room, it is closer to the beach, pool and restaurant). We had requested interconnecting rooms, but these were only available for the deluxe rooms, the bungalows were separate. The beds were firm and yes, while the room was a little dated, like has been previously mentioned, it was very clean and housekeeping attended daily to replace towels and clean the room. The hotel is currently in the process of refurbishing their rooms. However, for the small amount of time you spend in your room, they were more than adequate.
What really made the hotel for us was the pool complex, bar and the staff. We have an 8 and 6 year old who were throughly entertained at the pool for the whole 10 days. The setup of the pool is great, a shallow area for the kids and a separate deeper area for everyone else. Plus a swim-up bar in the middle where you can order food and drink to have delivered to your sun lounge. The bar staff are fantastic - particularly with the kids, who could go and order their own food and drinks. The staff even let the boys attach their ipod to the bar's sound system. It was a sad day when we had to say goodbye.
Our only negative was breakfast. The menu doesn't change, so we ended up having breakfast outside the hotel a couple of times for some variety and to have a ""regular"" cappucino! The Grocer and Grind near Seminyak square is great for that.
There was a diverse cliental staying at the hotel from newlyweds, young singles and families - it really appeals to all.",Puri Saron Seminyak
756,I loved Puri saron I will be back.!!!,40,June 2011,"The hotel is all about the location, the staff are fabulous, friendly and very efficient. The room is simple clean and the hotel is very well maintained . Loved every minute and cant wait to go back. Highly reconmend to all who are on a budget. Security wise in room safes provided security on patrol and as a single travelor very safe. Party atmosphere there also.!!!",Puri Saron Seminyak
757,Lovely hotel! Lovely staff! Smelly mouldy beds!!!,30,December 2010,Almost everything about this hotel was great. Lovely pool and swim up bar. Great friendly staff. beautiful gardens. The one thing ( which was a pretty big thing to me) was the mouldy smell of the bed and pillows. I had to sleep with 2 towels over my pillow and the smell was throughout the room. It really affected my rating of this hotel.,Puri Saron Seminyak
758,pay for what you get,20,July 2011,"Had 3 nights here, called seminyak but just in the shadowsof that town ,more Legian side , the name means Kings Palace but far from it, service none existant ,they tried placing us in a room adjacent the main foyer 200 mts from beach and pool ,saying only room available , we refused ,they then gave us the room we booked near the pool , which was ready the whole time .Staff watched my wife and i drag our bags to our room, tired hotel , some reno going on but hardly noticable , expensive drinking ,dont eat lunch or dinner there , dont get massage there over priced and ordinary ,,nil atmosphere ,

759,I'd gladly stay again,40,July 2011,"Fantastic location, walk past the pool and onto the beach!
It's not 5 star, but then you're not paying 5 star rates. It's clean, the staff are lovely, the rooms are largish and have air conditioning. The pool was nice and the pizzas yummy. It ticked all the boxes for me.",Puri Saron Seminyak
760,"location, location, location.......",40,July 2011,"Keep this secret.......absolute beachfront in Seminyak at an excellent price. OK it is not 5 star, not even 4 star, but it is ok considering the price. They have carried out some improvements over the last year, mainly new floors in the rooms. Breakfast excellent if a little busy at peak time. Pool very pleasant, and that amazing few steps to the endless beach. Jalan Diana Pura is developing and every year there are new bars and restaurants opening, some of the bars now offering cabaret type shows. Walking distance to Bali Deli for a real cup of tea and massive selection of serious cakes",Puri Saron Seminyak
761,4th stay,40,June 2011,My partner and I stayed at the Puri Saron for 4 nights this time in a bungalow. As usual we loved the hotel and it's location. Bungalows are large but on the dark side. The bath/shower is very high and I would not recommend this for anyone with hip or knee problems. We had a problem with noise from 4:30am each day with what was possibly goods being delivered to the kitchen. Next time we will try for the bungalows on the other side. The price of this hotel is an excellent guideline for what to expect. It's not 5 star but we don't pay 5 star prices.,Puri Saron Seminyak
762,"Great location, nice pool, good value",40,June 2011,"I stayed at Puri Saron for 5 nights with my parents, husband and two small children. We were pleasantly surprised after reading other reveiws. We booked 2 Deluxe Chalet rooms. Unfortunately they were not next to each other - which would have been nice. It is a large hotel and our rooms were near the restaurant and pool. The room was standard size with a huge bathroom. The breakfast is nothing flash and fairly boring after 5 days. Saying that - the price is very good for a beach front hotel and we would definitely stay here again. If you need late check out, make sure you prebook it. We had to book into a villa for the last day so we could have late check out as our rooms were not available to keep. However it was nice to see the villas and would look into those for next time.",Puri Saron Seminyak
763,puri saron just perfect,50,June 2011,"we stayed at puri saron for two weeks in june we had bungalow 4111.
Most beautiful thing about the hotel is swim up bar and location. the hotel is just attached with the beach.Warm Hotel staff, cleanliness, swimming pool made our stay enjoyable.
we would certainly advise people to go for Puri Saron.
They cleaned room everyday with fresh linen and good healthy breakfast in the morning and replace minibar just the way we want.

the hotel location is quiet and perfect for holidays. Thank you all at Puri Saron for making our stay memorable.",Puri Saron Seminyak
764,"Terrific, intimate place right on the beach",40,March 2011,"I loved this place. It was my first trip to Bali and wanted somewhere a little out of Kuta to chill out. It couldn't have been better, right on the beach and a short walk to the amazing restaurants in Legian.

The staff are amazing, nothing is too difficult for them and they are very friendly. They assisted me to book a couple of tours and the exchange rate within the hotel is not only very safe but comparable to the rates found externally. Without prompting, they told me about the nearest supermarket, where you can buy bottled water - very good. The hotel also provides a free minibus daily into Kuta. I stayed in what was called a ""bungalow"", which was large, very clean, had all amenities (tv, hairdryer, fridge, tea coffee etc) and close to the pool area. As far as I could tell, each room as well as bungalow, has their own private balcony, which is very pleasant to sit of an evening and watch the world go by.

THe daily breakfasts are also good value. It's buffet style and the variety of food available should please all. I hesitated to try the fresh fruit, due to ""bali-belly: fears, but had no adverse reaction to it and by the end of my stay, was making a bit of a meal with the fruit alone. They also have someone cooking eggs to order and and that was very good, from boiled, poached, fried and omlettes with any sort of topping you could desire.

The hotel is undergoing a refurb at the moment, so be sure to request one of the already refurbed rooms, as I understand the non-refurbed ones are not too good.

The pool area is also great and again the staff are excellent.

Overall, don't go to this place expecting 5*, it's not, but what it is is a little, intimate clean hotel that has all you'd need or want - I'll definately go back. Thanks to all staff @ the Puri Saron xxxx",Puri Saron Seminyak
765,Pretty average,30,June 2011,"My boyfriend and I stayed in a bungalow room for 4 nights on 11 June. The website looks nothing like the rooms. It's actually unfair just how much they mislead you in the photos.
Our room was tired, next to the restaurant which played the same music on repeat for 12 hours a day. Not offensive, just annoying. They were working by the pool, building a decked area, so not particularly relaxing. I'm not a great fan of the swim up pool bars but there was one there. The poolside area just wasn't great at all - the people staying there didn't help either.
We realised quickly that we didn't feel that USD130 per night was value for money. We then reliased that just in general, Seminyak and the south of Bali is expensive and actually what we were getting for our money was pretty average. You need to spend upwards of USD170 per night to get a decent place to stay in Seminyak.
Hotel was well situated in terms of the shops and beaches, but not really close enough to Seminyak to be paying Seminyak prices. Much closer to Legian. On another note, it's right near Double 6 Club so on a Saturday night the music is banging until 6:30am. Didn't bother us too much but worth noting.....
Plus points - the porter was lovely, service was OK. They arranged a driver for us to go to the Bukit Penninsula for us for a good price.
Breakfast was awful! Wouldn't ever stay here again. There are far nicer & cheaper places to stay in Bali.....",Puri Saron Seminyak
766,Amazingly good value,40,June 2011,"The best value for money hotel in Seminyak that I could find. The staff were friendly. The hotel has a lovely pool/swim up bar area and the location on the beach is perfect for those morning walks along the beach or to watch the sunset in the evening. Handy to seminyak shops and restaurants. The hotel room I stayed in was certainly not 5 star, but I didn't expect it to be for the price I paid with full buffet breakfast included each morning.",Puri Saron Seminyak

The breakfast buffet was fantastic, food great all round, pool bar food delicious, restaurant food great! Room was modern & clean, very very nice!! The pool is great with a swim up bar! Loved it here & great prices too. Not far from the loads of different shops & very central. I would highly recommend it here. Computers/Internet available in the lobby too which was handy.

769,"good room, lovely and comfortable bed, older hotel but very ""Bali""",40,May 2011,"The breakfasts were excellent, freshly cooked omelets just to your liking, hot dishes, cold dishes, fruit, cereal, juices etc. Way beyond my expectations.
The staff were terrific. Very helpful and always someone there with good english.
I liked the location , beach side and by a great street off the main drag, goods restaurants , shops, 2 tailors, JP's bar with live bands 4 days a week. I would go back.
Tip as in most hotesl, the room lighting is a little dull and I like to read so I took a torch... also handy at night on the way to or from local restaurants for dinner, to help navigate the pot holes on the streets and footpath, and also to read the menu's.",Puri Saron Seminyak
770,Older hotel with a great location - not luxurious but adequately pleasant,30,May 2011,"After reading some reviews, I was very nervous about booking here. Being honest, the resort's swim-up bar was fantastic! The rooms were good, clean, spacious (but we requested a room with a mosquito net and didn't get one - not a tragedy but it would have been romantically nice). The hotel is a little older and has that slightly wornout feel about it which you might like if squeaky newness offends you.

The location, smack dab on the beach, was great. Being within walking distance to shops, restaurants etc I suspect has given the hotel it's 4 star rating. I'd rate it as 3 star.

The hotel restaurant was verrrrry average and I would NOT recommend eating there unless you had to. The food wasn't bad per se...just wasn't great! My mie goreng was made with two minute noodles - what more can I say?

The breakfast buffet was good - all you can eat and plenty of choices, healthy and otherwise. Their banana pancakes were excellent even when they were labelled pineapple pancakes!

If you're the type of traveller that doesn't spend a helluva lot of time in the hotel room and a clean, comfortable spacious bed is all you want (with aircon) and a swim-up bar that rocks and it's right on Seminyak beach, then this place is fine. But if you're looking to be pampered and treated like the god that you so obviously are, then this isn't the hotel for you.

Truth is, if you want this brilliant location but a better quality hotel, you'll pay big $$$ for that so, all in all, there were compromises to be made and pampered luxury was one of those things.

I would prefer to stay here than in a fancier hotel in the middle of the shopping district with the noise and bustle but that's just me.",Puri Saron Seminyak
771,"Good location, Beautiful hotel grounds,Good value.. rooms a little tired.",40,June 2010,"We were looking for a hotel in Seminyak, beach front for under $100. There isn't too many options out there but Puri Saron was one of them.

772,"Best Spot, Best Value",40,March 2011,"My husband and I stayed at Puri Saron for 8 nights. We wanted to be in Seminyak and straight on the beach and we could not have found better. All the other resorts are accross the road from the beach, Puri Saron has a private access direct to the sand.
To have that same spot in Seminyak you have to stay at the very expensive hotels.
We had a bungalow (one on top of the delux room) it was clean, spacious and very quiet with our private balcony giving into the gorgeous gardens.
Staff was amazing all the way (we even got fried duck with veggies at 3am from the room service), and the pool bar is just a must - Try a Puri Saron Punch!",Puri Saron Seminyak
773,"Good value for money, great location",40,March 2011,"Was a little apprehensive when booking, after reading reviews, but we were very pleasantly surprised. Decided to book a bungalow and so glad we did, it was lovely. Downstairs, near the pool as requested. Staff very very attentive and friendly. Front of hotel and restaurants lacked appeal, however the Warungs out the back along the beach are fantastic for atmosphere, food and value. We ate here every day. The breakfast buffet at Puri saron is excellent. The location is perfect. We will defiantely return next year. One major complaint, ""the bed was very hard"" After telling housekeeping, they put a doona under sheets, which helped a little",Puri Saron Seminyak
774,A terrific hotel in a great spot,40,January 2011,"Like a few others here, I was a bit worried when I read the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised by the Puri Saron. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the people at the hotel were always helpful and the hotel itself had a nice atmosphere and excellent services. Absolutely loved the buffet breakfast.

The pool area is a lovely spot and we spent most of our days there, lounging around (the sun beds facing the sea are the best ones). At night, we would venture out for food as the hotel was pretty quiet and there was a greater variety of food on the street. If you're looking for a terrific Spanish place, there's a beachside restaurant that serves great tapas and the most amazing seafood. It's just to the right of the hotel when you go out of the gates on the beach. Keep an ear out for the extraordinary mix tape they play on loop.

Puri Saron isn't the flashest of places but you're not paying five-star prices. Having said that, it's a terrific hotel in a great spot and if I was ever going to go back to Bali, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
775,"Will go back to this Hotel again, Location in the right place for everything",40,January 2011,"Sevice very good staff very friendly, we asked for a ground floor and got one room was clean and tidy,had all the things you need tea/coffee,t.v,etc, and the location was great go out the back of the hotel and on to the beach to your left the night life and to your right a shot walk to Seminyak what more could you ask for....l did read some reviews on this hotel before we went and had my finger's crossed we had done the right thing yes its one of the older hotels in the area but that should not put people off.

777,"Pretty good value for the beach location, but that's about it...",30,December 2010,"My partner and i stayed for 4 nights.
On the plus side, the hotel is right on the beach, the pool is great for lounging around, the staff are friendly and the guy at the egg station at the breakfast buffet really knows his stuff.
Unfortunately, the room itself was not so great. The first night, I was eaten alive by mosquitoes that were breeding happily in the dark and wet bathroom. The shower head sprayed everywhere, except for at the person having a shower. The room towles were old and hard - only marginally capable of drying yourself or the floor. The floor in the room itself was always a little gritty from the beach sand, even just afte being cleaned.
Overall, not a room that you necessarily look forward to coming back to, but happy that its close to the beach.",Puri Saron Seminyak
778,"Do yourself a favor, don‚Äôt go there.",10,October 2010,"On our holiday to Bali we decided to stay one week at the Puri Saron Hotel.
We knew it would not be like the Kamandalu Resort where we came from, neither the Aston Benoa where we were going to.
But this was really the worst hotel we ever had in fourteen years spending our holidays in Indonesia.
I did not expect a luxury room but this did beat everything.
The room smelled musty everything was clammy and the furniture seemed to be thrown in from afar. The space between the bed and the wall was not more than 45cm.
The fact that they cleaned the floor soaking wet with a cleansing product, made it all worse. The perfume disappeared and the moist stayed.
The drinking glass smelled after whiskey when we came in, so they were not cleaned.
The first night I could not sleep because of the terrible smell of the pillow.
There were blood marks on my wife's sheets, and after they changed the sheets the next day, they were located on my bed.
The towels were defiled. I suppose they were rinsed out without using soap and so were the sheets.
The view was a wall and behind that a high building. It really felt like prison.
After intervention of our travel agent we were moved to another room that was less musty, but the dirty sheets and towels stayed.
The breakfast was proper, but the dinner in the restaurant was not tasty and I gave it back.
The food in the pizza restaurant on the other hand was good and the staff in the restaurants was very friendly. The pool and was nice and clean and so was the garden and the pool bar.
The reception staff seemed not to be very impressed by our complains and those of the guests that came after us.

The best time we had in Puri Saron was the day we left‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",Puri Saron Seminyak
779,NICE LOCATION,30,December 2010,"Came back from Bali yesterday (7-12-2010). Stayed in this hotel for 4 days with my friends. Room was ok, taircon working well. What i really like is it very near to the beach and they have swimming pool which we didn't get the chance to use as we always away for a tour the time we are back to hotel was late at night and pool usage is only until 9pm. Then comes breakfast. They have few choices to take and 1 staff just for frying your eggs. At first i thought it was nice, my friends always looking forward for breakfast until our last day, I ate fried rice and middle of our tour I had terrible diarrhea, my stomach was so painful i was so tired every after the stomach cramps and just wanted to lie down. I cant wait for us to be back in Singapore so I can rest well. I'm happy it happened on our last day otherwise i wont have chance to see places aside from Kuta.
I still recommend this place for those who wants to go Bali, but be CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU EAT.",Puri Saron Seminyak
780,First time in Bali,40,February 2010,"We supposed to have a room in main building, but reception desk offered us an upgrade to bungalow and that was very nice. Hotel is located just in front of the beach - it was amazing, to watch sunset from our swimming pool. The garden and all facilities were very clean and staff very kind. There was free wi-fi at the pool area, restaurant and lobby. We were lucky to have a room close to reception, so we could use the internet without leaving the room. Room was very clean with big king size bed and large bathroom with bathtub. It was very nice arranged - I liked it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
781,Avoid!,10,November 2010,"After a couple of days at this place, we were ready to give it a good review. But that changed quickly. The location is pretty good - by the beach and close enough to shops and restaurants in Legian but also a distance away from the action. The pool is great to laze around by as well. That is all the positive things we can say about it.

We stayed in a supposed Deluxe Room. Although the rooms aren't that fancy, they suited us and were reasonably nice despite the sheets being a bit dirty and the bathroom smelling all damp and musty. The shower is the worst shower we have ever experienced and is placed in such a way that the floor gets wet even when you have the mouldy shower curtain pulled all the way across. As the fridge in the room was absolutely tiny, we had to remove the mini bar drinks to put in anything of our own. So we placed the mini bar drinks together out in plain sight right where the staff who make up the room could see. After a couple of days, we noticed that they were putting drinks in the fridge that we hadn't bought (where they could find any room). So we went down to reception to find out we had a monumental bill for drinks we hadn't touched. After trying to explain it to the staff at reception, we brought down every single drink they had placed in the minibar and had only a small amount knocked off our bill. After arguing with these people, who made absolutely no sense with their accounting skills, we still ended up having to pay a significant amount for nothing at checkout. We are honest people and would have even been happy to overpay for something we had consumed, but paying money for nothing is unnacceptable. They maintained afterwards that guests can request an empty minibar, so if you must stay here I recommend you do so. This episode stopped us from ordering any poolside drinks or eating in their restaurant, as we didn't feel we could trust the staff and we had no idea what sort of bill we would have at the end. Plus we didn't want to give the hotel any further business. We had friends staying at other hotels in Legian and their rates, room and service were far superior - but this location and pool were better. That's all this place has going for it.",Puri Saron Seminyak
782,Nothing flash but worth it considering price and location,30,October 2010,"Stayed here in october. Was expecting problems reading the reviews. But as it turned out it was all pretty comfortable considering the price and location. Stayed in a bungalow, ie room with a large bathroom, why a large bathroom is baffling, nothing flash.

You get what you pay for. Forget the hotel spa, massage a total ripoff, unrelaxing spot and untrained masseurs, your better off getting a massage on the beach an hour for $10, there experienced and the massage is good.",Puri Saron Seminyak
783,Would deffinately stay there next year when we go again,40,October 2010,"Puri Saron Hotel was fantastic, clean and the staff were very friendly. I had read many reviews on Tripadvisor regarding this particular hotel and the reviews were not great so I was a bit concerned that we would be turning up to a dirty outdated hotel but it was so not.

We went for our honeymoon and yes the linen could be replaced and the towels are not freshly white, but it not that bad. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous and the rooms are very clean. Rooms get serviced daily with linen replaced daily. The hotel is right on the beach. We had a fantastic time and are planning to go back next year and we will be booking with the Puri Saron again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
784,Great Time,40,January 2010,"Fantastic stay.We booked this hotel from the airport on arrival.Rooms clean,safe hotel,breakfast was great, staff really helpful and friendly,the only downside was the drinks at the bar are a bit on the high side but i would definatly stay there again if i am in Bali.",Puri Saron Seminyak
785,location location location,30,October 2010,"On arrival we where put into superior room which where awful, two single beds for hubby and I and the kids where a long way away, after complaining we where moved to a bungalow the next day which was better location and decor.( Both rooms where clean)It seems this is what they do when people complain about the superior rooms as conversations with other guests we found they had the same experience. Food was great lots of choices at breakfast each day only complaint there is the pastries a bit dry but that may be climate. Loved the swim up bar all the staff very friendly and helpful, grounds beautiful and we enjoyed the location, don't use the hotel drivers very expensive transport just down the road. we found a driver there Nyoman Caler (08179720787) and he's a great bloke very helpful great english and reasonable prices - tell him Margy and Russell sent you!",Puri Saron Seminyak
786,Friendly hotel away from the madness of Kuta,40,February 2010,"We stayed here for a week in Feb 2010. For the very reasonable price we paid, we were pleasantly surprised by this friendly and comfortable hotel. The staff were very approachable, friendly and helpful. The accommodation was basic but clean and the beds comfortable. There was a little flooding in the bathroom, but this was a design issue, not bad plumbing. Breakfast was plentiful and the restaurant clean and inviting. I was most impressed by the amount of available shade around the lovely swimming pool, which meant we could stay down there all day without getting burnt. This hotel would be great for families, with the beach right outside the gate, and Kuta only a few minutes away by taxi when the urge to visit markets becomes overwhelming.",Puri Saron Seminyak
787,Great trip with the girls in a very relaxing hotel.,30,September 2010,"I stayed at this hotel with a group of 6 ladies and the staff were fantastic, our rooms were all next to each other as we had asked. The breakfast was a standard Balinese breakfast and they were happy to make our banana pancakes when they werent on the buffet.
We found this hotel nice and quiet, very peaceful, which is exactly what we wanted given we were travelling without our husbands and children.
The rooms are pretty basic and the linen could do with an upgrade but beds were comfy and it was all in all a wonderfully relaxing hotel. I wouldnt recommend for anyone with children as it doesnt have all the facilities you sometimes need with kids but for a adults holiday it is fine, probably more like a 3 star than a 4 star, We stayed in rooms but the villas did look fantastic, you get the best of both worlds, the privacy of a villa but on the grounds of a hotel. Little overpriced even for Puri Saron though so I would try and bargain for a good price on them.",Puri Saron Seminyak
788,Hated it - couldn't wait to leave,20,August 2010,"We were booked for 8 nights and left after 4 and would have left earlier if we could have - as it was we lost our money because we had prepaid. The first ""bungalow"" we were placed in was just so ordinary we were immediately depressed as we had paid a lot of money. Value for money was zero. We were moved to a different room the next day no questions asked (almost like they were expecting us to ask to be moved). However the new room was only marginally better - the only difference was a mosquito net on a 4 poster bed and a fake Balinese style TV cabinet . As many others have said the photos on their website are not a true indication and there are no bungalows - they are hotel rooms. There is no Balinese feel to this place, the rooms felt like prison cells, dark with no character at all. The 1st floor rooms are worse as at least you have a view of the garden on the ground floor - upstairs there is the feeling of being closed in on the concrete walled balcony. The ""white"" sheets and towels were grey and had seen better days many moons ago. A room is only a small part of a holiday but there are so many other great places to stay in Bali for less money and more value. Location-wise it is not too bad. Walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants and there is a supermarket nearby. Some lovely drivers very close by in the same street as the hotel - would highly recommend them.",Puri Saron Seminyak
789,fantastic staff and nice spot next to the beach,30,August 2010,"i read all the reviews before travelling with my family (husband,two 17 year olds and a 15 year old teenagers) and was worried.but decided to make my own judgement when we got to puri saron.we arrived at the hotel about 10.30am on a sunday,check in was not until 2pm.the staff we lovey and all very helpfull.they let us have a look at one of the rooms we were going to be put in.i was not happy with the location of the room on the 3rd floor the balcony was facing a brick wall so we said no to that room and they sorted out two more rooms for us to have if we were happy with the,they also were on the third floor,with nice garden views.the rooms were clean and the sheets ect were fine so we told the staff we were happy to have them rooms.they are not super flash or anything,but your not paying top dollar.the pool is lovely.breakfast is fine and the location right next to the beach is great.it a bit far to walk to kuta,but taxis are easy to get.i even got a birthday cake delivered to my room complementary.overall the kids, my husband and i all enjoyed our experience at the puri saron.if you keep an open mind and dont expect 5 star quality then you will enjoy.and if you are going to stay at this hotel,as long as you let them know if you are not happy with something they will do their best to try and accomodate you :)",Puri Saron Seminyak
790,PURI SARON DISASTER HOLIDAY,10,July 2010,"Have just returned yesterday from Puri Saron, a nightmare hotel in Bali!!

In 8 days we went through 4 room changes, blood stained ""cleaned sheets"", wee stains on our ""clean sheets"", mouldy bathrooms, shower falling of the wall, flooding bathroom, aircon dripping for hours on end, flooding the room, a bad fall in the puddle from the aircon, metal shards in our breakfast, insects in our glasses, money charged to our bill from different rooms, cigarette burnt pillows! Also, the hotel is directly next to a BUNGY JUMP NIGHTCLUB, which heads off at 2am till 6am every night! Get used to ear plugs.

The Hotel is HORRIBLE! In an awful spot in Seminyak!

Apparently it still stands at its old ratings star wise as it has changed owners in the past 5 years... but things are going down hill and everyone there complained about something.",Puri Saron Seminyak
791,Great value for money - not 5 * but 3*,30,July 2010,"We stayed in one of the bungalows that we booked and paid for and was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews before hand. The place was clean, quiet over looking a lovely well kept garden, lovely relaxing area to sit in outside to have a drink and read in fresh air. Well servieced each day and yes towels weren't a bright white but clean and changed each day. Good mosquito net that we used just in case. Room was big with TV and good sized batheroom with bath and area to change and keep bags etc. Large bench in bathroom/dressing room. Breakfast was ample and we had no reason to complain for think we needed more at all. 2 min walk to beach but if you didn't want to pay to sit on beach there was chairs in property over looking the sea. Hawkers were outside the gate but hey you just ignore or have a laugh with them and they leave you alone. Lots of yummy resturants within walking distance or cab ride for $1.50 NZ... 10,000 IRD.... but also nice place across road for us on our first night when tired from standing at airport for hour or so in heat.... but hey that is your welcome to Bali and never any different so you get over it. All in all we would return to this hotel but make sure we always book bungalows as they do seem to be the better choice in all properties in Bali

Oh and there was free wireless internet in our room even though they said only in resurant and lobby ... so do try it if you have laptop with you.",Puri Saron Seminyak
792,This hotel is a joke,20,July 2010,My husband and I have just spent 3 weeks at the Puri Saron Seminyak and after waiting over 2 hours to get through the airport arrived at the hotel around midnight to find our sheets were dirty and had to ring housekeeping to get them changed. This was a great start to our long awaited holiday and it was all down hill from there. This hotel is not the star rating as advertised. We would rate it as a 2 star rating. The rooms smelt musty and mouldy and the air conditioning leaked water all over the floor and you could not sleep with it on at night because it was too noisy. The breakfast was absolutely average and we found it hard to go back there so ate elsewhere most days.The pool was a great size with plenty of room for the guests but it was cloudy and you couldn't see the bottom in the deep end. We have a pool and know how it should be maintained. It obviously lacked chlorine and when this was mentioned to the maintenance person we just received a blank response. This pool is a health hazard. We would not recommend this hotel.,Puri Saron Seminyak
793,Rooms are revolting,20,July 2010,"The staff are the best thing about this hotel, they are wonderful and doing there best, but the rooms are horrible, blood stains on sheets, no safe, smelly pillows, pool is great and the pool bar is great, really close to the beach. If they refurbished the rooms and bought new towels and bedding it would be great!!!! The restraunt at night is empty and very boring.",Puri Saron Seminyak
794,Not bad as long as you avoid hotel room building,30,June 2010,"After 3 room changes we finally settled into a bungalow. My advise to you is DO DON'T BOOK A DELUX HOTEL ROOM. Either upgrade to a bungalow or villa. The section of the hotel housing the delux rooms should not even be in operation. It is completely contaminated with mildew. Some rooms smelt worse than others but you can see the mold on all the ceilings & even the bed sheets and pillows smell of mildew.

The pool is great, has a shallow area for the kids & nice pool bar. Spa is good too, although more expensive than others out of the hotel they will negotiate a cheaper price with you. Staff are very friendly & willing to help with any request.

The only other issue is that the hotel doesn't allow taxi's into the property unless dropping off guests. If you don't want to use the hotels drivers then a short walk up the road to Camplung Danduk is where you will easily get a taxi. If travelling with children bear this in mind as a stroller may a good idea. We bought a stroller for our 2 yr old but should've taken another for our 4 yr old as she didn't always want to do the walk & had to be carried.",Puri Saron Seminyak
795,Disgusting,10,May 2010,"This hotel is revolting.
Our room featured: blood on the mosquito netting around bed : ice cream dropped over furniture from previous guests : stained towels : dirty bathrooms, including mouldy, spiderweb infested bathroom cupboards : broken safe : ripped bed sheets : etc etc
After inspecting the property, we left for another hotel even though we had paid for it upfront. We were willing to forfeit our money, it was that gross.
DO NOT book this hotel, it should not even be in operation",Puri Saron Seminyak
796,"Mellow hotel, right on the beach",40,May 2010,"Stayed in a chalet (which is in a 2-storey configuration, 2 up, 2 down). Overlooked gardens and well-separated from other rooms. Very quiet, not full of Aussie bogans, and super-close to the beach. Within walking distance of great restaurants and shops. Very nice pool area with swim-up pool bar. Free breakfast is what you pay for, but most hotel breakfasts are like that. Hotel arranged transport and driver to Sanur, and also to mountains, elephant park and Ubud. Good prices no fuss. Although clean, bed linen and towels somewhat grey and showed their age. Not a drama for us, but some might have a funny turn.",Puri Saron Seminyak
797,Over priced and not at all what you see on the hotel website,10,May 2010,"This hotel was a real dissapointment and we were shocked by the price the place was charging. This was our third trip to Bali and other places we have stayed have been cheaper with far superior quality (and greater star rating).

We were picked up from the airport on time and taken to the hotel by a friendly member of staff. After this things went down hill. The room we were shown to didn't have a double bed as booked (not the end of the world) but did come with excessive damp. The room smelt musty and there were damp patches all around the ceiling and walls. The bed sheets and pillows in particular felt wet. The wardrobes smelt of damp and for some reason creosote. The bathroom smelt of drains and had mildew.

When we asked to be moved staff didn't have a problem and moved us within a couple of hours. The second room, although drier still smelt of damp and had the odd damp patch. The shower leaked all over the floor and the drains smelt each time you used it. We could hear everything from the corridor: guests arriving home late at night, staff shouting at each other at 6am. Room was a decent size though.

Breakfast was included, although not really worth it - poor quality food, slow staff and tea and coffee sitting around not being served.

The pool was by far the best aspect of this hotel. Always clean and well laid out. Good for the few kids we saw there (although I wouldn't take mine there). Also location-wise we liked this hotel: 15 mis walk to Kudeta, etc. Staff were always polite and eager to please. However, in our view the hotel was massively overpriced and in desperate need of some sprucing up. Visitors (should) expect much more for these prices.",Puri Saron Seminyak
798,Fantastic,40,May 2010,"I travelled there with my family, 2 Adults 3 Teenagers in May 2010. Two bed Villa.
Landed in Bali at night time so we were very disoriented from the start, werent overly helpful in helping us with the little things like; using the telephone, room service & getting an extra bed. We booked the villa (two bedrooms, own pool) for 5 people. When we rocked up at about 8pm the room wasnt even clean (tenants had just left- which was odd) & was set up for 4 people, two King sized Beds one in each room! When we asked for the extra bed they tried to tell us that we hadnt paid for it. Dad and I ended up having to walk it up to reception to show them we had!! They fixed it up and about 20mins later they turned up with an extra bed.
Two rooms were huge, clean, nice big bathroom. Villa included huge undercroft lounge room with 3 lounges & a coffee table.
Breakfast was between 6-10am every morning. Good variety including, Warm Indonesian breakfasts (sasuages, vegetables, rice etc), Continential breakfasts (cereals, fruit, Breads etc) and a staff member who was there just to cook your eggs!!
There were two resturants, one by the beach and the other the hotel main resturant.
Good prices, good service.
Main pool was huge, Swim-to Bar (happy hour at 5pm), towels provided & Heaps of sunbed lounges.
Two Minute walking distance to the beach. It was roughly 15-20mins to the main street of Seminyak. Lots of shopping. Down that main street it linked up with legian. Easy to hail down a taxi and get them to drop you down there.
WiFi in the rooms wasnt strong, dads laptop often didnt pick up the signal. He often had to walk up to the lobby to get a connection, which he wasnt to impressed with as they had avertised WiFi in your rooms. Computers in the lobby were easy to use & cheap. Printer available.
There was a lady in the Lobby who sold tours to the tenants. We used her for Elephant riding, White Water Rafting etc. Fantastic Lady very organised.
The Beauty Spa was excellent. My sister and I had a full body massage, cream scrub & herbal bath (not together!). Was much more expensive than what you could have got in the streets but the environment was better, quiet, relaxing.
Overall, Staff were fantastic. Beautiful people. Helpful (after the first night) & always greeted you with a big smile. We had an awesome trip. The villa is fantastic. Having your own pool is great, you can walk around in your bikini's without worrying people are seeing you!! Would most definantly stay in the Villa again.",Puri Saron Seminyak
799,Great Pool - VERY average rooms,30,April 2010,This hotel was recommended to me as a great pool area but the rooms are average. Well they were spot on. The pool is large and there is plenty of sunbeds around both in and out of the shade. A few steps from the beach as well. Zero service around the pool even though there is a pool bar. The spa is extremely overpriced and certainly not value for money. Step off the property and there are plenty of other spa's to use. The breakfast was terrible and we stopped eating it and settled for toast. The rooms were the biggest concern. Although large they are all in varying conditions. Some partially renonvated others untouched. The towels are grey and you can put your fingers through them. The bed sheets were stained. The bath area was dirty. We looked at some surrounding hotels and Puri Saron definately has the best pool area but the rooms are very average.,Puri Saron Seminyak
800,great Hotel highly recomended,50,May 2010,"Great value ,very clean rooms and great service. Away from the hustle and bustle, but only short walkj to Legian.",Puri Saron Seminyak
801,Right on the beach! This cant be beaten..,40,April 2010,"I stayed here with my fiancee for one week in a bungalow room.
The room overlooked the gardens and was clean and tidy with a big comfy bed. The hotel itself runs from the street to the beach so you can walk from your room past the pool, down onto the beach. My partner is a keen surfer so he was in heaven.

The hotel is walking distance to cafes, restaurants and bars. Taxis are located at the end of the street - about a 2 min walk, to take you where ever you want to go. Kuta was only a 10 minute drive away.

Although only rated 3 stars this hotel is real value for money with an unbeatable location for a great price. The breakfast was the only thing that let it down, but with so many cheap cafes close by it wasn't really a problem.

After looking at various websites i contacted the hotel directly and received a much better rate.",Puri Saron Seminyak
802,"Good hotel, but do seem after your money",40,April 2010,"We booked Puri Saron last minute after having a dreadful experience on Lembongan island.

The staff were great and organised our booking very quickly.

The hotel was bigger than the other hotels we stayed in Bali but the service was still really good. The hotel grounds were beautiful and there was a large pool. It was right on the beach and also very close to the bars and restaurants in Seminyak. We would particularly recommend a meal at Me'nu in Seminyak - the food was amazing and atmosphere was fantastic.

The only criticism we would have of Puri Saron is that it was quite expensive and they did seem after your money.",Puri Saron Seminyak
803,Puri Saron Bali,30,March 2010,"rooms very average and complex dated. Breakfast adequate, but difficult to get tea coffee most times. Never seem to have change at the poolside bar, having to wait up to 45 minutes. Complimentary shuttle bus non existant, but transport available for a price. Away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta in a quiet area",Puri Saron Seminyak
804,"great place, peaceful, quiet, away from the bustle a bit",50,March 2010,"we had a ground floor bungalow, clean, gardens glorious, pool complex wonderful, staff exceptionally nice, right on Seminyak Beach; breakfast was good, lots of choice, the meals offered for lunch and dinner a bit limited, but its only a short walk to the restaurants of Seminyak to fix that problem... the rooms were a bit dated, but who cares, wonderfully relaxing time, and after a hard day touring (or shopping) a fantastic place to return too..",Puri Saron Seminyak
805,The star rating got it right,40,March 2010,"We stayed for nine nights at the Puri Saron in a Deluxe room. This resort is rated as a 3.5 star resort and that is spot on. The rooms are clean, and stay beautifully clean thanks to the friendly, attentive staff. But they are a bit dated. We were advised to upgrade to a deluxe room and I am glad we did. We had a safe in our room, a king size bed and a big bathroom. The location is great, it's walking distance to Legian but just far enough away that you get the benefits that Seminyak offers, boutique shopping, relaxed atmosphere, a great selection of spas etc. The pool is nice, and breakfast is quite tasty but we found it repetitive so despite it being included in our package, we went out a few mornings.
The only way you would be disappointed by this resort is if you have high expectations. Expect this resort to be 3.5 stars and your expectations will be exceeded.",Puri Saron Seminyak
806,Could not fault one thing.,50,February 2010,"From the moment I arrived the staff went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and after only one day, knew my name and room number. The room was perfectly clean and was kept that way during my 10 day stay. The breakfasts offered a large range from the buffet with eggs being cooked fresh to order. The location is ideal if you want to walk along the beach or head up town for the nightlife. This was my 8th visit to Bali but first visit to Puri Saron and I will return.",Puri Saron Seminyak
807,puri saron seminyak,40,November 2009,"very friendly staff, bungalows are great with spacious bathroom and good bed, you can hear the sea from your balcony. breakfast is OK, all bread kind of stuff was dryish but i liked the choice of fresh fruit and the scrambled eggs from the 'eggstation'.",Puri Saron Seminyak

The accomm is basic but nice enough. The swim up bar and pool are nice. The buffet breakfast was varied from cereal to indonesian noodles and rice and was really tasty. The location was really good too, easy walking distance to shops and loads of restaurants.",Puri Saron Seminyak
809,Puri Saron Rooms etc,40,September 2009,"We (2 adults and 2 young children) recently stayed at the Puri Saron Seminyak. We opted for the 'bugalow' accommodation believing that it would offer us more space than a deluxe room. Unfortunately the only difference in size was the bathroom. The bedroom was the same, perhaps slightly smaller than the deluxe room. I would recommend a ground floor room as you can enjoy the beautiful gardens outside your door. The staff were all lovely, very helpful. Nice pool. Breakfast was ok. A big drawback was the inability to call or catch a Bluebird Taxi from hotel. The hotel does not permit taxis to wait in their street as it encourages use of local transport (which is a more expensive option).

Stayed at the Jayakarta last year and preferred the position. Easier access to transport, shopping and restaurants.",Puri Saron Seminyak
810,great location,40,May 2009,"First time we stayed in Seminyak. Great location as queit but still within walking distance of legian. Able to venture out without getting mobbed. Staff at the hotel were very helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Were originally booked in superior room which looked ok but were upgraded to a bungalow as we had requested king bed and were given twins. I would say probably worth paying extra but depends what you are wanting. Normal room was clean and certainly big enough and all rooms had balcony, The bungalow we were in was ground floor and had small garden area which was nice. Breakfast OK but not the best we've had. Would definately stay again",Puri Saron Seminyak
