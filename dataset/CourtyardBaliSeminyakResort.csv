0,Nice holiday,50,April 2023,I love the hotel especially miss Pebri she served us at seminyak kitchen restaurant I love the food at seminyak kitchen restaurant especially the pancakes . And sausages are yummy. I like to stay here. Love to be back again someday.
1,Five ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,50,April 2023,"Great swim up bar with friendly fun pool staff, thanks Surya,Yudi,Widi and Agus‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è. You guys made our time with you so much fun, great fun games of bingo by the pool which we will remember until next time."
2,Courtyard By Marriot Seminyak April 2023.,50,April 2023,"This was the fourth time we have stayed at the Courtyard Seminyak and we still love it. From the moment we checked in we were greeted by the assistant front desk Manager Gede Wahyu Pratama who was so helpful throughout our whole stay. We stayed in a Deluxe Pool View Room with Balcony, which was a good size and cleaned daily. The Breakfasts at the Seminyak Kitchen were definately the best of any hotel we have previously stayed at. the choice of Western and Asian food, the quality of the food and the very helpful staff.
The location of the hotel is great, with many restaurants, Bars and shops on the street just outside the hotel. The Beach is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel also has a shuttle service which takes you to Eat Street, Seminyak, the Beach and up to Legian Street. We can't recommend the Courtyard highly enough. Our favourite hotel in Bali.
Will be back again next year."
3,What an awesome Hoter,50,April 2023,"What an awesome Hotel this is, the rooms are g8, the staff really accomodating, the food is excellent, we had a romantic dinner experience while we were there & the two young lads that looked after us on the evening were just amazing, special mention to Gusadi & Trisna who are both just learning the ropes in the hospitality trade & another shout out to Gede, one of the managers who went above & beyond to make sure our stay was a very memorable experience, 10/10 for this one, congrats to all who looked after us"
4,No Personal Touches,30,April 2023,"We stayed here for 6 nights, while honeymooning in Bali. The hotel is ideal for a family holiday but it's not one I would recommend, if you want to celebrate a special occasion like a honeymoon or birthday. The hotel didn't acknowledge our honeymoon, which we were very disappointed by. It's always appreciated when hotels/resorts recognises special occasions, like ours.
No comment was made, when I mentioned to a receptionist that we were on honeymoon....We really just felt like a number here.

We were originally given room 689, which I would not recommend! The view was pretty poor! We were moved to room 614, which has a lovely view overlooking the pool and gardens. The balcony is a lovely spot to do some reading.

Some of the activities that were organised were poor- the bingo was very short.
Aqua aerobics was good fun and a lovely way to start the day.
The hotel is in a great location, only a short walk to the beach. The shuttle bus is very handy too."
5,My best experience to stay and everything was excellent,50,April 2023,"Firts trip to bali we spent two night for honeymoon everything was excellent we are really enjoying.Service was gracious and
Thank you for Mrs Eka_SPA and Mr Bobby_FB for the best service we really happy to stay here"
6,Good with some flaws,40,April 2023,"Everyone has already raved about this place. So, I will point out some flaws, none of which are very very major. The room design is different from that of a standard hotel room. While some might find this a refreshing change, for me it's not very logical. For example, having the bar/drinks-making area away from the bathroom, where one needs to get water. Another thing is the place to put one's luggage juts out into the walking area, and I've injured myself with this several times. Another weakness is the lack of a sauna and steam room, and the gym is far too small, being crowded most of the time, which is a safety concern when working out. Two annoyances that are not the fault of the hotel. One is every day in the evening there is burning of something in the vicinity, thus the smell and smoke comes into the rooms if you open your balcony door. Second is that the hotel guests are mainly families with young children, resulting in chaos, noisy running around, shouting, screaming, crying, banging of doors, all of which are clearly heard inside one's room, even though my room was rather secluded on the top floor away from the lobby. I will not repeat the good things about this hotel said by others but I want to highlight 2 things. One is that I have never seen house keeping being done so well and thouroughly before of a hotel. Second is that staff are quick to solve problems when they are brought up."
7,An A+ to stay while in Seminyak,50,March 2023,"A great place to stay, staff were helpful and accommodating. Room is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great, a lot of variety where you can choose from. And the dinner I had with my friend at the rooftop was remarkable. Arya and Chinta are amazing. Arya was so intertaining, has a good sense of humor and whom you can easily talk with while waiting for our dinner to be serve. Both on them were approachable and act on time when we need something. Thank you all guys, hoping to be there whenever we will visit bali again."
8,Great stay and amazing location!,50,April 2023,We absolutely loved our stay at Courtyard by Marriott! We loved everything about the hotel. The highlight of our stay was our house keeping attendant Buda! He was the sweetest and most humble man we have ever met! He made us feel so welcome and left lovely towel art surprises and sweet notes everyday! We were very sad to discover that he is only a temporary worker at your hotel‚Ä¶ his passion and attitude for his job was incredible! Marriott please hire this man as a permanent staff at your hotel. He is amazing for your guests and will ensure they feel just as special and satisfied as we were. We request that you personally let us know when Buda has been made a permanent staff member at your hotel and we will definitely be back to stay and recommend your hotel to all our family and friends! Thank you Buda and Marriott for having such a great person look after us during our stay üôè.
9,"The cuisine was delightful, and the service provided by Arista was outstanding. The buffet breakfast was always enjoyabl",50,April 2023,"The cuisine was delightful, and the service provided by Arista was outstanding. The buffet breakfast was always enjoyable, with a wide variety of options to choose from. We will certainly return in the future, as all of the hotel staff were incredibly friendly. Eka at the reception was particularly kind and provided us with 5-star service, which made our stay exceptionally pleasant"
10,Amazing stay! We will be back,50,April 2023,"What a beautiful place!! Cannot fault at all. We have been to Bali many times & this has to be up there as the best accom we have stayed at. The hotel is clean, beautiful and the staff are amazing. The swim up bar was a major plus and it‚Äôs in a very central location in Seminyak and right near the beach. We would defs stay again. We had a pool room view. Also the food was amazing!!"
11,Perfect hotel for families,50,April 2023,"Where do I start, this hotel was just the best place to stay in Seminyak, especially with an 8 and 5 year old!

The room was perfect with 2 large queen beds for the 4 of us.

The poolside food was really tasty and selection was great. The pools were the reason we chose this hotel, kids had so much fun! Maybe the hotel could add some floaters for children to use?

Loved the buggy service they offer to go nearby and the staff were super friendly! Room service was super and I loved the chicken noodles I got. Laundry service well priced too, saves going home with dirty clothes!"
12,Highly recommended Courtyard Marriott,50,April 2023,"Had our daughters 18th birthday on rooftop bbq buffet. Chinta organised it all and did a outstanding job, thankyou for making it a special night for all of us. The chefs and writers did a amazing job to.
Highly recommend it üëå"
13,Awesome breakfast spread,50,December 2022,We love to book the villa but they do not allow as I have 3 kids. So we went for the family room. Room is clean and comfortable. Breakfast spread was awesome with lots of variety üëçüèª a short walk to the beach and many shops & restaurants nearby. There‚Äôs a buggy that drive us to the nearby shops. Wish we could stay a few more days to try out the activities and pool.
14,Very Nice!,50,April 2023,"Very good hotel!
Close to the beach, it is a short walk distance or the hotel offers a cart ride too.
The restaurant is very nice, we had a nice dinner there.
Breakfast is the best, a lot of option and fresh food.
We had great time there.
I will recommend this place!"
15,"Gyamfuaa Court, Kumasi",50,March 2023,This is the Best Place in Kumasi when it comes to Luxury and Private living....Everything works. Period. There is absolutely neatness and top notch appliance. It makes Marriott Residence Inns looks like Motel 6 or in comparison. Wonderful work in the curating and artwork and sculptures .....
16,Great hotel in Seminyak with a few caveats that can be improved,40,March 2023,"Courtyard Seminyak is one of my favorite Courtyard hotels. I stayed here for 9 nights and my detailed reviews below.

What‚Äôs so nice about this hotel:
1) Location. This hotel is located at the heart of Seminyak area. Which can be a pros and cons depending how you see it. It‚Äôs not beachfront but beach is just 5-mins away. It‚Äôs in the main street, so traffic noises would be an issue especially if you got the room that facing the main streets.

2) Room. My first 5 nights, I was staying in Deluxe Pool View Room. The room is a bit small, but still decent for a solo/couple. Plenty of space to put stuff. If you travel with family, you may want to consider booking a suite. View from 610 is amazing as you got a whole resort view. My only issue with the room is the lack of hanging rack for drying your clothes.

The last 4 nights, they upgraded me to a suite which is double the size of standard deluxe room. However, the other half is occupied by a living space with decent size dining table and living room. The view from 660 however is not as good from 610.

3) Facilities. Huge swimming pool, swim bar, spa, gym, and poolside beds are available for all guests. They‚Äôre pretty decent. The gym is small but maintained pretty well.

4) On-site restaurants and eateries. They‚Äôre good but price-wise is a bit expensive. Breakfast has a lot of variety every morning. Great coffee by Tanamera.

5) Services. Top-notch! All associates are very nice and helpful. From the security, front desk, housekeeping, Seminyak Kitchen, they are very lovely and consistent. Definitely feel like a 5-stars resort.

Now what not so good and needs to be improved:

1) While they have a lot of F&Bs variety, I think the taste is hit and miss. For example, the meatball soup and fish soup, why it has so much oil? I can‚Äôt really taste the broth. It‚Äôs just too oily. The beef bulgogi also a miss. The beef is too thick and too chewy.

2) The F&B promotions also inconsistent and unclear. Sometimes elite member discounts were given, sometimes were not.

3) Housekeeping, please stop turning on all the lights after cleaning up the room. It‚Äôs such a waste of energy and very opposite with sustainability mission from Marriott.

4) Nyepi day activities didn‚Äôt align with the meaning of Nyepi day spirit. Beer pong? Bingo? Really? I understand hotel guests ate exempted but I really wish the hotel management could‚Äôve done a better job at keeping the noise and light level down to respect with the locals. Whoever organized those type of activities during Nyepi day should be ashamed. It‚Äôs both disrespectful and disgraceful. Please for the <3 of God, do better!

Looking forward to stay again and hopefully the hotel management able to improve things that I mentioned."
17,I'd score 100 stars I'd I could. Truly amazing stay!,50,March 2023,"Absolutely amazing service from every person we have come across. We are currently staying in room 622 and its in the perfect spot. Overlooking the garden and pools areas. The room is a good size and the bathroom is also very large. The housekeeping staff do a wonderful job of keeping the room spotless. Everything we could possibly need has been provided. Every staff member we have encountered from every department has been so cheery and so polite. They've even made efforts to get to know our names. We've never told them, they made efforts to find out themselves. We arrived the day before the nyepi celebration, or silent day as some call it and the staff made huge efforts to ensure the guests were happy and comfortable and that we were impacted as little as possible by not being allowed to leave the hotel, it was honestly nice to just spend the day around the pool and relaxing so we didn't mind at all. We are here on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast is wonderful. There is fruit, cereal, bagel, juices, omelette as well as the usual bacon etc. There is also more traditional Indonesian items on offer. You can even get waffles and ice cream! We have had and evening meal here and it was delicious, so much so we have booked the romantic dinner under the stars on the roof for this evening. The prices for the standard of food are actually really good. Around what we would pay for pub grub at home but with the standards of a high end restaurant. The hotel is clean, well kept and of a very high standard but the true value is in the staff. They really do go above and beyond to make sure we are having a good time and have everything we could need. Every single one is a credit to the marriot brand. We've stayed in beautiful hotels all over the world, and this is by far the best service we've ever had. I honestly would give 100 stars if it was possible. The service has been flawless, we honestly feel valued as guests and so very welcome. The beach area is super too, with complementary water and towels, also very good free wifi. Thats where i am as i write this review. We still have another 9 days to go yet and I'm already planning when we can come back 5* üòò"
18,Amazing !,50,March 2023,"I never expected such a high quality of service. And the food was absolutely perfect. Wow guys
We did a gender celebration and the team of the hotel created for us the best experience I could imagine .thank you !!!

Special gratitude to Chinta and The FB team üôèüèª"
19,Mind the attitude of your pool side bar waitress.,40,March 2023,"All ok except the attitude of the pool side bar waitress name wahyu. Ruining the whole stay. The least you can expect from any hotel should be hospitality and manners from their staffs.
Im surprised this hotel has a staff with behaviour like that. They should be trained on how to handle their customers with descent level of politeness, at the very least."
20,Courtyard Marriott Seminyak,50,February 2023,"I cannot rate my stay here high enough! Right from the start, the staff were friendly, welcoming and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. The rooms are spotless, modern and extremely comfortable.
There was a golf buggy to take you to the beach and back again if needed but ample space around the beautiful pool to chill and relax.
The breakfast here was also incredible! One of the best I‚Äôve ever had. So much to choose from and all homemade, fresh and absolutely delicious! The chocolate and banana granola was to die for!
I can honestly say as a very experienced travelled, I had the perfect stay here and would certainly recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs thinking about going to Bali! Incredible! Thank you!"

22,Not value for money,30,March 2023,"The hotel's location is convenient, being in close proximity to the beach and other popular areas. However, the room had a strong mildew odor, which unfortunately seems to be a common issue in warmer climates. Given the price of $800 AUD for a three-night stay in a twin pool access room, I was expecting higher quality accommodations. The distance between the room and lobby was quite far, and the toilet paper provided was of poor quality, with no bidet or hose as I have encountered in other hotels in the area. The pool was always crowded, making it difficult to enjoy. On a positive note, the service provided by the staff was good, and they were quite friendly. The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning was effective. The breakfast offered was average, although quite busy. Overall, I don't believe this hotel is worth the money and wouldn't choose to stay here again."
23,Nothing I can complain about. Just a perfect stay,50,March 2023,"I don‚Äôt know were to start. This hotel is amazing because of one simple thing: the staff!! But besides that everthing is clean, the pool is amazing, the ping pong table with Yudi (activity guy) is super, the service in restaurant and inroom dining are high standard. I could go on for hours. We loved out stay at this hotel and will come for sure!

Cheers, Dennis"
24,Friends visit march 2023,50,March 2023,Had the best time 5 friends in their 60‚Äôs plus. Had a ball all the staff were fantastic Maria from the kitchen was excellent üëç All the guys from the pool aerobics were fun and entertaining loved our stay would definitely recommend to stay and will come back again for sure üëçüòú
25,"Great place to stay, nice quiet rooms close to beach",50,March 2023,"We stayed at the Courtyard on recommendation of our adult daughter who had recently stayed here and we can see why she loved it. The hotel has amazing gardens and is very well kept . The rooms are clean and modern with the most amazing housekeeping staff who cleaned our room beautifully each day. The breakfasts are amazing with a vast variety of foods, hubby loved the bagels ü•Ø The hotel has a daybed area on beach strip where you can sit and enjoy the view . All staff were so professional and friendly. I liked the location as close to the beach but far enough away you don‚Äôt get any beach noise and as light sleepers we enjoyed relaxing nights of sleeps. The aqua aerobics was fun and we loved the Balinese night was sensational too!"
26,Next time I will choose again.,50,March 2023,"The service is good. The restaurant provides great food. Very impressive experience, such as the BBQ night on Wednesday, Romantic dinner on the rooftop on Thursday.
The staff are very friendly and helpful. The trip I booked via here was excellent as well, worth the every dollar you spent."
27,"Activities at the Marriott Courtyard, fabulous, fun and free! We had a great time and met so many wonderful people!we wi",50,March 2023,"What a great time doing water aerobics every day! Instructors such fun especially Widi and Surya! So funny and enjoyable!

All free just fun!
Join in the services they offer and meet new people from all over the world!"
28,Very comfortable Stay,50,March 2023,"Me and 3 friends have been here for 2 weeks. The rooms were very comfortable. We felt very secure. The service, specially from Chinta, Trisna and Gus was perfekt. Chinta accompanied us from the beginning till the end. We had a couple nice conversations that made the vibe perfectly.
The food was extensive. The drinks as well. When we arrived, we were received like the royal family on the first day. We‚Äôd like to coma back again. We also had a private BBQ dinner for about 1.800.000 SGD pp. Trisna led the dinner the whole time. He was extraordinary friendly and did everything like expected and beyond."
29,Stay at Seminyak,50,March 2023,"We visited the Seminyak Beach and parked ourselves at the Courtyard Beach side. Surya was very helpful and friendly! We enjoyed with him and he has amazing English. While it was very hot, he offered us some water and drinks and is a very happy chap!"
30,"Great hotel, I love it!",50,March 2023,"This is my first experience to stay in Courtyard for honeymoon.

A very big thank you to the entire managment & staffüôèüëå"
34,Great stay with amazing service,50,January 2023,"AMAZING SERVICE.
My husband and stayed here for a week and we could not recommend it more. Especially as a bonvoy member, the hotel really makes you feel special. I want to start by thanking Cica for a wonderful check in welcome, she really made the start of the holiday wonderful! Eka was also wonderful, her service and hospitality was great! We had a few issues with our room ( nothing big ) and they were able to accommodate and fix the matter swiftly. Special shout-out to Bobby the F&B manager who made our dinning experiences great. All the staff at the courtyard Marriott really so go above and beyond for their guests and would recommend it highly.

My only suggestion is the consistency of the drinks across the bars. My husband and I enjoyed the delicious bloody Mary‚Äôs and aperol tonics by the pool bar- however when we ordered the same at the seminyak kitchen ( for the dinner dinning) the drinks were completely different. Obviously made at different bars and with different bar staff. We actually couldn‚Äôt finish them as they were poorly mixed and the ratios seemed off. Only suggestion would be to ensure the consistency of drink standards across the hotel. Pool bar drinks are 100!

Can‚Äôt wait to come back at our next Bali stay."
35,"Great value, service and location.",50,February 2023,"Great service and value. Staff are friendly, great service from Chinta!. The rooms are clean and tidy. I've stayed here a few times now as it's located not far from Eat Street. There are good food options if you just want to eat and laze by the pool. There is a spa and gym as well as a breakfast buffet and kids play area."
36,Water aerobics at 11,50,March 2023,Went to Bali with mum and wanted somewhere easy and considerate‚Ä¶. Done! The staff have been lovely. did water aerobics with Surya today he was very friendly and kept us giggling with an entertaining water dance routine. Fun!
37,Best Staff & Hotel Ever,50,January 2023,"This was our 4th time staying at this hotel, safe to say it‚Äôs still as good as ever! The most welcoming and friendly staff ever (shoutout to Tek & Ari specially) the cleanliness is unbelievable and the food is amazing!! We wouldn‚Äôt pick any other place to stay when visiting Seminyak, keep up the amazing work. See you again soon üëå"
38,VERY GOOD HOTEL TO STAY,40,December 2022,Hi all stayed there during the new year of December 2022 with my family and brother from AUS.The hotel is very good.The check-in was very smooth and the rooms are also nice . The service is excellent with the ever-smiling face of staff members. The food spread was very good but they need to add more Asian food to the menu keeping in view the flow of Indian tourists. The new year party was very average though. The pool was very good with swim in bar....
39,Amazing hotel,50,February 2023,"Such an amazing stay! Staff are consistently friendly and helpful, pool area is to die for and so convenient being the central part of the hotel. Suryya & Yudi we‚Äôre such fun staff who worked at the pool, got us to play games for competition to win a free Bintang. Surrya hosted water aerobics and it was so fun and such a laugh! Highly reccomend this hotel!"
40,Best hotel,50,February 2023,"The best atmosphere and absolutely love the aerobics everyday at 11am with Surya !!!! Love the energy ! All staff have been so accommodating and very friendly always with a smile on their faces!!
We can‚Äôt wait to come back :)"
41,Amazing stay!,50,February 2023,We had so much fun and the service from all staff was outstanding. Mr. Angga at the taco truck was very friendly and he does serve the best tacos and drinks in Seminyak! Highly recommended:) we‚Äôll definitely be back :)
42,Outstanding,50,January 2023,"We have just completed our 9 night stay at Courtyard Marriott! Everything has been just amazing, the staff are absolutely all amazing and a very special shout out to the pool bar staff, Penny, Ayu, Alit, Mob, Ketut and Debu each and everyone of you looked after my family and went the extra mile to make our stay so special.

To the Courtyard Marriott Staff, you people make this place great! We can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay again soon."
43,Best customer services!,50,January 2023,"We spent our CNY holiday at Courtyard hotel Seminyak with my family and our 7 months old baby, and we were all amazed by the quality of the customer services! Truly outstanding! I've been travelling a lot for holidays and work, staying in numerous 5 stars hotels, and it is probably the best service i ever received. The team will do their maximum to assist you, and if something is not up to your expectation, they will find a way to make it up to you. I want to give a special compliment to Eka, the loyalty officer, who is a true gem, always with a smile and professional attitude. I can't thank her enough."
44,Zanti Spa Arik and Gym Yudi,50,January 2023,"Good spa experience and massage are the best
Warm welcoming from yudi and arik in spa and gym
Will come back again when visit Bali
All friendly people in Bali
Recommend place to visit
Terimakasih Semua"
45,Review,50,January 2023,"Surya was the best attendant that I‚Äôve ever seen. Not only was he attentive, but he was warm and joyful at all times. His boxing lessons are a must-try and he clearly deserves a raise!!

Air was also amazing and was very cheerful!!"
46,Good hospitality,50,January 2023,"I am a loyal guest and member at Courtyard Seminyak and Bonvoy. why do i always choose courtyard seminyak? In Bali I have never found service friendliness in all parts of the hotel, from the start of check-in we will be greeted warmly by Bli Wahyu, Pak Ramu, Mbok Santi, Pricilia and Eka, the cleanliness of the rooms is quite well maintained. especially you will find warmth from their service in the Seminyak Kitchen area, they have a good chef with delicious variations and tastes, you will be warmly welcomed by the service of Pak Bobby, Mbok Ayu, Mbok Indah, and we will meet again with Eka. but most importantly almost all workers in the courtyard are trained to provide friendly service."
47,Lovely place to stay,50,January 2023,Beautiful place to stay room superd i love it the view after 2 days explored Bali when i came back i was surprise by your room attendent Buda & Wisnu decorated my room towel so beautiful after so tired whole day it make me smile. Thank you Courtyard Seminyak make my day i guessed i had to extend another night hahahah.
48,Vacation with family,50,January 2023,"Love our 7 days at Courtyard! The staffs were helpful and polite. The breakfast was fabulous, lots of choices. We love our hotel driver (Komang) who always ready 24/7 to drive us around. The spa was fantastic. Overall it was a great and memorable vacation. One of the best courtyard marriott so far!"
49,"Great location, great rooms, value for money",40,January 2023,"Got a 2 bedroom pool view suite .

Simple review,

1.Great staff service 9/10
2.Food in resturant better than some others in surrounding 9/10
3. Rooms 8/10
4. Location 10/10
Worth the price and location. Would recommend for couples or family's."
50,Happy Honeymoon,50,January 2023,"We came to Bali for our honeymoon and had a great time. The Courtyard Marriott was a wonderful place to stay. Close to everything and all of the facilities were great. We loved the pool and swim up bar in the evenings. The included breakfast had a great variety of international foods and we could try something new everyday. The spa was beautiful and my two massages were relaxing, just as they should be. The rooms were cosy but comfortable with a great bed and pillows and a nice sized balcony over looking the pool. Most of all we loved the staff and the warmth of the people. Special shout out to our favourite waiter Arya and to Eka. We would 100% stay here again."
51,Second Time Was Even Better!,50,December 2022,"This was the second time we have stayed here and this time was even better than the first!

The hotel is very clean as are the rooms (big too). We like the area for walking around (some good restaurants and massages close by) as well as being a short taxi ride to different areas of interest.

But what REALLY makes this place amazing to us are the staff! First there was Eka who not only remembered us from our previous trip three years ago, but also that we had to rush home for a family emergency! That was so shocking that she actually cared so much to remember. We saw her every morning at breakfast and shared stories of each others lives and adventures. Her professionalism and sincerity was off the charts. She is absolutely the face of that hotel!

Along with her, we have to also give to shout out to Pebri and Anini. During our stay, we wanted for nothing as these two energetic people where always there with smiles, quick jokes and amazing service! We left our stay there feeling like we had new friends in Bali. Thank you ladies!

All in all, it's a really good hotel to stay in and it earns many extra points because of all the wonderful people that work there."
52,Great stay!,50,January 2023,"Had a great experience at this hotel. Rooms was immaculate and shower was out of this world! What really made it was the staff, they couldn't do enough. Constantly smiling and happy and always ready to help with everything. Special shout out to Surya, Yudi, Dika, Alex,Prana, Agung & Adi. Wish I could remember all the staff's names. Definitely would recommend a stay here."
53,As good as JW or Ritz in the West,50,January 2023,"Fantastically run hotel - with super friendly and helpful staff, modern and clean rooms, and a spectacularly delicious breakfast buffet. The location is also 5 minutes walk away from a bustling beach with lots of cool beachfront restaurants.

I‚Äôm a titanium level Marriott member and this is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve been to in the portfolio outside of their St. Regis hotels and some Asian W Hotels. This is a great alternative to W Seminyak for those who don‚Äôt want to splurge."
54,Great little hotel in Seminyak,40,December 2022,"We had a good stay at this hotel. Unfortunately for us, this was our first hotel of our 3 week holiday and when we went down to have a swim on our first hour after arrival my son slipped on the step by the pool and injured his head. Fortunately there was some kind of medical conference happening at the hotel and so we had access to doctors and nurses who suggested we head to the hospital. The hotel gave us free transport to the hospital which was very kind. Long story short, my son was fine just a nasty accident and the hotel was very helpful. The manager was in contact straight away and staff kept in touch throughout our stay to make sure he was ok. Manager asked to meet so we could show him where my son slipped and he assured us this would be fixed. Lovely staff, good breakfast, good pool area and great location.. Loved our adjoining rooms. Would definately stay again."
55,Great stay in Bali,50,January 2023,"Great location, nice facilities and excellent staff!!! We landed in Bali for some good time off and we are super happy we chose this establishment. Near the beach, but with plenty of choices for restaurants, shopping and even clubbing - we were never short of things to do. A great shout out to the excellent staff. In particular Alfi at the reception, who welcomed us and took care of all our queries from our arrival onwards. Gus Dek at the pool bar (it is a swim up bar for the lovers of the genre) and all the guys there made sure we were properly hydrated throughout the day. Finally the Seminyak kitchen restaurant has a nice spread for breakfast and very kind waiters - thank you Trisna! All in all a great stay.

One room tip: get the inner view rooms over the pool. The streets can be noisy, plus you are protected from too much wind."
56,"Amazing location, INCREDIBLE team",50,December 2022,"Everything great you would expect from a Marriott hotel. Clean rooms, great service, awesome food, and tons of facilities for the kids.
However, the team here are the stars of the show. The BEST service you could wish for. I stupidly left my phone in a grab car the day before we left. Within 5 minutes security were on the CCTV looking for the number plate, Ari the concierge was helping me navigate Balinese websites, Tony the manager immediately came down to see if he could help and started a service ticket on the phone with Grab. Once we located the phone via Find My Samsung Tony called Ari and he immediately hopped on his bike and drove me to find it! We spent 1.5 hours driving around the city together looking in cars and asking locals (who were incredibly helpful) with no luck, but at least I returned with a friend rather than empty handed. The next day Tony had done a full handover to the new day manager and Nyssa on the desk was fully aware of the situation and still following up with Grab. By midday the driver returned with my phone! Every security guard I've seen since has asked if my phone was returned and they were all escatic to hear the good news. Amazing performance and communication all round.
Thank you so much Courtyard Seminyak. I'll be back!"
57,Comfortable stay in Seminyak,50,October 2022,"Located at a good location in Seminyak, walking distance to the beach with a convenience store just around the corner. Breakfast buffet is extensive and delicious. More importantly, my Bonvoy platinum elite status was recognized and given 4pm late checkout."
58,A memorable stay,50,December 2022,"Once Again, Courtyard did not disappoint. This was our 6th visit and first post lockdown and its was as welcoming and great as even. We were welcomed like family. The weather in Bali was a bit of a damper so did not get to use the pool as much as we would have liked to. The breakfast spread was great and room facilities were great. Location of the Marriot is very good and they still provide a complimentary shuttle service to Seminyak Street, Eat street and the Beach. I could rave on about all the good things forever. The christmas buffet dinner was great too. Thank you to the team for a great stay.
All the team from Room cleaners to the management are very happy to help and a pleasure to deal with. Some names that stand out are Hardi and his team (Ari, Arya, Sopari among others) who are always will to go the extra mile arranging transport, resturant bookings etc. Penny, Ayu and all the staff at the pool bar for their great service.
Devi, the barista, what great service from her. She knew my morning coffee order and would be more then happy to make it the minute she saw me. Thank you. Eka , the customer relations officer would go out off her way to ensure we were comfortable in any manner. Laurens , the general manager who we met for the first time was easy to approach and had some great chats with us. Ramu and Wahyu, it was a pleasure to meet you and deal with you .

All in all , thank you team Marriot. We will be back in the next few months."
59,Memorable family stay at the Marriott Courtyard,50,December 2022,"Excellent and memorable family stay at the hotel during Xmas 2022. Very polite and helping staff, excellent facilities and awesome location. We had booked a family room for the 4of us. The hotel staff goes out of the way to make your stay comfortable"
60,Nicest Courtyard I have stayed it.,50,December 2022,"A short but pleasant stay at this wonderful well located hotel in Seminyak. Was fortunate to be welcomed, checked in and also checked out by Eka, the guest relations manager. Initially surprised that breakfast is not complimentary despite my Titanium status but Eka was again very gracious to extend an imitation as she was keen for me not to miss the wonderful spread. The breakfast did not disappoint.
I was also upgraded to pool facing room on the far end of the building close to the kids club. I was initially concerned it was going to be noisy but but it turned out to be very quiet. The whole compound was well maintained, clean. The entire staff was always smiling and helpful. Such a delight. Keen to return for a longer stay."
61,"Amazing pool, Bingo!",50,December 2022,"Next to pool bar, shaded area, nice vibe with good music playing. Amazing staff Surya Awidi at the pool bar. Very friendly and professional. The ambience is amazing. We had a ball playing Bingo!

Pool is also amazing, split into 2 ie one with swim up bar and other more relaxed and low key."
62,Best resort in the heart of Seminyak,50,December 2022,Perfect location close to shops and restaurants. The resort is amazing. Great facilities and friendly staff. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a wonderful holiday in Seminyak. I am a returning guest and every time I have had a great experience.
63,A very happy guest !!,50,December 2022,"My second time here and I‚Äôm never disappointed. The resort is perfect ! The facilities, rooms and location are fantastic. The staff are amazing - friendly and helpful and go above and beyond to ensure the guests are having a wonderful time. I will return again! My husband came to celebrate his birthday and our wedding anniversary and the staff made it even more memorable for us. Thank you !"
64,This is probably the best Courtyard in the world,50,December 2022,I couldn't think of a single fault or deficiency of this hotel during my one week stay. The spa in on site and excellent as well and the food and dining options. It's a 10 minute walk to the beach with a thriving nightlife scene.
65,Failed wedding anniversary surpriseüòÇ,10,December 2022,"I booked the room for celebrating our wedding anniversary through my travel agent, and already put some detail about our wedding anniversary in advanced , hope for some little surprise no matter what the surprise will be, because as a guest we love some little surprise, attention to detail and caring feeling we received from the hotel.

Long story short we checked in at 8 dec 2022, and I repeat our concern that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary to the front office officer, I though that all is good üòä

Turns out we have nothing in a room just standard plain bedsheets, not even greeting card or some little cake or fresh fruit üòÇ

I complained to my agent, and my agent show me the proved that already put some detail on the booking system, then I emailed the marriot representative to inform this condition, surprisingly the answer was shockingüòÇ the representative said that Courtyard isnt full service hotel like the other Marriott chains hotel we've been there before (come on, even the 3 star hotel could provide the best service they could, for just little greeting card with some fresh cut fruits it's make the guest feel special for sure )

Despite this problem, overall this hotel gave decent service as the hotel should be. Thx"
66,What a hotel with beautiful people,50,November 2022,"First class hotel with very attentive staff that can't do enough for you,
Food was excellent and sugar sands 1st class,staff around cave pool bar was also fantastic. all wrapped in a great position for the beach.
Shops are a a 15 to 30 min walk but its cheap to get taxi everywhere.
Done alot of trips with our favourite to a temple, ubud and best of all was bali zoo dping the mud fun, all in all a trip of a life time thank you bali"
67,"A beautiful, relaxed holiday",50,December 2022,"We stayed at Courtyard by Marriott in Seyminyak recently. Can not fault any of it. All the staff everywhere were so friendly, helpful, and smiling. Our room was great, was clean, and had comfortable beds. We had everything we needed. The dining room and bars were fantastic, offering a great range of food/drinks, the pool area maintained perfectly. The atmosphere was superb. Their Christmas decorations are so beautiful and colourful. I highly recommend staying here."
68,"Most divine food, excellent accommodation, quality service",50,December 2022,"The food is delightful! Arya served us with excellent service and found out he was the newly chef as well. The food was absolutely of the charts but not only the taste, the presentation was beautiful!! Best hotel/restaurant in Bali!!"
69,Doing it right in Bali!,50,November 2022,"For excellent quality of food, service and smiles, look no further than this resort. Conveniently located amid many excellent restaurants and shopping stalls in Seminyak, the Courtyard provides an all round experience of luxury and local hospitality.

There are 2x ATM‚Äôs and a Mini-Mart directly across the road.

We were surprised but relieved at the security measures at the front of the resort, assuring a safe and worry-free stay.

Boasting 3 outdoor swimming pool areas and a lovely swim up bar, there is room for everyone to enjoy the Courtyard on those warm days!

The hotel rooms are spacious, air-conditioned and very well appointed, with a very high degree of hygiene. Extremely comfortable bed and large bathroom. Loved the shower.

The breakfast buffet was amazing!! Something for every taste and quite a bit more. Food was fresh and beautifully prepared, the service prompt and friendly.
Dinner at the restaurant was very nice too.

We enjoyed a massage in the Zanti Spa, which was a delicious experience in a beautifully appointed suite, after a day of exploring our surrounds.

We loved every moment of our stay and will be sure to recommend this oasis to anyone. We hope to return soon."
70,Amazing. Relaxing. Luxury.,50,November 2022,Amazing! Breakfast was top notch with plenty of choices. Indonesian was my fave. Who wants to eat western food when in Bali??? Staff very friendly especially Ari who was spot on with his recommendations of where to eat or shop! Sorry Ari we didn‚Äôt get to see you again before we left! But thank you. We will definitely be back.
71,Can not fault this resort,50,November 2022,I stayed at Courtyard by Marriott- Seminyak in November. I can not fault the staff of the hotel itself. The buffet breakfast and restaurant meals are top tier. I had the pleasure of meeting Pebri who is a staff member at Courtyard. She was so lovely! And super attentive to every need. She always went above and beyond for me during my stay and she made Courtyard by Marriott- Seminyak that much better!
72,It‚Äôs a block of flats with a pool,30,November 2022,"I don‚Äôt know where the great reviews come from but here is my opinion.
The courtyard is actually a lot of small rooms (delux) with a balcony where you have the splendid view of everyone else in their small rooms. To entice you they offer a suite which is another small room with small room sitting area. Plus balconies so you can look at everyone from two balconies.
To be fair the rooms are clean,TV has lots of channels but it‚Äôs tight for a couple especially with the slightly open plan loo.
The general are is scruffy outside, restaurants with a seat near a busy road .. the beach is a construction site and the hotel beach is way down near the double six.

Happy hour is the uninspiring middle of the courtyard is 150 for two. I was paying 75 for one at the grya Santrian in sanur which actually is a nicer area.

If you want a ‚Äúfeel of Bali ‚Äú this is more a feel of a gulag, I won‚Äôt stay again but it all comes down to taste I guess.
Ps. The breakfast is about 15 usd. Do yourself a favour and turn right outside , second restaurant down is the Puri Cendana. Fresh eggs ( poached beautifully) bacon, toast coffee and fresh mango juice half the price with lovely staff. N"
73,Absolutely fantastic!,50,November 2022,"The most amazing hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at, from the food to the service. 5star all round. One of the waiters named Arya was fantastic made our stay very pleasurable. Highly recommend staying here as you will be very well looked after. Rooms are air conditioned & cleaned everyday. A lot of entertainment including live bands & dances. This is my first time in bali & courtyard has made it a memorable one. Thank you so much. We will be visiting again!"
74,LOVED this property!,50,October 2022,"Stayed at this property on my own after attending a wellness retreat in Bali.
The property itself is beautiful, and the staff here were outstanding.
I‚Äôve stayed in many Courtyard Marriotts over the years, and hands down, this is one of the best I‚Äôve experienced.

The young lady that checked me in was exceptional, and went above and beyond to ensure that my preferences were met, and that I had everything I need. Including a late checkout, as I had an evening flight out the next day. She was so accommodating, providing me with a 3pm courtesy checkout, plus offering to ensure that my luggage was held so that I could enjoy the pool some more while waiting to go to the airport.

The rooms here were absolutely beautiful, with lovely views overlooking the pool area.

I ordered room service as well - food was excellent, and the young gentlemen that delivered my food could not have been more polite and professional.

All around fantastic experience, and I hope I get to stay at this property again in the future!"
75,Best hotel crew in Bali !,50,November 2022,"Highest level of service! Greatest praise to the whole team, everyone is always friendly and extremely helpful. At any time, everyone tries to help you and fulfil all your wishes. Marriott can be proud to have such people in the team. Without staff like this, the hotel would only be half as good. Just to count some of the crew -> Eka, Yukti, Pudri, Pebri, Gus Dek!!! Thank so much for everything! You are simply awesome!"
76,Great visit!!,50,November 2022,"This is a fantastic hotel located in a great spot in seminyak. It‚Äôs not on the busy roads but it‚Äôs convenient enough to be able to get to the beach in 5 minute walk or into the center of the city in about a 15 minute walk. The pool area is great with plenty of seating. I enjoyed drinks and lunch in the bean bag chairs. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating and the food in the restaurant was very good. I didn‚Äôt have the breakfast but the dinner I had was great. Pebri is a fantastic server and really made my visits to the restaurant very special. I also used the gym and there is plenty of equipment for any type of workout you want to do. It‚Äôs very clean. The room was spotless and very comfortable. It was nice to have central air :-) and the balcony was great for my morning meditation.

I also participated in the Balinese cooking class it was a great fun and interactive learning experience. Chinta helped me book the class and Chef Surya was super patient and explained the significance of the ingredients used. He even answered all of my questions regarding best practices and cooking tips. I think it is a great class for those who love the unique spices in the Indonesian food and want to learn what they are and how to recreate them. I hope I can find kefir limes and galangal in the states. If you don‚Äôt know what those are they are staples in the food and you should take the class :-). You even get a little cookbook and gift after the class. Great value for everything you get.

As a female solo traveler I really suggest this hotel. I always felt safe and accommodated."
77,Great choice,50,October 2022,"Stayed here for four nights, we loved it, the pool area is great, breakfast is great and the bed was very
Comfy. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was the toilet door was clear glass. There is another door but that encloses the whole bathroom area, so no one can use it if your in the toilet."
78,Great resort for families,40,November 2022,"We only had one night here as we were en route elsewhere, but it was great for our needs. We stayed in the poolside view terrace rooms (a king bed room connecting to a twin room). We were located right at the quiet end of the pool near the kids club, which was great. The kids club caters for kids up to 12. 2 hours per day per child are free for guests, or you can pay for them to stay longer. They‚Äôre open until 8pm, so my husband and I were able to go out for dinner alone whilst they hung out at the kids club - my elder two played video games whilst my youngest did crafts with the attendant. There are daily scheduled activities offered for the kids also. My kids enjoyed the room service menu, from memory there was a dedicated kids menu. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included with our stay, so we decided to walk to Ku De Ta for something to eat. I also want to mention how nice the check-in process was. My son and I weren‚Äôt feeling great after a boat ride from the Gili islands. Whilst my husband was checking in, an attendant offered us cold water and distracted my other two kids w popcorn from their popcorn cart in the lobby. We also left a bag behind when checking out, and once we realised my husband was easily able to message them via the Marriott Bonvoy app to have it located and sent to our next hotel. Such a pleasant experience."
79,Amazing!,50,November 2022,"We have really enjoyed our stay in Courtyard Merriott. From facilities, to amenities and the incredible staff, out stay was a perfection. Spacial thanks to our housekeeping Intan and Dino for keep the room clean, stocked and leaving a super crative towell animals wqitonhbfor us each day."
80,"Brilliant hotel, Brilliant Serviceüëçüëçüëç",50,November 2022,"I stayed at the Courtyard three nights October, then after visiting another island, back for four nights in November. My first visits to this hotel, but what a great time. Everything about this hotel is superb, the building, the facilities, the food, the pool, the service, but most of all the staff. They all go out of their way to make your stay super enjoyable.
Unfair to pick out any individuals, they were all great. That said, special thanks to Ayu in the restaurant, Naomi - the best egg chef in Bali, Nyssa on reception, and finally my room cleaner Intan.
All I can say, is if you can stay at this hotel, do it, you won‚Äôt be sorry."
81,NOT WORTH IT !,20,November 2022,"First time staying at Courtyard Seminyak because I wanted to find a quiet atmosphere but still in the middle of the city. I didn't expect to have such a bad experience, and
just this time also disappointed with Marriot,

1. All requests on traveloka have not been read even 1, so when I arrived at the place, the room was informed that it was ready but the final touch-up was not yet and I was asked to wait until 3 o'clock according to check-in time (even though I asked for an early check-in)

After waiting, about 20-30 minutes I asked again and it turned out that the room was ready but no one called me to hand over the key. (even though I was waiting in front of the FO)

2. Arriving in the room, I entered with an ac room that was not cold. That's why I waited 1 hour
It's more and I set it to 18. But it's still not cold enough.

Finally I called 0 to ask for a room change, and the response was ok and later I will be notified of available rooms or not.

After there was a room available. I already had time to ask and the info, if I moved, didn't want to be too far away, in the middle And the staff agreed, then I was okay and I declined the offer to see the room because I was informed for me to clean up all the dl. After cleaning up my items, I called 0 again for the info and the staff answered that he confirmed and sent a report to the related department. After this wait again 20 minutes but no response. Then I call again.. and 10
Minutes later there was a response. if there was a trolley problem.. (even though I didn't ask for a trolley) I was finally asked to wait for the keys to be delivered.

And after 20 minutes of waiting, I decided to go downstairs. But his statement is different. (rooms at the back of the building, newly prepared rooms)
And it's me who has to go downstairs to get the key. and because it did not match the conversation on the phone, then I canceled the room transfer.

and with the condition that they were tired while holding back their anger they still called to my room. but I ignore it.

then my WA Manager FO apologized because I was tired, so I replied after I woke up and the worst thing was they just apologized.

and I stay in a room that is not comfortable with the air conditioner that is still not cold even though the technician has checked when it's normal.

Sorry, this time I was disappointed with the courtyard Marriot service that I booked with a pretty good rate of 2.2 million, is the Customer Experience service like this, right?"
82,Pool entertainment!,50,November 2022,"Pool bingo by Surya and Jonny was great, gets everybody involved. Plus always better when you win a free drink.
Bar staff are awesome and friendly, special shout out to Penny!
Things like this make courtyard Seminyak the best stay experience"
83,Family Holiday,50,October 2022,"What an amazing family stay in such a great location. All the staff we‚Äôre so welcoming & friendly. We look forward to coming back again. A special thanks to the Kids Club team, our daughter‚Äôs created such a bond with Debby & Komang. Also the concierge team, Hardi, Ari & Arif - were such a great help."
84,Just as I remember it,50,May 2022,"This was the third time staying at Courtyard Seminyak. It was extra special as this was a father daughter visit for just under a week.
It was just as I knew it from last time.
Graciously I was referred to the GM Mr Kritzinger who gave us great insight into the philosophy of the hotel and staff.
I can confirm we were provided with wonderful service from the restaurant, to pool bar room service and room attendants. I might say I believe the Courtyard has the best buffet breakie on the island.
We had a wonderful time at the Courtyard and we look forward to coming back."
85,Shall return!,50,October 2022,"Had a great time during my short stay in Bali.

Conveniently located, close to a number of good restaurants, bars and spas. Theres construction work being done at nearby beach.

Staffs at hotel were extremely friendly and helpful. Special thanks to the concierge team, Rosid, Ari and Hardi - made my stay feel like home!"
86,A real 5 star experience,50,October 2022,"A friend and I booked a trip to Bali through Trailfinders & our 1st stop was Seminyak in the Courtyard Marriot. It really stood to its 5 star rating. I cannot fault this hotel. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are fantastic. They are so upbeat, kind, attentive & really make your stay feel special. They couldn't do enough for us & nothing was too much trouble, extremely accommodating.

The hotel is secure with a body scanner on arrival & 24 hour security & helpdesk. Bottled water is complimentary which was much appreciated, and the breakfast each morning was amazing. The overall ambience was just lovely, whether it was for families/couples/friends, everyone staying just loved it.

We have been to other accommodation here in Bali and nothing has lived up to the standard of this hotel. 10/10 and would definitely go back!"
87,Fantastic hotel experience !,50,October 2022,"Every day we are greeted with smiles and good morning greetings. All employees are very friendly and ready to provide a very satisfying service for our breakfast and stay. Hospitality that does not distinguish every guest who comes is very unique in a company, especially hotels and the tourism sector. We appreciate the hospitality from the General Manager to the public toilet cleaners and other employees who made our holiday very memorable after long pandemic and we are happy to give very good comments to our friends who will come to Bali. Thanks to Mr. Laurens ‚Ä¶ was nice conversations. Mr. Ketut Ramudayana for the complement. Thanks to room attendant‚Äôs Agung, Ayu, Jeri, Pradana, Arya for making our room comfortable. Yudi for Yoga in the morning in the pouring rain keeps his spirit. Loyalty Officer .. Eka‚Ä¶ who is always cheerful every morning and ready to welcome us at the breakfast and all fabulous waiter and waitress at the restaurant. Thank you all the bartenders and waiters at the bar and pool. Thank you to all Courtyard employees who cannot be mentioned one by one‚Ä¶ All one great team. Not to forget thank you for the good service at the Courtyard private beach and the free shuttles to the all important streets and the beach. We will be back !

Ps: when you are polite and good to the people‚Äôs.. you‚Äôll get good and fantastic experiences back. Don‚Äôt put your self better than anyone. Be humble and let‚Äôs the good karma shine on you. Don‚Äôt expect people respecting you if you don‚Äôt give respect to others. After all that matters we are going to die naked without luxuries and status. Namaste."
88,ANOTHER SPLENDID WEEKEND STAY,50,October 2022,"I had the pleasure of returning to the Hotel from 07 to 10 October and after over 2.5 years being absent, it was great being back and to see life and the resort atmosphere up and running.
My sincere thank to the entire team who ensured my stay was awesome. The Seminyak Kitchen Manager, Dea was splendid in her operational duties and going up and beyond the call of duty. She is always ensuring the guests are veery well taken care of and her team are all very efficient as well. Leadership by example indeed..
Thanks also to Eka, the Loyalty Manager who spent time to explain to me the details of my benefits as a Gold member.
I also thank Hardi, at Concierge who still maintains his passion, smile and eagerness to please. Keep it up Hardi - you constantly never have a down moment!
Also big thanks to Satria of Housekeeping who did my room daily at the appointed time and did a job so good, it seemed better than check in standard!! Kudos to Satria and his personality shows in his work.
Good work too from Adi in Banquets who has previously looked after my various events in the Hotel.
All of them are definitely assets to the Hotel.
My thanks also to all the other Team Members and Management who were all splendid and ensured standards were constantly maintained.
With that stated, time to look at the next trip to the Hotel in early 2023.
Cheers ALL."
89,World class Service,50,October 2022,"We stay in Courtyard hotel for three nights for our honeymoon. We will like to specially thank Guest service Rosid for the world class service and make our honeymoon memorable. His service is really world class. He drive us by buggy, recommend delicious restaurant to us and assist us with our luggage. He is helpful, friendly, approachable, and he will take an extra mile to service his guests. He is a great asset for the hotel. I‚Äôm really appreciate for his world class service.

My previous room 635
Name Jacky"
90,Flawless!!! 10/10 recommend.,50,October 2022,The hotel is immaculate and well kept. I checked in with Eka who was super friendly and bubbly. The process was smooth as butter. Security check in the front before you enter the premise made me feel secure. Check in was a breeze. Room was clean and modern. A++++. I‚Äôm coming back to Bali in May and will definitely stay here again. The Marriott team and Eka outdid themselves! A++++!!!
91,Highly recommend this place!,50,October 2022,"What a treat it was to stay here! We‚Äôve travelled to many places around the world and this resort offered the best service we‚Äôve every received. All staff were incredibly welcoming and accommodating. The rooms are nice and housekeeping sometimes leave you little notes or souvenirs when they‚Äôve cleaned your room which we thought was a special touch. Another special touch is that they have a popcorn machine from 1-6pm each day, these little things do not go unnoticed. The pool is situated in the perfect spot for the sun and the pool bar is great. I‚Äôve left a separate review for the hotel‚Äôs restaurant but will make another mention here as the food and service is exceptional. Their buffet breakfast is one of the best we‚Äôve had and the food we had at dinner was delicious too. Thanks for having us, can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
92,Fantastic hotel,50,October 2022,"The Courtyard by Marriott is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in (and I have done my fair share of travelling).

The hotel itself is exceptionally clean, well presented and has brilliant facilities. We made good use of the pool and also played on the table tennis table. It is in a great location and the hotel arranged for a driver (Peter) to take us out for a few days. These were our best days and Peter was so friendly, knowledgable and made us feel at ease. I would definitely recommend using the hotels concierge who arranged this for us.

We had breakfast every day at the hotel - probably the best buffet breakfast I‚Äôve ever had with so much choice and fresh, well prepared food and variety. The staff were so friendly - notably Pebri who took the time to talk to us and was so interested in what we had done the day before.

One evening we went to the Meat Shop and had the most delicious steak dinners. We were lucky enough to have Feby as our waiter but also spoke to Arya and Bayu - all 3 were absolutely fantastic and so accommodating.

We will definitely be back!! Thank you so much Courtyard and all the friendly staff for such a beautiful weeks stay."
93,Great week away,50,October 2022,This is our second stay at the courtyard Marriott Seminyak the first being before covid. The hotel and staff are fantastic. Super clean and the staff are extremely attentive and friendly. We were looked after in the restaurant by Arya and Hery who were especially helpful and friendly. The food for breakfast is extensive and delicious. The quality and variety are excellent. We had the most fantastic stay and will definitely be back again.
94,Cooking class,50,October 2022,"We signed up for the Seminyak Kitchen cooking class. It was amazing. Hari, Chef Uri and Chef Eka were all fantastic. It ended up just being the 2 of us so was our own private clocking class. Fair price and a cute gift at the end. Thank you Holly and Chris from Canada."

Thanks for a great stay."
99,Great place to stay in Seminyak,50,September 2022,"My husband and I, had a pleasant stay for 3 days in Courtyard Seminya last weekend. Mr. Anggi assited us very well and helped us with our travel itenaries too. We stay in the suite room, which was spacious and has a nice balcony to chill while enjoying the pool view. One of my favorite thing is the breakfast menu is amazing !!"
100,Great to finally be back,50,September 2022,"Just returned to Courtyard Marriott after a 3 year absence. So nice to be back!
Beautiful hotel and staff.
The kids are loving it and special shout out the the ladies in the kids club who always go above and beyond and Widi and Joni from the pool bar."
101,Amazing kids club,50,September 2022,"Our kids used the kids club facility at the hotel for few days and they were more than happy to back to the kids club each day! The staff Debby, Komang and Diah took great care of the kids and organised activities to keep them happy and entertained! Highly recommended for families!"
102,Wonderful birthday surprise from the staff members,50,June 2022,"This review is definitely overdue! We visited from Los Angeles in June, and I must say the staff at this location deserves a huge shout out for making it such a special trip for me and my family. The service from the minute we stepped out of our car was excellent. Tiffany was a sweetheart at the front desk. She was able to get us an early check-in, connecting rooms and upgraded us to beautiful balcony pool view rooms. Breakfast buffet at this location was top notch with a huge variety of selection. We were greeted by Trishna at the restaurant every morning with a lovely smile. The beautiful memory that I will always cherish was my birthday surprise from Eka and her team. The team here deserves recognition from Marriott for extending such unsolicited, top quality customer service. We will absolutely return at this location.

-Fatima"
103,Superb Stay!,50,September 2022,"We had a wonderful 5 days at the Courtyard Marriott where we stayed from the 20-25 September‚Äô22. The rooms were comfortable and the pool was so great. Getting to see the local fire dancers on Saturday night (where they have performances at 6pm at the courtyard) was a very nice touch. We also went for the Argentinian Night where the entire courtyard was transformed into a massive BBQ! There was even a live band to serenade us. Courtyard Marriott really put in a lot of effort to give their guests the best experience, well done team!

We want to comment Eka who was polite, patient and kind. From seating us during breakfast as well as making sure that our check out process was seamless! It‚Äôs the staff like her which make this place truly shine.

Also, Gus the poolside bartender made some good drinks! We loved the Strawberry Daquiri and the White Russian he concocted that were going 1- for-1 during happy hour (:

Thank you for giving us 5 star service throughout the trip, we have absolutely no complains, just compliments. We had such an amazing time and we hope to be back very soon!"
104,Great kids club service,50,August 2022,"Nice location, beautifull hotel with kids club and i let my kids there for a day, well taken care by great and dedicated staff debby and diah who did an amazing job,my kids love to play there and begging to come back again, well recomended!!!"
105,Raoyalty STIII after the pandemic,50,September 2022,"My wife and I spent our 32 Anniversary at the Courtyard Seminyak from 8-12 Sept, 2022. The place was very busy, compared to the scene last Feb, 2022, when we were there. It was good to see the Resort functioning at near full capacity and everything was running smoothly. The grounds and rooms are up to their usual high level of maintenance and cleanliness and the ""What the Truck"" sandwich wagon is still an excellent meal deal. We cannot recommend the Hotel, Staff, rooms, restaurant and location highly enough...
Already planning my 74th Birthday stay there for next March!"
106,Great place to stay,40,September 2022,"Great place to stay pool bar is awesome. Surya, dika and yudi where a huge help. The nightly activity's kept us busy. They also have a part of the beach fenced off for hotel stayers.
Highly recommend staying here"
107,Great place to stay!,50,September 2022,"We loved our stay at the Marriott!! The location is a few minutes walk to the beach plus they have a free beach shuttle!

The resort is lovely and the staff are very attentive! The service was fantastic! Narita was lovely! The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have been to.

The only negative was that we left a deposit for food and drink and the staff mentioned a few times (when we tried to put drinks on tab) we needed to leave a deposit when he had. They also said the food and beverage tab was all used (so we paid cash) but on checking out, we had a $120 credit which couldn‚Äôt be refunded. Once I explained that we weren‚Äôt too happy, they returned $50 and offered drinks and food from bar. Unfortunately, we had to go to the airport. I think this is the only small thing that we had issues with. I think better communication would solve it.

Other than that, this resort is amazing. We will be back. We are booked for June 2023. Highly recommend.

Thanks for an amazing holiday!!"
108,Outstanding Service,50,September 2022,"Service, service, service‚Ä¶ you simply can‚Äôt fault it. For those thinking, what‚Äôs Bali like post Covid, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs back and better than ever. The staff here are wonderful and made our family‚Äôs stay memorable and comfortable. A highly recommended hotel for families."
109,Bali holiday,50,September 2022,We have been staying at the courtyard by Marriott Seminyak for 11 nights it has been an absolute pleasure meeting the lovely staff that work there especially three of our favourites Pebri Arya and Teja they were always happy and helpful and always took great care of us we would like to thank management and all the staff for giving us such a pleasurable holiday always in our memories much love Francesco and Gwen
110,9.9/10 (just because full marks is impossible right?) Fantastic stay.,50,September 2022,"This hotel is fantastic. It‚Äôs clean, beautiful, and the staff are very kind and friendly, nothing it too much trouble for them. The pool is nice and the hotel has their own beach section (with a shuttle) and Surya looked after us really well there. It‚Äôs only minutes from the beach where there are lots of nice restaurants and bars. Breakfast is possibly the best I‚Äôve experienced, and I‚Äôm 44, I‚Äôve had loads of them! I can‚Äôt recommend the Marriott enough."
111,"A great hotel, excellent staff and a perfect location",50,September 2022,"My girlfriend and I ended our trip to Bali with 9 nights in the Courtyard Seminyak following some issues in another hotel we booked this early in the morning and checked in that afternoon.

From the minute we arrived we knew we‚Äôd made a good choice, from getting out the taxi to walking into the room the entire check in process was efficient and professional something we hadn‚Äôt experienced much whilst in Bali.

We had a king room with a pool view (I‚Äôd definitely recommend the pool view option over the city view) even with only booking that morning we still managed to get a room on the top floor upon request which was great.

We enjoyed breakfast everyday in the hotel and would advice anyone who stays here to opt for the breakfast included option when booking, they literally couldn‚Äôt do more for you. There are options for all tastes and its the one place in Bali we managed to have bacon for breakfast, so really gave some home comfort.

We both have food allergies and as such good in Bali has been a worry, however not at this hotel. From the moment we made the restaurant staff aware of our allergies everything was catered for with fresh food being prepared each morning. I have to give a special mention to Pebri who went out of her way each day to make sure we where okay and brought our food without needing to ask and was extremely friendly, she has really made our stay extra special by removing the worry for us, thanks Pebri!!

The pool facilities at the hotel are great and cater to both couples and family‚Äôs with two separate level pools with bean bags and sun loungers to both. The upper level has the bar with a swim up pool section and the lower section has a shallower area for kids. The pool and bar staff are very friendly and always happy to help, they also make fantastic cocktails (the White Russians are fantastic). It was great to have a couple of days just relaxing after a busy time travelling around to recharge before doing Seminyak and the surrounding areas.

When looking to venture around Seminyak the hotel is in a perfect location right between both the restaurants and the beach. They have a shuttle which runs all day and into the night where they will drop you at the private hotel beach area or next to the restaurants whenever you like which is really handy in the heat of Bali.

To conclude I would highly recommend this hotel, it‚Äôs been fantastic and if I‚Äôm ever back in Semiyak I‚Äôll be staying here."
112,Perfect stay,50,September 2022,"Find it difficult to find any faults, spotlessly clean, quick and pleasant service nothing too much trouble. Perfect location couple of minutes from beach and bars and restaurants. The breakfast choices were amazing never had so much choice. Traditional Indonesian, noodle bar, continental and the usual eggs and bacon ( poached eggs undercooked for my liking but these personal preference. Fantastic stay thank you Courtyard by Marriot. Last thought we had the moonlight romantic meal Wow rose petals, romantic lighting and the food an absolute delight."
113,First Class & Allergy Friendly,50,September 2022,"This hotel is amazing. It was our first trip to Bali from the UK and from the very start we were made to feel so welcome.

The hotel room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and left exceptionally clean.

The pool side has chilled dance music on throughout the day and the staff speak excellent English. We loved the swim up pool bar and the cocktails are to die for‚Ä¶ my personal favourite was the frozen daiquiri. The prices for drinks and snacks are really reasonable and they have a happy hour 2-4-1 daily.

The shuttle service is amazing too, you can get it anytime and they drop you either at their private beach area (WiFi also included) or to the busy spot for restaurants. It‚Äôs really handy but you can walk it it‚Äôs about 10 mins walk.

The hotel is pretty, modern and has everything you need on your door step. The staff are the heart of this hotel, they really do go the extra mile. I have an allergy to Milk & Nuts and the hotel were amazing with it. Special shout-out to ‚ÄòPebri‚Äô. She really looked after me every morning at breakfast. She had the chef make me everything fresh and she remembered my order every morning. Thank you so much for being so caring! I never felt safer in a hotel with my allergy. Thanks Courtyard for a memorable stay we will be back!"
114,Thank you,50,August 2022,"Location 8/10, 15 minutes walk away from Beach, on main road where there are restaurants, ironing services and food shops
Staff- 10/10, very friendly staff
WIFI - 8/10.
Food - 8/10, tasty breakfasts and other food

There are sunbathing/relaxing area with sunbeams and umbrellas and pools."
115,An affordable few days‚Ä¶..,50,September 2022,"We stayed for 5 nights and honestly couldn‚Äôt fault the place. Our stay was affordable, the service was amazing and for what you pay o would definitely stay here again.
Pembri was our busy for breakfast and after one visit remembered all of our names and made sure our stay was perfect.
Everyone from the transport co ordinators to the bellboys were pleasant and super kind."
116,Widi & Joni,50,September 2022,Played Jenga with Widi and Joni today and they were amazing!!! Hotel stay has been beautiful. Staff are so accommodating! Will definitely be back for our next trip to Seminyak. So many activities to keep you entertained by the pool!
117,Nothing but pleasurable,50,September 2022,"Courtyard at seminyak is first off absolutely beautiful but more than that EVERYONE so friendly and happy to help you! Breakfast was incredible the selection abundant with choice and such great quality. The facilities are impeccable three pools to chose what suits your needs. Never had an issue getting a sun bed! The private beach area was such a lovely little touch with towels, beds, Wi-Fi and water that just made beach life that much better.

As previously said all were so genuinely helpful and great at their jobs but a few stand outs,

Eka, every morning would make sure we had everything we needed and helped arrange anything that we had on our wish list. Great knowledge and extremely helpful

Surya, worked in recreation so helpful in meeting and exceed our needs either pool side or down on the beach. Such great personable skills and such a beautiful approach to the work he was doing.

Yudi, I did a yoga session with Yudi on the roof top. It was stunning! The care and attention given was incredible. Would definitely recommend taking part.

Narita, the best at poolside bar! (Although all were incredibly on the ball). Narita‚Äôs smile and way of working is just enchanting. Always ahead of your needs and done with such grace and beauty.

Hardi, we managed to book an incredible experience of quad biking with Hardi at concierge. He made sure we were looked after and everything was in place for a seamless experience. Took very good care of us.

Overall would go back and stay in a heartbeat!"
118,Great experience,50,September 2022,"Wonderful stay, atentive staff and good location. Close to the beach just 5 minutes walk. delicious food, and great pool. drink at pool bar you have to try,and they have some fun activities to do during your holiday,such bingo,aquarobic and yoga. I have join morning session with yudi,He is very nice and good instructor. Best stay in seminyak. Weldone courtyard seminyak"
119,5 stars for this Marriott! Lots of high end features...,50,September 2022,"Great resort to stay at... we had a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom room - was more like an apartment - spacious, clean... only complaint was small fridge. Room service food was great... room cleaning attendants quick and thorough. Buffet breakfast selection covered everything - great cappuccinos!
Location - while not on the beach is only a 3 minute walk... variety of shops and eateries a one minute walk."
120,Marriott Bonvoy - Viva - At The Courtyard Seminyak,50,September 2022,"Simply the best. A good enthusiastic check - in at the reception by Ms Yukti. They value your membership. A room upgrade. A welcome cookie jar and a glass of fresh juice served in the room. A dedicated efficient manager Ms Eka to service Marriott Bonvoy members. And to top it all, a welcome reception at the poolside for members with cocktails and drinks."
121,Family friendly resort in Seminyak,50,August 2022,"I stayed at this hotel from 18-22 August. My room was on level 6 and faced the swimming pool. It was comfortable and spacious with a writing table and balcony. The staff at this resort are very helpful and cheerful. Breakfast at the Seminyak Kitchen was a sumptuous affair with wide selection of Indonesian, Western and Asian food items.

The only disadvantage of the hotel is that it is around 100 metres from the beach but you can avail yourself of the complimentary buggy service.

The spa was good. I had a relaxing and rejuvenating 90 minute massage at the Zanti Spa."
122,The best cocktails in Seminyak,50,July 2022,"Great five days spent in this lovely hotel! The cocktails are a must especially during happy hour, recommend the iced white Russian.
Rooms are comfortable with a generous sized bathroom and the balcony looked over the gorgeous pool.
Location is great for the beach and local restaurants.
Hopefully we can come back for another visit in the future."
123,Fantastic second home,50,August 2022,"I am here for business, put up in this hotel by my kind client. The hotel is top of the top for Seminyak, amenities and staff alike (the staff had been abdolutely adorable). Very nice swimming pool, pool bar and fitness room, the food is very good (especially breakfast). Well done Marriott!"
124,Great rooms & service,50,September 2022,Professional photos don‚Äôt do this hotel justice. It‚Äôs a great 5* hotel with luxurious rooms and all the facilities you need. I‚Äôm not a breakfast buffet person but my boyfriend loved it. Good location - not exactly in the heart of Seminyak but still within fair distance of everything and very close to the beach. Would recommend!
125,Yudi is the best!,50,August 2022,"We had the best time here!! Yudi in particular was outstanding. He lead yoga for us and it was some of the best yoga I‚Äôve ever done!!! I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel and Yudi enough! He was a great instructor, teaching all levels of yoga and giving adjustments where needed. This resort was the perfect getaway with an amazing pool, spa, and private beach area. We love the courtyard and we love Yudi!!! And also we love Dika and Surya! All my new best friends and fabulous employees!!!!"
126,Awesome hotel in Bali - book it!,50,August 2022,"This is a wonderful and modern hotel in the heart of vibrant Seminyak. The rooms are comfortable with great air conditioning, private balconies with comfortable sofa outside, functional study desk, plenty of water. Breakfast buffet is spectacular as a titanium it was included for two people everyday above and beyond what they are required! Friendly and helpful staff, also given bintangs at checkin which was so kind. Late checkout, excellent gym and great pool area with plenty of sun. Very reasonable room service pricing and flexible options and best of all a shuttle to the private beach they also have!"
127,Marvellous Marriott,50,August 2022,I am currently staying at the Courtyard by Marriott. We came for a joint celebration for my wife‚Äôs and I wedding anniversary and her birthday. The experience we are having staying here is absolutely amazing. We are so happy with choosing this hotel. The staff and service are excellent. Best hotel we‚Äôve stayed at (and we go on holiday about 3 times a year!) so this is definitely saying something! The staff at the hotel make it a 10 star hotel. The Seminyak Kitchen is 10/10. Big portions at very great price! This staff go out their way to make guests feel very welcome and making sure you have the best stay. They went our their way to bring us food thats not on the late night room service menu. The cleanliness is 10/10. Looking forward to the rest of our holiday and the hotel spa. Not looking forward to leaving the hotel to back home on the 5th September! I‚Äôll definitely be back to this hotel when visiting bali again.
128,SURYA IS MY FAVORITE,50,August 2022,"I love this hotel and all the people! The service is 11/10! The pool area is great and they have a fabulous private spot on the beach. Everything about the resort is great, but what makes it is the people. Surya waited on me hand and foot and never stopped smiling and laughing. He was a great bingo leader, and amazing beach attendant! I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel and Surya enough! If you come to Seminyak, you must stay here!"
129,WE LOVE YOU DHIKA,50,August 2022,We had the BEST time! Dhika was the best aqua aerobics instructor and bingo leader! I‚Äôve never seen skills quite like his. You must stay here and ask for Dhika. The sole reason I came to Bali and the sole reason I‚Äôll come back. We love you Dhika!!
130,Fantastic service,50,August 2022,"What a fantastic hotel! Beautiful, clean and a lovely place to be. We went for our honeymoon and it was 1/3 of the places we stopped in Bali (another one being 5 stars) however Marriott hotel stood out by a mile. The service was exceptional, very attentive and friendly staff that did everything they could to meet our needs.

In particular, the pool bar attendant Dede, he has exceptional hospitality skills. Dede made us feel so comfortable and welcomed, he gave us recommendations of where to visit in Bali and wanted to get to know us as people. He even made cocktails for us that weren‚Äôt on the menu by special request.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The food at Marriott was fantastic- including gluten free bread and a wide choice of food options at breakfast time.

Lifts to the beach for free made it an easy experience. Special welcoming gift with it being our honeymoon. Sociable setting with bean bags by the pool allowing you to talk and meet new people.

All in all, fabulous hotel and experience. Thank you."
131,Very attentive staff!,50,August 2022,"Due to having dietary requirements and food intolerances, we communicated with the Chef and Reservations team in advance of our stay to notify them of our needs. They promptly acknowledged our email, the severity of the intolerance and notified their entire food and beverage teams.

What was also pleasing was that at check in, they confirmed they were aware of the food intolerance and our dietary requirements without being prompted. This just shows how good the communication was internally.

From the moment we checked it, the staff and management were so warm, kind and friendly. We were always met with warm smiles by the staff who knew us by name.

Due to the dietary requirements, the Chef Rizal personally made us whatever we wanted. We are blown away by how caring and considerate the staff at The Courtyard were.

The Courtyard also has an on-site spa which is relaxing and well priced. The massages were incredibly relaxing and just what we needed to relax. The gym, which is situated next to the Spa, has a wide range of equipment you would need to have a good holiday work out.

Location wise, The Courtyard is situated in Seminyak. The hotel is about 15mins walk from Eat Street where there are a number of places to eat and grab ice-cream. Also, it is walking distance from Mini Marts and Pharmacies for anything you may need.

A massive thank you to Eka, Chef Rizal, Jul, Arya and restaurant manager, Dea, who looked after us during every meal, always had a smile on their faces, and going above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay to be enjoyable.

We can't wait to return!"
132,Great trip to Bali,50,August 2022,"Had a great time in the hotel. Thanks to ‚ÄúWidi‚Äù for all the great table tennis game. Look for him if you want some games to remember üòâüëå

A lot of great facilities as well including the gym, pool and the Spa"
133,Outstanding stay. Choose this property - you won't regret it!,50,August 2022,"Choosing this property was among the best decisions I made for this trip. The team are absolute rockstars, the atmosphere is both lively and relaxed, and the property is impeccably clean and well maintained. This property punches well above its weight! As a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member, I received some of my best elite treatment to date. Moreover, I could tell that this exemplary service and their standard of care extended to all guests. A huge 'thank you' to your entire team, Courtyard Bali Seminyak, for such a wonderful stay. You‚Äôre doing everything right. For the best value, amenity, *and* service in Denpasar, look no further!"
134,Awesome hotel!,50,August 2022,"Have stayed in many places over many visits in Seminyak and am really impressed with this place. Superb quality hotel at a great price. Staff are the best. Food amazing!
But would most recommend a Yoga/stretch session with Yudi!
My body feels so much lighter. Lots of fun and entertainment too in a he bar/pool area with enough pool space to chill too. Highly recommend this place!"
135,"Convenient, clean, pleasant",50,June 2022,"We stayed in so many places in Bali to be able to experience all sorts of activities.
Our selection of Courtyard was because of our experience with Marriott, which is always super.
This hotel in specific was great. Great location, great staff, very clean rooms.
Here and there we had glitches with amenities being missed out after makeup service such as towels or water, which happens so our overall experience was wonderful.
Thanks to Barbara and Intan for keeping our room perfectly clean, tidy and always keeping special water as a gesture. You do an amazing job on a daily basisüíö"
136,One bedroom suite is worth it,40,August 2022,"Do yourself a favour and stay in the one bedroom suite! The other rooms are way too noisy, small and dark!
The security is great here, and points for the room service food was delivered quickly and the staff delivering food friendly. The mash potatoes were nice and kids burger too. Drinks came with a glass of ice that was covered.

Stayed for 5 nights."
137,Awesome staff and great location.,50,July 2022,"One block back from the beach, however easy access to all parts of Seminyak, and can walk to Legian and Kuta for the beaches, shopping and restaurants. Large pool area, with pool bar. Nice cocktails available by the pool. The buffet breakfast had lots to offer, including cook to order, and was always delicious. The rooms are a good size with large bathroom and balcony to enjoy a quiet happy hour drink. Overall, the hotel conditions are great and the staff are very friendly and accommodating."
138,Enjoyable holiday,50,July 2022,"This place proved to be a great spot for a pleasant vacation. The rooms are modern and comfortable. They have a safety box and perfect air conditioning. It has an amazing breakfast, perfect location and well trained staff! I will definitely come back!"
139,Great service,50,July 2022,"Pleasant stay, all the staff very helpul. Very good facilities,clean pool and room. Closed to seminyak beach and they have beach space for the hotel guest just 10 minutes form the hotel. Yudi will be happy to help you at the beach. Thank you will be back"
140,Amazing,50,July 2022,"Wonderfull stay,clean room and compy bed.they provide various activities each day,i joined the yoga class by the rooftop was amazing Yudi was the istructor. Recomemded place to stay in seminyak. Thank you"
141,"Fantastic, clean and modern hotel!",50,July 2022,"Beautiful clean hotel, room was immaculate, the bathroom was fantastic, big with walk in shower. Staff were lovely and friendly, couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us. Staff around the pool were brilliant, lovely pool bar and food portions were big and fantastic quality. Shuttle bus down to the beach or to local shopping strip but all within walking distance anyway. Hotel concierge organised us some great trips to the local temple and dance and to release baby turtles for an unbelievably decent price and driver even waited for the tickets for the dance for us while we explored the temple. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
142,Excellent restaurant and staff.,50,July 2022,"I stayed in Seminyak for a month on a working holiday and stopped at many restaurants and hotels. The staff at Courtyard were by far the friendliest, most attentive and professional. The food is also unmatched. Special thanks to Wika, Arini, Indah, Maria and the rest of the team for their generous hospitality. -P"
143,Great experience,50,June 2022,"Great experience,clean lobby and room is well maintained,and also delicious food.
Staff are very friendly,,and the pool bar is very good place to stay during the day enjoying the drink and you will invited to join activity,they have diffrent game each day.Bingo was fun with yudi and surya.welldone."
144,More of a home than a hotel! Unforgettable experience! 10/10,50,June 2022,"I only planned to stay a few nights but ended up staying a few weeks. What makes this place so special is the amazing staff. The GM Laurens and his Assistants Ramu, Wahyu and Eka run this place like a close knit family business and are incredibly attentive and really care about guest experience and people in general.

I had a scooter accident whilst staying there and they were all incredibly kind and really went the extra mile, the great Concierge crew including Hardy even pushing my wheelchair down to breakfast each day! I felt like I was leaving a bunch of friends when I returned to UK and miss them already, I have never received such kindness before, testament to Laurens, the GM's commitment to his guests.

I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bali and look forward to seeing the gang when I return in Winter, they really made a huge impression on me.

Otherwise- Rooms were super modern, comfy beds, great balcony with pool view. Buffet Breakfast and food in Restaurant was top notch. Swimming pools lovely and a great pool bar to hang out in. Good location 5 mins walk to the beach.Some nice special events with live music in the gardens occasionally also. A real treat of a hotel!"
145,More than Excellent,50,June 2022,"Excellent customer service. I wish there were a higher rating than excellent! I felt like a family member to the staff, they were so attentive and concerned that I was enjoying myself. At one point I suffered from stomach trouble from eating outside of the hotel, and once the hotel waiters found out, they were always checking on me.
Room: From our balcony we had a lovely view of the pool from one end of the pool looking towards the far end by the pool bar. The room was immaculately clean each day. Our room attendant appreciated the daily tips we gave and even left on our bed a couple of animal figures he folded from extra towels. We loved the shower with both side and ceiling spouts.
Pool: The multi-level pool was beautiful to look at and even better to swim in. We enjoyed cocktails and lunches by the pool on many days.
Restaurants: We loved the meals at Seminyak Kitchen, at the Meat Shop, and by the pool. The only restaurant we didn't try was the What the Truck, but we did chat with Yoga there and he was so friendly and welcoming to chat with.
I want to especially mention a few people: Yoga and Maria, both in food service and a charming pair. Anggreni, who prepared eggs to order, even took the time to make me Eggs Benedict, which required her to run back and forth from the front to the back of her work area, all the while managing her omelettes at same time! Somehow she did it all with a smile and positive attitude. Dea, the kitchen manager, was very nice to us and smoothed out a small hiccup we had during our stay.
We left deciding there was no better place to go to in Seminyak or Legian than the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak. If we return to Bali, this is where we will stay."
146,Great holiday,50,July 2022,"had an amazing holiday at the Marriott Coutyard Hotel Seminyak. Rooms beautiful, food great. Staff so helpful and friendly. A special mention to Valentina Valerie who learnt our names and greeted us personally made my husband and i feel special"""
147,Beautiful hotel and excellent location,50,June 2022,"Excellent stay at the courtyard! Cica and Clara went above and beyond to welcome us for our stay. We were greeted with a round of beer while we wait for our room to be ready. Cica was super attentive to our needs as we were a group of 5 and we were fortunate enough to have 1 of our room upgraded to a suite. She continued to impress us with her excellent customer service and patience as we had multiple requests and questions throughout stay! Thank you for making our stay so pleasant!
Chow,"
148,Wanted to love this place,30,June 2022,"I‚Äôve stayed here twice now and really loved it! The bed was super comfortable, food was excellent and staff were all so friendly, most remembered me on my second visit.

I got bed bug bites on my first trip here in April 2022, I was hoping this was a one off. My second trip in June I got them again but much much worse.

It‚Äôs really such a shame as I loved staying here but the bed bugs will mean I definitely won‚Äôt come back."
149,Continues to perform.,50,March 2022,"My third stay at The Courtyard. This establishment remains a worthy 5 star accreditation. My daughter and I stayed for a week during which time we experienced wonderful staff, so willing to please. I rate the breakfast the best for choice and presentation I‚Äôve had down to the random tasters provided by the chefs. You can chose to sit outside and watch passers by, inside for a little more aircon, or in full aircon enjoyment. Rooms are well appointed and cleaned daily."
150,Great stay in Seminyak,50,June 2022,"Had a great stay at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak with a mate. The room was immaculate, cleaned daily and had everything you need including an iron and board. The air conditioning worked perfectly. Breakfast options were extensive, and staff were great. Val was especially friendly and helpful.
The pool was fantastic and the bottom section at about 40 metres long, was good for lap swimming. The pool bar was a nice place to be, however we were not able to charge our food and drinks back to our room tab, which isn‚Äôt very convenient.
The gym has an adequate range of equipment, and the spa offered a very professional massage service.
The location is good, and hopefully as things get busier, tourists won‚Äôt be pleaded by every single shopkeeper to come in and buy, every time you pass, every day!"
151,Definitely will coming back again,50,June 2022,"We recommend a stay at this hotel as we experienced a relaxing stay at Marriott courtyard in Seminyak, the staff where warm, welcoming and effiecently attentive to our needs and requests. Well-worth staying in this super located hotel at Heart of the area."
152,Amazing Hotel,50,June 2022,"We booked 2 rooms - 1 bedroom and another 2 bedroom and both on the same floor and close to each other as requested. We staff are soo friendly. Our breakfast was buffet every day and this didn‚Äôt disappoint us. We were looked after by Pebri and Rudi and there service to detail was amazing.

Our 2 bedroom package we also received 4 x 1 hour massages. We booked in and the Spa are was lovely and clean. We had 4 ladies looking after us. They were Ayu, Lastri, Sudi abd Parsini.
I had Parsini and I think she gave me the best massage I‚Äôve ever had. It was a lovely afternoon in the spa.

The free popcorn and fairy floss everyday was another highlight to this amazing hotel.

Thanks for another great stay. We will be back soon."
153,Great place and hosts,50,May 2022,"We spent 8 days as a couple at Courtyard by Marriott, Seminyak and enjoyed our stay. The room with balcony with view on the pool was exactly that, the room was cleaned meticulously every day and bottled water was added every day as we found this to be very important even to brush our teeth. Breakfast which was listed prior to our visit as limited was the best we ever had and we could not see any limitation. All the receiving and serving crew were extremely helpful and courteous with a special note for Eka and Ayu."
154,Super & Excellent Service & For Long Term Stay!!,50,May 2022,"Can not fault a thing about this amazing hotel. Every staff member I had an interaction with went above & beyond for us and were so lovely. Laurence as GM, Eka as PR of Marriott Bonvoy member, Surya at the beach (if I was not wrong), Khrisa & Swastika, etc I forgot the name sorry;)
The breakfast is the best I‚Äôve seen & my room and friend room was perfect. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else when in Bali. Very hard to fault a thing! It's affordable and excellent service ever!! Recommended!! J'aime tous les staffs xoxo"
155,1st Time in Bali,50,May 2022,"We are a couple from Germany and travel a lot and are quite critical when it comes to comfort, cleanliness and hotel staff. From the moment we arrived at Marriott Seminyak to the moment we left, everything was just above our expectations!
We can highly recommend this hotel.
Also we want to say thanks to Tony from the reception! We booked our hotel on a very short notice because it was not clear if our flight from Dubai will depart. However something went wrong on booking.com and we actually didn‚Äôt have any booking. So we just went to the hotel at night from the airport and met Tony and his colleagues from reception. He arranged everything for us very fast and uncomplicated. And one thing we would like to mention is that we never experienced so much kindness from any other people in the world that we experienced in Bali and especially from the staff at this hotel. Also the Breakfast was very very delicious. And since everything was above our expectations we decided to extend our stay."
156,Absolutely Perfect,50,May 2022,"Honestly, I could not ask for more. From the time we checked in until we checked out, our entire stay here was perfect. Loved the pool area, it has such a relaxing ambience. The gym isn't too large but I found it adequate. Rooms were spacious enough, and the beds were really comfy. Perhaps the best reason to stay here is the staff. The entire staff were extremely courteous, helpful and friendly. You can approach anyone, and they'd gladly help you out. For those needing COVID tests prior to their flight, tests can be done onsite. The location is great too. Although it's not a beachfront hotel, the beach is still within walking distance. If you find it too far to walk, the hotel provides free transportation to the beach. There are lots of shops and restaurants in the surrounding area too. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who plans to stay in the Seminyak area. When you consider the price they're charging per night, this place is an absolute bargain."
157,Great to be back after 2 years.,50,May 2022,"Everything is back like before , great to see many faces we know from before, good Marriott could keep so many in and around Hotel from drivers to pool restaurant staff.
Not easy to get Everything up and running smoothly."
158,Beautiful hotel and kind people,50,May 2022,"My friend and I came to Bali for a one week holiday and we had the best stay at the Marriott. We would like to thank, in particular, Wika, Rudi, Intan, Valerie and Teja. Our deal through Jetstar was great value. All the staff here were so kind and helpful and went above and beyond for us. Wika was so helpful organising transport for us, he was so welcoming and became a friend throughout our stay. Intan B was so helpful in cleaning our room everyday and made some fun creations with towels. The staff in the Seminyak Kitchen were so kind and welcoming. The daily buffet breakfast was so delicious. Valerie and Teja were two of the kindest people we have ever met, everyday they helped us with breakfast and went above and beyond for us, they were so helpful, professional and kind! We will be coming back and recommending other people to come here."
159,Amazing Stay!!,50,April 2022,"3rd time at this property. The Location is terrific -

The GM -Laurens Kritzinger- is very visable- and walks the property
Shout out to Rudy at the restaurant/bar
And

160,the best pool hotel in seminyak,50,May 2022,"You never go wrong pick this hotel, friendly customer service, big pool, fantastic breakfast, best valet service parking, big bedroom and clean bath room, best pool view balcony, everything is excellent"
161,Sleepless in Seminyak,30,May 2022,"We were originally planning to stay here for 5 nights but decided to depart after just two due to having to endure so much noise that we barely slept for those two nights.

Unfortunately, the hotel is built in such a way that every footstep, every closing door and every movement of furniture is heard loud and clear. What made this so unbearable for us were the guests staying in the room above us and who, it seemed, never stopped slept (but for quite different reasons!).

It is a shame that this was the case as the staff at this hotel (and we encounted many of them in our short time there) are among the nicest and most eager to please that we have ever had the pleasure to meet. The other thing we loved was the food in the hotel's restaurant, which was always fresh and delicious.

Other than the noise, the room itself was nice, with a very comfortable bed, fast and free wifi, a large TV with a good variety of channels, and great air-conditioning.

So, while we won't go back, if you are not a light sleeper and are looking for accommodations in Seminyak, the Courtyard Marriott could be a good option."
162,Fantastic hotel; fantastic staff,50,May 2022,"Our family had a wonderful time staying at The Marriott, largely thanks to the incredible and dedicated staff. Ayu, Wika, Kai, Dwi and Maria made my six-year daughter (and us) feel like the hotel was our home away from home. Nothing was too much trouble, and their service and kindness made our holiday. The dining experience is arguably the best we've had as the food is fresh, extremely tasty and very well priced. We were made to feel so welcome by everyone at The Marriott that it was harder than usual to end the holiday. I would urge anyone to book and experience the delightful, caring and considerate team at The Marriott. We'll return as soon as we can."
163,Family 2 centre Bali Holiday,30,May 2022,"If you are expecting a 4* Marriott you will be sadly disappointed. I paid in full 4months in advance for a deluxe family room for myself and 2 adult daughters as a second hotel in Bali for our 2 centre holiday. The room was dark, no balcony, windows overlooking the street with 2 double beds very close together. Bathroom with small single wardrobe where clothes would get damp from shower which was in cubicle next to it. Hardly enough room to hang clothes for 3 adults for 10day stay. Room had only 2 tea/coffee cups and saucers, 2 glasses and towels for 2 people only. Needless to say we did not unpack. It cost me ¬£700 to upgrade to more appropriate rooms. Receptionist claimed hotel ""full""! Staff very polite and courteous. Menu did not change throughout our 10day stay. No chef specials or recommendations which one would have expected for 4* Marriott. Very few facilities available. Would not recommend as 4*. Jane. Worcester UK."
164,Home in the Heart of Seminyak,50,May 2022,"stayed in suite room here during the lebaran holiday. Located in the heart of Seminyak. Experienced a warmth welcome and hospitality by all the satff here. They give a good advise to travel around Bali during the peak season after covid.
Had a bit of hiccup in the beginning but was handled professionaly and fast. I know the guest here will be in good hands.
recommended for those who would like to stay in Seminyak!"
165,Very nice experience.,40,April 2022,"Much better than my expectations. I stayed in the Deluxe Pool View room and the room is quite spacious. The view from the balcony was really great too.

Another plus point is that the hotel location is really close to the Seminyak beach. I just can catch the sunset in the evening just by walking for probably 4-5 mins. Staffs are helpful & nice too. But unfortunately, during Ramadhan the breakfast offered cannot be used earlier for the Sahoor, so you have to order a different menu if you want to get Sahoor food from the hotel. Overall, it was great staying in this hotel."
166,Superb,50,April 2022,The hotel was beyond our expectations. Location very close to the beach and rooms of high categories. Breakfast is fantastic and the staff super helpful me friendly. We would like to thanks Valery for being so attentive and professional at the restaurant with us and all the good recommendations about food that we even didn‚Äôt know and made our experience fantastic. Thank you once again
167,Seminyak kitchen,50,April 2022,"Just have a dinner couple days ago with my clients (iftar ramadhan). This place have a very good food and great service! Im very happy because my clients are satisfied. Thanks a lot for chinta, ayu puspa, dwik, and yoga for serving us very nicely, and thank you to dearest val for recommending this place."
168,"Great place to be with family, clean room, friendly staff",50,April 2022,"Very satisfied with all the facility, the staff was amazing. The one who the most memorable amongst them was Ms. chinta who genuinely take care of our rooftop BBQ. We were about to dine outside but she convinced us to join the BBQ and that was become the best decision of the day. My family really enjoyed our time. Also special thank for all the chefs who made such a tasteful meal.
Can't wait to come back!"
169,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,April 2022,"The room was clean and comfy, the food was tasty, and the employees were friendly. What i loved the most was i could walk from the hotel to Seminyak beach so i could get the sunrise moment right on time. Prolly was my best stay while in Bali. Gonna come back soon for sure."
170,Beautiful place to stay,50,April 2022,"I‚Äôve stayed at the courtyard Marriott Seminyak 5 times now and it has always been consistent with service and quality..!

The staff have always been happy, helpful and friendly..! Just to name a few I‚Äôve gotten to know personally, Valerie (Val) Rudi, Bobby and also the amazing glowing pregnant Penny..!

Nothing and I mean absolutely nothing was a problem for the amazing staff here at the hotel..! The warm welcomes we received every morning at breakfast to the constant hello‚Äôs, goodbyes and the welcome backs was so heartfelt and genuine made you feel part of the Marriott family.!

I‚Äôll be leaving the hotel in the next 2 days to fly home to Reality and certainly not looking forward to it..!

Yes the hotel is and has always been a wonderful place to stay but if it wasn‚Äôt for the amazing welcoming staff, I may have tried one of the many other hotels in Bali.

I can‚Äôt say enough about the wonderful service I‚Äôve received from these beautiful humble people..

If you get a chance to come to Bali, please try the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for you next stay and say hi to one or all of the above mentioned names for me..!

If you‚Äôre a kind happy and understanding person, little mistakes are made, there‚Äôs no need for a negative review.. Just remember, we‚Äôre all human and certainly not perfect.. Communication is the key for a happy and relaxing holiday..! The staff and management are more than happy for your feedback.!

If you think I have enhanced the photos on line, think again..! These are the pics I took from my balcony looking over the pool..! Tranquility..!

Thank you again Courtyard I‚Äôll certainly be back soon.! Thank you for also Making my 60th birthday a memorable one.! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
171,Great Place To Stay & Friendly Staff,50,April 2022,"My stay with Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort was unquestionably one of my best stays in Bali. As I was staying on my own, from the moment I was greeted by the Reception staff I knew it was going to be a lovely stay. I had stayed here in Dec 2019 and was very professional as you would expect and all staff smiling whilst greeting people.

This resort was my choice to relax and chill by the pool to have drinks or nibbles by the pool from the lovely drinks/ food staff Penny, Narita & Ayu who are just happy ladies who love attending the guests and making all feel welcome with smiles on their faces.
The breakfast is great and has a wide selection. The restaurant staff I‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt be able to name them all as there are so many, but the ones I can name were very attentive and obliging. So thank you Rudi, Rae, Yoga, Arani and Val who is training in hospitality all made me feel welcome.

Having a relaxing massage at Zanti that is in the Resort is very refreshing and rejuvenating. Thanks Puji and the other ladies.

The rooms are very clean with sufficient wardrobe space good bathroom and bed is comfortable which is what you expect and get.
Everyone wore masks in keeping with Government rules which is good to see.

The area in which Courtyard is situated is walking distance to the beach and Legion beach but a bit of a walk to Kuta beach.Bintang supermarket is walking distance for any grocery items there‚Äôs also a little convenience store opposite.

Thank you Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort I enjoyed my stay immensely."
172,as expected from Mariott network,50,March 2022,"the hotel room was quite spacious and comfortable. there were a lot of shelfes and cupboard, and even an iron and it‚Äôs board. the food from room service was delicious and its price was reasonable. our room was also soundproof. the hotel location is less than 5 minutes walk to Seminyak Beach and the renowned La Plancha or Chez Gado Gado."
173,Comfortable Stay at Great Location,50,April 2022,"Room is clean and very well maintained. Cleaning staff Buda and ? ( sorry forgot his name) keep my room clean and neat.

Breakfast is also great. It could have more varieties of fruit (and freshly cut fruit) but good enough. They are kept in the refrigerator which is some way is good to keep it from from warm weather. Staff are very friendly at breakfast. They often stop by to ask if I need any help. Valerie is especially friendly. On my first day, she offered me fresh made juice that was not clearly offered.

This hotel is only minutes walk from Seminyak Beach. You can walk along the beach from Kuta all the way to the hotel.

You can also book private day tour to any tourist destination with a driver and a car. The driver i had, Ketut was also knowledgeable.

Overall it is great stay."
174,Memorable stay,50,April 2022,"It was a very memorable stay with courtyard marriott world trade centre, i went with my family really enjoyed especially would like to thanks HOUSEKEEPING guys they make us feel so special always room cleaning was on time and Mr phanindra always come to check our room. Thank you guys for making our stay special will surely come back."
175,"Zanti The Retreat is tuly ""Relaxing""!",50,February 2022,"My wife and I spent 5 days at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali in Feb, 2022, for Valentines day and it was great! I especially want to highlight the Spa there ""Zanti The Retreat"". We have stayed at The Courtyard Seminyak about a dozen times in the past 10 years, but this was the first time that we have gone to the Spa.
We took advantage of a 1 hour Couples Massage Special and loved it! The atmosphere was extremely relaxing, warm and caring with lovely Balinese music playing softly in the background.
My wife and I cannot recommend a massage at Zanti strongly enough. We were not impressed with the only two other massages in our lives at other places and were quite uncomfortable with the people involved, but this one was exceptional. My Masseuse was Hari and she was a pure delight. She immediately put me at ease, made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire hour and was skilled in working out the knots of daily living.
Whether you have ever thought of having a massage or are a massage enthusiast, give Zanti a try. You will NOT be disappointed!! We are headed back for a repeat stay later in April and cannot wait."
176,A nice evening dinner !,50,April 2022,"Food and service was good.
Sat at the air conditioning room, which is nice.
Well received by Ayu Rai ,Juli, Harry Bayu.
All very good service.
Had the Chicken and the Spring Rolls, also good.
Soup Puntut is very good !
Corkage only 150000 , so can bring your own win3."
177,Seminyak stay,50,March 2022,"I never write reviews because , well I‚Äôm lazy. I‚Äôve been coming to Bali for 14 years , first time back since COVID and this trip was for work. I‚Äôve never stayed in Seminyak and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever stayed at a Marriott outside of the U S at an airport. When I made my reservations ,entry had guidelines one of which was to stay 4 nights in a CSHE hotel and this hotel was on the list.

I have to say it was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. The room was very comfortable ,clean , great balcony space. The bed was beyond comfortable!

I had room service 3 of the 4 nights as I was super jet lagged and exhausted from meetings , the food was great with a nice variety.

Breakfast was amazing , a buffet with tons of choice. The hostess Ayr greeted me by name each morning before I even said my room number .The same girl waited on me each day her name was Val. She was sweet and chatty.

The entire staff from the front desk to the concierge, the restaurant staff and room service was seriously A++++.

I moved to Canggu for the remaining 5 days as it was a bit closer to where I had to be each day and a bit more lively than Seminyak which sadly took a bit of a hit during COVID it seems as far as closures.

After I checked into my hotel in Canggu I wish I had stayed where I was. That‚Äôs an another review."
178,Great hotel.,50,March 2022,"stayed at courtyard seminyak on the 26th of march, check in was super fast, very friendly staff at front desk. even though we are only silver marriot members, we were upgraded to a pool view room.

the room exceeded my expectations, it was very clean, very brand new, toilet is also very clean. had some trouble with shower button to enable the rain shower though (very hard to turn/pull). just minor stuff.

wife had a very nice SPA session, took the ZANTI RENEWAL package. Kerti was very friendly and wife felt that it was one of the best she ever had.

Pool was huge, didnt have a chance to swim though.

breakfast was good, freeflow soya milk (loved it) and the beef stew soup was very very good.

good location, free valet parking. very clean rooms, awesome pool, great spa, very friendly staff, GREAT price, what more can you ask for ?"
179,Outstanding Service and wonderful Staff,50,March 2022,"Bali is open for business!
We stayed in this wonderful hotel this week (family of 2 adults, 2 children from the US).
This Courtyard is not like any other Courtyard in the US!! It has wonderful amenities and the staff is delightful! Breakfast is superb, our kids loved the pools and we were transported to the Courtyard private beach area. They even had a wonderful promotion in the Spa and we had a family spa treatment that our girls loved.

The restaurant has a lot of vegetarian options and the cleaning staff was amazing!! 100% will stay here again.....thanks for a wonderful visit!"
180,Exceptional,50,March 2022,"My mother and I had an excellent stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. The staff throughout the hotel were fantastic and really made our experience special. Ibu Ayu at the kitchen restaurant, pak Surya at the beach club, and the front desk team.
We were upgraded to a pool view, The room very clean with excellent amenities. I extended my stayed from 5 to 7 nights because it‚Äôs hardly to leave the comfort hotel has offered.
Highly recommended to friends, everyone couple, family or solo traveler."
181,Awesome Hotel & Stuff!,50,March 2022,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but what an amazing time did we have at Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak!

The genuine hospitality is just what made all the difference for me & my Family.

Thank you to all the People of the hotel, you‚Äôve been amazing!"
182,5 Stars for me! You can‚Äôt go wrong,50,March 2022,"All the staff are outstanding, never miss a beat and always make you feel welcome. The people are amazing with their beautiful hearts and warM smiles. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Courtyard Marriott it‚Äôs family friendly great kids club and nanny service. It‚Äôs 5 stars for me"
183,Excellent breakfast and service,50,March 2022,"Came here most days of our trip away. Excellent selection of food and quality of breakfast. Service was brilliant, Ayu from breakfast was attentive and welcomed us with a smile every morning. Would 100% recommend."
184,Amazing 10/10 would recommend for breakfast,50,March 2022,"We came for breakfast and it is the most amazing place. The staff are so welcoming and friendly, the price is great and the food is delicious. If you got for breakfast speak to Ayu as she is amazing and will sort you out with whatever you need. 1000/10 amazing place vibe and people. Thank you Ayu!"
185,Always my favourite hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2022,"Has always been my favourite hotel in Seminyak area.
Strategic location n just a walk away from the beach.
The staffs always puts a nice smile and so welcoming.
The cleanliness of the hotel is also cared for.

Sleep soundly without noise is my priority and Courtyard makes it happen. Quiet neighbourhood n i didnt hear any noise when I slept.

I always love the variety kind of breakfast they had in Seminyak Kitchen.
One of my favourite is the granola bowl n the fried rice. The pastries are also nice.

Overall, i mostly recommend to stay in Courtyard Seminyak when u come to Bali."
186,Always the place to stay in Seminyak,50,March 2022,"Strategically located within walking distance to the beach.

Staff are always helpful and courteous.

Room for improvement:
Huge choices at the breakfast buffet. A selection of fresh fruit juices. However, the default at fhe juice bar is that all juices are sugar-added. This really kills the healthy part.

Yes you can request for juices to be made with no sugar added. However the juices that I ordered still came with added sugar during one morning.

Why can‚Äôt the juices be served without added sugar as default?

Diabetes is a growing health problem in the whole world and it would be nice to see that Seminyak Kitchen is doing its part in helping address this health issue. Waiters and bartenders should be made aware of this issue."
187,Marriott Courtyard Seminyak Bali Bagus!,50,March 2022,"The property has an excellent location. 5 minutes away from Seminyak beach. The room was luxurious. Bed was comfortable! Room service was quick. The food was delicious. F&B servers Arini & Widi were first class! Arini & Widi were genuine and made us feel like family! Mahalo to Gus Dek, bar tender at pool bar!"
188,"Excellent, as always",50,February 2022,"It was wonderful to check back in again. I checked back in yesterday evening and everything is as good as always.

It‚Äôs especially nice when staff remember your name from your previous visit, and I was delighted to be given my room upgrade.

Looking forward to a wonderful four more days here"
189,Truly 5 star hotel services with a good price,50,February 2022,"The definition of 5 stars hotel is Courtyard by Marriot Seminyak hotel. This is so so Marriot. No doubt about his security, cleanliness, and comfortable in every side this hotel.
Good price to stay in it.
Nice breakfast with many kinds of food
A Step away to the beach n minimart
Will definitely come back here."
190,Lovely experience,50,December 2021,We stayed there for Christmas and was welcomed warmly by the hotel staff and surprised with a room upgrade. There was also a nice welcoming pack in the room and towels were folded nicely. We love that these details are well managed thought through. Thank you!
191,Holiday 2-4 Februari 2022,50,February 2022,"Special Thank to Bu Eka , for help arrange surprise my son's birthday
My Family enjoy and happy stay in courtyard seminyak. Because all staf kindly & helpfull.
Excellent service, ambiance, and clean room"
192,Amazing Breakfast,50,January 2022,"Today was my last day in Bali, choosed my breakfast at the Kitchen by Courtyard Seminyak, absolutely beautiful. Chinta and another greeter obviously outstanding, she makes everyone's happy while at breakfast time in the morning. Apart from that, the kitchen staff were totally incredible, even they worn mask, I could see their smile during service time. Thanks to waiters who did extraordinary hospitality. For those who didn't stay at this hotel, you may come to try for this amazing breakfast with affordable price and ofcourse buffet, thanks Courtyard, would love to see you guys again next time!"
193,Returning stay at the friendliest hotel in Bali,50,January 2022,"I previously stayed at Courtyard Seminyak on the last week of November for three nights and I was impressed by their hospitality, facilities, and strategic location. Hence why, I decided to return to the property for my January stay in Bali. As I have mentioned before, the hotel is conveniently located within the Seminyak area, precisely in the less busy area that is closer to Double Six/Legian. The Seminyak beach is just a couple of minutes away from the hotel. Some mini markets, warung, and restaurants are within close proximity from the resort, making it easier for travelers seeking for deliveries of the consumable.

Upon checking in, they noticed that I have stayed in the hotel previously and they warmly welcomed me back (funny enough I was greeted by Eka for both of my visits!). A self-service welcome drink of cold ginger tea was provided and it was refreshing. The resort also provided a mobile key feature through Marriott Bonvoy app although it didn't work properly for me throughout my stay. Regarding the issue, I did ask for an extra key and the process was seamless.

We booked two Deluxe rooms and both of the rooms were upgraded, each to One Bedroom Suite and Deluxe Pool View (twin bed)! They were currently on a promotion of upgrading rooms although1 notably I also did receive an upgrade (to Suite too) back on my stay in November. As I have read on the internet, they usually offer upgrades to Deluxe Pool View (at least) as when I saw the map of my room's floor, they notably have more Pool View rooms than City View. Additionally, all of the rooms are equipped with Balcony (or Terrace for level 1 rooms)

Upon entering the room, I was greeted by a greeting card, mini treats, and a healthcare kit consists of masks and hand sanitizer. It was such a delightful gesture as they emphasized that I was returning to the hotel and not visiting them for the first time.

The One Bedroom Suite is spotlessly very comfortable as it has a separate living and bedroom area that can be fully enclosed into two separate rooms. The room itself is pretty much soundproof and very comfortable in way that it's not vigorously furnished nor spooky. It's simple, modern, and has a homy feel. The living area has a separate dining area and a two-seater sofa. Two flat screen TVs in the room were working fine, even though I suggest they need to start changing them to smart TVs or the newer ones. The bedroom has a generous king size bed that was very comfortable. It is also equipped with a nice working desk, lounging chair, a bluetooth speaker, and some other 5 star hotel amenities. There's also a semi-walk-in closet area before the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but I would like to point out that they only have bathubs on the 2 Bedroom Suite type (that we stayed back in November). Deluxe Pool View room was pretty much ""just"" the bedroom of the One Bedroom Suite, with similar amenities, and equivalently comfortable. I requested a muslim prayer kit but they didn't offer a ""sarung"".

Many facilities were offered throughout the resort: three-tier swimming pool, a well-equipped gym, spa, kids club, bike rental, and a private beach space at Double Six Beach (accessed by buggy). For accessing the beach space, iirc there need to be a reservation although it's complimentary. The resort also offered some activities plastered on a board near the pool of yoga class and such but only available for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Throughout my two nights stay, we enjoyed two delightful buffet breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen. Everything from the wide selection of foods to the service are perfect. We even chatted with the friendly manager (I suppose one as he wore a different outfit from the rest) about our trip, he was very friendly and welcoming. I would like to point out their decaf coffee, Nasi Bakar, and French Toast are amazing!

About the service and the people, I have no doubt that this is arguable the warmest and most welcoming hotel I have ever been to in Bali. Everyone greeted me even in a passing. Some were very welcoming about our trip stories within the island. Their attention to details may also be highlighted such as packing cutleries into a special package for improved cleanliness. Another gesture that I would like to point out is when my family went for a jog, my mother was pretty short of breath upon entering the hotel lobby and the nearby security staff offered her a bottle of water. It was a simple yet heart-warming gesture.

There were no major downsides about the hotel throughout my two stays but I would like to point out some minor marks that might help the hotel to improve or travelers before they give the hotel a visit:
1. On our first visit, we stayed at Two Bedroom Suite and One Bedroom Suite. The 2 BR was located at the var end of the hotel, furthest from the elevator
2. The One Bedroom Suite from point (1) was located at the second (2nd) floor and its has no direct access to the lobby through the elevator, which is a hassle if you bring multiple suitcases.
3. The hotel elevators doesn't reach every floor. The one nearer to the lobby can't reach Level 1 and 2 while the one further from it can't reach the Lobby.

Despite the points above, if you are looking for a friendly, strategically-located, and extremely convenient hotel without splurging your hotel budget, Courtyard Seminyak might be the best fit for you. I will definitely return for my third and more stays in the future!"

The hotel has an service excellency, they send us many chocolate, and fresh juices plus sliced fruit after some issues the day before (i am not gonna tell the detail). The Duty Manager was so heartwarming. Definitelly will go back to the marriott hotel group!!"
196,Long overdue break!,50,December 2021,The check in & check out experiences were fast. The staffs were accommodating & friendly. The buffet breakfast has a good quality of food & beverages. Location is strategic. Nice pool and fitness center. I would definitely revisit and recommend it to everyone.
197,Perfect holiday stay at the best hotel in Bali,50,December 2021,"Always and excellent experience. The entire team, Widi, Dwi, Fery and Chunta are always so approachable and willing to assist. This is always our first choice for hotels in Bali. Perfect location to explore beach, Seminyak, local restaurants. But the food at the hotel is beyond expectations and service level is perfect. No complaints in all of the years we‚Äôve stayed at this location. Thanks Marriott team"
198,Dissapointed with this hotel not as I expected especially during this covid moment,30,December 2021,"I choose this hotel since it has good location and review and my experience with Marriot brand is good. But this courtyard seminyak has let me down in many area especially during pandemic time.

From the moment I check in and request extra towel and pillow from their app and it said done but when I enter the room none is done.
My preference of high floor also not fullfilled.
And I have 2 booking on 3rd day to suite room they didn‚Äôt know until I mention to them.
Request to them if it possible to have suite room all the way from day 1 to day 4 since my day 1 and 2 on deluxe room they said possible with extra charge. I didn‚Äôt upgrade since the suite room doesnt have twin bed.

Now on my third day I asked them what time can I move to my new room they said 3pm since they are fully booked on their suite now.
Its funny on my first day when I check in they can upgrade me to suite with charge not free but now they are full. And I checked in late at night 10pm ish so they should know if they have room available or not.

Courtyard seminyak should look after their guest more.
As if they didn‚Äôt care if we have to move room and all the hassle to pack your luggage again.
Now the room is ready at 3pm normal check in time and we have to check out at 12 pm.

Stayed at many marriot chain and othe chain before usually they acknowledge you as their member even you are not platinum member just normal member.

St regis and W brand surely provide better service and understanding considering their price point. But even Westin has served me well never more dissapoint me.

Hope courtyard seminyak can improve their service more in the future.
I dont wish to stay at courtyard brand anymore.
Fairfield serve me better service if I remember correctly.

Seminyak kitchen breakfast is good luckily.
The spa also good service.

Just the reception need more training in how to handle guest IMHO"

They are very attentive to their customers. Health protocols are always observed. Tables and chairs are always sterilized before we sit down. Plastic gloves are available everywhere. Very hygienic.

Three delicious meals delivered on time and as a vegetarian all queries re removing meat, no sweet course etc dealt with to the letter.
Linen changes delivered promptly fresh and warm with duvet and pillows ready stuffed.
Most impressive was their approach to Netflix. Speech and movement were out of sync. No sooner had I mentioned it than an instructional video and bluetooth appeared.

There was a slight comment on cutleries during our breakfast (understand it was sanitized however there was still a bit of visible stain). The staff quickly apologize after I raised the issue and replaced it with a new set.
This hotel takes Covid-19 measures seriously, so that's a good thing."

Service from their housekeeping was also one of the best I find on my stays at all of Marriott properties during this pandemic situation. Room was regularly sanitized, clean and well prepare.

Got a very reasonable price for the rooms and we were upgraded to 2 bedrooms suite (awesome!!)

The rooms were spacious and clean (this is very good point), even though the breakfast was semi buffet (some foods were already prepared, but for certain foods, you need to ask to be prepared).

The lobby was great, the service was excellent. The front desk was really helpful and thoughtful. I really recommend this hotel to those who travelling with kids.. they have kids club, nice pool and good pool bar.

So far, I'm satisfied with this hotel, really gonna back for sure to this hotel again."

Everything is wonderful about this hotel but what makes it so special are the beautiful Marietta touches, and of course the staff. The staff really make it here.

Breakfast is delicious, and the eggs benny are a nice twist on a classic eggs Benedict.

The pool area is excellent and the service at the pool bar is exemplary. I am staying in a one bedroom suite, overlooking the pool and I could not be happier. Thank you for the upgrade. üôèüôè

237,Second stay at Courtyard Seminyak in April 2021.,50,April 2021,"Perfect place to stay, this is our second stay at Courtyard Seminyak we love it. We spent 5 days at the Courtyard Seminyak in April of 2021. Breakfasts at the Seminyak Kitchen were amazing, great rooms, lovely pool, fitness centre and a spa.

All staffs were helpfull & friendly. Especially to Lutfi Pristiawan for what you did for us was beyond what we expected. The team from Seminyak Kitchen that took care of us, Widi, Ayu and others were very friendly and took care of us all the way.

We'll return to the Courtyard Seminyak again in the future. We sure will recommend the hotel to our friends and family."
238,A birthday to remember1,50,March 2021,"My wife and I spent 4 marvelous days at The Courtyard Seminyak in March to celebrate my birthday. The place was absolutely wonderful and the Staff could not do enough for us, always available and ready with a smile and ""Hello!"". We splurged and reserved a pool access room~ a treat beyond description! The room was large, well appointed and had everything that you could ask for~ the bed was a true joy! Breakfasts were real treat, with everything cooked to order or even from the buffet on one morning. The food was always fresh and hot and we even ate at the in-house Steak Place one evening. Being older, we eat earlier than most, but the Staff and Chefs were happy to accommodate our desire for a 1700 dinner, even though they usually open at 1830. That is the kind of 'extra effort;' that is a hallmark of the Courtyard Seminyak! The area around The Courtyard is open to easy walking and the beach is an enjoyable 10 minute stroll down the road or hop the free Resort shuttle. To be treated as Royalty, or better yet, family, was an amazing experience.
We will return to The Courtyard again in the months to come. There is no better place to celebrate a special day, or any day, than this very fine Resort!"
239,Amazing Stay!,50,April 2021,"The stay was amazing! Laura assisted us during check in process and everything was super smooth. Room was comfy.

253,Consistently an Excellent Stay,50,December 2020,"I‚Äôve stayed here at this hotel on and off since July and couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with the team. In fact, despite Seminyak being a little quieter than usual because of COVID, I‚Äôve still gone out of my way to stay here instead of Canggu or other hip areas because of how good it is. The rooms are impressive as always ‚Äì spacious, clean, and well managed, with the cleaning staff always leaving a cute towel decoration whenever they service the room.

Then there‚Äôs the staff, which are exceptional and honestly on par with a 5 star Ritz Carlton/St. Regis/Four Seasons service. Not only was everyone attentive in recognizing me by name as a return guest, but the management (shoutout to GM Laurens) was super attentive and went out of their way in ensuring a smooth stay. I was particularly impressed by the concierge service guys like Arya and the kitchen staff like Chef Uri, Manager I Kadek Januariana (Bobby), July, Ayu, Gita, Saih, and Narita who made my morning everyday with their excellent culinary delights that somehow tasted as equally good for room service.

All in all, I recommend this Courtyard highly and suggest you look no further if you‚Äôre aiming for an amazing, phenomenal stay in Bali."
254,A great place for short getaway,50,November 2020,Highly recommended. I'd say it's one of the best place to stay for short getaway. Strategic location and the staffs really are friendly and relatable. They made our trip and stay felt like covid-free.

256,LOVES ITüòçüòçüòç,50,October 2020,"I'm staying at the best hotel in Seminyak Bali. Courtyard Seminyak, simply one of the best stays I've been in Bali. Courtyard Seminyak also has a private spot on Seminyak beach with a sun lounge that can be enjoyed by hotel guests.

Plus if they go to the restaurant they have to try their Seminyak Fried Rice. Ughhhh totally delish ü§§ü§§"
257,Comfort zone !,50,August 2020,"What a great place to stay and chill, courtyard hotel gives us balinese nuances from the first time we arrived, balinese style uniform for all the hotel staff, the food, and of course the hospitality from all the staff ( especially chef donald who gave us genuine service and tasty food ), what a wonderful experience!! I highly recommend this hotel !!"
258,Holidays,50,November 2019,"Beautiful jotels & excellent service,
The pools absolutely gorgeous, friendly staff & very helpful.
I was stayed with girlfriend but feels safe
Close to everywhere, private beach & have a transporter yo & from beach to hotels.
Breakfast full of choices.
Very clean room too :)"
259,"Great Property, Even Greater Staff",50,September 2020,"The property is solid - Great value for money and thanks to my status, I got upgraded to the One Bedroom Suite overlooking the pool. Nice, modern room that's weird to get to from the lobby but that's my only gripe. Everything else about my stay was amazing and it had more to do with the staff than the property itself.

First off, the breakfast is amazing. Seriously tasty, delicious food with equally attentive staff and a chef who actually comes out to say hi to you. Scrumptious. The check in staff are also very professional, courteous and kind. However, the real stand out was the concierge, specifically Arya, who singlehandedly salvaged my trip from the edge of failure.

I had missed the ferry to Nusa Penida because of a miscommunication with my guide. I mentioned this to Arya and he basically arranged for a private boat to take my diving and back, and a tour guide to show me around Nusa Penida. I thought I would have to cancel my trip out there but thanks to Arya, I was able to do it after all. The lengths he went to to make sure I was safe and having a good time, and following up with the vendors showed incredible initiative, dedication, and professionalism.

I enjoyed my stay so much I extended it and highly recommend you stay at this hotel. The rooms themselves are solid but it's really the staff that stick out and I will always stay in this hotel upon my return to Bali in the near future. I suggest you do the same!"
260,Great hotel and food,50,September 2020,"Was great opportunity to stay here even during the pandemic. Room were great, safe, clean and comfortable. Our balcony was very spacious and we had the view of the pool which was quite nice.
The food in the breakfast is delicious and had enough of option. Chef Donald were very helpfull and informative.
We are extremely happy with our stay. Highly recomended !"
261,"Nice Hotel, Great Event, Kind Service",50,August 2020,"Stayed a night on Saturday for the event ""Evening Barbecue and Cocktail"". Was a great setup in the inner courtyard with a barbecue buffet, live band and great service.
Many thanks to Mr.Ambara who made it happen. And to For Brothers Bali.
Will come back again!"

263,Un h√¥tel fabuleux !!!,50,August 2020,"We spent 10 days in this hotel ! What can i say ?! It was awesome !! Teams are great and very friendly and so kind. Special mention to Mr Ari who was very helpful and very efficient. Mr Tekut Ramu who is the guest service manager was very professional and very very kind. We spent a day with him when he was on day off and we came with him to his hometown and he showed us the waterfalls in bedugul. we used to go in hotels everywhere in the world, my husband works for hospitality industry but we have never seen a hotel like this, it was like we were in family because the team was very close to us. We appreciated that.
Thanks a lot to all the teams (pool bar, breakfast area, housekeeping and guest service). We will come back there for sure !! This hotel is more than excellent ! It forgot : the breakfast was great and the restaurant too !"
264,Happy and feeling safe,50,August 2020,"Checked in with 3 children to spend 4 nights stay but still need to do online class during stay with wifi connection in the rooms and area pretty satisfied. Staff is helpful and aware of the action in distancing with good protocols (wears masks and gloves in public area and restaurant) from security point until pool area. Healthy herbs welcome drinks in the restaurant to boost our immune was beyond expectation. No buffet during breakfast but good selections offer with menu and good taste. The second day of the stay warm hospitality received from the executive chef a bag of coconut cookies to enjoy our coffee/tea times. Rooms were disinfectant during cleaning/turndown services. They ready and prepared how to handle the current condition of the global pandemic.
Thank you to all the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak team for the sincere and hospitality üôèüèΩ"
265,Love this place,50,July 2020,"Great location, amazing staff, awesome breakfast, and beautiful rooms. The spa is also great and I would highly recommend the Balinese massage.

266,Family vacation,50,August 2020,"We went to this hotel to another vacation with my family, hotel has very good price for stay a while at pool, big thanks to Eka to warmly welcome us at Reception and good service too from Ayu and Mob at pool,we will back for sure"

I myself always love to stay in this place because of the hommy ambience and the hospitable, quick response staff. In guest service, I had the great help from them. In Seminyak Kitchen ( the restaurant) I met the very hospitable, sweet persons: Widi, Arini,Dhani, Febby, and all the kitchen associates ( Chef and all kitchen staff) were wonderful.

Keep being amazing...so I, my family and other guests always want to return to this hotel..

From arik ria antini incharge in SPA departemnt

272,Day trip,50,July 2020,"We came for the afternoon with a splash bash pass. My toddler enjoyed the kids club but we came right before closing so she didn't have much time there as she would like.
We relaxed by the pool and also had dinner in the restaurant. All the staff were friendly and helpful for us, accommodating our requests.
My husband and I were also able to get away for a couples massage (which was divine!) while our friends watched our toddler for us. Definitely will come again!"
273,MBC event at Marriot,50,June 2020,"This place was so amazing, the service is very awesome. I am from MBC wanna say thank you for all the staff at Marriot. Oh yeah and the food its so amazing my favorite is nasi goreng and for drink is milkshake"
274,Bad atmosphere,10,May 2020,"I went there on monday for swimming with my friend and toke a package.
The bartender didnt know my friend was near him.he just said to waitress ‚Äúwhat those people order while he looked at us‚Äù
And why those people smooking (i and my friend toke a vape) vape was allowed by other waitress.the waitress was really good. It just the bartender keep talking and all the staff from the bar looked at us(hand potition at the waist).
i know they must say something and it made the atmosphere was bad.
And the bartender was said ‚Äúis it they only order the pakage?‚Äùand my fried went back to us...

Soo 10 minutes after, i decide to order other drinks...
And go...
I went to a lot of hotels and bar around asia and ausie....
But this part of merriot was pathetic..."
275,"Would be happy to stay again, thanks for a great week.",50,March 2020,"We stayed here in late March and had a great time - what stood out the most is the fantastic staff, they were happy and passionate about what they do, and it shows.

Check in was a breeze, and the welcome drink was a perk. Our room was clean and well appointed, I requested a quiet room and it was exactly what I got. The pool was big and spacious, the restaurant was delicious, don't miss the salad with the Balinese tuna at the casual restaurant next to the pool.

I didn't get to try the taco / coffee truck this time but it looked interesting. There was complimentary popcorn and shuttle service to eat street and the beach. The kids club was a savior for me and I was able to leave my baby there for two hours and go for a massage at the spa.

Special thanks to Wahyu (duty manager), Rai, Dewi (housekeeping), Putu, Ivan, Priscilla (front desk), Ayu (kids club). Arif who drove us a few times in the shuttle, and Pebri in the Seminyak Kitchen restaurant --- I hope I got the names right. The team was wonderful and this is the key to a successful organization - keep up the great job. Well done, see you again soon."
276,Short and Sweet,40,March 2020,"We stayed at the Courtyard for the first 2 nights of our trip to Bali. We were arriving into Bali around 12am so we wanted to find a moderately priced hotel in Seminyak for our first 2 nights.

When we arrived the front desk agent helped us check and had someone bring up our bags. We had a welcome drink of 2 Bintangs which was a perfect way to end our day after almost 17 hours of flying. We had booked a King Bed Pool View room which was well accommodated.

Location wise Seminyak is a great place to explore. The hotel is a bit away from Seminyak Square but there are a lot of shops nearby the hotel to check out. The hotel has a large pool and swim up pool bar. They have dining options like breakfast buffet in the morning or ala carte options. We had in-room dining for lunch which was convenient and well priced.

One thing to note is that they make guest safety a top priority. Any cars entering were checked by the hotel security each time they came in. There is also a bag & body scanner that you will have to go through each time you enter the hotel. I thought this was amazing and made us felt extremely secure staying there.

Pricing can't be beat if you want to budget your stay in Seminyak. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting to stay in the area!"
277,The friendliest staff!,40,March 2020,"It was my first time at this hotel. First and most important I have to commend the staff, where ever I met them for their smiles and friendliness. This is from securitystaff (and they are there for my safety) to reception staff, roommaids and every body else I met during my stay.
It is staff like that, that make you over look what other glitches there might be, not that there were any during my stay.
Checking in was a little longer than expected, but that is due to procedure rather than staff, I have mentioned this to the managent, which has been very responsive to my view.
My room was well appointed, and the bath room very big. Every where in the hotel it was spotless clean. The bed was great and the linen krisp clean and new.
My room was facing the pool, and thus really appreciate the no noise policy hotel maintain.
I spend about 100-120 nights on hotels a year most due to work, this time it was for pleasure, and a pleasure it was.
With short walk from the beach 10-12 minutes, and restaurants and shops close by I think the location is great.
I enjoyed my stay, and it was very relaxing. Especially because of the first class staff."
278,Just as good as we remembered!,40,March 2020,"We had previously stayed at Courtyard 5 years previous and it is still just as good as the first time. From the moment we arrived, we felt safe and extremely welcomed.

We stayed in a Deluxe Poolview room, which was beautifully appointed, clean and comfortable. The pool is beautiful and clean, sunbeds really comfy.

Seminyak Kitchen was amazing. Everything you could want for breakfast - special thank you to Indah for breakfasts and to Arini who looked after us during dinner. We had dinner 3 times at hotel and each time the food was delicious.

Our package included a free-flow cocktail hour which was great every afternoon. Selection of 5 cocktails, 3 beers & 2 mocktails or soft drink. A daily canap√© was handed around, something little and yummy. Special thanks to Alit and Narita for always being so happy and helpful at the pool bar.

Our package also included 2x 60 min massages which were wonderful. Thank you to Parsini, she was fantastic.

Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
279,Modern & Clean,50,March 2020,An absolute awesome place to stay. Has everything you need. Here the staff make you feel extremely welcome. I won't stay anywhere else in Bali. No need this brilliant resort is perfect. I cannot wait to return.
280,Honeymoon,50,March 2020,"I would like to say that me and my wife fell very good in your hotel.
Beautiful way they set our room.
All staff was very friendly and polite from the reception desk to the room service lady(Baskara).
Very clean hotel.
Tasty food at the restaurant and again friendly staff with good training and Different approaching attitude then most of the places/restaurants we visit in Bali.
Breakfast was just amazing, honestly, so many choices and everything was tasting fresh.
Definitely will recommend Country Yard by Marriott and try to come back one day.
Our next hotel from Ubud was ratted as ‚ÄúLuxury Resort‚Äù and was not even close of what Country Yard by Marriott offer"
281,Best Guest Service!,50,March 2020,"When I booked our stay, I didn't realize how tremendous the guest service would be from arrival to departure. We'd like to mention Indah and Widi from the Seminyak Kitchen. They were both extremely friendly and accommodating in every way. They remembered us each day and greeted us with the biggest smiles. In my 16 years working for Marriott, I have never experienced such amazing service. I work in Sales and would definitely want these two individuals working at my hotel. Indah and Widi may only be trainees, but they went beyond our expectations Thank you for everything!"
282,"Excellent hotel, food & service",50,February 2020,"Excellent hotel, very clean & the customer service was fantastic. Nothing was too much to ask. All staff were so nice, friendly and really helpful. Particularly Alit, Arca, Ded√© & Febri at the pool bar. Had so much fun chatting with the staff and enjoying my wonderful Bali holiday. This hotel is a 2 minute walk to the beach. Not far from Seminyak shopping & Kuta. Great security, we felt really safe here. Also great facilities for families and kids-kids club. The good was amazing, fresh juice & smoothie bar for breakfast plus all the hot and cold foods for breakfast. Definitely book breakfast with your stay! Thank you so much!!! I will definitely stay here again & I highly recommend this accommodation."
283,Great choise hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2020,"Stayed 2 nights and we are very lucky to be upgraded in a deluxe balcony room. Rooms are beautiful, location is close to everything and they provide the shuttle transportation around attractive place in Seminyak and also free valet service for the private car, We enjoyed the breakfast buffet with very good varieties of food and service is beyond description. I highly recommend this resort to everyone visiting bali"
284,Amazing Hotel,50,March 2020,"Such a fantastic hotel. Stayed for a week with my partner. It was his birthday so the hotel had flower petals, a birthday cake and a happy birthday banner in our room to surprise him. The breakfast is AMAZING!!!! A short walk to the beach, supermarket across the road, loads of bars nearby. Cocktails are gorgeous, the best steak I‚Äôve had in a long time and the spa is absolutely beautiful! Had the best facial I‚Äôve ever had and the therapists are such beautiful ladies, so friendly and couldn‚Äôt be of more help. A fabulous hotel with fabulous staff. Couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough."
285,Beautiful and friendly staff,50,March 2020,"My husband and I are here for 5 days with friends from Australia. Our stay here has been nothing short of exceptional because of the friendly staff and the phenomenal service extended to us. The staff are attentive and helpful and always carry out their work with a smile. Special mention goes to Wulan, Indah, Nita, Pebri, Feby and Priscilla.
The housekeeping staff have also been exceptional and meet our requests for extra sachets of coffee and water whenever we call them.
The location of this hotel is also very good as it is walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants. The hotel also offers buggy service to the beach and ‚ÄòEat Street‚Äô where there are more bars and restaurants.
We will definitely come back here again.
Thank you for making our stay here memorable."
286,Unexpected Service,50,March 2020,"From the checkin desk to the spa the reception was better than the other resorts I had been to.The breakfast spread was big and the service staff Pricilla Chandra, Wulan,Tia, have to be mentioned in particular. The pool bar was good. The reception at the spa with Puji was amazing. The masseuse was gentle . Dinner at restaurant had a good spread of international and local cuisine. The shops are just outside the resort. The shuttle services to the beach is always on time. I thank the management for making this resort such a pleasant one."
287,Less crowded with great facility,50,February 2020,Stayed for 3 night during end February for meetings. Rooms are big and facilities throughout hotel was great. Check in and check out was breeze. Staffs were friendly and felt welcoming. Near to beach and lots of shop and restaurants. About 40mins to airport on a normal traffic condition. Pool bar was great. Will stay again
288,BEST HOTEL AND SERVICE EVER !!!,50,February 2020,"As soon as me and my wife stepped I.

289,Great location,50,March 2020,"Great location, amenities, staff and food. The rooms are not huge but sufficient and clean. The staff are very helpful and polite. The pool bar is excellent and they have two pools of which one is ideal for lap swimming. I also liked the fact that you could walk to the beach or get a hotel transfer to the hotel beach.
Not too large and walking distance the beach"
290,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,50,March 2020,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we felt as if we were among family. The staff is so warm and friendly and are always ready to help us with any questions we have. If you‚Äôre looking for a hotel with a fabulous location, comfortable beds and wonderful food... look no further. Tell them The WIngin‚Äô It Family sent you. ü•∞"
291,Will definitely return,50,March 2020,"Stayed here for 5 nights. Can't fault anything. There are 3 pools, one being the pool bar, normal pool and then a kids pool. With it being a little quiet with the virus panic at the moment we had no trouble finding a sun lounger any day. Poolside service great too. It never felt crowded in the pool and plenty of spots of shade. Pool staff will also remove towels of anyone trying to save a lounger.

Rooms are clean and spacious. Kudos to Rich our housekeeper who made awesome towel animals each day. Definitely a pleasant surprise. Water refilled each day. Felt very safe leaving belongings in the room but there is also a safe in the closet. Rooms are soundproof and very quiet at night.

Location is fantastic. An easy walk to the beach or eat street. Hotel also has a buggy service to take you to various areas. Didn't try the private beach but walked past it one of the days. The area feels safe too with very few people bothering you on the street. Yes, you have to get your bags scanned each time you walk in but prefer that for the extra security! Added maybe an extra 10 seconds to our arrival. Had a massage at the Zanti Spa which was great.

Will definitely stay again on our next visit!"
292,Amazing experience!,50,February 2020,"One of the best hotels we‚Äôve ever been at. The atmosphere, the pool(!), the breakfast and not the least the staff is worth 5++++ stars. Thank you Merta, Febri, Dicky, Angga and Sry for taking so good care of us. We will be back for sure :)"
293,Nice stay,30,February 2020,"Here on a business trip. Check in was quick & efficient as attended by Nyassa. Rooms are modern, clean and equipped with lots of plugs.Wifi is good for me to catch up with work. Breakfast was fine not that much of choices enough to meet your daily needs at Seminyak Kitchen. Will be back again for leisure the next time around to try the spa to enjoy all the facilities."
294,Pool Bar,50,February 2020,I Love coming 2 this Hotel Resort Courtyard By Marriot Seminyak The Food is Great Friendly Staff everythings Really Clean Beautiful Clean Pool I been coming 2 Bali Last 3 years n always stay at The Courtyard Great Security n I like 2 Thank Ayu n her Great Staff at t Pool Bar They always recommending Good Places 2 go see in Bali
295,Amazing stay,50,February 2020,"We stayed for 7 nights at Courtyard by Marriott seminyak with my 2 year old toddler and had a fantastic time.

Location - good location, quiet, not too far from seminyak centre (although in peak periods road traffic is terrible, so even a 6km taxi ride will take 30 mins). Good walking location to the beach, and the hotel offers a free shuttle to take you there whenever you want.

Room - we got a 2 bedroom suite so our toddler could sleep in her own room. The suite was great - 2 huge bathrooms, a living room and a balcony with pool views. 3 TVs, bathrobes and slippers, room safes, 6 free bottles of water a day. So spacious. Great blackout curtains BUT the bathroom sliding door has large glass panel that lets all the light into the bedroom from the bathrooms windows. I'm incapable of sleeping without darkness, so I did find this difficult the first few nights.

Gym - the gym has some good, new equipment, but can get busy in the mornings.

Pools - it's a fantastic setup with a kids pool at one end that steps up into the family pool, which steps up into the pool bar pool. There are day beds and umbrellas the entire length of the pool and it is really relaxing. They have service from the day beds, the temperature is perfect not cold but not too hot, the pool bar is awesome with reasonably priced drinks and food. They have a 30 min no daybed hogging policy (you can't just dump your stuff and leave it without using it).

Food - food here is incredible. Do yourself a favour and have the spaghetti Bolognese. It's delish! Really well priced food. Buffet breakfast has an incredible selection and even do gluten free foods/breads/pastries.

Staff here are lovely. They remembered my daughter's name and loved playing with her. They are all polite and friendly. Check in and check out was quick and seamless. Security is paramount here with every person requiring a bag scan and metal detector walk through and all cars thoroughly checked. They also do a welcome alcoholic (or not if you desire) beverage and never ending popcorn and fairy floss in the foyer.

Kids club here is fantastic with a ball pit and other play things and activities all day. My toddler loved it, although children under 4 need an adult with them or you can pay for babysitting services. We had our own nanny who stayed with her.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back in a heartbeat. Couldn't fault a single thing."
296,Holiday,50,February 2020,"I absolutely loved this place .. I‚Äôve travelled quite a bit all over the world in the past 40 yrs & this hotel has to be the best one so far .. The staff are so friendly & respectful & can‚Äôt do enough for you . The rooms are very clean & today & spacious enough & the pool bar is just perfect .. Can‚Äôt say enough about all the staff ... Just amazing .. A special mention to Febri , Ayu , Ari, Mob, Wulan ,Roni , Alit , Narita , Agik , Widiana, Kesawa , Arca.. We love you all
Thank you so much for your awesome hospitality .. We definitely will be back ‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèºüòä"
297,Hotel good but area so so,40,February 2020,"Stayed 6 nights after 4 nights in Ubud. Hotel is a modern, quality establishment with all staff, without exception being friendly, helpful and efficient (special mention to Dhani a waiter and Nisa the intern omelette chef in Seminyak Kitchen restaurant and to Rich, Intan, Nunu and Andre our room cleaners) and a genuinely pleasant addition to our stay. The service and food at breakfast was first class and we had 3 excellent quality and value dinners in evening including, without doubt, the best fish and chips I've ever had (and I've had hundreds) anywhere/ever.
However, we felt the local environs let the hotel down somewhat. Lots of chaotic, noisy traffic, persistent honking taxis and stallholders but the most disappointing aspect was the appalling amount of rubbish being washed in with the tide at the otherwise impressive beach (hotel has a small staffed private area for guests with free shuttle and free water). Obviously this isn't hotel's fault but it was a big negative for us. A nice week but probably wouldn't return to Seminyak despite quality of the Courtyard."
298,pathetic,20,February 2020,"The food very pathetic, service was horrible. The staff is very rude. The indian cuisine is limited and taste is pathetic. i was served pizza base as naan for breakfast. i spent 9 days here when i asked for a late checkout i was asked to pay 1 million rupiah. when the room what i paid was for 1.2 million rupiah. the concierge people work as commission agents for arranging travel."
299,Great holiday!,50,February 2020,"We stayed at the Marriott for 8 nights and absolutely loved it. All the staff were very accommodating- special mention to Gus Dek who took great care of us and made our experience all the better. Really went out of his way to please us!!! We will be back.
Thanks Gus Dek !!"
300,Best family resort,50,October 2019,"I have always been a fan of hospitality and facilities provided by Marriott chain and that's why booked this resort for my Bali trip. And as expected, I was not at all disappointed. Everything is just perfect about this property: modern design, spacious rooms, clean pool, gym and spa facilities, lavish buffet options and superb location."
301,Hidden gem,50,January 2020,"Just visited this place for our getaway. Have to say we were very impressed, considering so many other accommodation/villas to stay.

Room was amazing, walked straight out of residence to the amazing pool and swim up bar. Food was tops, amazing brekkie!

Other than the rude male we had at check in, the staff at this place are just too good! They go out of their way to make sure you feel like a holiday.

Cheaper rate than that of the big beach resorts. Courtesy bus and taxis always nearby to get you around.

Highly recommend!"
302,great hotel,40,January 2020,"overall was a great stay here, spent 3 nights the staff was great, the location was good, only the minor was the cleanliness in the room need to be improving, out of that was really a good stay, love Marriott hotel as always."
303,Welcoming stay,50,February 2020,"Came to this place by myslef thinking I was gona have a lonely time but the service is very welcoming and facilities better than I thought. Food was awesome with a mix of local and western food. Loved the room service burger.
Yeah totally reccommend if you want a chill holiday."
304,Fantastic resort!,50,February 2020,"We stayed at courtyard for 9 days Feb 2nd till Feb 10th with our 3 year old and loved every minute.

The highlights here are the breakfast buffet , the beautiful pool, pool bar and friendly staff. We met so many new friends at the happy hour at the pool bar. It is a really social venue. Kids are treated so beautifully by all the staff and other guests.

We loved the temperature of the pool. Was lovely and warm. We swam so much.

Thank you to Wifi, Doni and Pebri for being so kind to our 3 year old and to all the staff for their great service.

Tip: if you want more food options at pool side you can request the restaurant menu aswell.

Will be back. Thank you."
305,Beautiful Hotel,40,February 2020,"We have just returned from 8 nights at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak and overall we really enjoyed your stay. The resort is beautiful, particularly the pool area, and is very clean. The staff are lovely and were always very helpful. The breakfast was a bit hit and miss. The waffles and pancakes etc. are cooked in bulk and by the last few hours of breakfast, they're hard and cold. We wouldn't pay for the breakfast at the hotel again. We had some issues with noise during our stay - we were working out in the gym using the weighted cable machine and as the plates touched between reps, it obviously makes a noise. We were asked to ""stop dropping the weights and be quiet"". I don't understand why you would put a gym next to a day spa (you have to walk through the spa reception area to get into the gym). There was another occasion where we were laying by the pool and were quietly playing music on our phones. We checked with the guests using the day beds next to us if we were bothering them and they told us they were enjoying the music and didn't understand why the hotel didn't play music at the pool. A staff member asked us to turn it down - you could barely hear it as it was. We were later was told to turn it off due to the hotel's ""no noise policy"" and then noticed security walking around the pool area for there rest of the afternoon."
306,Pool bar experience,50,February 2020,"The pool ball was an amazing experience! Great atmosphere and service during our stay here. I would like to give special commendation to Yudhi, the pool manager, Febri, Agung and Ayu for an excellent service. They have been very friendly, helpful and provide service with a smile which makes your stay extra special . More power to these fabulous Courtyard Pool Bar team! See you next time!"
307,Nice hotel and wonderful kids club,50,December 2019,"We enjoyed our stay in Courtyard by Marriott, food is nice and swimming pool is excellent.
The kids club is one of the most best service in Marriott so
Special thanks to Chandra, Debby and Ayu for taking care of my daughter, so that we can have some time me and my wife.
I recommend it for families and definitely I will stay there during my next visit to Bali."
308,Solid choice,40,February 2020,"I recommend staying here. I have mainly positive things to say. Location was convenient. The hotel is opposite a mini supermarket, and it's a on street with lots of restaurants and bars. It's also a 5 to 10 minute walk to the beach.
The hotel itself is impressive and has luxury feel. The lobby is spacious and has a nice ambience. You feel good arriving there after a long journey. Our room was spacious. Wifi worked well and there were plugs on either side of the bed. Bathroom was spacious too...had most the usuals in it but did not have a vanity kit (cotton and ear buds), but you can request these.
Service is friendly. Room service is rapid. And ay breakfast they treat you like royalty. Spread is also great.

As for the negatives...we were initially given a room where our balcony had a view of a wall. How depressing. Please tell them at check in that you won't accept this room....they did at least go out of their way to change the room the next day.

Also the beach club was a let down. Seminyak beach is gorgeous. But the club did not match the luxury feel of the hotel. It is very basic and feels a little cheap."
309,FANTASTIC,50,February 2020,Loved this hotel ! From the moment we arrived nothing was a problem . The pool was great and Fabri and Agung deserve a special mention for their wonderful service . Would definitely recommend the Courtyard Marriot Seminyak for a great Bali experience.
310,Perfect holiday hotel,50,February 2020,"What a wonderful way to spend 8 days in Bali. We chose Courtyard Marriott Seminyak & couldn‚Äôt be happier. From the ease of checking in, the beautiful rooms and amazing service down by the pool. A special mention to Febri & Agung...nothing was too much trouble and they always had a smile on their face. They made you feel so welcome.
Breakfast is fantastic, anything you could want is on offer.
We will definitely return üòé"
311,Will stay again!,50,January 2020,"This was my second stay at the Courtyard by Marriott and we will be staying again.
The hotel is in a perfect location, it also has a free shuttle that will take you to Eat Street, Seminyak Square or Double 6 beach.
The rooms are clean and new as the hotel is only 5 years old. I would recommend upgrading to the 1bedroom suite if you are travelling with a family of 4, otherwise the standard rooms are fine.
The staff at the hotel are lovely, all happy to be there, the hotel has an amazing atmosphere so its understandable why they love working there.
Tony the duty manager is very sweet and goes over and beyond.
Ari make the best coffee in Bali - highly recommend the Iced coffee.
Sri by the pool was amazing, always there with a smile and ready to help.
The kids club was our saviour, Komang was my kids favourite, so lovely.
We are really looking forward to go back, the hotel has such a communal feel, it feels safe to be there."
312,Absolute Worth,40,January 2020,"I stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights recently. Upon arrival I was offered Bintang Beer as welcome drink that was great. Modern room with Bluetooth speaker amazing. Large shower area. Gym was clean and good equipments. Breakfast was great with great coffee options.
Walking distance to the beach and laplancha. Great Hotel with kids and close to all the shops."
313,Brilliant Hotel,50,January 2020,"This hotel has excellent service. The breakfast is the best and the staff are super friendly. There was one waiter Arja, he was very welcoming and stopped and chatted to us. Definitely recommend this hotel, the room we stayed in was super clean and close to the pool, reception and the restaurant."
314,Vacation,50,February 2020,"Super happy with my choice to stay at the Courtyard By Marriott in Seminyak. Service and staff are 100% friendly kind and helpful. Resort is superb, everything on point, would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Bali."
315,The Most Gracious Caring Staff,50,January 2020,The folks at this hotel are Excellent! I would go back there in a heartbeat if I travel to Bali again. Very caring people that go the extra mile. See a letter I worte to the hotel manager to let him know how wonderful his people are that explains my experience.
316,Great property with poor amenities,30,January 2020,"Have stayed here several times. This is a great property, best pool in Bali and very friendly staff. Amazingly, for a 5 star hotel, they have 1 star towels and sheets. There were six in our party and every single person thought the pillows were dreadful. They might seem little things but they can really impact your stay."
317,Not sure if I will be back again,40,January 2020,"I have been staying at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak as a solo traveller since 2014‚Äì and this CNY, decided to bring my family. We booked a total of 3 rooms as I wanted to share with them my previous wonderful experiences at this hotel.
Understand that it‚Äôs busy season, but this hotel has since lost much of its human touch.
I had given feedback at front desk regarding the sofa outside being rather smelly. No apologies were given and there was no follow up on whether anything has been done . (It still stinks!)
I have also left daily notes for Housekeeping for facial cotton as I had forgotten to bring mine- it only appeared once out of 3 days unfortunately. (And sadly, no more towel animals awww)
On a positive note, the standard of breakfast is still excellent ‚Äî even though gone are the days where the management would walk around and chat with guests to find out more about them and ask for feedback about their stay. (ie: human touch). Facilities in general are also well maintained, with staff always seem mopping and cleaning the area.
Hopefully Marriott will regain its footing soon. Until then, not sure if I would be giving this another shot ."
318,Literally the best,50,January 2020,"Hi All. I haven‚Äôt actually completed my stay here but needed to get this off my chest. This hotel was absolutely fantastic. Vibes, customer services, buffet breakfast and room service. They actually had bagels, cream cheese and salmon as a buffet option & ice cream!. Rudi (General Manager at the swim up bar) always ensured that we had the best time. Wika was an exceptional bar King and Bintang who was the yogi for the sunrise yoga sessions was so professional & calming. I have to rate this experience 10/10 for me and my partner. Location is near a lot of restaurants and beach!. Perfect if you don‚Äôt want too much of the hectic scenes. Enjoy x
P.S Penny went on maternity leave and I‚Äôm wishing her and her newborn all the best. She was also fantastic."
319,Honeymoon stay,40,January 2020,"The Hotel is well located near many restaurants and shops.
They offer one way complimentary shuttle to the main streets of the center.
Breakfast is good and they have a wide variety of items in the buffet that would satisfy different tastes.
The rooms are a bit noisy as hotel is situated in a busy area but it was not a big deal as we didn't spent much time in the room but they were spacious and very modern."
320,Excellent resort!!,50,January 2020,"I love this resort so much, I‚Äôve stayed here twice and I can‚Äôt fault it. Beautiful staff restaurant pool. It‚Äôs so clean they are so efficient. I wish I could stay longer. I‚Äôll definitely be back again!!"
321,The best hotel!,50,January 2020,"I came to Bali as a solo female traveller, after staying a week in a retreat I decided to live a little luxurious and stay at the Marriott. I was not dissapointed!! From the second I stepped through the lobby I had a beer upon arrival, a beautifully made up room overlooking the pool/lounging area with a private balcony. Most of the week consisted of eating breakfast in the Seminyak Kitchen which had the absolute best service! Always waiting on you hand and foot! The lovely smiles that graced me made my day! The service around the pool was fantastic, as was the food and drink. The service was beyond anything I could have asked for. Thankyou to everyone who made my stay incredible and so relaxing!! The recognition is well deserved!! Jules x"
322,Exceeded our expectations!,50,January 2020,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott from 8-17 January 2020. I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness & service of the hotel that I would have to rate the hotel in my top 3 hotels ever (and we have travelled a lot). Nothing is ever an issue for the staff. They are so helpful & friendly. Even the cleaners always have a beautiful cheerful greeting for you.
The pools are wonderful as is the swim up bar. Concierge was always helpful in finding a taxi & offering suggestions for places to visit.
I must also comment about the amazing breakfast put on each morning, There is absolutely nothing I can think of that has been excluded. All for an extremely reasonable price.
As for location - it is a 5 minute walk to the beach. The Marriott has its own reserved spot on the beach but that is quite a long walk down the beach. However the hotel runs a shuttle which is available on call. The shuttle will also take you up the road to the Seminyak shops at call. This is an absolute godsend in the stiffling heat. There is a small supermarket across the road & a very cheap Laundromat around the corner.
Security is also good with every car who enters the property checked & bags of everyone entering the hotel are checked under a scanner.
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It caters for any age group."
323,Fabulous,50,January 2020,"Stayed for a week with my family of 4 in a 1 bedroom suite. Very spacious & clean, amazing buffet breakfast. All staff go above & beyond to make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. Special mention to Febri at the pool, fabulous customer service, so friendly & great with the kids. Highly recommend this hotel."
324,Exceptional in Every way!!! Highly recommend this hotel!!!,50,January 2020,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights in January 2020, and on future trips to Bali,I will never stay at another hotel again!!! The amazing care that every employee I encountered at the hotel showed their guests was second to none. The spacious room, the comfortable bed, the amazing breakfast buffet, the proximity to the beach and shops- I could go on and on. Just 5 star!
I came to the Courtyard Marriott from previous accommodation having injured my ankle. After checking in (a refreshing Bintang was served as the welcome drink!!), the next day my injury had worsened and I called the reception desk asking for them to call a taxi for me to take me to the hospital, and a wheelchair as I couldn't put any pressure on my foot. Not even a minute after hanging up the phone, reception called me back and advised that they had spoken to their Duty Manager, and that they had organised a hotel car to take me to the hospital so I wouldn't have to pay for a taxi. They also advised that when I was done with my hospital visit, to call them back and the hotel would send their car again to pick me up which they did! This also happened the day after as well as I had to go back to the hospital for a review. If that is not exceptional customer service and treating your guests like family, I don't know what is! As I was travelling alone, I cannot tell you how much this meant to me!!!
For the rest of my stay, staff went above and beyond, checking on me to see if I was comfortable and needed anything!!
Special mention to Widi from the buffet breakfast who could not do more to help me. He approached me seeing I was getting around with a walking stick and took my food to the table for me so I wouldn't struggle and got me additional food and drink when requested. Such a kind-hearted young man with a megawatt smile that I couldn't resist taking a selfie with him!!! Thank you Widi, your kindness and exceptional customer service will never be forgotten.
To all the staff and management, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the care and kindness you showed towards me. All other hotels should take a leaf out of your book in how to treat your guests, as you are true leaders in your field!
I CANNOT wait to come back to your hotel for all my future visits to Bali. Thank You!!!"
325,Pure Bliss,50,January 2020,"Fabulous friendly staff, the rooms were clean, large and very comfortable, food was delicious, and varied for all tastes. The Pool and Pool bar was very inviting after day trips out. 5 minute walk from the beach, on the door step to all shops and restaurants. wish we could have stayed longer, we will certainly be back and would highly recommend staying here."
326,"Friendly, Professional Staff, Comfortable Beds and an Exceptional Location",50,January 2020,"As a repeat guest to the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort, I can highly recommend the friendly and professional staff. They always make my stay memorable and I feel like a VIP. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are well appointed with spacious balcony's, effective air-conditioning and my room preference would be a Suite. The Resort is walking to distance to the beach, cafes, bars, restaurants, shops and beauty and massage services. Perfect for a solo traveler, couples, groups or families. The food (especially the buffet breakfast) is delicious with a massive variety of fresh specialised food."
327,Nice Cozy hotel,40,December 2019,"Its a nice cozy hotel, a little bit far from the beach but its ok, we can walk around 20 minutes. The location is good, many restaurants and shops around. Traffic is very bad in Bali during Christmas or New year so to stay at this hotel is good because we can walk everywhere"
328,Most amazing hotel one can find in Seminyak.,50,January 2020,"All the staff is lovely and super polite, specially the kitchen area is tremendous you find halal, vegetarian all kinds of menus possible.
The chef Jabrix at egg station made special breakfast for us every morning as per what we liked.
Also got our massage done from Zanti retreat, me and my husband felt it was worth every penny we paid. We both had a great experience.
We visited bali for our honeymoon and we stayed here for 4days and this was the best hotel amongst all other hotels we tried."
329,comfortable,40,January 2020,"nice, well run hotel, service and food excellent, you need to walk to the beach about 2km on a busy road, they do offer shuttle.very busy area. the pool area is wonderful but drinks are pricey as per all hotels are. i feel hotel should offer after dinner entertainment for holiday makers."
330,All Boxes Ticked,50,December 2019,Wow wow wow .. as we checked to this hotel staff was warm from concierge especially Ari to checkin staff .. room was clean & huge with a view of city & pool & all amenities. Pool was awesome where we spend our late afternoon/evening.. shuttle to beach & other drop of points really awesome . New year party at the pool side was awesome entertainment was really nice .. we than took a short walk to the beach where the party never ended. Overall our 7 days spent at the hotel was like home . A definite return & referral to this lovely hotel . 5 stars
331,Pleasant short stay,40,November 2019,Had 2 nights stays. Check in and check out process went smoothly. Nice decent size of room with overlooking the pool. Variety range of breakfast and it is good. Spa was a wonderful experience. There is shuttle to the beach and Seminyak town. Overall staffs are friendly except one of the lady from call centre which not really helpful.
332,"Super location, room and restaurant in busy Seminyak",50,January 2020,"Everything was super smooth! The airport pick up and check-in was very efficient, a nice room overlooking the pool but nice and quiet, excellent dinner in the on-site ""Seminyak Kitchen"" one evening and a simple but satisfying bar snack the next. Really good breakfasts, cannot remember when I last saw such a diverse choice and everything very freshly made. Just a short stay (recovering from jet lag before heading to another corner of the island) but flawless. Great staff in all the departments; housekeeping, f&b, front desk and concierge. This place really delivered."
333,Our honeymoon adventure!,50,December 2019,"Can not fault one single thing about this resort we absolutely loved staying here! Friendly staff, amazing cocktails (best we had on the whole trip) fun events plus loads more. We cannot wait to come back and stay with you guy's again."
334,Excellent service and relaxing stay,50,January 2020,"My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard over the Christmas and New Year period. Having stayed in many hotels, we were most impressed by the service and inclusive atmosphere of the resort. This is what sets it apart. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a great holiday and there are many examples of this throughout our stay. On one occasion where I was feeling unwell and my husband had dinner on his own, the staff were exceptional - checking in regularly to ensure he didn't feel lonely. Only suggestion would be perhaps a little more food variety at the pool bar area and restaurant. We would highly recommend anyone considering a stay at this hotel."
335,Amazing,50,January 2020,"We just had a 7 night stay at this wonderful resort for about the 10th time. We can not recommend it enough to anyone wanting a a relaxing holiday.

From check in to check out the staff went above & beyond our expectations once again. Management were always around the resort making sure everything was ok. It was good to see management also helping out where they could, ie: clearing tables at breakfast.
Breakfast is a highlight, everything & anything you could want, they even cooked me oats in the kitchen, yummy.

New Years Eve was amazing, cocktails, dinner & entertainment couldn't have asked for more. Good fun night.

The pool was always so clean & relaxing & pool bar food & staff was great too.

Some staff that deserve a mention, Ketut, Front Office Manager, Eka in Guest Relations, Bobbi, Restaurant Manager, Waiters Arja & Widi & off course Maria, you all made our holiday that much more special.
We got to meet Daniel, Director of Operation who was very approachable & made sure we were happy everyday. A big thank you Daniel.

We would highly recommend this resort to anyone wanting a relaxing & enjoyable holiday, We will definitely by back soon"
336,Nice hotel,50,July 2019,The road in front of the hotel is narrow and the atmosphere nearby is quite crowded. Room is nice and complete with amenities. I aslo tried the gym and the sport facilities were quite complete. I went for business trip there and the F&B for the meetings are delicious. Staffs are nice and friendly.
337,Best place to stay in Seminyak,50,November 2019,"Welcoming, friendly, obliging staff. everything you could ask for at a resort. Breakfast out of this world, pool bar and pool fantastic....couldnt recommend Marriott Bali Seminyak high enough.Good value for money..."
338,A modern hotel near (ish) the beach,40,January 2020,"I stayed here for 4 nights over the new year. The new year celebration was amazing and the staff produced the most amazing pre dinner cocktails, dinner and DJ with fire dancing etc. This hotel is great for a short stay. Their 'section' of the beach however is quite far away and whilst they have a shuttle bus the actual sun loungers are nearer to the road rather than the beach so we ended up paying to use the public beach sun loungers. It is also important to note that their shuttle bus runs one way into Seminyak town which we did not realise until we were there and then we had to find our own way back-this was not explained or in any of their information. A fine, modern hotel for travellers."
339,Special days in Courtyard Marriott Bali,50,December 2019,"We spent our year-end with friends from Greece for 4 days at Courtyard Marriott Bali. With four children it was a great stay in the center of Seminak. Hotel is closed to the private beach. Rooms are comfortable, clean and cosy, We had some difficult when we checked-in the hotel, because there were no family delux room with balcony as I booked. But we were lucky because staff were very patient to explain, organize a complementary transfer even though it was a mistake from booking system. Especially I am thankful to David at the reception who took care of complaint with extra care. It was all in all perfect stay there. Staff are very professional in every respect.

Next time we stay again in Seminyak, then I will choose the same hotel."
340,Fantastic resort,50,December 2019,"We had a 6 night stay at Courtyard by Marriott in a pool view room and it was hard to fault. The reception and concierge staff were welcoming and friendly and done everything they could to make our stay comfortable. The rooms were clean and comfortable size. The beds and pillows were really comfortable! I‚Äôd like to acknowledge Arya from housekeeping. She cleaned our room a few times throughout the stay and you couldn‚Äôt fault the cleaning. She has attention to the small details and left our room spotless.

The location of the hotel is great, within walking distance to the shops, food, beach, laundry and massage which was handy considering the traffic in the month of the December. The resort is family friendly with a kids club and children‚Äôs pool. All the staff that the pool bar were also very friendly. There‚Äôs a great variety of food at breakfast and a mix of food available at the pool bar and in room service at a reasonable price.

The hotel has excellent security. All cars entering are checked by security. There is a security scanner everyone you enter back into the hotel.

We had booked a hotel in Kuta for the last few nights of trip and due to having such a low standard room, we ended back at Marriott to enjoy your last night in Bali. The hotel has such a great and welcoming vibe and we loved every minute of our stay there."
341,Great service,50,December 2019,"Great property. Superb service. Very helpful and understanding staff.

You want to ask for Hardi at the concierge for excellent service. Very helpful and kind gentleman. Helped us even after we checked out and left for another destination"
342,Great relaxing holiday,50,December 2019,"I had a great time here. It was my first trip to Bali and first stay at a Marriott hotel. I would say it is well worth it especially if you have time to enjoy the amenities and activities the hotel has to offer.

The service and friendliness of the staff were impeccable. Do keep this up! Everyone was so friendly, always checking in to see if anything was okay.

The spa was a wonderful experience. I had the detox package and the Balinese massage. It is clean, hygienic, and the staff are professional. There are clothes hangers to hang your clothes, clean towels, shower amenities, all for your use within the spa.

The hotel buggy was a great perk - although the beach and eat street are also easily accessible by foot. However, on hot humid days, the buggy is very much appreciated.

The private beach area is small, but has enough space for the number of customers coming and going from the area. I loved that towels and cold water were supplied there too.

The hotel bingo is a great afternoon activity as well. I didn‚Äôt get to try the water aerobics (it started half an hour late one day).

If you get the package that includes the free flow cocktails in the evening - it is well worth it for the drinks. Although, the canap√©s are variable and could definitely be improved. The canap√©s were slow to come out some days - not coming out til 4.40pm one day (the drinks and canap√© period is 4-5pm). I think the canap√©s on one day of my stay was the best. Whereas the other days, they were something that I would happily miss.

The breakfast was great. The only negative would be that the staff were over eager to clear plates at times. One day we had our coffees (more than half full), a bowl of soup, and a plate of bacon, that we were not done with cleared within a minute of not being at the table (whilst getting up for more food from the buffet). It was not an issue and they were easily replaced. But perhaps checking in to ensure customers have finished before clearing would also minimise unnecessary food wastage.

In overall, I was very happy with my holiday there. It was great as a relaxing holiday. I also felt safe and comfortable at the hotel when travelling solo ~ especially being my first time in the country."
343,Wonderful New Year Celebration,50,December 2019,"We are from Canada so this is our first time celebration New Year in a warm country. We bought the New Year celebration dinner package and were very glad that we did. The celebration started with free flow drink at 7PM with some finger bite snacks then the full buffet with live music in the main the restaurant. We were greeted by the smell of the BBQ before reaching the restaurant. Our table was outside - on the terrace, it was nicely decorated with seashells and lit with candles which complemented the crescent moon night. Inside the restaurant, different food stations were set up to offer a myriad of hot and cold choices. It was hard to choose but the helpful staff was there ready to explain and serve. You could see and hear the fireworks probably from the beach club parties nearby. Around 10:30 the audience was dazzled by the fire dancers with their circles of fire, then minutes before the countdown the water drummers in their LED light lit costumes performed upbeat rhymes inviting all the foot loose to the dance floor while staff offered free drinks to everyone - which was a nice surprise. We left after the countdown but we could hear the music went on until 1AM.
A big thank to Chinta, her team and of course the Chef with his team for the wonderful night. We really enjoyed it.
As for the hotel, we have no complaint either. Upon our arrival we were offered a fresh towel and a cold welcome drink while Priscillia, the assistant loyalty manager went to get the room key (we priorly checked in online) she then walked with us to the room and provided more information on the way. She was very pleasant and resourceful (recommended us where to eat, etc..). A plate of sweets was later sent to our room from Priscillia as her personal welcoming. Thank you Priscillia!"
344,Pleasantly surprised,40,December 2019,"We arrives and were greeted by a bomb sniffing dog and metal detectors. After getting over the initial encounter, can't say enough about the staff and how responsive and hospitable everyone is here. Stayed for about a week during NYE and they went all out. I was a bit disappointed that the pool bar closed at 10pm but other than that, a top notch establishment for single travelers and families alike."
345,3rd amazing stay!,50,December 2019,"This hotel continues to deliver a warm welcome and exceptional hospitality!
A big shout out to Angel who noticed I was feeling unwell and tried everything in her power to speed up the check in process ahead of check in time (and on a booking that was booked shortly before arrival)
The room upgrade was also greatly appreciated - thank you! A second thanks to Arya who flagged down a taxi in peak times for his care! Two of the many examples of how customer service should be done!

Room was wonderful, location is also great with plenty of options on the door step. A buggy service is really great for transporting you to the beach club and surrounding amenities. Breakfast at this hotel continues to be the best received.

Once again a big thank you! ‚ô•Ô∏è Dont hesitate in booking here - you won‚Äôt be disappointed - my third visit and it won‚Äôt be the last!"
346,"Great hotel, great service",50,December 2019,"We arrived very early and while check-in was only at 3pm, the front-office rep managed to get the room ready for 11am. We knew then we were in good hands.
The hotel itself is conveniently located, 5 min away from a public beach; they also provide a shuttle service to their private beach a bit further away.
As to the rooms, they're very clean...I will argue their family rooms are a bit too small, but this may be because I need to find a negative point.
In fact, the only negative point is the housekeeping service, that tends to forget very quickly what we ask them to do. But again, I am complaining for the sake of complaining as they all do a great job - and with a smile.
Facilities are very nice too: the pool is big enough for everyone to have fun and space. The fitness center, although not huge, has you covered. The kids club is extremely convenient with its 2 hours free of charge every day.
I definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Seminyak."
347,Robust hotel,50,December 2019,"The intention was not to stay there. We had booked a villa through a well known website and found out on Christmas Eve that we had to leave 3 nights early i.e. on Christmas Day.

So we were going through our phones on the evening of 24th then going to hotels to find 2 rooms for the following 3 nights.

Thankfully the Marritott had rooms! We were not happy about the booking process as we were told at reception to go onto the internet to book. But it was not going well due to the poor wifi and bad 3/4G. After 20 mins, I blew up and told the receptionist that it was crazy to be at a hotel reception that couldn't book a room. Quick call of the gentleman to someone who confirmed that wifi was lazy that night and who agreed to use his PC to book us in. @ Marriott, please forget your processes and put clients first.

Cost was not cheap but not crazy either.

So we had our rooms with a pool view. Neither large nor small but clean, well fitted and - heaven! - floor iles as opposed to those horrible hotel carpets.

Breakfast was plentiful and good, catering to westerners, Indonesians, Indians (although I never saw much Indian food ... greedy but I would have loved a butter chicken on boxing day) and Chinese. But you expect that now in that category of hotel in Asia. Recommendation: eggs benedict at the egg bar and the smoothies made on the spot. Open until 11 am which is great for party goers and those with jet lag.

The rooms had a view over the 2 pools. A larger one fir families and a smaller - but still large - with a bar next to it. I am not sure that the sight of people getting drunk in a poolvon Christmas day is one I enjoy but I assume that the Marriott is competing against all the beach clubs. I will leave a separate review for Seminyak Kitchen which I believe handles the food delivered around the pool.

Super secure. Bali bombings are not forgotten. 5 mins to the beach and the gay bars.
the pool and the restaurant can get noisy in the day and evening but sound proofing is good.

Approchable and personable manager. We had a quick but good chat on the Hong Kong ""events"" and it was good to see he was genuinely curious about the situation.

Good place."
348,Nice place with friendly staff,40,December 2019,Get inside the hotel its abit tricky due to location however once inside i an quite amaze how the hotel is build. More amaze with the level of friendlynes from the team. Minor feedback is only on the security. Understood their main job is very important in securing premises but i think a simple smile and a little friendly will make big different
349,Average stay,30,December 2019,"On the good side it‚Äôs very clean and great rooms, pool is nice and the shuttle to the beach is great. Very friendly staff and most things were very good.

Negatives.
Breakfast area busy and it‚Äôs lost the edge, first day we got seated and we had no cutlery. Ordering food at the different stations was un-orderly. Food quality could have been great (because they have the staff, great ingredients and equipment) but they were poorly executed. - we complained about this and the person we spoke to took notes and said that tomorrow they would take special care of us. When tomorrow came we got seated and she took our coffee orders. 10 minutes went by without coffee and when I found the waitress i asked her if she forgot our order = she said yes and apologized.

Day two of our stay we only received one shower towel. So we got out of the shower and only one of us had a towel!
Day 3 we didn‚Äôt get any towels at all. I had to dry myself with a face towel. When I called and asked what the problem was they said that it‚Äôs very high occupancy (which it was) and they had run out of new towels. So we ended up getting pool towels for the rest of our stay. For being 5 star hotel this is unacceptable to not give towels and not atleast leaving a note saying for example ‚Äúwe apologize for not giving you any towels, these will be delivered later or please call us for delivery‚Äù.

So the hotel has potential but it‚Äôs lost the edge for being a 5 star Marriot.
Maybe we were just unlucky with all these things. Apart from these service was great, dinners and lunches in the same restaurant as the breakfast was very good."
350,12 days of Xmas at Courtyard Seminyak,50,December 2019,"Our family of 4 stayed for 12 nights over Xmas, in a 2 bedroom suite. Our room was fabulous, nice deep baths, spacious rainwater showers, king size bed, and cool aircon. The service was outstanding, we loved eating breakfast (and some dinners) at Seminyak Kitchen. Special thanks to Arja, Ivan, Arini, Dodi, Fabrix, David the Service Manager, and John the General Manager. All round service throughout the hotel has been brilliant, and the hotel location was convenient. Courtesy shuttle to downtown Seminyak as well as to a private beach, everything has been thought of.
5 stars, highly recommend üôå"
351,Good Location! Hidden Gem,50,December 2019,Great price and good location! Outside hides the inner beauty. Pool is good and the staff is super friendly. less than 10 minutes walk to the beach and lots of bars next door to the hotel to walk to. Stayed here on the last night of the trip. Great Value and great service! Wish stayed here more nights.
352,Wonderful stay,50,December 2019,"A+ we really loved our stay and we are actually really sad to leave. The hotel is very modern and trendy. As platinum member we received a royal treatment. Most important, the most of the staff is amazing. They work very hard but always make time to chat and make sure that everything is OK with a big smile. We will remember Angel(la) and Arja but honestly every people we got the chance to talk to was wonderful. Management, you should be proud to have such amazing people making this hotel a wonderful place to stay. The location is also good. Only negative point was the kid club. The ladies there are really not friendly (especially one) and we did not felt welcome nor wanted to left our kid there alone...
Overall our experience was perfect and we will come back for sure."
353,"Tourist from San Francisco , USA",50,December 2019,"Excellent in every way ..... clean rooms, superb buffet, unbelievable service!!
Fantastic location!
Must mention pleasant and attentive service provided to me at breakfast by Sanya.
I give the hotel five stars plus!"
354,"Great location, wonderful hospitality and delicious buffet!",50,November 2019,"I just returned from a 7 night stay and left wanting more! This hotel is perfectly situated as a central hub with access to everything Bali.

As soon as we arrived the check-in process was seamless. Our room was clean and spacious with a very large shower. Within 20 minutes we were unpacked and off for a short 7 minute stroll to the beach - the buzz, unbelievably spectacular sunset and bintangs set the tone for the start of a great holiday.

We walked to most restaurants and cabbed to others in the heart of Seminyak- so much variety - all conversation pieces.

Breakfast buffet included is the absolute BEST way to go. With service from 6am - 11am we were able to leisurely enjoy a morning coffee before indulging (far too much) in the ridiculously full buffet that offered both ethnic as well as western dishes to savour. The very attentive staff were always there to serve us with a smile to ensure we had everything we needed (and the ice mochas were divine!)

I LOVED the Balinese cooking class we took to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday. It was beautifully set up, very well organized and the resulting meal and dessert was so delicious! Complete with the staff presenting a decadent chocolate cake and singing happy birthday.

The pool always had seating available and the prices for drinks and/or snacks were very reasonable. (I'm told the minty lime mojitos were refreshing, blissful and addictive!). We all agreed and sensed that the staff appeared to be happily enjoying their jobs judging from the smiles that greeted you from all areas of the hotel. They made us feel very welcome and comfortable.

We arranged all travel (to Ubud, excursions and airport) from the hotel - a tad more expensive than bargaining with a taxi - yet it was well worth it for the reliability and care.

I would definitely go back and stay here again in a heartbeat.

Thank you Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for your genuine warm hospitality!!"
355,First time guest,40,December 2019,"Having travelled to Bali many dozens of times and having walked past this hotel on numerous occasions, I finally decided to give it a whirl. I booked about a week or so ahead using my Marriott Bonvoy points and a Suite night Award Certificate. The hotel contacted me 2 days later to confirm my upgrade...So far so good,.

After the previous lack lustre night at the Hilton Garden Inn, the difference couldn't have been greater, a warm welcome, instant recognition of my Titanium Status with Bonvoy, an additional welcome drink (Mineral Water on arrival and a Bintang which they delivered to my room!) a lovely suite upgrade, complimentary breakfast vouchers, and a nice little cheese platter with a personalised card waiting in my room...

The room was ready well ahead of the 3 pm check in time...and without asking they confirmed by 4 pm late checkout..

The breakfast spread this morning was exceptional, a real attention to detail for the layout, functionality and aesthetic was first class and the menu options extensive...

Side note, it's always nice to see hotels recognise their guest demographic so some Vegemite on offer was a nice touch....one small suggestion would be to include salted and unsalted butter options.

The hotel gym is small but functional, the pool expansive, although perhaps its central layout means it can be a little noisy for pool view suites...

I had a lovely chat to several of the girls working at breakfast, and Priscilla ( I think) the Duty Manger was very charming and invited me to a special function tomorrow evening for Bonvoy Elite members, which I unfortunately had to decline as my hotel hopping is to continue today..

All in all w wonderful first impression.. I will return."
356,LUXURY AND SERVICE AND ITS BEST.,50,December 2019,"I did my first solo travel as a middle age lady and I absolutely loved this Resort.
I couldn‚Äôt ask for better hospitality if I tried.
From the moment that I was picked up at the airport to my time to return home to Australia.
The package deal was really worth it, it had quiet a few free inclusion.
Plus a happy hour from 4-5 @ day. A taco truck out the front that served nice tacos to nibble on if you didn‚Äôt want to go out for lunch.
The staff were fabulous and very happy to assist anyway possible nothing was a problem for them always happy and smiling.
The security is fantastic you have to go through a scanner like the airport each time you enter the Resort, which I think is a good idea.

My package deal was going to be on a top floor somewhere facing the pool, but on arrival I asked the lovely Lieony (I think it was) on reception Aif I could be upgraded and pay the difference for a Pool side room! It was no problem at all, I thought for the small difference it was so worth it too just walk out and there you have your sun lounge and pool.
The rooms are spacious and the bed very comfortable and the showers are large. They have a safe in them also which is good.
They have 3 pools, a kids pool, one in the middle and then a bar pool that plays music, so you can pick which one to use. There are lots of bean bags around to lounge on and a nice under cover section with comfortable lounges and chairs with fans and there are musicians who play I think most nights.
The food prices are comparable to other places and service is great too. The breakfast has a wide selection each morning and is fresh and nice.

I have to include that I asked at one happy hour for a Bintang Radler to be told there wasn‚Äôt any left, but after asking our waiter Angga if he could do his best, he managed to find one after hunting high and low, what service. So I promised I‚Äôd mention him here. Suksma üôèüèª

Oh and on my arrival I was offered an alcoholic drink to cool me down as was everyone who arrived which was greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm guessing they would offer soft drinks to people who don‚Äôt drink alcohol.
One early evening I found my way up to the roof top to look at the sunset, it‚Äôs not the best view, but if you don‚Äôt want to walk to the beach which is about 10 minutes walk you can see it from there.
I meet Daniel who is one of the Managers, he is such a lovely and informative person to talk with. They were having a small function up there for invitees only, so I apologised for crashing it but Daniel made me at ease by getting me a drink and having a talk with me for ages.
I was really sad when my time came to leave.
I have been to Bali endless times and I can say this is one of the places I will be returning to again in the future

I really can‚Äôt pick one fault with this Resort and my husband and I have stayed at one other Marriott Resort that I don‚Äôt think compared to this one. Also another affiliated one that didn‚Äôt compare. So I will return with my husband.
Matur Suksma"
357,Birthday Week in Seminyak,50,December 2019,"This hotel definitely impressed me for the price I paid. This hotel was one of the most affordable hotels in Seminyak Indonesia. The hotel was definitely a 4 star hotel with great amenities. The unlimited breakfast every morning will definitely be missed. Please make sure to take advantage of the breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen. Also for a snack after drinking, the hotel has a taco truck by the lobby with really good tacos!! Happy Hour was definitely something I took advantage of. 5-7pm and 9-10pm. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. I was hanging out at the bar on my birthday and the manager called me to join the marriott bonvoy members only to only find out they had a surprise for me!! Thanks again to the staff!!!
Location was perfect. It was only 5 min away from the beach , Eat Street and night life. Definitely worth booking for a low price and luxury feel."
358,"Amazing place, facilities and staff!",50,December 2019,"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. From arrival we were given a complimentary drink before even checking in. The facilities are near new and so many options for people staying there including a taco truck at the entrance, Zanti spa, huge pool, pool bar, noodle stand, gym and daily activities for guests.

Highly recommend the full package deal which includes access to a daily buffet, daily happy hour, free spa and dinner.

The staff were very attentive for the duration of our stay and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure our stay was pleasant. I must specially mention Arja, Juli Darma and Merta who made sure our stay was as perfect as it could be.

Looking forward to coming back in the future. Thankyou!"
359,Best holiday ever!,50,December 2019,"This place is filled with extremely helpful, attentive and friendly staff who made our stay at the Courtyard by the Marriott so delightful. We had a fantastic package which included buffet breakfast, daily free cocktails and canap√©s, free meal vouchers and a spa voucher. The additional inclusions made it more enjoyable and it was great value for money.

The breakfast is amazing, so many options we still looked forward to breakfast on day 7! The kitchen was that great we went back for lunch and dinner several times and were even given a free cocktail on our last night. The facilities are also incredible including the pools, sun lounges, pool bar and poolside service.

It‚Äôs home to Zanti spa, number 1 spa in Bali. I went for 3 treatments that‚Äôs how professional they were. The room was always clean and tidy and we would often return to little gifts placed on our bed including chocolates for our anniversary.

Finally it‚Äôs close to the centre of Seminyak where all the action is. I would highly recommend this place and we look forward to returning again soon. A special mention to the staff that were extra attentive to us during our stay including Juli Darma, Arja and Merta."
360,"WOW, service, breakfast and spa",50,December 2019,"Amazing stay at the courtyard in Seminyak, after being recommended by my parents we thought we would have a go. we arrived late 12.30am on the first night and warmly greeted by all staff including ADE who thanked me for my loyalty of being a Bonvoy member, Ade explained all hours of ammenities located in the hotel and showed the location as well. Ade showed us to the lift and wished us a great stay! The first morning we pre-booked a Zanti spa message, which is number 1 for a reason, one of the best messages we have ever had. The warm welcome, from the staff was a beautiful start, we had an amazing couples message, pressure was great and no task was too much during the message. We had the ""Jetlag treatment"" a full body message, mud wrap and herbal bath! The whole experience was 5*, although a little more pricey than the streets of Seminyak, it was well worth it in the end and would recommend to anyone!
The rooms were large with a beautiful patio facing the inner courtyard, beds always comfy at the Marriott properties. The pool very large and two seperate one's so families with kids are never a bother! Breakfast, wow wow wow biggest buffet i have ever seen, literally everything from curries, soups, ice cream to bacon, doughnuts and eggs benny! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! One last shout of is to Roger at the Concierge who was always welcoming, and recommending restaurants and spa's nearby! Thanks so much to the amazing staff at the Courtyard! We will be back!"
361,Delightful stay,50,December 2019,"Stayed here for 3 nights. There room here is new, well maintained and comfortable. Hotel has really professional and friendly front office service team Ms Yanti and Mr Putu. Really good place to stay in Seminyak."
362,Fantastic Holiday on Bali Seminyak plus trips around the island!,50,November 2019,"Very nice and kind staff of the hotel made my stay just perfect! Always clean rooms, restaurant and public areas. Best ideas for trips around the island from the front desk team and organised with the Concierge team / drivers. For example dinners, day trip to Ubud, rice fields and markets, Temples like Ulu Watu for reasonable prices Due to security team you feel 100% safe all the time. Just love this resort!"
363,So friendly,50,December 2019,"Highly recommended the resort. It is clean and beautiful. The staff are amazing. Friendly, professional and always smiling. The location is great. Close to everything I wanted to do. We will come back to Bali and will come back to Courtyard by Marriott."
364,Delightful stay!,50,December 2019,"It‚Äôs the people that make the place!
The staff in this resort are courteous, helpful and always smiling - they give a good vibe to the place. The room is spacious and clean, breakfast is good, great pool area, it‚Äôs a short walk away from the beach and there‚Äôs shuttle service to a few central points. We enjoyed our stay here."
365,Amazing hotel and incredible hospitality!,50,November 2019,"I knew by the reputation this hotel has that the stay would be enjoyable, but our expectations were exceeded day after day. The location is great - a 5min walk to Seminyak beach and a short walk to Legian St. Plenty of nice food options all around, but we ended up eating at the hotel most times - great food at great prices. The grounds were immaculate, the pool was the perfect temperature and sparkling, the hospitality was nothing I've experienced anywhere else. The staff went out of their way to make sure you were happy and comfortable at all times. Always smiling and happy! All the staff were so wonderful, but a couple really stood out for just out of this world service - Dewaaiiuu Pebriyanti and Eka Purnama were just superstars when it came to being waited on in Seminyak Kitchen. Attentive, bubbly personality and really caring. Can't speak highly enough of them!
The rooms were roomy, very modern, clean as a whistle and stylish. Beds were so comfy it felt like home away from home. Our housecleaner Arya really made our day when we came back to our room at the end of the day to find a pristine room and gifts and a note on our bed. It's the small touches.
We will be back to Bali, and there's nowhere I'd rather stay than here."
366,"Great Rooms, Great Location",40,November 2019,"The best thing about this resort is its location - it's very close to Double Six beach, and on the same street as the famous Bali Joe bar. The street is lined with shops and restaurants, and it's easy to get anywhere from here.

Side note: For Indian food, visit Gateway of India that's one the same street.

Loved the rooms too. They were spacious, and up to Marriott standards. Highly recommend taking the pool view rooms, on the 5th or 6th floors. The rooms feel open due to the view.

Housekeeping deserves a special mention for being great and keeping the room ready for us each time we came back from an outing. They even did a honeymoon decor for us when we checked in.

Special thanks to Arya on the team who got us what we needed quickly every time.

The pool bar is great too, especially in the evening when the Sun is about to set, and the weather gets a bit cooler.

Highly recommended!"
367,"Don't just 'yak', come to Seminyak.",50,December 2019,"A weeks stay is NOT ENOUGH at this Resort. Great security, even better food & plenty to keep you entertained throughout your entire stay.

Plenty of local transport (if you are not game enough to drive yourself), very lively indeed."
368,Good location and hospitality,40,December 2019,"Stayed here for 3 nights with the kids. Good location to seminyak beach and restaurants.
Was greeted and check in by Bubbly Eka. She remembered the kids name and also send up a choco platter for the kids.
Kids also love the kids club and love Komang who accompanied them in kids club. A good place for parents to unwind for a massage and nap while the kids hangout at the kids club.
Breakfast was also amazing with something for young and old.
Thanks for the hospitality."
369,Amazing hotel,50,December 2019,"Wow. This hotel was so much better than I was expecting (not that I wasnt expecting it to be good). From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the service in this hotel was outstanding. Truly everyone works hard and does it with a smile or friendly chat each day right from the security on the front doors to the front desk to the maids to the bar/resturant staff. This coupled with beautiful clean, modern and well maintained hotel pushed this hotel into the 5 star category for me. The room which we had was big, plenty of space, large shower room and excellent facilities, TV, wardrobe space to Complementry wifi. We had breakfast included in our stay which was full of lots of choice and plentiful and up to 11am.the prices for food and drink are excellent to the prices you would pay outside of the hotel which made us happily stay around the pool a few days and relax and order snacks and drinks. Short walk ( of golf cart transfer) to the part of the beach which the hotel occupies ( its 5 min walk to beach 10 to the hotel bit) and lots of restaurants and some bars on the road nearby to eat out. It was quiet by our hotel compered to further around Seminyak center by the main shopping but that's easy taxi or walkable if you prefer. The spa ( which I write a separate review for) was the best spa I've ever been to. With prices for length of treatments and the therapists quality absolutely amazing. For a relaxing stay in a hotel far punching above its star rating I can't recomend this hotel enough."
370,Holiday stay,50,December 2019,"This hotel has been so welcoming and comfortable to stay at. The staff are always welcoming and inviting to not only is but it guests as well.
Highly recommend spending a few days if not all of them in this hotel"
371,Gorgeous hotel,50,November 2019,A beautiful hotel close to everything in Seminyak. Rooms were beautiful and pool stunning. Staff super friendly and we loved every minute of our stay. Thank you for looking after us. Will definitely stay again.
372,Amazing Week,50,November 2019,"This was our first trip to Bali. We had the best time at this hotel. So many highlights, a lovely pool, hotel room immaculately cleaned each day, breakfast is the best selection I‚Äôve experienced anywhere. We also had some great additional inclusions, airport transfers, a 60 minute massage each, dinner for two, daily cocktail hour and others. A good location, close to plenty of shops and restaurants, a little way from the beach but the Marriott has it‚Äôs own small private beach and operates a daily shuttle service to it. The best part for us was the staff though, always so helpful and friendly, they made us feel so welcome. We hope to visit again soon."
373,Great hotel,50,November 2019,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Great breakfast buffet with many vegetarian/vegan options. Modern and clean air conditioned room. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy access to bluebird taxis in this area. We would certainly recommend this hotel.
374,Great place to stay in Bali,50,November 2019,"I have the greatest experience at this resort. Place is clean and you will always be greeted with a smile by all the staffs. I am so surprised when I was greeted by our name from Eka the first that help us when we check in that show that she remembered and value me as a guest.
The breakfast menu was great at the resort and food was good with lots of variety. Highly recommend place to stay in Bali üëç"
375,Absolutely Amazing Stay,50,November 2019,"Our family recently stayed 5 nights in a 2 bedroom suite, room 343, the room was absolutely amazing, so spacious. Great view from room from large balcony. Bathroom were huge. Tea/coffee ,asking facilities, small fridge. Our room was at the very end, a long walk from kitchen etc. which doesn‚Äôt worry us. The room was very quiet, we never really heard much noise. The room was everything I had expected. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, absolutely no problem get good quality sleep, or a sleep in. The rooms were beautifully cleaned everyday by fantastic staff.

My biggest praise for the Courtyard Marriott is it‚Äôs staff. I had a list of names, which I have foolishly misplaced. Our son has severe food allergies, and we‚Äôd always previously decided not to travel to Bali for this reason. After 16 years we changed our mind. I contacted the hotel months before arriving about the allergies, and received amazing communication from executive chef Donald. When we arrived, the hotel had my sons allergies noted at checking in, and the chef (Calan ?? - you are AMAZING) came to meet us on arrival, sat with us, discussed his allergies, then went off to make his lunch, as we hadn‚Äôt eaten for many hours. I cannot thank every chef, waiter and waitress who looked after our son on our stay enough. Nothing was too much trouble, you are all fantastic. Even when we went to Ubud for a big day out, they packed our son up some lunch for the day. I truly cannot thank you all enough.

The breakfasts are truly amazing. That egg station OMG, I so miss it. Our daughter was over for leavers week & stayed elsewhere with friends, but came to join us one morning because we had raved about our breakfast so much.

Loved the cold beer & cold towels on arrival too, great way to be welcomed to Bali.

The location of the hotel we found to be perfect. There is a shuttle bus to the beach, but it‚Äôs honestly an easy walk, not even 5 minutes. We spent many an afternoon watching the amazing sunsets from one of the beach bars. We were able to walk to good shopping etc.

I just cannot fault anything about the Courtyard Marriott. It‚Äôs an amazing resort with amazing staff, who just make everything a joy.

We will definitely be back at the Courtyard Marriott, this time a longer stay.

Thank you so much for a fantastic family holiday everyone."
376,Courtyard Seminyak,40,November 2019,"Just returned from Courtyard Seminyak with family. Hotel was good with a huge lobby. Checked in at 4pm room was not ready yet, had to wait, thats fine, occupancy was high. The pool is great. Room was modern. Breakfast was amazing, with lots of variety to choose and the staff at the restaurant was very attentive."
377,Simply the best!,50,November 2019,"Highly recommend staying at the Courtyard in Seminyak. Every time we travel to Bali, this is our place to stay. This hotel is very convenient, great ambience, great kids club, the food is delicious and the staff here are amazing! Special mention to Hendra, Penny and the rest of the pool bar team, they went above and beyond for our family! Ari at concierge is also very friendly and helpful. We love staying here because of these beautiful people! We will definitely be returning again!"
378,Exceeded expectations - Fantastic,50,October 2019,"From the moment we arrived till check out we were treated royally. I booked this room on points and I am a Platinum Marriott member. The check in was done fabulously. We were offered cocktails as Aka our receptionist informed of of the hotels amenities. Our room was upgraded, we were given complimentary breakfast (not included when you book with points-which was incredibly delicious every morning and ran till 11:00AM!!) and a daily twenty dollar credit for any food or beverages purchased plus a twenty percent discount on the balance!!!! Wow! seriously what great perks. We get to our room and a complimentary fruit and cheese platter was there waiting. The hotel itself is big but not overwhelming. It was modern and immaculate- the rooms, public areas, pool, and health club. The staff and management really has this place humming. Smiles and hellos all day we felt so welcome. Our room was facing the pool and courtyard but was quite. The room was decorated beautifully. It had lots of surface areas to lay your stuff out, great big bed, big TV, a nice balcony and a big modern bathroom.The hotel arranged for day trips and the concierge was fantastic with local recommendations -every one was spot on. We were invited to a managers cocktail reception, just wonderful. I happen to be staying here over on my birthday and the manager and staff came by during breakfast with a cake and candle to sing and wish me a happy birthday. Afterward the manager sat and chatted for a while. The level of warmth and hospitality exhibited by everyone at this hotel was over the top. The hotel has a private section on the beach with chaise lounges, shower and towels- very walkable but they offer a shuttle, its two minutes away. The Marriott beach area is in the most prime area- we originally were going to check out some of beach clubs but felt no need to travel and pay when this was right here. All in all this Marriott was a great choice for us and I would recommend it highly."
379,Amazing holiday,50,October 2019,"I stayed at this beautiful , amazing hotel in October. I was in Bali to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday!! I was met at the airport by a Marriott driver and transferred to the hotel. On arrival I was met by Pricilla, guest relations manager, and she supervised the check in procedure. They upgraded my room and she escorted me to my room and high lites areas of interest including the getting around the place. She also invited me to the hotel managers cocktail party which was awesome. It was a beautiful stay and I can highly recommend this fantastic hotel!! I must say a special thank you to Pricilla, Ivan, Whawon , Santiago, Wahyu and Dento the chef!! You guys definitely rock!! Hope to see you again soon!! üíÉüèø"
380,Blissful Balinese Birthday Celebration,50,November 2019,"We had an absolutely exquisite stay and celebration here, which we can attest is truly Bali's finest address.
We were sad to leave and wow to return to this slice of paradise when we visit Bali again.

The property, setting facilities, and more importantly, the service, left a most outstanding impression.

Many thanks to Chinta and team for an unforgettably blissful experience!"
381,Honeymoon in Bali,50,November 2019,"What a beautiful resort with 3 pools, 1 restaurant and a private dinner at rooftop.
If you want luxury this is the place to stay.
Staff were incredibly friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you.
We have been so spoiled tonight at dinner with fillet mignon, lamb and carpaccio.
A wonderful suggestion from CHINTA and amazing service
(you are a legend!) Thanks again.
We will be back!"
382,Mr,50,November 2019,"I would like to thank Sri for her professional

Thank you all Iva Rredwine and all
Recommend this place for singles couples and families
Loved it
Thank you again"
383,Another night in Bali,50,November 2019,"I missed my flight yesterday so i had to book another night in Bali. I chose this hotel as recommended by my friend Calvin Sanjaya.
The hotel‚Äôs so nice and the location‚Äôs just perfect.
At evening, there was a fire dance show as well in the middle of the hotel. I took a chance to enjoy the show and decided to swim right after all the missed-flight drama which i had on the afternoon.
the hospitality in here‚Äôs also good. David from the receptionist desk was so thoughtful to give me a welcome drink to beat the heat after having such a rough day.
Summing it up, this place is a very nice place to stay. From the location, pool, facilities, even the breakfast !
Def will come back !"
384,Beautiful comfortable hotel with great staff,40,October 2019,"I stayed here for 1 week with my mother. She flew in from England while myself only from Perth. I arrived first and enjoyed a nice cold complimentary beer while I waited for the room, it was only 20 minutes.
Rooms are a little small but cosy, with huge showers.
We stayed in room 352 which we found was extremely noisy as we were over the ""kids"" pool area. Although I understand children will be on holiday at the same time I found some of the parents had an awful attitude to other guests by allowing their brats to scream at the top of their lungs in the pool from 5am. At least tell your child to be quiet until a decent hour!

Breakfast in the hotel restaurant ""seminyak kitchen"" every day was amazing, what a selection and what quality! The staff attentive and I was super pleased to be able to order an iced coffee to go included with breakfast! We had a deal including a 2 course lunch and a 3 course dinner at Semintak Kitchen and we went for the lunch, wow it was beautiful - best meal of my whole Bali stay.

We also had free flowing cocktails and canapes from 4-5 daily which was great, I must say the canapes although tasty may as well not be advertised, sometimes we only got 1 little bite sized offering through the whole hour. Definitely not enough to be able to advertise it. Cocktails great.

Swim up bar was a surprise as we didn't realise there was one, so refreshing and such great attentive staff.

We used the shuttle a couple of times to go to the beach, the staff member there was great, friendly and attentive.

Pool guys were great, and kept to the rules of removing guests items who were reserving sunbeds without using them.

There was a bad feeling at the end of our stay though as this is the first hotel I have stayed, especially a 5 star that doesn't have a lounge for guests to use after checking out - a departure lounge.
There is one shower for each guests, which someone was in so we couldn't go through our suitcase and get ready properly. All the guests from the pool use that same toilet so it's very busy. I was quite stressed by the time I left because of this as I couldn't get changed or refresh before my flight."
385,Beautiful Resort made even more beautiful by CHINTA its amazing staffüíù,50,November 2019,"Breakfast at the Seminyak Kitchen was excellent, huge variety and always fresh, we have stayed at some amazing 5 Star resorts around Asia and Seminyak Kitchen breakfast was up there with the best we have ever had.
Happy hour cocktails are a must and for a 5 star resort very reasonably priced ( 2 for the price of one ) Room service was also really well priced.

Very special mention to the amazing CHINTA thanks for an unforgettable holiday,hoping to be back soon"
386,Best service imaginable,40,September 2019,"On an island known for its outstanding service, this hotel surpasses them all. This is my 5th trip to Bali and we had five rooms booked for our group of 20. The hotel itself is what you would expect from a boutique style Seminyak accomodation and it's important that you know what you're getting so there's no disappointment. This by no means a grand, sprawling resort. The setup is similar to the Trans or the Haven with an underwhelming foyer. However, the rooms, breakfast and restaurant in general are excellent. We upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite which was definitely worth the extra money. The space and pool view really made a difference. Breakfast was very good. Great variety, fresh juice station, Chinese bfast etc. plus decent coffees especially the Macchiatto.
The biggest down side to the hotel is the tight pool area and limited seating. Frustrated people walking laps around the pool area looking for a seat is a regular occurrence. The other problem is the lack of sun in the pool area due to the narrow design.
Overall, we had a great time at this resort mainly due to the outstanding service. Nothing was too difficult and care was taken in every interaction. Thank you for making our stay memorable."
387,What a beautiful spot,50,November 2019,My wife and I stayed here for our first visit to bali. Being our first time we were a little apprehensive but I can tell you the staff here sure made us welcome. A big beautiful pool with swim up bar where we were greated daily by the wounderfull mr Wika one of the most helpful and friendly people u have ever met. We ate at the seminyak kitchen everyday we were here at some stage or another and were never disappointed. We were looked after each day by another wonderfully employee Arja who just seemed to be there Every time we were(always so happy and helpfull). In fact I do not have a bad word to say about our stay. We loved everything. The people the venue and all it has to offer. An absolute must if you want to stay in beautifully seminyak.
388,"Higher priced than competitors, but worth the money!",50,November 2019,"I have stayed in this hotel so many times and continue to give it the best reviews. It is clean, efficient, and well-run. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I've seen anywhere. Staff always makes me feel at home. I shall return there again in a few months!"
389,Our awesome stay at Courtyard,50,November 2019,"Definitely have enjoyed our time at Courtyard Marriott in room 341. The room was spacious and big, cleaners very good. One of the best buffet breakfasts I‚Äôve had. The pool by the bar is so nice. Highlight to some superstar staff - Priscilla, Daniel, Indah and Tony have such an exceptional level of customer service. Will be back on our next stay to Bali! So sad to leave tomorrow :("
390,Friendly Place,50,November 2019,This is a great hotel in every way for solo traveler families or couples Great Location amazing service and ammenities The breakfast is wonderful and the staff are terrific you can‚Äôt fault this hotel The rooms are clean comfortable and lovely balcony overlooking the pool
391,What a fantastic place to stay,50,November 2019,This would have to be one of the most fantastic places to stay in Bali. The staff are fantastic nothing is too much for them to assist you with. If you want a relaxing holiday this is where to experience it. Highly recommend the Marriott to everyone
392,A home away from home,50,November 2019,"We stay for 2 weeks in the Courtyard in Seminyak and we are impressed from this hotel. For many years we stayed in a other hotel here in Seminyak, due to some bad experiences at our last visit, we were looking for a new place and found our new home away from home here at the Courtyard. From the very first moment we are treated like family members. All the management staff and the chefs have a chat with us every day. If we need anything extra, it is done within minutes. We really feel like VIPS here. Check in was in our room and extraordinary friendly. We loved that there was a welcome letter and some chocolates waiting for us already. Even a welcome drink was served. As gold members we got a room upgrade and we are very satisfied with our room. Bathroom is quite large with a good working rainforest shower. A comfy bed, a large flatscreen and a nice balcony makes our stay very comfortable and relaxing. Housekeeping is doing a great job keeping everything very clean and tidy. Breakfast is wonderful with lots of choices,fresh juices and prepared to order dishes. We already had dinner twice here in their restaurant and the same as for breakfast, stunning quality and lovely presentation. Best of all are the people working here. We never experienced such a lovely team in any other hotel we have been. We spend at least half of the year in 4 or 5 star hotels either for business or vacation. The experience with the staff here in the Courtyard is the Best in many years. We really do feel like family members and not like hotel guests. Our biggest Thanks goes to the outstanding team here in the Courtyard. We are still one week here in the hotel and already looking forward to our next visit. We found our dream hotel in Seminyak. Thanks so much to make our stay a memorable one."
393,Birthday week,50,November 2019,Thank you for another wonderful week of Courtyard Seminyak hospitality as only you know how to deliver. Your staff are an absolute credit to you with special mention to Ari the concierge who offered to drive me to the pharmacy when I was unwell and accompanied me inside and then drove us back to the hotel. That is going above and beyond expectations yet was so appreciated. Our birthday celebrations were so much fun shared with Ramu and the breakfast team and also with China and team at the amazing full moon dinner. Thanks again for ‚Äúwelcoming us home‚Äù
394,Full moon Dinner suggestion from beautiful CHINTAüíù,50,November 2019,"The facilities at this hotel are good and the location is also convenient if you like Kuta. The breakfast- OMG! We have never experienced such a variety! Absolutely amazing each day knowing you have such a large choice in what to eat...Thank you CHINTA for the beautiful experience of the 3 course Degustation menu for the full moon Dinner. Thanks again.

Well done to Chef Donald and teams who work at rooftop bar ....it's delicious, fabulous and well worth a visit to."
395,Great hotel in a great location.,50,November 2019,"We stayed here twice on our recent trip to Bali. First we stayed for 3 nights - then after 5 nights in a private villa we returned for another 4 night stay. This hotel has everything you could want for a Bali getaway. Fantastic rooms that are modern, clean, spacious and well appointed. The pool complex is amazing with a swim up bar and plenty of sun beds - we never missed out on getting a spot for the day. Our package included a 60 minute massage which was very professional and of a high quality. The daily breakfast buffet was outstanding....everything is taken care of and the food is outstanding. This hotel is located only a 5 minute walk to the beach...a 20 minute walk to Seminyak Square and surrounded by great places to eat and drink. Lastly, the staff at Courtyard are amazing!! You won't regret booking a stay here."
396,Courtyard Review 10/10,50,November 2019,"We had a lovey stay at the Courtyard. Amazing staff who go over and above to ensure you are well looked after. In particular, Feby at breakfast and all of the other staff who made us delicious omelets every morning. 10/10"
397,Love it best JW in Asia,50,September 2019,"Good to stay here.
Staff is super friendly & helpful
However is also good to visit for one meal one drink
Which I always did
I also love to join event conducted in this venue.
The place real chil from security house till the lobby, restaurant...they have amazing team."
398,Didnt Enjoy,20,November 2019,"Very flat faced hospitality with no courtesey visible. Stayed 2 nights here, despite the fully prepaid booking, the minibar was empty as it seems the hotel couldnt trust its guest with a few beer bottles / miniatures. Room was just ok, nothing great for the price paid. Breakfast was nothing great either. Harrowing time for vegetarians at this property. The overall vibe was not very favourable. AVOIDABLE FOR INDIANS, to say the least."
399,had a great stay with my friend,50,November 2019,there are shuttle to the private beach and city center by buggy. so convenient :) i had a great stay with my japanese friend here and spend good time. breakfast also great with smile of the staff. there are a private area too if you want to do sunbathing at the beach
400,Faultless,50,November 2019,"Our second stay here - beautiful grounds and pool, clean and spacious rooms, all food is great - from breakfast, snacks by the pool and dinner.
What makes this hotel stand out is the staff, every person that we dealt with went above and beyond to help - special mention to the poolside bar staff for the friendly service and welcoming attitude. Management should be very proud of the way their staff represent the Hotel."
401,Amazing,50,November 2019,"My husband and I had 7 wonderful nights at the Courtyard Marriot.
Everything about it was excellent. The room, pools, pool lounge, location, dining options, buffet breakfast and especially the staff. All very friendly and willing to go above and beyond to ensure out stay was amazing.
Special mention to the ‚ÄòSeminyak Kitchen‚Äô staff, but especially Widi and Saih, beautiful people who we looked forward to seeing in the mornings as they greeted us and treated us like family.
Other staff to mention Baskara in housekeeping, for the lovely little gifts and towel animals he would leave us, a very nice touch. Also the very helpful concierge Arya and customer liaison and management team like Daniel, John, Bobby and Chinta who were interested in our feedback to make sure our needs were met and expectations exceeded. In fact the customer service in general is exceptional in all areas of the resort.
Also loved the free shuttle to ‚Äòeat street‚Äô or the Courtyard‚Äôs private beach which was also within walking distance.
A truly lovely experience in Bali thanks to Courtyard Marriott. Would love to come again."
402,Best staff in Bali,50,November 2019,"Staffs are so friendly almost feels like home. The guest relationship team always tries to go the extra mile. Pricilla, Eka, Tony, Lovina to name a few.
The rooms are clean, pool bars are chilled, they also have a beach club so that you can enjoy the ocean. Cost performance is excellent."
403,Amazing.. just amazing .,50,November 2019,"Came to Bali for a mums get away and so glad we stayed here. The staff are amazing. The rooms are clean, tidy and spacious. Not overly expensive but a great vibe for all. Have already booked a return with the family.. thank you"
404,A business meet and stay,40,October 2019,"Beautiful location, a great place for vacation and also for business meetings. Very near to the beach. Courteous service and cordial staff. Well trained too. stayed there for 4 nights. Have a nice pool and lounge."
405,A home in Bali,50,November 2019,"We like Courtyard for its staff from Front Desk to Housekeeping, F&B and Concierge. They have very good customer service, to mention a few are: Mita (staff at Seminyak Kitchen), Arya and Komang (room attendants). Very good facilities. clean place, good location and events."
406,We LOVED our stay at Courtyard ‚ù§Ô∏è,50,October 2019,"We stayed here for 7 nights and loved every minute of our stay! The staff are what made it so special - they‚Äôre amazing! The breakfast choice was great and the breakfast staff always made you feel so welcome on a morning. The room was super spacious, with the balcony overlooking the garden area. We got cookies delivered to our room from the hotel manager which was such a lovely gesture, the service was incredible.The little touches they left after cleaning the room is what made us smile too, thank you too Dinantara for our Bali key chains we received on our last day we love them and was super thoughtful! Our room was spotless every day and we appreciated it so much

The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Seminyak Beach in where we watched sunset at La Plancha, it was amazing!! Surrounded by many restaurants and bars further up, not to mention how great the What The Truck tacos were and super cheap, try them out if you get a chance !!

I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough, if your staying in the Seminyak area please spend your time here as you won‚Äôt regret it! Courtyard made our experience in Bali perfect thank you"
407,"Still, one of our favorite hotel",50,November 2019,"been staying in Courtyard Marriott and loving everything about the hotel ever since

Staff is very friendly and eager to make your stay better since the moment of check-in. They dont really seem to hesitate to give an upgrade when available. but the hotel is easily full due to its location and interesting price.

They have table tennis, quite a good gym and beautiful pool. their pizza is delicious. cant remember the last time i finished pizza that fast.

Room and bed are very cozy. but my favorite feature is actually the vibe. Dont know how they do it, but the hotel seems to always have a good vibe, happy customers and vibrant atmosphere lol

surely a comeback!"
408,Bali holiday,50,November 2019,"Excellent service,taco van good value staff excellent,special mention to staff,Sri poolside waitress,and yoga instructor Bintang.security very comforting and friendly. Great holiday will recommend to others"
409,"Great location, great rooms!",50,October 2019,"What a hotel!! We loved this place! We had a ground floor 1 bedroom suite! It was great for the 4 of us! We had 2 roll away beds and the room was huge.

My children wrote little notes to the housekeeping staff and they wrote back and made little towel animals and placed their teddies on them, They loved getting back to our room to check out what they had done.

The pool is great for young and old, the staff are lovely, the breakfast was A+. The location was perfect, a short walk to the beach or a scooter ride. Mimi Mart across the road. Popcorn and fairy floss is a lovely touch for the kiddies!
We'll be back!!"
410,Wonderful 4 Nights Stay,50,November 2019,"It‚Äôs a 5-star rating for a 4-star hotel. Courtyard Seminyak is way better than the other Courtyard I‚Äôve stayed. This is my 3rd visit to Bali and I always choose Marriott. Indeed a Marriott culture mixed with authentic Balinese service is the main reason why I love coming back to Bali.

Thanks to Ivan for the flawless check in. Anka, Arja and Febry were friendly and ensured that our dining experience is always memorable. Chef Jabrix at the live egg station was fantastic. Dede from the pool bar did a wonderful job too. Ridwan, Ari, Hardi and most especially Widiadnyana from concierge were awesome!

Room was spacious and the pool is beautiful. Location is convenient too. They have a shuttle to the beach if you want. I would highly recommend this hotel."
411,Amazing stay,50,October 2019,Thanks to all staff at the resort it was an amazing place to stay. Chinta was great with the service and hospitality at the resort. The food and drinks were great also. It was so awesome. I did not want to leave this resort. It‚Äôs close to other shops and restaurants and 10 minutes walk to the beach or you can take the shuttle service to courtyard beach area.
412,EXCELLENT!!!!!,50,October 2019,"From check-in to check-out, all the staff were really kind.
Thank you all Mr Daniel Bartolomeus,
Ms Priscillia, EKA and SAIH, Mr ADE and KITCHEN Chef .......
Great breakfast,lunch and dinner....
Located at central of semiak.
A lot of shopping in walking distance.
Not far from the beaches.
Beautiful pools and free beer on check-in.

Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
413,Silver Wedding Anniversary,50,October 2019,"We arrived after a hot and humid two hour drive from Ubud, unfortunately we were a little early and our room was not ready. We were offered a welcome drink so as we sat and waited for our room we enjoyed a ice cold beer. 15 minutes later the lady who checked us in approached us and apologised that our room still wasn't ready but would we like another complimentary beer while we waited. Excellent customer service. As it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary they had decorated the room and left us a plate of chocolates. In our room we received complimentary water everyday and our maid left us a little gift with a note on the bed each evening, nice touch. The breakfast was expansive with various dishes from around the world. Unfortunately on the first morning we opted for a western style cooked breakfast as we had a tour organised we were the first to enter. The breakfast items were all cold, don't know how as they had just opened. The other mornings we visited the place was very busy and on one occasion another couple took our table. The reception area has free popcorn and candy floss and outside there is a food truck connected to the property. The hotel offers a free shuttle to various locations and also has it's own private beach. Our flight home was at midnight and the hotel allowed us to use the facilities to freshen up."
414,Best breakfast ever,50,October 2019,"Best breakfast ever, great and friendly staff, top security being an American chain, Central to semiak. Highly recommended, lots of shopping in walking distance, not far from the beaches. Children friendly, beautiful pools and free beer on check-in."
415,Home Away from Home,50,October 2019,"The location of the hotel was perfect - close enough to walk to the main road, the restaurants, the bars and the beach, yet just away enough from all the action when you are after a quiet haven. The room and bathroom were very spacious, modern and comfortable with fantastic amenities, and the hotel's pool was such a delight to dip in every day with the sunken bar as the highlight where you can sip amazing cocktails. Check-in was smooth and efficient and Sekartaji from Reservations was so helpful and assisted greatly with all our enquiries. Breakfast each morning in the restaurant was such a great way to start each day with the widest buffet choices. The restaurant staff greeted us each morning with a big smile and made us feel welcomed and nothing was too hard for Anka to ensure that we were happy and well looked after. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we were acknowledged by everyone and felt safe. Everyone made us feel so special that we decided to extend our stay for 2 additional nights. We will definitely be back."
416,My Home Away From Home,50,October 2019,"Wherever i am travelling across South Asia or Asia Pacific I try to add a stop in Bali so I can stay at the Marriott Courtyard. It is situated right in the heart of busy Seminyak, surrounded by great bars, restaurants, spas and boutiques, and yet once you cross the threshold you enter a world of chill. The hotel is built around a two-tiered swimming pool and pool bar where you can hang out, relax or catch a sports game or listen to live music. The breakfasts are fully-loaded in the busy buffet restaurant with Western, Asian and local Bali choices not to forget a well-stocked juice bar and plenty of healthy food as well. The staff are incredibly friendly, stopping to saying hello and learn your name and a little bit about you. There's a gym and beauty spa and lots of activities for kids from what I could see and yoga classes on the roof. The rooms are more than spacious with comfy beds and big, well appointed bathrooms with waterfall showers. You can sit on the balcony and watch the world go round or nip down to the pool or grass area and take a nap under the parasols or on the huge bean bags. Seriously, I love staying here. And, this time round I stayed in one night for dinner at the Seminyak Kitchen and it was absolute quality. Thanks to all for making my stay so welcoming."
417,Very nice hotel,50,October 2019,"Awesome and fun hotel at seminyak, also the staff are really welcome and friendly. If you need any info about hotel you can ask Cinta, she‚Äôs really helpful staff. Seminyak kitchen has loads of variaties from rice and noodles to breads and bagels. The atmosphere is always busy there and a plus to the bagels there; it is sooooo delicious, very recommendable!"
418,Amazing,50,October 2019,"Stayed for two days one night here. Enjoyed everything. The room was great, service was amazing, pool was lovely and did not regret to do the Romatic dinner offered by Chinta, the sales, was absolutely romantic."
419,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,October 2019,"From the minute you arrive at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak you are treated like your the only guest in the hotel. The staff go above and beyond to attend to your needs. From reception to the pool bar and pool attendants thru to housekeeping who leave your room immaculate each day you definitely get your money‚Äôs worth at this hotel.
I‚Äôve stayed several times at courtyard and every time we stay the staff continue to go out of their way to attend to you and make it a very pleasant stay.
Our room was always spotlessly clean, fresh towels and bed linen changed regularly.
The breakfast is second to none and so many varieties offered. Love the fresh juice and smoothy bar.
Don‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Seminyak stay at the courtyard"
420,A Seminyak MUST stay :),50,October 2019,"I would highly recommend staying at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak. From the moment you are greeted and transferred from the airport to the welcome beers at reception you are treated with nothing short of amazing service. Firstly I would like to take the time to thank Eka and her team at reception for helping organise a birthday surprise including champagne, cake and flowers for my best friend‚Äôs birthday. The time you took to organise this all and the constant email updates prior to arrival was second to none ‚Äì Thank you very much. I would also like to take this time to thank Febri and Sri who were absolutely outstanding during our time by the pool. Their attention to detail and service was impeccable and nothing was ever too much for them. Thank you for making our time extra special we cannot wait to come back and see you both. A big thank you to Chinta as well who would personally make sure we were having the best time possible. I would also like to commend Willi ‚Äì she was our breakfast attendant and was one of the most genuine and lovely people we met in Bali ‚Äì Thank you for our coffees before we even asked for them you are a credit to this hotel. The rooms are beautiful by design and housekeeping do the most amazing job each day. I would definitely return to this hotel and would have no hesitation to recommend it to all my friends and family. Keep up the great work guys; there is not one aspect of this hotel i can fault. You all do an amazing job and the team work shows. Cannot wait to return ÔÅä"
421,Great staff and great location,40,October 2019,"We stayed here as a family of 6, so we had two interconnecting rooms. The only negatives about the room was the view overlooked the back of the hotel which was not very appealing, our room had a glass 'wall' and you could see the person on the toilet from the entrance door and the interconnecting room, and the fridge didn't work. I tried to get another room but it was going to cost too much.
Other than that the staff were so lovely and really helpful. Breakfast was included in our booking and we were spoilt for choice. The food was amazing! We loved the swim up pool bar, the pool, the gym was great and the spa was excellent. Location was great too, with a mini mart across the road, markets, we used the hotel shuttle quite a lot and we trusted the hotel to find a reputable taxi service for us when we needed it.
There are definitely more positives than negatives and we all said that we'd stay there again.
Thank you again to the lovely staff who helped make our stay a memorable one. We hope to be back next year."
422,Relaxation and Excellent Service,50,October 2019,"What a great location and facility for just about any activity you want to enjoy in Bali. A 10 minute walk from the Beach, it is also one block from shopping and is self contained with multiple pools, restaurants, and a wonderful spa. The rooms are lovely and the facility is immaculately clean. The staff are well trained and seem to enjoy working with the the guests. I want to particularly mention Joni, who worked two days at the beach site where guest have a secure location to enjoy swimming and surfing on the Double Six Beach. They have towels, umbrellas, chairs and cold water as well as a shuttle if you don't want to walk the 10 minutes back and forth.
While I didn't go to the pool, since I love swimming in the ocean, many families enjoyed the pool facilities.
Transportation is very accessible anywhere in Bali for a reasonable fee. The food at the hotel was very high quality with a large selection of different types of food. i enjoyed a Balinese massage which felt fantastic after a day of bird watching in Ubud.
It was a truly wonderful get away."
423,Great Staff,50,October 2019,"All round great and friendly staff. Staff knew you by your drink. always willing to help nothing was too much for them.

I highly recommend staying at this hotel. plenty of things to do around the hotel."
424,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,October 2019,"Courtyard Marriott hotel is by far the best stay in Bali. Excellent service, customer focused and great location. I would like to thank all Courtyard Marriott staff that made our (my sister and me) stay memorable. The restaurant with all the variety of choices and such friendly staff makes your holiday worth while. Compliments to the chefs too."
425,Awesome hotel N staff,50,October 2019,"Awesome hotel, good location, nice staff, excellent service from ms Chinta,
Reasonable price to stay.. Big pool for family.. and nice acoustic music at saturday night @kitchen seminyak restaurant, barbeque is so tasty.. come and I guarantee you won‚Äôt regret it"
426,"If I could give 6 stars, I would",50,October 2019,"Our third stay in 4 years and the hotel gets better each stay. Had a 7 night Seminyak Ultimate Relaxation - great value. Includes hour drinks each day and return airport transfer.

Thank you to all the staff including Bayu, Mita, Lieong and Vamy."
427,General,50,October 2019,"Stayed with family 2017 and come back this year again to the same hotel. Highly recommended and absolutely amazing in every aspect. From very friendly welcome , amazing and most lovely staff, service provided by the pool , buffet breakfast and dinners at Seminyak kitchen atmosphere and cleanliness of rooms. Very family friendly and very happy with everything will always remember my visits to Courtyard as a most lovely experience."
428,Highly recommended for family holiday,50,October 2019,"Perfect for family group with adults and young children. Pool facilities were excellent, cleanliness checked regularly, pool staff vigilant so that no-one could 'hog' the seats and there was never a problem getting a deckchair or bean bag. Waiter service poolside was quick and efficient and a good range of food and drinks available. Rooms (we had pool access) were spacious, clean and air con was refreshing to return to after being out in the heat. Location was good, plenty of shopping, entertainment, restaurants, mini marts nearby. Staff were excellent, well trained, patient with rowdy customers, beautiful with the children! Special mention and thanks to Ramu from the front office for going above and beyond to organise a visit to a local school."
429,Disappointed with the downgrade,30,October 2019,"I stayed for my honeymoon here for two nights and we booked a double King size bed for the occasion. Not only were not given the double king size bed, but they gave us two single separated beds, and they gave us a refund of ‚Ç¨13 only! They said they would move us to the room we booked next morning but they never came. They came the next day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon but we were sleeping and we couldn't change room, and also they didn't clean the room we were staying. The rest of the hotel was fine but we were really bothered with the downgrade and the insignificant refund in comparison to what I have paid."
430,Great location,50,June 2019,This hotel provides both location and reasonable price. Simple and clean facilities. Swimming pool with sun beds available as well as in house bar. You only need 5 min. walk to main street from the hotel and they also provide city pick up & drop service. Convenient hotel.
431,"Friendliest Staff in Seminyak & Celiac Friendly, Too!",50,October 2019,"We booked a last minute anniversary trip to Seminyak in Bali and thought we would try out the Courtyard. Our expectations were not just met, they were exceeded! The rooms were a nice size, and very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful - no request was too small. Before arriving I had been slightly nervous about the availability of gluten free foods during breakfast but that turned out to be needless because each morning the chef‚Äôs assistant spoke to me personally to take my order!!"
432,Fantastic Stay......Can't Wait to go Back!,50,September 2019,"Our family and friends of ours (2 other families) recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for 8 nights in September. Our first time to Bali we weren't sure what to expect, but it definitely exceeded our expectations and we are already planning our next trip back.....thanks to the great experience the Courtyard Marriot gave us. The hotel itself has a great vibe and is ideal for families or couples. Our 4 and 8 year old boys spent all day in the pool, which has a dedicated shallow area for kids, as well as the adults end which encompasses the pool bar. If they weren't in the pool they were asking to go to the Kids Club which gave you 2 hours free child minding every day. The added bonus of unlimited popcorn and fairy floss in the lobby also sealed the deal for the kids. We also used the baby sitting service a couple of nights to allow my husband and I some time to ourselves - the same staff from the kids club doubled as baby sitters, which meant my boys knew them and felt comfortable with them. The Hotel itself is modern, clean and very well maintained. The rooms were well appointed (maybe starting to show some signs of age, but nothing compared to the other hotel we have stayed at after this one). I was also most impressed that the rooms included decent hair dryers that could actually dry long hair - something that not many hotels are able to provide. The hotel also provides free bottled water and it was never a problem if we asked for more. I also utilised ""Zanti the Retreat"" - the hotels Spa - for a couple of massages and the staff and massages there were fantastic. The most memorable part of our stay were the staff at the Courtyard Marriott - they were just lovely and could not do enough for you. In particular, I would like to thank Anka and Chef Cadol in Seminyak Kitchen (the hotels restaurant). My husband has a number of dietary requirements and Anka and Chef Cadol ensured that they knew what my husband could not eat and made a note in the kitchen for every time we ate there or from the pool side menu. This was definitely above and beyond and not what we were expecting. It gave my husband piece of mind to eat without fearing he'd have a reaction. Anka would also come and say good morning or evening whenever he saw us in the restaurant which made us and our boys feel very welcome. I'd also like to thank the concierge staff - they were always organising restaurant bookings and chauffeur bookings - all done with a smile and they never missed a beat. All in all, a fantastic stay and we will definitely be back."
433,Another Relaxing Stay,50,October 2019,"Our 4th stay at the Courtyard Marriott.
Again stayed in a 1 Bedroom Suite. Very comfortable and spacious.
Staff are fantastic friendly and accommodating.
The swim up pool bar is a great place to meet and mingle.
Great drinks and food especially Happy hour time.
Special thanks to Ayu for her great service and friendly smile and all the great team see you all next year"
434,Amazing hotel. Superb facilities and staff.,50,October 2019,"We stayed 5 nights in October. The hotel, staff and facilities are all 5 star.

Room was nice (a little loud), pool area and pool bar are amazing and serve good food and drink. Hotel breakfast is just amazing. Gym is pretty good also if you fancy it.

I really recommend this place."
435,Loves our stay,50,October 2019,"This is our second time staying at the Courtyard Marriott Resort, Breakfast also very good massive selection, pool areas also great. One thing we love about this hotel is the staff every staff member we met would go out of their way to help us.
Very good location and clean.
Thanks to Chinta very polite and always friendly and helpful. See you again on our next stay at the Courtyard Seminyak Resort"
436,Amazing hotel,50,October 2019,"Chinta. Very approachable, friendly, knowledge of hotel outstanding made for an enjoyable great holiday.Great location poolside bar highly facilities clean,tidy and all the staff very friendly and helpful."
437,Beautiful hotel,50,October 2019,"Seminyak kitchen is a nice modern design cafe/restaurant ,the food is delicious, friendly staff .I used to work with Chinta when the hotel newly opened back in 2014 at the Kid club, I am so proud of her for what she has accomplished and her hard work . She is a valuable asset to the Marriot group."
438,Great Hotel and most pleasant service,50,October 2019,"We have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for our first 3 nights after arriving for the first time in Bali.

The hotel staff is amazing! Very friendly, warm and welcoming and helpful! David was a great help during our stay! We had been traveling for 24h and wanted to get some rest but got placed in a corner room directly by the streets - so cars on both sides-traffic is very bad in Bali, so it was super loud.

Within no time and with understanding David moved us to another room and even upgraded us ;) we did not expect this as all we wanted is a quite room but it was a super nice surprise- THANK YOU!!

The rooms are spacious (booked originally a Deluxe room) and clean and housekeeping did an amazing job!

The pool area is something for everybody: quite at the middle part and also good Musik and a chill area by the pool bar! Here the staff was always around and food and drinks we can recommend as well :)
One thing we liked is if you are not at your sun chairs within 30 minutes the gently remove your items to a secure place so other guests can use the chairs and no one can reserve chairs for any longer which only seems fair!

The breakfast is simply the best I have had in a long time in hotels: they just got everything covered and it‚Äôs more like a brunch - we loved it!!

The also have a taco & smoothie truck outside the lobby and it‚Äôs just perfect for a quick, simple and good snack during the day!

The location of the hotel is convenient: just a 5 minutes walk to the beach and there is a super market right across the hotel as well as shops and massages - close by within 10 to 15 minutes walk you will find restaurants and just about further about a 20 minute walk you are in the center with more bars and restaurant-the hotel also does provide an shuttle service

Overall I would come back any time and might hopefully very soon again;)

Thank you team Courtyard Seminyak;)
See you soon!"
439,Great customer service.,50,July 2019,We have a wonderful 5 day stay at Marriott Courtyard Seminyak. The breakfast kitchen was the highlight and the happy hours was a great idea. Special shout out to Hendra and Annika and literally all the staff and leadership team for their genuine efforts.
440,"This is the Best Hotel
EVER!! Thank you!",50,October 2019,"We‚Äôve just stayed here for 7 days and without a doubt, this is the BEST hotel we‚Äôve ever been to! The staff made us feel so welcomed and loved! We cannot recommend this place anymore! The food in the Seminyak kitchen is phenomenal, the rooms perfect and pool fabulous, but the people are just INCREDIBLE! Special thank you to Anka, Anton, Widi, Arini, Jabrik, Dicky and Ayu, everyone on staff is so kind! Thank you and You‚Äôll be seeing us again! God bless!"
441,Holiday/work,50,October 2019,Great hotel. Rooms are large and very nice. Staff could not be more helpful. Pool and pool bar is great can find shade and sun whatever you want. The food truck out side hotel has food and drinks at a very reasonable price. Breakfast has everything. Hotel is central to everything but you need transport. Took us a couple of days to get our bearings as we haven‚Äôt been here before. There is a shuttle to eat street and it‚Äôs own private beach. Which is very convenient. They also have cars you can hire to take you further if need be. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance of hotel as well but we didn‚Äôt explore these. The day sap is exceptional and reasonably priced. Happy hour every evening between 5and 7. And 9 and 10. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
442,Worth It,50,October 2019,"Cannot fault anything.
Stayed here as part of a package deal from Air NZ which is worth every dollar.
Room is good size, very clean and beds are nice.
Food is tasty and service is fast.
Pool is enticing with their pool bar.
They got fun and short activities every day to keep guests occupied.
I would like to thank all the lovely, kind, and warm staff as they made our stay excellent."
443,Amazing Stay,50,October 2019,"It was really an amazing Stay with my family, kids aged 14 and 10. It was a home away from home and Mr.Anka Seal , manager at 1st floor restaurant was so very warm and hospitable..who specially went out of the way to prepare vegan dishes for our family..
We would really like to thank him for his effort.."
444,super hotel,50,September 2019,"we have stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and really loved it. Super clean, comfortable, very good staff and overall our experience for amazing. Especially enjoyed breakfast. It's 5 minutes walk to the ocean beach, but they have free shuttle to their private spot there. Overall very excited by being there. Thank you"
445,Not happy.....to be leaving!,50,October 2019,"I should start this by saying that any negative reviews on here are clearly nonsense or written by lunatics as this place is spectacularly good and if I could give more stars I would.
We came on a deal with Air New Zealand that included flights, room, transfers, breakfast and a whole host of other goodies including free-flow cocktails from 4-5pm.
We came as a group of work colleagues and when the deal comes up next year we will be bringing even more people with us.
The Staff - the staff here are the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met. They bend over backwards to help and to make you feel welcome. And they are genuine.
In addition I met the general manager, John, who was helping clear plates in the restaurant which I consider to be excellent management. He took time to talk to me and to explain the policy for food and toiletry waste (which is excellent) and later in the day still remembered my name! To me that makes a huge difference. I know I we are just bodies in the hotel but everyone makes you feel like part of the Marriott family. The bar staff, the restaurant staff, the housekeeping team, the concierges, every person here has a smile for you.
The Rooms - fantastic, great view of the pool, scrupulously clean, spacious enough for 2. Great shower. Super comfy bed, perfect air-con and every amenity. I cannot fault the room.
Seminyak Kitchen - OMG, the food! Incredible. If you fill up at breakfast you wont need to eat until dinner time! The curry every morning was incredible and the dragonfruit smoothie, well......
Facilities - gym is very well kitted out with good quality gear. Very clean and good enough for most peoples requirements. The spa was amazing, my first ever massage was an experience never to be forgotten. So good, so professional.
The pool is superb, plenty of space with excellent access to the bar, plenty of seating and sun beds and attentive staff.

The bottom line is that the whole hotel is superb and while there are other places, and cheaper places I will not stay anywhere else when in this part of Bali. We are already planning another trip in April and will be looking for that deal to pop up again.

Thank you to the entire crew at the Marriott - you made our holiday very special."
446,"Great location, great staff",50,September 2019,"We enjoyed our stay here at the Courtyard which is conveniently located amongst restaurants, shopping and of course tattoo studios :) . The grounds are well maintained and the facilities were sparkling clean and comfortable. Of course the level of a resort depends on the hospitality of the people. I would like to give a shout out to Sintya who made us lovely fruit juices at breakfast in the buffet which was always well stocked and with everyday changes to the selection while maintaining quality. The custom made omelettes change daily so do not miss the balinese omelette if you get a chance. Each morning we were greeted by Ayu and Anka Sealthiel who were helpful, friendly and pleasant to meet. I would also like to compliment the helpfulness of the person who checked us and escorted us to the room however I have misplaced her card. The quality and the consistency of the service in Bali makes us appreciate the value we get by being a Marriott Bonvoy member!!"
447,Beautiful Hotel,50,September 2019,"I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak for 5 nights with 2 friends.

Beautiful hotel and facilities. The pool was the highlight. We spent hours next to the pool ordering cocktails.

The rooms were clean but a little small for 3 women. There was some confusion when we first arrived about our booking as we booked online at booking.com not through the hotel website directly. They thought the booking was for 2 people not 3 but was all sorted out in the end.
Great location close to the beach but out of the main busy area so not noisy at night.

Amazing buffet breakfast! Very friendly and helpful staff. I definitely would stay again."
448,Great service,50,October 2019,"We stayed at Courtyard for 5 nights and I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Beautiful place. Fantastic staff. Amazing service.
The kids events were really enjoyable and the pool is superb. Make sure you get the breakfast because it‚Äôs soo good. Totally enjoyed our time at Courtyard."
449,Six Star Service,50,October 2019,"We‚Äôd planned 8 nights at the Courtyard by Marriott. After one of the most enjoyable & comfortable stays, we extended another 5 days. Every request made, to any of the staff, was actioned immediately. Thumbs up for service, comfort and location. We WILL be back"
450,Wonderful Week,50,October 2019,"Relaxing and enjoyable stay. Every amenity you need for a week of R&R. Staff excellent, rooms very clean and modern, efficient check in and out and spacious bathrooms. Many food choices amongst their kitchen and bars, pool side service and quality was awesome. Special thanks to Ari, Bhawana & Penny who will go over and above to satisfy your every need."
451,Warm and comfy atmosphere,50,August 2019,"Loved the hotel! Very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of good deals. Especially liked goodbye dinner at Seminyak kitchen. Lots of thanks to Widi, who made our romantic getaway with my boyfriend unforgetable ."
452,Courtyard Marriott,50,October 2019,"Hotel was amazing!
Good quality food, and amazing staff!
Everyone is so polite and friendly, I loved the music playing everyday and passing it before going to poolbar!

You feel so welcome from the day you walk in to the day you walk out, loved how we got little treats sent to our room and the hygiene of the rooms is excellent!!

What made our stay much better was all the staff
But two really stood out for us Chinta and Sri Lovely personality and enjoyable to be around definitely makes me want to come back and see them again!"
453,Our daughter's wedding trip - Thank you Ramu (Front Office Manager),40,September 2019,"A large group of us stayed at this hotel (Recommended by our niece) - over 21 rooms booked mid to late September 2019 ranging from 5 to 7 nights.
The rooms are a good size and clean, bed comfortable, staff are courteous and friendly, great location and great atmosphere.
I am Lactose intolerant and asked if they had lactose free milk. Mr Ketut Ramudayana (the front office manager) who was in the restaurant approached me and what happened next blew me away. He went out of his way to try and solve my problem. Contacted a chef and asked the person to go to the markets to buy some lactose free milk. The chef purchased what was available - a baby's formula milk powder. Unfortunately they don't have lactose free milk available (like we get it in Oz) in Bali. The mere fact that they went to so much trouble to try and help me is testament to Ramu's desire to provide exceptional customer service.
A few days later John (GM) was standing at the entrance to the restaurant at breakfast and I was able to provide him feedback with both my exceptional experience with Ramu and not so good experience with a front desk team member ref: the credit purchased at check-in. Thank you for listening and solving the problem for me.
The food and entertainment at the hotel is very good. Especially the Trio, two acoustic guitarist and Baby bass, whose harmonies were very very good. They entertained us on the lawn area during a BBQ theme evening dinner.
Great location, great atmosphere."
454,"Pretty Good, but not really 5-Star",20,August 2019,"We booked a 1 bedroom Pool View room which was located on the top, (6th) floor.
Our greeting at the front desk was pleasant, although due to the larger than expected size of the place and subsequent influx of new guests it seemed a bit rushed and robotic. There was the added pressure of having to immediately decide how much of a tab to put on our room account which cheapened the experience somewhat.
The room was spacious and tidy although a few aspects tainted our stay. The tiny fridge did not work so we couldn't chill our water. The fridge was finally replaced on day two. There were no tea or coffee making facilities which is a strange omission for alleged 5-star accommodation. The bed had only a warm doona/quilt but no flat sheet which was another strange omission given the ultra hot and humid climate in Bali. Sleeping was difficult as we had to continually adjust the air-conditioning to suit this limited bedding option.
The included breakfast was good, plenty of varied options, although the coffee was dreadful, which seems to be a common problem throughout Bali.
The beach shuttle was irregular and didn't actually take you all the way to the designated 'Marriott' part of the beach.
Other than these minor gripes the staff made a good effort and the place was in pretty good condition, although structurally it looks to be collapsing in places, (see pictures) this could be just cosmetic damage caused by the regular earth tremors? Whatever it is it should be looked at.
There are performers playing acoustic guitar and singing modern western 'hits' until 9pm every night. This became quite nauseating after a few nights, we would have preferred to hear traditional Balinese music but I guess they feel like they need to stoop to the lowest common denominator to keep the punters happy?
Our lasting impression was that due to the large size of the hotel the service isn't as personable as you get elsewhere and that management operates it on a shoestring budget. We also got the feeling that the staff tried hard but might be a bit downtrodden and not entirely happy in their workplace.
Even though it was generally a decent stay i'm sure there are numerous better options in Seminyak so there is no way we would stay here again."
455,Hotel experience,50,September 2019,"My experience at this hotel was amazing because of their service and the facilities they had was good and it was close to shops and the beach and not only that they were always willing to greet you and help you and the food was amazing and breakfast was amazing and have the opportunity to have a shuttle bus go to the beach

My Overall rating for this hotel is 10/10
i Recommend this Courtyard my Marriott
hope to comeback to bali and stay in the same hotel"
456,A must stay,50,September 2019,"We had the best time at this amazing hotel
Excellent location, excellent hotel and the staff were incredible, especially Widi and Arja .. they went over and beyond in the Seminyak Kitchen not matter what time and they are a credit to the company .. and the pool staff were fantastic! Thank you Hendra, Narita and Penny
We will definitely be back üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
457,First time in Bali,50,September 2019,"We family 2 adults and 8yr old stayed 5 nights at this resort. We loved it straight away. We had a suite it was clean and comfortable and the bed was lovely to sleep on. We had a balcony with pool view. Room #543 and it was quiet. Hello to all the wonderful hardworking staff, you do an amazing job, thank you. Also the housekeeping was outstanding.Always greeted with a smile, nothing was a problem.Had a great time at the pool bar and great service and music. The food is amazing and we had the buffet bbq in the garden one night. Yum! Its close to shops and restaurants and the shuttle can take you to the beach. We recommend Courtyard Marriott."
458,Really Excellant,50,September 2019,We stayed 2 nights then came back again for a further 6 nights could not fault anything at all. Seminyak Kitchen Resturant was amazing The rooms was really clean and comfortable would stay there again. Close to the shops and a shuttle service to the beach.
459,Good hotel,40,September 2019,"We visited for 8 days. We arrived late evening (21.30pm) and reception gave us lots of info, some of which would have been better if we had been given 24 hours to consider (eg. The depositing of credit/20% saving). We did not appreciate the cost of things or exchange rates to make an informed decision. The hotel is clean, staff are excellent and helpful and breakfast is plentiful. Would recommend."
460,Amazing experience,50,September 2019,"Great pool view. Thank you for Joshua for room arrangement upgrade to suite, GRO eka, Intan, FO Ade, Ivan & Housekeeping team superb hardwork n excellence for setting up 75 goodie bags and thank you notes in the rooms, bell boys team, also aprilia for key chains."
461,Amazing retreat in heart of Seminyak!,50,September 2019,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Courtyard for 7 nights and we have nothing but good things to say! The customer service first and foremost was incredible, with nothing being too large of a request. Rooms were super clean and new, pool view also made us feel as if we were staying in our own retreat away from the busy streets. Seminyak Kitchen was also amazing and the buffet breakfast was to die for. Having been my first time to Bali, I thoroughly loved Courtyard and would happily go back to stay there again. Will recommend to everyone!"
462,Great cooking school,50,September 2019,"This is a relaxing hotel with a great vibe. We want to be lazy for a week so location for walking and not doing much was important. This hotel has made it easy for us. Access the great coffee around and about and nice shops also,

For the hotel, Highlights are the Taco truck and the really lovely and relaxed staff. But the best was the cooking school. Very relaxed but well organised. The chefs knew their stuff and we‚Äôre happy to share tips. The food was awesome and we felt we were able to do as much it as little as we wanted to. It was altogether very relaxing and rewarding.

We will be back.

Keep it up Courtyard and your efforts will be always appreciated."
463,My favourite Hotel,50,September 2019,"I have been coming to Bali for a very long time now. I go to Bali 2 x a year for the past 10 years. I must say I have fallen in love with Courtyard Marriott. I feel like this hotel is like home. I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough!!!!!!!!!! It‚Äôs in an awesome location, where you are close to everything but also away from all the hustle and bustle. They also have there own private beach where you can relax and not have to worry about anything. The buggy drops you right in front so handy you don‚Äôt even have to worry about transport.
The staff is one of the best I have experienced always going above and beyond to make sure everything is perfectüëåA BIG thank you to Hendra for leading a great team!!! Ari, Ayu,Dicky,Aertu,
Ajick and many more.The best bar crew!!!!!
Also a very big thank you to John you truly made sure everything was perfect. Look forward to coming back soon. Might have to get a permanent room....."
464,Great hotel to spend vacation,50,September 2019,"This was my first time on Bali. Since I didn't know where to book, and I was already a Marriot member, Courtyard Seminyak Resort was logical solution. This was such a good decision. I've been to some Merriot hotels but staff here in Seminyak is soo nice and helpful. Every morning a present and a message. Breakfast is great, so many choices even for people who can't handle gluten, or are vegan.With Gold Membership you can get good rates not to mention presents you get. You get a lot for your money. Even if you're not a member they will treat you like a real guest. Genuine smiles and service. Perfect trip to Bali.Thank you."
465,Great place to stay,50,September 2019,"Having been to Bali six times before, we felt like a change. We had always wanted to stay at the Marriott, so this time when our Travel Agent suggested a great package for this hotel, we were thrilled.

We had a room with a pool view and balcony. I would not recommend a street view as it‚Äôs a busy street and noisy. The balcony was perfect to sit out on in the evenings.

The service is excellent and staff do everything to accommodate your needs.
The breakfast is up there with the best in Asia. So much choice. The fruit juice bar and bagel bar were winners for me.
Sintya who made our juice each morning was outstanding.

The sunset yoga on the rooftop was much more enjoyable than a yoga studio. The teacher was very good.

The food in the restaurant is really appetising and the chef is excellent.

The hotel has a party atmosphere around the pool area and the live music was worth listening too.

The shuttle is available to the B66 beach and Eat Street. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for this service. The Marriott has a reserved beach area with lounges.

The spa and massage although included, were provided in beautiful surroundings by professional masseuses.

The only downer was the cocktails and canap√©s part of the package as smoking is allowed in the pool bar and the canap√©s were pretty ordinary.
The smoking totally spoilt the pool bar for us.

The staff did try and accommodate us but we decided to go elsewhere."
466,Bali Trip,50,September 2019,"My husband and I along with my mother-in-law recently went to Bali. We stayed at The Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak hotel. I would say that staying at this hotel was the highlight of our trip.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly, professional staff and their warm smiles. Checked in was swift although we had to wait for our rooms to be available. The Management team ensured that we were well taken care of. Special mention to front desk staff, Santi and Assistant Loyalty Manager, Priscilla for ensuring all of our special requests and accommodation needs were met from the very beginning throughout our entire stay at the hotel.

My husband, mother-in-law and myself felt very comfortable and was treated with special care and will surely return on our next trip.

Lastly, to the fellow staff at Seminyak Kitchen in particular, Anka Siel Thiel. Thank you very much for your warm and kind hospitality in ensuring our stay and dining requirements were satisfied. Anka exceeded our expectations in not once but numerous occasions be it remembering our names, preferential seating, assisted with making bookings outside the hotel and last but not least, a great local who is friendly and nice person to chat with.

A good trip is one that you can look back and remember fond memories of and when we think back of our recent trip to Bali, we can surely remember our pleasurable stay in this hotel.

There is no doubt that we will return again if coming back to this hotel was the only reason to do so.

Thank you very much."
467,Awesome place,50,September 2019,"Gorgeous rooms, good location, just a great experience all-round. 5 minutes walk from the Seminyak beach yet it's also just few minutes away from number of Aussie bars. The staff were very friendly, especially the bloke named Kesawa. Fantastic customer service üëå"
468,BEST EXPERIENCE!,50,September 2019,"I‚Äôve been to this hotel many times before and will come again as it is the most welcoming and enjoyable hotel in Bali, couldn‚Äôt recommend it more for anyone coming to bali. Spent most time around the Pool Bar, couldn‚Äôt complaint with the Bar crew service. Thank you to Hendra and the team, Kesawa, Angga, Arca, Merta and Wika. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!"
469,Most relaxing holiday at 5 star hotel,50,September 2019,"Literally had the best time . The staff looked after us so well . Breakfast was amazing . Service was 5 star . I couldn‚Äôt ask for a more amazing hotel Service . Highly recommend to stay here . Shout out to Pool Bar Team, Hendra is leading the team very well! Kesawa, Merta, Mob, Santoso! See you guys again soon."
470,Just beautiful,50,September 2019,"A beautiful resort with beautiful people, has everything you could ask for in a resort, with the beach a short Marriot buggie drive away. Special thanks to Jon, Ari, Dewa, Hendra, Ayu, Dicky, Tony, Aertu, Jabrix and many more staff, thank you the memories."
471,Great service and location,50,September 2019,"We have recently returned from a 10 night stay at the Marriott Courtyard Seminyak.
It‚Äôs a fantastic hotel in a great location and very safe we really couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Great breakfast in the Seminyak kitchen restaurant and special thanks to Wili for her gracious service and warm smile every morning she really couldn‚Äôt have done enough for us.......the take away coffee was a nice touch.
The pool bar staff were fantastic Angga and Siri really went the extra mile and it was a pleasure to have a drink or snack and always greeted with world class service.
The rooms are spacious and clean, I would recommend a pool view room great balconies.
We used the hotel transport service and hired a car for the day great value and excellent way to see the island. Our driver Made Parmita was exceptional he dropped us off, waited and offered a real insight to Bali its people and customs thank you Made.
My only suggestion would be for the Management to list events in advance that may impact closure of the garden. We sunbathed in the garden every day but it closed on numerous days due to private functions but we were only made aware on the day.
Thank you team for a memorable stay and keep up the good work."
472,Love the location,50,September 2019,"Amazing staff, great food and amazing location! Everything is close by. We enjoyed our time here. The pools are really good. The staff in the kids club are super friendly. We really enjoyed our time here."
473,Very friendly and accommodating,50,September 2019,"We had a fantastic stay here, unfortunately it was too short (6 night)

The rooms were very clean, comfortable and quiet.
The restaurant provided a wide choice of food.

The hotel staff were amazing, they will bend over backwards to help you have a better holiday.

For those asking about cost from the airport DSP we used grab and paid 138,000 RP.

There are many shops and restaurants near to the hotel. The hotel also offers a free shuttle to the beach. Actually is is only a 5 or 6 minute walk to the beach."
474,Fantastic,50,September 2019,"Exceptional service and outstanding facilities.

Rooms, pool and gym were of the highest standards and staff simply couldn't do enough for the family.

An on demand shuttle service to nearby activity precincts and private beach further consolidated the 5 star experience."
475,Holiday,50,September 2019,"Great place to stay. Near to shops, beaches and restaurants and cafes. The cleaniness of the rooms and every other area is spotless. The staff are welcoming and friendly. Well worth the stay üëç pool is great and child friendly"
476,Great staff and average location is good for party goers,30,September 2019,"Booked a king size bedroom configuration but was checked-in with a double bed room due to unavailability, all was sorted out on the next day - we were transferred to a nice pool view king size bedroom, special thanks to Mr. Sopiyan. Hotel staffs are nice and helpful. Location close to beach with hotel shuttle. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby - good for nightlife and party goers. Also close to different kinds of shops."
477,Enjoyable Stay,50,September 2019,"Not perfect but extremely enjoyable stay. Spent a lot of time at pool bar had great service.
Thank you Agik, Handra, Kesawa, Narita, Ayu, Penny, Ari, Sri, Aedos, Mob, Dede, Dewa and anyone else we missed. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
Thanks
Mark & Aki"
478,Good experience,40,September 2019,"Stayed here for a week. Was good. Nice room overlooking the pool, cleaned everyday, breakfast was very good with an abundance of choice and different cuisines. Staff all very polite and helpful.
The pool area did get a bit congested at times due to there not being much outside communal area and half the sun loungers would be in the shade gone midday.
Would definitely consider a return visit in the future."
479,Sophisticated 4*,40,August 2019,"In a world where much is found wanting. This hotel is a great balance between what u pay and what u get.

Being more of a 5* hotel guy with a must being on the beach. I found This hotel to be a great option for not spending a fortune (spend that on enjoying the island instead), yet coming back to a hotel that is simply put comfortable luxury.

Get a suite. It‚Äôs a little more but so worth it.
Great pool.
Dreadful restaurant food. We were 8 people who all agreed on this. Not negotiable.
Breakfast was lovely."
480,Perfect Getaway,50,September 2019,Close to shops and beach (400 metres away). Breakfast was great in variety (especially the fruit juices). Hotel Spa is very full and need to book days in advance. Good food/convenient stores/currency exchange/emergency medical centre just right around the corner.
481,"Outstanding service, great location",50,September 2019,"First time in Bali so a lot of unknowns. Thank you to all the team and especially Gede Wahyu Pratama who went out of his way to assist.
The hotel has everything you need and is close to beach and some good restaurants and cafes."
482,Everything was excellent,50,August 2019,"Me and my friends, we spent 3 nights here for our short getaway in Bali and i must say it was excellent. Staffs are really friendly and helpful, also special thanks for wahyu from house keeping for giving me this cute key chain. Really appreciate that!

Moreover for the breakfast buffet, they provide various food choice from european, indonesian, etc. juice section and bagel bread section are my fav, cause remind me of old days when i was live in germany."
483,Favorite hotel in Bali,50,September 2019,"We loved everything about this hotel! We stayed for 5 days/4 nights, the check-in was quick and the room was ready on the spot. The breakfast has many options and the presentation of food looks perfect.

Rooms are spacious and every room has a small balcony that has a view on the hotel's pool. The location on the hotel is very good, there are many restaurants, bars, money exchange and pharmacies next to it. It is also around 10 minutes walk to the beach and around 20-25 minutes (walk) away from Seminyak Square (also has many restaurants and shops).

Us as honeymooners, would definitely recommend this hotel to couples."
484,Great Location with Very Friendly Staff,50,September 2019,"Just stayed here for the 4th time with a group of guys on an annual trip for 4 nights. Given we have no younger people in the group, the Seminyak area is perfect for us with great, beach, bars and restaurants without the over powering crowds.
We watched this resort being built and said we would try here once completed. Well we did ....and we have not stopped coming back each year.
Why ... great location, very well priced, staff that continually make you feel welcome, modern rooms with balcony, amazing breakfast and a pool bar with connected undercover area (out of the sun) with lounges that is separated from the main pool.
The beach is a 5 minute walk or you can take the buggy to the resorts private beach location and at sunset the famed bean bag bars are in full flight as people congregate to watch the sunset.
Thanks Courtyard for another great stay."
485,fantastic,50,September 2019,"We stayed 1 week at the Courtyard by Marriott & loved it. The breakfast was amazing, it had such a great variety of food. the pool was great the resort was clean. the staff were all so friendly, efficient and lovely to deal with. Only a short walk down to Seminyak Beach which has beautiful sunset, but they also have a shuttle to take people down (we didn‚Äôt use it)"
486,Amazing!,50,September 2019,"We travelled from the UK to do a tour of Bali. This was the first hotel we stayed in and it was by the far the best!

The arrival was great and we were able to check in early- after a very long flight this was really appreciated. We stayed in the ground floor behind the water fountain - unfortunately I can't remember our room number, but it was perfectly situated near the poor but far enough away from the kids pool to avoid hearing the hustle and bustle.

The breakfast was so great- there was so much choice and we couldn't have asked for a better breakfast. The buggy service to the beach was really useful as was the friendly driver who gave us tips on where to visit.
We stayed in numerous hotels during our trip (including other Marriots) and this hotel was the best"
487,Family holiday,50,September 2019,"Stayed at the Courtyard for the third time in 3.5 years and we will continue to come back in future. We absolutely love the location, the facilities, the casual yet professional nature of the hotel and most of all we will keep coming back because of the staff of the entire hotel. Friendly, happy, helpful, accommodating, professional, always smiling, fantastic with kids and happy to go over and above for us are all terms we can relate to the staff at the Courtyard.

We could name every staff member here but a special mention to Ari and Merta in the pool bar and Debby in the kids club who all made special efforts to look after anything we required and were always happy to help with not only myself and my wife but to our two daughters as well.

Thank you again for an amazing 11 nights.

Matt, Mel, Amelia & Lucy"
488,"Good hotel, room a little small for our needs",40,September 2019,"We recently stayed for 2 nights at this hotel between bookings in Nusa Dua and Legian. Check in was smooth, and the kids were delighted to receive popcorn and fairy floss on arrival. We were booked into the deluxe family room which features 2 queen beds. We found the room to be quite small to fit 4 people and their luggage, and unfortunately it did not have a balcony, which we always find useful when travelling with children for drying swimwear, and for us to sit on while the kids go to sleep. The pool is long and rectangular in the middle of the hotel, and was a little cold first thing in the morning, but warmed up throughout the day.
Breakfast was delicious,with all of the usual buffet suspects, and lunch around the pool was also tasty, with a good range of options. The location is not super close to Eat St, but the hotel runs a buggy service to take you, or can organise a cab or private car. Overall we would probably not stay here again, not because of any issue with the hotel, but just because we require a little more space than what was available in our room."
489,Posioned by the Freon gas leaking from the fridge,10,May 2019,"Be very aware that you could wake up to the horriffic smell of leaking Freon gas from the refridgerator at the end of your bed, if you are lucky emough to wake up. If you are asleep you will not be aware that you will be breathing in this poisoness gas. You will get horrific headaches sore chest and throat. When i rang them to complain about the dreadful smell which we thought was coming from the drain in the bathroom. The men that came to the room had covered their faces and went straight to the fridge.
Which told us by their actions that they KNEW excatly what was causing the smell and they werent prepared to breathe it in !!!!
This happened on our very first night !!! not a good start to our holiday.
The total lack of compassion is appalling a i am sorry for the inconvienance is not good enough. There should be a safety device to protect guests, if my sister had not woken me i may not have lived to write a review.
it took us until the last night of our stay to find out what this poisoness gas was we were offered an apology and a free meal off a very limited menu that was not very nice.
I would not reccomend or ever stay with them again , please beware people its supposed to be a holiday not a nightmare !!!!
We thought we would be staying somewhere safe but No it was awful !!!"
490,Great choice for your Bali holidays,50,September 2019,"it's the first time visiting this hotel in Bali and my experience was great! the staff was kind and helpful the hotel design was good too, it has 2 pools and one of them has a bar in it! amazing seating in the pool and enjoying a cocktail. the room is spacious and modern and has access to the pool directly from your garden. the spa was amazing and the therapists really professional. there is also an amazing gym with all equipment to keep training also when you are on holiday."
491,PERFECT STAY,50,September 2019,"Really like this hotel. I think one of the best places in Seminyak that you can find. Price, service, rooms - everything is very nice. Also they have a good spa with a lot of options and nice design. I was enjoying it a lot. Thank you."
492,Service Problems Here,40,September 2019,"Im going to write my review how it happened. The place is very nice with two large pools, pool bar, plenty of bean bags or beds and umbrelllas. They have a singer each night, the buffet breakfast is excellent and the overall ambience is very nice. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. But on arrival we were hungry and keen to go out and eat, we waited about 35 minutes for our bags in the end i had to go and get them. They were very apologetic which was ok. It got a little worse before it got better. We were sent some complimentary snacks of fruit and chocolate and a very nice letter. We went out the next day to come back to the room with the banana peels and half eaten chocolates still in the room giving off that schoolbage smell. Only one towel had been replaced and even after going to front desk and letting them know a towel never came so we had to share before we went out. Shower robes were refolded dirty and put back instead of being replaced and when eventually replaced only one had a belt. Next day off to breakfast and orded tea as usual. I got a cold cup of tea and asked could i have a hot one that never came. I asked again and was told no english breakfast, thats ok anything will do and 15 minutes later the tea came. To the hotels credit the manager and general manger came to see us an offered us an hour spa which we took, late check out and complimentary airport shuttle. But it just seemed as thought we were having bad luck with service as even after bringing to attention it continued. Its one of the more expensive places to stay and while nice, they have some service issues that really need to be addressed ro maintain a consistant level of service to bring them into line with comparable places i have stayed."
493,We loved our stay!,50,September 2019,"This was our first visit to Bali. We were thrilled with Courtyard. Our room was beautiful, spacious, pristine, and we had a lovely note with snacks waiting for us. The staff were friendly and helpful. We really appreciated the 4 bottles of water provided each day. The pools are amazing. We felt safe and would stay there again."
494,Awesome resort,50,September 2019,"The pool bar, rooms and breakfast are fantastic. Being so close to everything is a great benefit. Chinta and Sri at pool bar do such a great job. Make sure you personally ask for them. We cant wait to come back and do it all again for our 9th annual visit."
495,Always an amazing stay!,50,September 2019,"My family and I have stayed at the courtyard Marriott seminyak a number of times and cannot recommend this place highly enough! The hotel is very clean and location is the best! Located on a great street with lots to do and so close to seminyak square without being in all the hustle and bustle.
I have to say the service and staff are one of the best I have ever experienced! The pool bar staff are the best! A massive thank you to Hendra for doing such an amazing job at leading such an awesome team! Peni, Agik, Ari, Narita you girls are amazing! We can‚Äôt wait to come back! This place has become a second home to us! My kids absolutely love it and feel so loved and safe! (Also a special thanks to the awesome kids club team, you guys rock too! )Thank you to every one of you for always making our stay so special :)"
496,Great holiday,50,September 2019,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Courtyard Marriott.
We were greeted at check in with a cold drink each and then shown to our room with minimal fuss and very pleasant staff.
The room was very clean, quite big and had a balcony overlooking the huge pool.
Lovely bathroom with a huge walk in shower.
All the staff were very pleasant and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for them and we had particularly good service by the pool from Merta and Srie.
The location was great- 3 mins walk to the beach, but a shuttle was also available if you wanted it.
However, you could quite easily spend your day by the pool and just rest and relax if you wanted.
We definitely want to go back and spend more time there. Top notch. Well done all the staff!"
497,Phenomenal,50,September 2019,"I‚Äôve stayed at probably 50 Marriotts total in the USA - courtyards, JW, Marriott. This had to be the best service I‚Äôve gotten and the nicest overall hotel. The room isn‚Äôt quite on the level of a Ritz Carlton, but the service is and more. I had a late flight so they gave me a late checkout and then allowed me to use the locker room shower right before my flight as well. The breakfast was 5 star quality and very plentiful They have a buggy that‚Äôs pretty accessible and will take you to the beach or close to seminyak square. Close enough to a lot of shops and restaurants to walk as well. The only thing is that the pool is where the courtyard is and they play music all day so it‚Äôs somewhat loud if you plan on chilling in your room - even then it wasn‚Äôt distracting. Great value and would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for something like this."
498,Family Holiday,40,July 2019,Great resort in the middle of everything and walking distance to shops and beach .Very clean and food and drinks ok .The pool does not get much sun that would be my only complaint .Very nice but I would much prefer to stay on the beach.
499,"Outstanding hotel, changed my perception of Courtyard brand",50,August 2019,"This is probably the best Marriott Courtyard in the world. Absolutely brilliant modern full service hotel. Super rooms. Great food. Outstanding staff. Olympic+ size pool. Some of the best location in Seminyak. Most of the clientele at the time of our visit were Australian rednecks, though there was some diversity too."
500,NUMERO UNO IN SEMINYAK,50,September 2019,"We stayed for 3 days & 2 nights, our room has pool view and its very comfortable , we always spent our time at the hotel because they had everything that you need , kids club, big pool, pingpong etc, we would like to say BIG thank you to Eka & wahyu for the birthday arrangement for our lovely daughter in the room, Mr Ambara the F&B boss, Anka from seminyak kitchen , Hendra at the pool , Chef Donald for best food quality , the bartender Indra who made the best cocktails in this planets & all the team , you guys are amazing"
501,Amazing stay @ Courtyard,50,September 2019,"The best hotel in Bali and one of the best I‚Äôve visited in the world. Amazing service, rooms, cleanliness, food, drinks and whole experience. A special mention to Hendra, Penny, Agik, Merta, Kesawa, Narita, the bar staff. They made our experience so much better. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel üôÇ"
502,Wonderful place to be,50,September 2019,"Outstanding service at breakfast by two young ladies ""Febrri"" and ""Willi"". At any time they are smiling and helping with right advice to ease any problem. They are talented to make you happy that you are always looking forward to see them the next morning again"
503,"Great facilities, amazing staff made for a memorable stay",50,September 2019,"Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott with my family for 9 nights and couldn‚Äôt recommend this property highly enough.

The resort is only a handful of years old and is in excellent condition and well maintained. It has a nice, modern, contemporary feel.

In terms of facilities:
The pool area - fantastic and includes a number of spaces to use. Our kids loved it.

The kids club ‚Äì great. Offers a range of activities as well as complimentary free time.

Wifi - works really well.

Breakfast ‚Äì amazing! Plenty of choice. And plenty of variation. Honestly, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

Location - excellent. Free shuttle is available to the beach (which is not a long walk anyway). Plenty of shops, restaurants and attractions are available at a walkable distance.

Rooms - we had a pool view balcony room which was very nice with good size bathroom and shower.

24hr gym will have all the equipment you‚Äôll ever need.

My final point is the most important. And I hope you‚Äôve read this far.

Now, a lot of places have great facilities, but the thing that makes a stay at the Courtyard really enjoyable, comfortable and stress-free is the staff. Everyone is extremely helpful and genuine. This creates such a friendly atmosphere and relaxing vibe. Honestly, this makes such difference. You‚Äôll feel right at home and part of the family from the minute you walk in. All staff we encountered were so fantastic. And importantly, management staff are also very deliberately visible and accessible.

In summary ‚Äì we had such a fantastic experience. I‚Äôd highly recommend this property to anyone.

PS: The popcorn and fairy floss machines in the lobby were forever tempting the kids (and adults!) and were a nice touch."
504,Courtyard is the best!!,50,September 2019,"Our second time here. Favourite hotel by a mile. Unbelievable service, the friendliest staff and a great pool/atmosphere. A big thank you to Hendra, Arca, Dede, Mob, Penny, Rudi for the amazing service, cocktails and laughs at the pool bar. And thank you to Widi for your service upstairs in Seminyak kitchen."
505,Great and central resort,50,September 2019,"We always come back to this hotel.
We are here a few months ago.
Love the breakfast, many variations and fresh juices. The staff is amazing.
Their bar staff especially Komang made us very comfortable.
Ms Prisi and Gede always make us feel like home. The house keeping staff should be recognise for their effortless work.
Kids club staff is very friendly and good.
See you on the next trip!"
506,Great hotel,50,September 2019,"Great five star hotel close to everything in Seminyak. I‚Äôm still at the hotel and so far it‚Äôs great. We got a one bedroom suite at the fifth floor and it‚Äôs super modern and clean. 2 flatscreen TVs, mobile doc for music and great view over the large pool area. Big bright toilet and shower with sliding doors. Quick room service (about 15-20min). Great Spa and restaurant as well. I will review it in a separate post. We will definitely come back here if we are in Seminyak."
507,The most fantastic holiday experience!,40,August 2019,"We stayed at the Marriott for 2 weeks during August 2019 and couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel highly enough. The weather at this time of year was absolutely perfect as well.

From the AMAZING breakfast buffet & pool side service/menu to the hospitality of the staff. They were so accommodating and friendly. A special mention to Kesawa, Ayu & Rudi (plus more that I can‚Äôt remember their names but were sooo beautiful) and the staff at the kids club. A holiday never to forget and we will 100% be back. Exceptional value for money in every way. We loved it. Thank you."
508,Kendall Holiday in Seminyak,50,August 2019,"1st time in Bali, stayed at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. Amazing hotel - staff absolutely made visit. Pool staff Alit, Sri, Angaa, Ayu and Rudi were so welcoming and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us all. From cocktail hour when Alit already had our first cocktail sorted before we ordered to the staff feeding our kids with milk - sometimes warm, sometime cold! Rudi checked in with us everyday he was working and the other staff constantly checking to see if we were ok and generally having a chat. Merta saw my 8 yr old son on our first day throwing a ball - he immediately approached him and started to throw the ball with him - my son was hooked. Every day Merta and my son spent some time together, each looking for one another - Merta made my son‚Äôs holiday wonderful. We were in Bali for a wedding so we were nervous finding a babysitter when we were at this wedding. We hired Chandra from the kids club and she was awesome. My 11 yr old daughter was quite overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of Seminyak but Chandra connected with her and she relaxed from then on - Chandra and other staff in kids club were great and the variety of activities the kids can do during the day is vast and exciting for them. I think the best thing my kids loved was the free popcorn and fairy floss everyday! We had massages at Zanti the Retreat was amazing. The rooms were nice and modern - probably a little bit small for a family of 4. The only down side was it was quite noisy in the hallways with doors to rooms quite loud when they close and guest noise, particularly late at night (late guests checking in). The surprise gifts that Dedy and Dinantara left in our impeccably clean and tidy room made our kids‚Äô day. The breakfast was AMAZING! So much variety and again, friendly helpful staff. Even head staff and the hotel manager introduced themselves to us at a drinks night. Would highly recommend this hotel and will be back to share this experience again."
509,We will be coming back - loved it,50,August 2019,"We absolutely loved our stay with the great team at the Marriott. Everyone at the hotel is wonderful from front of house, security, cleaning staff but a special shout out to Alit, Merta, Rudi, Sri, Angaa, Ari and Chandra. They looked after us and especially the kids so well - it was the highlight of our trip.
Facilities at the hotel are excellent and it is very laid back which we really liked.
We had a room with 2 queen beds facing the road and there as no traffic noise.
Cant fault it at all 10/10"
510,Excellent Stay,50,September 2019,"My husband and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary in Bali and stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. The staff was amazing and the accommodation were superb. Ari, the Concierge, was so knowledgeable and courteous and always went above and beyond to ensure that we were taken care of. Thanks Ari!"
511,We had great time,50,August 2019,"Upon check in there were many security checkpoints which made us feel very safe being next to a city that was attacked only a few years ago. The room was very nice and spacious. We did not have a pool view but were ok with that. We were on the side that we could see a beautiful sunset every night. The pool was great and spread out. The hotel is in a wonderful location, walking distance to just about everything! Would definitely recommend if you want a great city experience in Bali!"
512,Charged an exorbitant US$6 for 3 local calls made,20,August 2019,"Used my room phone to make 3 local calls (1-2 min duration each) and was charged an exorbitant US$6 upon checkout. Was already displeased by this, and subsequently I found out my friends in another room were charged US$0.30 for the same thing. When we questioned the receptionist, he did not bother to investigate my charges and simply said this was automatically calculated by the system.

Room: Floor was dirty when we first checked in (small bits of debris, hair still visible everywhere). Housekeeping services were generally subpar. No replenishment of shower gel and shampoo though the bottles were empty.

Location was ok. There are many eateries and convenient stores within walking distance."
513,Always a problem with the key card and no replacement of soiled towels,10,August 2019,"We stayed here for 4 days, and we had difficulty unlocking the door with our key cards everyday. We had to get it fixed every day or just keep trying till the door unlocks eventually after trying multiple times. It is extremely frustrating to do this on a holiday.

Also, we wanted to change our towels so we left them on the floor. But we realised that all housekeeping had done was to pick them up and fold them and hang them up again. We were sure they are not new as they were still damp and not folded perfectly and left in the wardrobe where we first found them.

All our empty water bottles were also not cleared. We now have a pile of 7-8 of them on a corner of the room, collected over the days."
514,Excellent resort and service,50,August 2019,"I was there for my birthday celebration,the resort and room was beautiful. Service was impeccable,food was exquisite and so sweet to surprise me with a lovely birthday cake. Special appreciation to the manager and Ms. Chinta for making sure our stay was memorable.

Overall,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to making a return trip to Courtyard Marriott Bali at some point in the future. I would highly recommend this property!"
515,Friendly and clean,50,July 2019,"We stayed 4 nights with 2 children age of 6 and 9.
The hotel was clean and the staff is friendly. The swimming pool was nice and big, with a shallow pool in the back. Our kids loved the performances and the cotton candy. We didn‚Äôt find out about the ‚Äòprivate‚Äô beach part until our final day, but we still really enjoyed it. They have a shuttle bus to the beach and other areas to save a bit on walking. I can certainly recommend this hotel to anyone."
516,Happy champs,50,August 2019,"Myself and my husband stayed for 6nights at the hotel. We booked the deluxe room with the balcony and city view. We were moved into the deluxe room with the pool room because they found that the city view would be to noisy. Then already we were really impressed with the hotel. Entering the room , was exactly what we we wanted , the space is perfect and amazing pillows and comfy bead. The room had a great view , good service, very good security. The breakfast is Aaamazing!! Definitely need to have the breakfast.
The semminyak kitchen is amazing aswel. We went for dinner the second time and feby was exceptional. He was so kind and helpful and tried to make us comfortable with conversation. Which I must say is really nice . He made sure we were happy with everything, and gravy gave us some good advice on all the good places to see. Because of him we will definitely go back again to semminyak kitchen . I posted a picture with him. So everyone else can have the experience we had , we didn‚Äôt find fault in anything at the hotel to be honest .

Had / having an amazing stay. Thanks"
517,"Great hotel, brilliant service, very impressed!",50,August 2019,"We stayed at the Courtyard for 6 nights on our first trip to Bali and were super impressed from the first night we arrived. It‚Äôs in a great location, the staff are so friendly and welcoming - every single person we encountered was smiley and helpful - and the food was lovely.

We had breakfast included in our stay and there was so much choice; the egg station was great (you can order any type you like), fresh juices every morning, lots of healthy options as well as the usual fry up, pastries, cereals etc. We had dinner in the Seminyak Kitchen (same restaurant as breakfast) a couple of times which was just as tasty, as was the food delivered for room service (same or similar menu). When we booked our stay there was a special offer on and we got 1 x 2 course lunch, 1 x 3 course dinner, free drinks and canap√©s from 5-6pm every day, coffee from What the Truck and a 60 minute massage in the spa. We utilised all of these and was a really nice touch. The massage was amazing!

Our room was a family/city view on the 6th floor. I‚Äôd read a few reviews before I booked that the city view rooms were noisy but we didn‚Äôt find this at all. We found the room to be really well designed with lots of plugs for all region types (no adapters needed), plenty of storage space and really clean/comfortable.

One of the things we really liked was the security checks every time you enter the hotel and all cabs/cars are stopped and checked by security on the way in as well.

The pool area was really nice. The only downside for us - and not everyone would be bothered by this - is that half of the pool/sun loungers are in the shade all day which meant the loungers in the sun were taken really early and made it difficult for us to get beds in the sun on a few occasions. That said, the hotel have a great policy of removing towels from sun loungers if they are unoccupied for over 30 mins to stop people reserving them in the morning and not using them until midday like you get in other hotels!

We used the shuttle service to the private beach (outside the Double Six hotel) a couple of times which was also a great service to have and it was only 5-10 mins to walk back. There are plenty of shops and restaurants along the way and close by to the hotel. The beach was really nice, not that great for swimming as the waves are really high but my boys (age 7 & 11) had great fun jumping the waves and also took surf lessons from the guys on the beach. We paid 500k for them both for an hour and they loved it (you need to barter!)

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again. The hotel has a great vibe and we would highly recommend it."
518,Exceptional Pool bar staff,50,June 2019,"This place was amazing. This was my first overseas holiday and I couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Everything exceeded my expectations. The room, pool and food were exceptional. The best feature by far was the staff. So welcoming and friendly no matter what hour of the day. If I could name them all I would but the pool bar staff were the best. Sri and Hendra greeted you with a smile everyday. So friendly and welcoming. We may not have wanted to leave the bar."
519,Quality all round - Service makes a difference!,50,August 2019,"This was our second stay in the last two years and the service and amenities are excellent. It‚Äôs perfect for a relaxing break and relieves the stresses of life. The food at Seminyak kitchen was great as always, with breakfast included in our package and was more than we could imagine in terms of taste and quantity. The pool was great, and the rooms excellent, clean and well appointed. The best experience though was the staff who were friendly, professional, and welcoming. Special mention to Narita, Sri and Ari in the pool bar and Febri and Duvan in the Seminyak Kitchen who made us feel at home. We will definitely return on the future!
The hotel is close to restaurants, bars, spas, and there‚Äôs a supermarket just across the road. It also has a private beach with a shuttle for those who just want to sunbath or take a swim. Airport shuttle and a welcome drink on arrival topped off our great experience. Highly recommended."
520,Highly Recommended,50,August 2019,"We stayed in a ground floor poolside view room which has direct access to the pool.

The pool is huge so it was never overcrowded and also has plenty of daybeds so we never had a problem finding a vacant one regardless of the time of day we decided to swim.
There are buzzers beside the daybeds which allow you to order drinks and food, now that is relaxing!

The room was modern and spacious with a very large shower and a comfortable king size bed with plenty of pillows.

The staff are all extremely friendly and always greet you with a big smile and friendly hello which makes you enjoy your stay even more.

A Couple Of Tips For Your Stay,

There is a mini mart across from the hotel for supplies which we also used for converting our money. They are authorized and honest and offered a competitive exchange rate.

You should use the blue cabs with a ""Taksi"" sign on the roof when necessary. They are metered and very cheap, we never waited more than a few seconds to catch one right outside the hotel because there are thousands of them!

Book a day tour on the island because it is really beautiful and a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas.

Although the hotel food is very good if you feel like spoiling yourself book a table at Mamasan Bali which is quite brilliant.
The Taco truck out the front is great for an anytime snack.

We loved our stay at the Marriott and will definitely stay here again if in Bali."
521,Excellent location with great service!,50,August 2019,"This is my second stay at this resort and it never fails my expectation! As a platinum marriot bonvoy member this is the type of service i expect from every marriot bonvoy participating hotel. Their breakfast is one of the best i have had caters to many cultures. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get around ..beach is a 5 min walk. Hotel shuttle services are available to take you to the beach and Seminyak square. Special thanks to Priscillia for arranging a beautiful room,as well as the welcome gift which mafe our holiday extra special and Eka for her professional follow up of any queries i had after leaving. The staff are really the cherry on the cake! See you again Courtyard Marriot Seminyak!"
522,Lived everything about this hotel,50,August 2019,"Extremely polite and prompt staff, the location of the hotel is so central (bars and spas all along), the pool bar has live music every night, the food is excellent, the rooms and nice and clean and big. Housekeeping of the hotel is excellent- they would clean the rooms 2-3 times if you are out and there is no DO NOT DISTURB sign. Overall, a great place to stay. I loved it."
523,Perfect location for exploring Seminyak and the rest of Bali,50,August 2019,"I travelled in a group of 8 (6 adults and 2 kids). This hotel is in the perfect location to explore Seminyak and the rest of Bali from. Walking out of the hotel there is everything you need on the street and the beach is only a 5 minute walk away. They have the most delicious taco truck out the front of the hotel and free popcorn and fairyfloss for the kids, which was a great touch. The breakfast was excellent and delicious, with everything you could think of to eat. We had a dinner and lunch at the hotel and they were both delicious too. Febri who served us at breakfast and the dinner we had there was so friendly and helpful and she remembered all of our names after the first day! The pool was stunning to look at at night from your balcony and the beds were so comfortable! Rudi who cleaned our rooms each day would leave us towels folded into animals with a different note each day which we all thought was super sweet. The only negative was the bathroom layout, the cupboards to hang your clothes and where the safe was located was not practically designed, when you opened the cupboard door you could not get to the toilet and there was not enough bench space or powerpoints in the bathroom and that's if I am being really fussy. Overall I think the Courtyard by Marriott is great value for money and is great for families."
524,Excellent,50,August 2019,"I spent three night at this hotel. Everything from start to finish is amazing! Room was clean,modern and spacious. Nice pool area with pool bar. Beach is close by and the hotel runs a shuttle bus to the beach spot if you don't feel like walking ! Breakfast was amazing- so much choice! Staff are really friendly! Will definitely stay here again the next time I travel to Bali!"
525,Very pleasant stay,50,August 2019,"We stayed 6 days in Courtyard and in general we were very pleased by everything. It is a well decorated hotel in a nice location of Seminyak. It has a very nice pool and pool bar for some relaxing moments in the hotel , a very good spa that you must try if you visit and large clean rooms with all comforts. From my experience, highlights of the hotel are the security, the great breakfast and the staff. Inside the hotel you will feel totally safe as the security level is very high. The breakfast was excellent for every taste with a combination of Asian,European and continental tastes. However, the thing i would like to emphasize the most is the staff..every one of them is exceptional! Really very helpful, kind and friendly..first time I have to say such good words for the staff! Thank you guys!"
526,2nd time visit,40,July 2019,"This was our 2nd time at this resort and we loved it again from the great pool to the lovely room on the 3rd floor to the great variety at breakfast . Security was great as is the location of bali national golf club .The shuttle bus to their beach bar is a winner ,we will return"
527,Awesome resort,50,August 2019,"Had a fantastic stay at this resort. Great location, short walk to beach, shopping and restaurants. All the staff were very helpful, in particular Ari from the pool bar. Ari is very lovely, she gave us lots of suggestions for activities and places to visit."
528,Great hotel,50,August 2019,"We stayed here for 4 nights and were very impressed. The facilities and staff were all first class. The pool area is wonderful. Our room was clean and had everything you need. The staff all went out of their way to ensure you have a great stay. Location is great close to the beach and bars, cafes, restaurants etc. Highly recommended."
529,Beautiful Hotel,50,August 2019,Amazing staff so helpful special thanks to Nyssa on front desk thank you for your help - Rudi our room cleaner beautiful clean room always smiling and nothing to much trouble for you to do for us love the towel arrangements- We had amazing breakfasts lunch and dinners wonderful chef unfortunately we did not get your name - Our last day here 9 days has gone so quick we would recommend this hotel Wayne & Shirley OShea
530,We preferred it over Soori Bali,50,August 2019,"We landed in bali at 1am from the US with a 4-year old. We checked in with Sila and he was so helpful. I had made the reservation for the wrong day and he fixed it and added the special package I had without any instruction from me - he just handled it. Then he heard us talk about how I booked a tour at 4am so he had breakfast boxes ready for us. I chose my welcome gift which was waiting for me in my room before I arrived. I was so thankful that I didn‚Äôt have to be the one thinking ahead and asking questions. Instead, Sila just handled everything and anticipated my needs. I got the special package which included free meals and massages which was SO worth it! The Bali massage was very nice. Our favorite was the breakfast buffet and even though we stayed at the fancy Soori (Kardashian and Justin Bieber resort) a few days later, all we could talk about was how much we loved the Courtyard Marriott and missed the breakfast Buffett and wished we were back there. I was curious how a courtyard could get such great reviews and now I understand. It is the anticipation of needs, the amazing massages, amazing kids club, the breakfast Buffett that makes it stand out."
531,Bali Holiday,40,August 2019,"Just stayed 14 nights @Courtyard Marriott.
Fantastic Holiday.
Morning breakfast we were greeted every morning with happy smiling faces, enjoying a superb breakfast. Our Wait staff especially Febri and Willi were only to happy to please us. And make sure we has the perfect Cappuccino every morning . Thank you girls
Afternoons spent enjoying the pool bar, the staff and management there were very professional and eager to assist. A special thank-you to Hendra Narita and all the staff at the pool.
Our Rooms were serviced every day and nothing was to much trouble.
Thank you to all who were involved in the day to day running of the hotel.
I would highly recommend this hotel."
532,Fantastic Experience!,50,December 2018,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a week in December 2018 and absolutely loved the experience. The room was excellent, food amazing (including buffet breakfast, room service and the restaurant) and staff an absolute pleasure to deal with. A young staff member named Feby was really awesome to deal with in particular. We loved it and will definitely come again!"
533,Awesome service,50,August 2019,Started off with a few problems with our room. Was fast resolved and very professional. Excellent service from everybody but stand out service from andry he really went the extra mile for us he's and asset to the resort.would highly recommended staying at the courtyard by Marriott to any one travelling to bali. Very safe and family friendly environment.
534,Excellend Mid-range Hotel around Seminyak Area,50,August 2019,Had a 2 nights stay at Courtyard Marriott before transferring to another Marriott Bonvoy hotel. Hotel rooms and amenities was not as impressive but the service was excellent. Assistant Loyalty Manager Priscillia greeted us and showed us the room upon checking in. We were offered free Breakfast because of our Elite member status. She has been extremely friendly and helpful in recommending restaurant and places to visit.
535,Great hospitality and nice location,40,August 2019,"Á¨ëÈ°î„Å®ÂÑ™„Åó„ÅïÊ∫¢„Çå„Çã„ÅäÂ£∞„Åã„Åë„Å´„ÄÅ„Åô„Åî„ÅèÂøÉ„ÅåÁôí„Åï„Çå„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇÈÉ®Â±ã„ÇÇÁ∂∫È∫ó„ÅßÊ∏ÖÊΩî„Å´‰øù„Åü„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÁÇ∫„ÄÅÂÆâÂøÉ„Åó„Å¶„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç§„Åß„Åç„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅ

We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and had a great time.

Most impressive thing I‚Äôd been feeling was that every time I see those stuff at the lobby, restaurant, corridor or wherever they give you big smiles and friendly greetings. It made me smile also! The first night we went to the Seminyak kitchen to have dinner and the stuff named Dodi came talk to us and he was so nice. Hope he enjoys his visiting Japan!

The food was just ok on both breakfast and dinner but has so many variety so that was fun. On the last day we decided not to go there in the morning because it‚Äôs almost the same menu.

And for the room it was always clean, smelled good and big enough for 2 ppl. The guy named Ari always cleaned up our room for us and he leaves the towel dolls... that was so pretty! We loved that. On the first night we had a problem with the bathroom door so we got our floor flooded with water came out. The next day after I ask about this problem, it was all fixed so all good... one thing we were disappointed was we booked the pool view room, expected to have the great views but our room was 2nd floor on the corner it has not so very good scenery. We wish you could give us different room prices according to the room location.

Hope to see you all next time when I come back to Bali. Thank you for the great time!"
536,Excellent service crew and breakfast,40,August 2019,"Stayed 3 nights . Great breakfast . Seminyak Kitchen has the spread one expects in a 5 star hotel . The dining experience is made special because of the entire dining service crew. Very helpful, attentive and first class service attitude. When we had some questions which were not within their usual scope , they made effort to find answers by checking with relevant courtyard staff. Really appreciate Feby and Deyi(hope I got the name right) for their service. Actually I would like to commend all the courtyard staff . Excellent service throughout from checking. in , reception , room service, dining , spa and checking out . Will stay again . It would be perfect if it is by the beach ."

538,Marriott courtyard hospitality,50,August 2019,My first visit to Bali. Stayed in Marriott courtyard. Great staff ‚Äî Feel warmth and welcome. Breakfast is good with wide choices. You can get fresh juice. Staff Samitya will customise the juice to your liking and even make suggestions for you. Memorable stay
539,Excellent hotel in Seminyak,50,July 2019,"Very nice hotel with beautiful rooms and a modern feeling to it. The staff was always very nice with my family and I and we felt very secured staying there. The pool is beautiful though a bit cold and lacking a few more lounge chairs. The food at the hotel was simply delicious from breakfast to dinner. We also tried the Zanti Spa which was excellent and affordable! We were very glad to spend 3 nights at this hotel and will not forget the friendly service that we received from check in to check out by all staff members.
Highly recommend!"
540,Top Hotel at Reasonable Price.,50,August 2019,"Can i start off by saying a big thank you to your wonderful staff, and particularly the poolside bar staff (whose friendliness, professionalism, and banter was great) for making our stay such a memorable one.
The hotel is ideally situated within a 5 minute walk to the beach, although there is a free shuttle.
The rooms were of a decent size, well maintained and extremely clean.
Food including breakfast consisted of a good variety,with quality produce.
The pool area is partially in shade, but the sun travels the legnth of the pool so it is mostly in sun all of the day, the 30 minuite time limit on beds left unattended is a good idea.
All in all a fabulous 6 nights would definitely recommend.
The hotels best asset?
Its staff.
Thanks again."
541,Definitely Will Stay Again!,40,August 2019,"The bedroom was incredibly comfortable and clean. Very relaxing. My friends and I loved the balcony. We had a room with the pool view and the balcony was a great place to just lay back and relax. The weather was perfect during our stay, warm, sunny, but still with beautiful fluffy clouds, thus the balcony was a perfect place for us to cozy up.

The receptionists were friendly and helpful, they are fast enough in assisting us. However, we bought a value voucher for our breakfast and the communication between the front desk and restaurant was poor, every time we enter the breakfast, the staffs had no idea about the voucher and we always had to explain and re explain, it was quite bothersome.

But, the breakfast itself was good and we do recommend you to get it if you have the chance. The choices were not that big but tasted great. The omelette station, although crowded, served us quickly. What I love the most is their iced latte, and most importantly, their juice! I was in love with their detox juice and always take an extra glass to bring to my room after I finished the breakfast.

The location of the hotel is gold. They have a shuttle to bring you to the beach, but even without it, it‚Äôs very near, only 5 mins walk to La Plancha. It‚Äôs also surrounded with many restaurants, both cheap and aesthetic ones. I also love their taco/cocktail truck in front. Unfortunately I forgot his name, but his service was excellent. I asked for cocktail recommendation and I love both of his recommendations, shoutout to him! Amazing service, friendly, fast, great!

Lastly, the housekeeping staff was incredibly helpful. I asked for some amenities more than once and he responded quickly. On the second day, he left a small souvenir along with a massage on our bed, it was very thoughtful and made our day. It may be a small thing and unimportant, but it boosted our mood greatly. His name is Wahyu. 5 star for him! Great job.

Overall, We do enjoy the stay, and thank you! We will definitely stay here again next time."
542,Great stay,50,August 2019,We stayed here for 6 nights and loved everything about this hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful and very helpful and very professional food was fresh and tasty great selection for breakfast the massage at the spa was fabulous wish we had time for more in a great location near beach near good restaurants well done staff for a great stay Greg Heffernan
543,Good Location and Very Nice Hotel,50,July 2019,"This is a very nice hotel I found in Seminyak. The room is new and very beautiful. The guests at the hotel are good, so you can relax peacefully and enjoy the holiday.

What I liked the most was the pool area where I can just lay down on a beanbag chair and chilled.

They also have the shuttle service to the beach where they have private area for hotel guests."
544,Excellent,50,August 2019,"All the staff were so kind and went above and beyond. They were so friendly and have an excellent kids club. For kids under 4 you have to pay $7 AUD an hour. It‚Äôs so worth it, great cocktails and the pool is massive!"
545,Highly recommended!!!,50,July 2019,"My initial experience was not good due to an issue with my travel agency and the reservation. Even though it was not the hotel's fault, since the first minute, all people were willing to help. They offered me additional support in the period to get the issue resolved. All the people, without exception, was really kind providing outstanding service. Thanks to Priscilla and her manager that were working hard for us to have a pleasant stay. Many thanks to all the staff!! It has been really a pleasure and I'm really thankful for your exceptional support."
546,Great gym/personal trainer,50,August 2019,"I have just spent 6 days at the Courtyard by Marriot, Seminyak. I enjoy keeping fit while on holiday and partly chose this hotel for the gym. The gym was great, three treadmills, a bike, weights, cross trainer. I also took advantage of the personal training option which I cannot recommend enough! Wahyu, my trainer was fabulous! For $30 an hour, I had a session each morning, including weight training, cardio and boxing! He was very motivating and well worth the money."
547,Honeymoon Trip,40,August 2019,"Booked 5 nights via booking.com and we paid extra for some additional gadgets like couples massage and dinner. The room was quite typical, the bathroom was slightly larger than standard and offered shower stand only, no tub, however it had natural light windows. The tv, kettle, lights, remote and balcony door all worked without any need for help. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and had a fruit juice stand. Only thing is the hotel was constantly filled with children, as if it was marketed for parents with kids, maybe because of its pool. They didn't have an adjacent beach site however free shuttle was offered for a nearby beach facility with beds and WiFi, shower on offer. Hard checkout time of 1:00 after extending with only paid checkout delay offered."
548,Little dissapointing,30,August 2019,"Decided to stay at this hotel again after a wonderful experience I've had with the first stay, however this time was little dissapointing when I found out that I wasn't being told the truth upon check-in. When I checked in, I asked that if I was given an upgrade due to the Platinum status. The front desk Ade apologised that they weren't unable to give me a Suite room because the hotel was busy but they were able to upgrade me to a better type of room that I originally booked for. When I entered the room, nothing special about it and I became suspicious if he just lied to me, but I didn't wanna make a fuss about it because having an enjoyable time in Bali other than the hotel was more important. But I did ask the front desk upon check out and asked the type of room I had. Of course it was exactly the type of room I booked. Then I expressed my displeased feelings toward their dishonesty to me. Just tell your guest the truth and explain the real situation. Believe me, I would understand! So I was very looking forward to my stay at this hotel again, but came out with a little dissapointment. Everything else was okay. The pool and the breakfast, they were great! But I can't give 5 stars for this one."
549,Just perfect,50,August 2019,"This was an amazing stay... could not fault a thing. We booked a 2 bedroom suite for a family holiday and it was perfect. F&B is spot on, breakfast is amazing, Taco truck and pool menu is spot on.... All staff were amazing, every interaction was personal and service was perfect. This is a gem of a hotel and I would recommend to anyone. Couple or family, you can find your groove here and the location is perfect to main beach, shopping and everything in-between. Thank you SO much."
550,Recommended,50,July 2019,"Our stay here was fantastic. Our room was great, breakfast was plentiful and location is central. The pool bar and staff were friendly and will do anything for you. Well done to Hendra and a special mention to Sri who helped us with everything."
551,Amazing place to stay. Will definitely recommend to family and friends to stay here :),50,August 2019,"The rooms were beautiful with so much room. The pool was so clean and lounge chairs were so comfortable.
Special mention to Hendra and his bar team, Dede, mob, Arca and Dewa making amazing cocktails. Nothing to fault."
552,Highly recommended,50,August 2019,"Honestly the best service could not fault a single thing. Rooms are amazing, the pool bar is great, and really great location. The staff are always smiling, super friendly and polite.
Shout out to Hendra and his team and special mention to Narita, Agik, Alit and Kesawa you were all amazing, and really looked after us. The owner should be extremely proud to have staff like you working for them."
553,Lovely stay,40,July 2019,"Our suite was perfect and loved the breakfast. Staff were amazing but the pool area is not great, I go on holiday for the sun. There isn‚Äôt many beds that get the sun all day and the pool area doesn‚Äôt get sun after 3.30pm which was really disappointing. The hotel has an area at the beach but this is quite shaded too. I couldn‚Äôt fault anything else apart from this."
554,Very good with one area for improvement,40,July 2019,"We recently stayed here for 7 nights after staying in Singapore. We arrived in the evening and we were disappointed that our room over looked the street and the car park. However we knew we had not booked a pool view so in affect got what we paid for. However we decided that we would upgrade as we could not imagine having this view for a week. Staff in reception organised this for us and could not have been more helpful! The room was lovely and clean and overlooked the pool. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice. The hotel provide a free buggy to the beach as they have their own area just for hotel guests, there are sun beds, towels and you are regularly given bottles of free water and ice lollies!!
Now to my main gripe about the hotel, the pool, but for me one of the most important parts of my holiday. As you‚Äôve no doubt read one side of the pool is in shade the whole day so not many people appear to want the row of beds at that side. The sun beds on the other side that are in the sun are like gold dust!! Yes get there early if you want a bed and don‚Äôt move for longer than 30 minutes as we did see pool staff remove towels. I did attempt the pool but it was freezing and was very disappointed because I enjoy swimming. We decided for 4 days to go to the beach as there was no issue with beds being in the sun or shade.
What can the hotel do about this because it does appear to be affecting people returning? I would knock down the big ugly looking water feature which would create another area for beds in the sun. I would also heat the pool.
I have to mention the staff, they are the best asset of the hotel!! We could not have wished for more polite and friendly helpful staff!!"
555,"Enjoyable stay, great service",50,June 2019,"Thank you to all staff at Courtyard at Marriott especially to Santi, being the first friendly face we saw who was very helpful and accommodating, but as were all staff there.. good kids club and good pool, yummy breakfast and room service :)"
556,Did not live up to expectations,30,July 2019,"To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Lovely initial impression, friendly check-in staff, great free buggy service, coffee truck, our hopes were high.
What a let down when we got to our room. Deluxe Family room was outdated, cramped and unbearably noisy. We were kept awake by the horns and woken at 5:30am by chairs being rearranged by the restaurant. We complained after 2 nights & was told all family rooms face the street & no balconies. So the rooms with the most people & kids have the least space & face the noisiest part.
Could never get a sun lounger by the pool. Despite a 30min hold policy, guests from the pool access rooms reserved the few lounges in the sun from early in the morning before going back to their rooms.
The pool wasn‚Äôt warm enough to swim in for more than 15 mins, a problem having it in the shade of the building. And it‚Äôs def not a kid friendly hotel with the pool having a huge water feature instead of a slide or something fun.
To finish it off, we bought a F&B credit which we checked on twice to ensure we‚Äôd used it all up. On departure told there had obviously been a mistake and we had 250k remaining which was non-refundable. After complaining was told they would have the manager contact us. Three days later and we‚Äôve heard nothing.
Location is good for walking to the beach, but we‚Äôd never stay again."
557,Great location!,50,July 2019,"This is the first time we stay in Courtyard Seminyak. They greet you with choices of drinks while checking in, very professional and attentive staffs, walking distance to beach, restaurants and shops. Beautiful pools that you could spend the whole day chilling. Will definitely come back again."
558,Amazing honey moon here.,50,June 2019,"Brilliant hotel, possibly the best I have ever stayed. Staff were amazing, too polite if there is such a thing! We arrived without a booking as our villa was not good, staff were great offering us different deals. Yes this hotel is expensive compared to others, but totally worth it for location and service!"
559,"Nice hotel, good location",40,October 2018,"Rooms were nice and also very clean, good size. Nice bathroom, comfy bed and balcony overlooking the pool. Was hard to get a bed by the pool though.
Breakfast area was smaller than I am used to in Bali but plenty of food and service was still fast.Decent gym, but it did get busy so hard to get to equipment.
Used the complimentary massage and it was fantastic.
Would stay here again."
560,Great spot,40,June 2019,"Really great location, only a 5-minute walk to the beach (La Plancha is a must for evening drinks) and a quick taxi to other popular places such as Finns or Mexicola (another must if you want a crazy night). We got a pool view room which was nice, we didn't spend too much time in the hotel as we used it as a base to see all the local area. Breakfast was by a mile the best breakfast we had anywhere on the island, so much choice! We also had a couples massage which was great.

The only negative was that we were scheduled to check out and go to Gili T but the boats got cancelled, so we basically had nowhere to stay for a night and were pretty scared. Once the hotel we realised we didn't want to stay there (we just wanted to see different places) they completely lost interest and didn't help."
561,Amazing - as always!,50,July 2019,"We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for our 4th time. As always it's brilliant.
A quick and easy check in on arrival has you into your room fast which is nice after flight
The breakfast is up there with the best on offer, even when staying in hotels triple the price of this one. The range and quality is outstanding.

Our apartment was spacious and clean and the daily housekeeping was fantastic.
We didn't expect to use the Kids club much however I couldn't get my children out of there! Komang, Deby, Ayu and others were fantastic with many fantastic activities each day.
The pool on this occasion did seem a little colder than other trips so I'm not sure if this has changed or if it is just due to us travelling at a different time of year.
I do like that the reserving of sun lounges is watched so that people can't reserve them for hours without using them.
The food is fantastic and great value for money.
We did stay during the earthquake and I was so impressed with the handling of this by management. Not only did they inspect the whole hotel to ensure no structural damage had been sustained but they did this in a prompt and professional manner and continually checked on the guests to see if everyone was ok. It was so reassuring to have this happening. Once again we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard Marriott and can't wait to return again with family and friends next year."
562,The best service all round!,50,July 2019,"This is my second stay at the hotel and the staff at the restaurant, concierge, front desk, housekeeping and pool bar are friendly and courteous. Arja, Rai, Hardi, Juli, Fauzam thank you all for the exceptional service!"
563,Awesome and lovely stay,50,July 2019,"I really enjoyed my time in Seminyak while staying at the Courtyard. They were very accommodating, friendly and their breakfast was amazing! The rooms were clean and the balcony area was comfortable. One could spend an entire afternoon there just listening to the music while reading a book. They had live music every evening and the pools were fun, with a swim up bar. They had a buggy that could take you to the beach even though the hotel is within a 6 minute walking distance. Everyday the house keeping staff would leave a cool gift for their guests!"
564,Wonderful,50,July 2019,"My wife and I stayed here for 7 days and found this resort was above and beyond our expectations, we loved the location and the staff and service were second to none. All of the staff were willing to go that extra mile to accommodate. Breakfast is brilliant!! The rooms are modern, well thought out and immaculately clean. House keeping do a brilliant job. Would definitely stay again"
565,Exceptional and Beyond,50,July 2019,"I booked a group for my company from 21st to 26th July.

Everyone always have a big smile on their faces and certainly was very warm to the heart.
The hotel room is more than what we have paid for. Clean and coming back to my room seeing the cute towels with little gifts made my day.

Location is right where the bustling activities are with about 10mins walk to the beach.

My group enjoyed the stay very much and I certainly look forward to bringing my family back here if I were to come back to Bali."
566,Fantastic,50,July 2019,"We stayed for 7 nights and everything about the hotel was amazing. Location is central to great restaurants and shopping. The staff at the pool bar were amazing. Hendra and his staff were courteous and attentive. Special mention to Sri who was absolutely fantastic.
Lia"
567,Amazing Courtyard Marriott,50,July 2019,"Chinta. Is organizing the dinner buffet and was great , friendly, and humble. Amazing night with delicious food and Balinese dancing and Bali music. Definitely Will come back. The breakfast was delicious along with a great dinner."
568,Service with a smile,50,July 2019,"Myself and my boyfriend recently spent 9 nights here and what amazing holiday it was! The staff were all so friendly and welcoming in particular Ari and Ayu in the pool bar, they are the sweetest ladies I have encountered. I am already counting down the days until I can visit again! The cleanliness of the hotel rooms was exceptional also!
Chloe and Josh"
569,A sanctuary amidst the hustle and bustle,50,July 2019,"This resort hotel had a very friendly and welcoming vibe. Located just a few minutes from Seminyak beach it is also convenient to restaurants and interesting shopping.
The staff were aways polite and friendly and went out of their way to assist. Nothing was too much trouble. They seemed to have a genuine interest in their guests.
Our room was very clean and bright and looked over the central pool and garden area.
The Seminyak Kitchen dining area offered a good range of dining options across all meals.
We were very happy with our choice of hotel."
570,Amazing stay!!,50,July 2019,"Our whole family had an amazing experience here!
The food and drinks were amazing and the service was always really friendly. Every morning Dodi greeted us at breakfast and remembered us by name and we always saw Hendra talking to people staying. All the crew go above and beyond to make sure guests are happy
The rooms are really clean and Sintya left lovely notes after she cleaned our room
Would definitely recommend staying here and it is close to so many attractions and things to do in Seminyak"
571,Fabulous Hotel,50,July 2019,"Our recent stay here was a fabulous experience. The hotel staff throughout the resort were helpful & attentive. Always a smile & greeting wherever we went. The reception staff quickly responded after we had issues with rude, noisy guests in adjoining rooms and Ramu in management personally saw to rellocating us. Buffet breakfast catered to all tastes, amazing selections !!
The pool staff in particular the lovely Ari & Ayu remembered our names & genuinely loved to chat & greet us every evening.
Can highly recommend this resort for all types of guests, couples, families, singles...
Great location ."
572,Amazing!,50,July 2019,"This resort is absolutely amazing! Not only is it stunning and in the perfect location, all the staff here literally made my entire holiday! Particularly Hendra for his amazing customer service and for making us feel comfortable 24/7! His welcoming smile everyday always put us in a good mood and made us feel at home. Sintya, our beautiful room cleaner who made coming back to the resort every day exciting to see what note she had left for us that day! And all the other staff who went above and beyond to help us, especiallywhen things got a little haywire, were all undoubtedly amazing people!"
573,Great place,50,July 2019,"Perfect place to stay! enjoyed every minute, especially the free shots from the amazing bartender Hendra Dwipayana. Rooms were clean and well presented with a yummy restaurant to eat at inside the hotel. Would recommend to any person visiting Seminyak"
574,We Really Enjoyed Staying Here,50,July 2019,"This place has everything. The team members working there are so friendly and helpful. They really look after you.
The facilities were modern and clean.
The pool and swim up poolbar were exactly what we wanted.
A walk up the beach gets you to Seminyak Square. No need for taxi/transport up there.
There is a beach buggy that takes you to the beach front seats.
A really enjoyable stay."
575,A cool and shaken stay,30,July 2019,"First time staying in this hotel, which is pretty decent. The double bed room is rather comfy with basic amenities provided. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Had a reasonable memorable stay, which capped with my first Indonesian earthquake experience. Was shaken up by a 6.2 Ricther scaled earthquake. The hotel responded very efficiently and professionally by making a public announcement and gathering all hotel guests at the lobby. A clear explanation and reassurance were provided. All guests were allowed back to their once the property was checked through. Subsequently, after that shock no more earthquake was reported and holidaymakers continue enjoying Bali and the hotel facilities. Cool and shaken."
576,Disappointed,30,July 2019,"My Family of 5 were en route to Australia from London and I purposely booked this hotel, so we had 24hrs of luxury.. I have done this trip many times and did my research - we arrived at midnight, exhausted from our flights and they demand full payment vs handing over your credit card, I just wanted to bill everything to my room.. that was a drama at the desk trying to work out taxi & currency & booking.com.... only one side of the pool is sunny, so there is not enough sun loungers to go round & again you are faced with ‚Äòcash or card‚Äô with everything you order, I just wanted one bill at the end of my stay.. the food is mediocre - lunch by the pool was terrible, so we had to venture out for dinner before our flight to Oz.. the two good things are.. the room was spotless and the massage I booked was amazing! If you‚Äôre loaded and don‚Äôt care about what 1mil rupee you‚Äôre being charged.. then it‚Äôs ok - would not return."
577,Amazing stay,50,July 2019,I have just had an amazing stay at this hotel. The staff are absolutely amazing. So attentive and friendly. The food at the restaurant is delicious and fresh. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seminyak. I look forward to my return.
578,Dodi who works in restaurant,50,July 2019,He is a absolute credit to the hotel. Extremely professional and always polite and smiling . He is very good at his job with a high level of customer facing skills . Very happy customer and I will be back most definitely:-)) KAACTIVE PT üí™üèºüí™üèº
579,"Good service, food and attentive staff",40,June 2019,"We were really made to feel welcome on arrival at reception. Our room faced away from the pool which gave us interesting views of the surrounding area. The buffet breakfast was really good with a big range of different types of food to cater for all tastes. The room was a reasonable size, quiet and the bed was comfortable.
Within easy walking distance to the beach and there were many eating places nearby as well as a small supermarket.."
580,"Great service, awesome location",50,June 2019,"Stayed here while attending a work conference. Service and facilities are excellent. Rooms were spotless. Breakfast buffet was a standout and pool side bar was comfortable and not expensive. Hotel location is not central but this is part of appeal - very close to some nice restaurants & shops and a short walk to the beach.
Would love to come back when not working!"
581,Fantastic hotel and experience,50,July 2019,"Just back from our six night stay in the Marriott courtyard and still feeling very relaxed! The hotel was wonderful, rooms spacious, clean and tidy, food in the restaurant and pool bar was excellent! The staff undoubtedly made this experience special - they were all so nice and friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Special mention to some standouts- Ari and Sri in the pool bar who were fantastic and made our stay very enjoyable and Santi in reception who was always ready to help with a smile. Well done folks and thanks for a great experience"
582,Ari,50,July 2019,Great stay but you must visit the pool bar and Ari who is a gorgeous Balinese girl will look after you like royalty. Sri makes you feel extremely welcome and greets you each day. See is genuinely interested in you and wants to know about you. Best bar person in Bali!
583,Amazing Hotel Resort,50,July 2019,"The Courtyard Marriott remains one of our favourite resorts in Bali. We have just spent a week at the resort, it was our 5th or 6th stay here.

I highly commend the staff who are very friendly and very attentive. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they attend to each request with a smile and 'can do' attitude.

Right from the minute we arrived, we were greeted with a warm welcome. We got the impression that everyone knew us and were determined to make sure that our every need was met. The check-in experience was amazing, we were made to feel welcome, and was personally greeted by the acting manager Grant and the guess relations officer Precillia.

We were offered refreshments, a cold towelette and Precillia made sure the check-in process was seamless. In fact, we were offered a choice of rooms.

The pool bar is a great place to relax. The staff are super friendly and helpful and with great music playing, this is truly a superb location for some down time.

I'd like to mention Ari, the young waitress, even though having been around for only a month was an ultimate professional. Her actions, friendly approach and general demeanour suggested that she had been in the job for a lot longer.

The breakfast served in the Seminyak Kitchen is high on our list as one of the best, if not the best, Bali has to offer. You can literally request anything at any time and the chef is on hand to please. The choice of dishes are outstanding and caters to anyone's taste, irrespective of your country of origin.

Overall, I highly recommend this property and will return again and again."
584,Lovely hotel. Some positives and negatives,40,June 2019,"Positives: Great service, lovely room, amazing breakfast. We got freebies of a free cocktail hour daily - brilliant. A free one hour massage - amazing. A free dinner - great. The gym is probably the best hotel gym I've ever used
Negatives for me: We had pool facing room above reception and every night it seemed the bar was in my bedroom. One night they had food trucks in the car park and that was so loud it was ridiculous. Also woken by drunkards in the corridors and outside. I'm a good sleeper and not normally sensitive to noise. Maybe request a room well away from Reception/bar area and it would probably be lovely.
I didn't particularly like the pool/bar area, not many recliners and the usual drama of people leaving a towel on there for the day which was not policed and just annoys me. The bar/cafe wasn't very big and full of smokers (yuk). There was a big area with fake grass which was largely underutilized which was a pity. The morning we left there were chairs and umbrellas set up, not sure why they didn't do this every day.
Value for money? Hmmmmm. Two rooms, total NZD $500 a night. It is 5 star in Seminyak so that is what you pay. You don't have to pay this much but need to get out of Seminyak."
585,Honeymoon stay,50,July 2019,We arrived very late at Courtyard but staff were on hand to greet us and welcome us to the hotel. Thorough security checks before you enter which is good. We spent two nights here in a very spacious room. Great selection of food at breakfast including a fresh juice station. Everything tasted good! Seminyak is very lively but the hotel pools are a great place to relax. Friendly and attentive staff.
586,Not paradise it's hell,10,July 2019,"From airport to hotel and back we had nothing but bad experience, taxi driver cheated us, hotel was dirty and rooms musky smell, food terrible, management worse and didn't care, merchants cheat you, we never will go back."
587,The most amazing stay,50,July 2019,"Thank you Grant and team for an amazing stay. After I was ripped off in eat street the security team swung into action and assisted with some muscle and got my money back. Much appreciated, made for a very interesting night. One that I would prefer to go without!!"
588,Overall good hotel,40,July 2019,Overall nice hotel. Good breakfast. Pool was nice. Comfortable beds. Clean room. Nice staff. Safe. Fridge. Good WiFi. Good A/C. I couldn‚Äôt give it five stars because even though we had a good time there... Something was missing. I just don‚Äôt know what it is. Maybe based on the excellent reviews we were expecting more. But I would stay here again.
589,Great stay,50,July 2019,"Fantastic hotel located in Semon yak only a couple of minutes from the beach. Security is pretty good, there is a machine that check your bags as you enter the hotel and you walk through a body scanner.
Semonyak is much better than Kuta because there‚Äôs less hassles from anyone trying to sell you items around the hotel.
rooms all overlook a beautiful double pool that has a pool bar and another adjoining bar area. Pool was not heated however and quite chilling, can be considered a bonus in the hot weather.
There are rooms available that walk straight out to the large pool. We felt it‚Äôs nicely located as away from hustle and bustle and only a couple of minutes from the beach.
Kids friendly hotel with fairy floss and ping pong.
Is quite a quirky hotel like there is a note in room saying ‚Äòwe know you need your fridge empty so you can use it on holidays so we‚Äôve done just that. Here‚Äôs a snack list for your needs‚Äô.
Breakfast buffet is great with everything freshly cooked , ample room in the eating area and every type of food imaginable.
A cool coffee, taco van permanently operates out the front and the coffee is really good and strong.
On checkout I heard someone compliments when they said ‚Äòthe staff are simply amazing ‚Äò
Sopiyan, Ayva, Arya, Laura, Widiadnyana, Krisna, were fantastic and extra hospitable."
590,"Wonderful staff and management, hats off to Grant!",50,June 2019,"We arrived back at Courtyard Marriott after feeling very let down by a visit to The Grand Mirage In Nusa Dua. Grant and his staff were wonderful, allowing us an early check in and were genuinely interested in our needs as guests. This is one of the hotels where you do not feel like just another number and we really appreciated the attention after our journey."
591,"Birthday Celebrations with my wife alone without the kids after 26 Years """,50,July 2019,"What an absolutely fantastic hotel with fabulous friendly staff and management always greeting and making sure you feel welcome , I have been on holiday to a few countries but have to say this was by far the best hotel I ever stayed at.
Thank you to all staff and management for making my stay a memorable one.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Bali for a holiday."
592,Awesome Hotel,50,July 2019,The staff is friendly and extremely welcoming. Cece was so helpful in finding us the correct room for our needs. Chinta was great checking up on us every day. It is a very clean hotel and the pool is spectacular. everybody was amazing I shall highly recommend this establishment to all my friends and family. Thank you for an awesome stay.
593,Honeymoon trip,40,July 2019,"This is no ordinary courtyard Marriott as this one takes everything to a whole new level of comfort. We booked this hotel purely to explore Seminyak, and not spend any time in the actual hotel. For that purpose, this hotel fit our needs perfectly. The location is perfect to all the iconic beach bars with bean bags and so close to eat street restaurants. The room itself was very nice and they went out of their way to make the room nicer for our honeymoon( flowers in the shape of a heart) only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars because the place is swarmed with little kids. So for some people this may be a great option, but for two late 20s on our honeymoon, it was a bit chaotic (especially breakfast!)"
594,Kitchen Seminyak,50,July 2019,"The Romantic Dinner on the roof top was an exciting venue to celebrate our 7th Wedding Anniversary. All the 5 Course menu were exceptionally delicious aromatic slipper lobster, Lamb loin was superb etc.... The service BY DODI was absolutely charming. 5 star plus
Kitchen Seminyak serves lovely food"
595,Nice modern hotel,50,July 2019,"My family and I stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed the stay immensely. As part of the package we received some perks such as free massages, lunch and cocktails which made the stay even better. My son especially liked the free cotton candy on offer each day.

Rooms were nice, modern, clean with very comfy beds. Staff were always very happy and keen to help out. Some people complain about the security measures but unfortunately that is the world we live in and is a small price to ensure safety at the resort.

The hotel is nicely situated close enough to the beach and convenient for local shops, restaurants and bars meaning you don‚Äôt have far to travel if you fancy a wander around.

The only negative of the stay was the pool temperature but I understand that was probably due to time of year. It was just a bit too cold to enjoy.

Overall would recommend for a family holiday in seminyak"
596,Marriott ticks all the boxes for Bali Trip,50,July 2019,"I‚Äôm so pleased to be staying at the Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak! Everyone here is fantastic! The food is great! Especially love LOVE the buffet breakfast! Lots of variety! The breakfast staff always know your name: Dedi, Dodi, and Aya to name a few are WONDERFUL !! We had a wonderful traditional dinner that the LOVELY Chinta organized!!! The good was FANTASTIC as well as the traditional dance performance! The dinner is a must for those wanting to try more traditional dishes!

The rooms are kept clean and the BED IS SO COMFORTABLE!!!!!!!! Makes it hard to leave to do activities! üòÜ

It was my mine and my daughter birthday ...and they left a cake for us when we checked in. Super cute touch!!

I‚Äôm so happy with the service and staff here at the hotel and I look forward to visiting here again in the future!

Thanks to everyone at Courtyard for a great vacation so far!"
597,Fantastic Service,50,June 2019,"We had a wonderful stay here the staff could not do enough for you, the room was very clean, service fantastic, breakfast good had a great variety, special surprise when the staff sang happy birthday to me a gave me a cake (for breakfast) after one day there the staff would recognise you and they would bring your drinks without you telling them what you wanted, I would come back again. The only negative is that there were not enough snacks when they had happy hour, I know it is not a meal however this was still a good time"
598,"Best hotel, food, and service!!!",50,July 2019,"In my two plus years of traveling to Indonesia, my stay at the courtyard Marriott seminyak was by far the best hotel experience I have experienced. The food was exceptional - chef panda and yoss deserve special recognition. They are very talented and provided the best food! To be honest I chose to eat all my meals at the hotel because of them. Other staff members made the experience truly memorable as well. Widi was engaging and very professional. The housekeeping staff: ngurah oko, and weda took great care of our room and left us very pleasant surprises each day. Truly phenomenal. If you are going to holiday in Bali stay in this hotel. You will not be disappointed. I am counting down the days until I can go back!!!! I won't stay anywhere else."
599,Outstanding service.,50,July 2019,"I cannot rate this hotel and its staff highly enough.
From the reception- who changed our room by request with no problems at all.
The pool bar staff - Hendra and his team honestly could not do enough! I‚Äôve never seen such wonderful service in any hotel that I‚Äôve stayed in.
And the hotel is within walking distance to bars and restaurants.
It‚Äôs perfect t in every way
Couples, families. I would even be comfortable to come alone.
Well done guys. Awesome job. Don‚Äôt change a thing! It‚Äôs perfect!
Pool could be a little bit warmer! üòÇ"
600,"Lively Location, Good Hotel",40,May 2019,"I was actually very impressed with my stay here. It is a Marriott Courtyard property, but still felt like a full ""Marriott"". Check-in was efficient, offered complementary beer and was explained the facilities of the property. It is a bright and airy hotel and the rooms are very modern with balconies facing over the central pool area. Breakfast in the main restaurant offered a range of local Indonesian choices as well as western options and even though the buffet was busy, plenty of staff were on hand cleaning and resetting tables. As a Marriott Elite member, 4pm late checkout on Sunday was provided and I was even offered a complementary beer whilst checking out. Staff were friendly, English spoken was good.Location is a few hundred metres from the beach with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Inside the hotel did feel quite peaceful and relaxing. For the area it is located in, its a good option."
601,An Absolutely Awesome Experience,50,June 2019,The quality of service par excellence. Cuisine I reckon is best in town. Superb location close to all amenities. Rooms are immaculate. To Team Courtyard well done. The surrounding gardens are in pristine condition.
602,20th wedding anniversary holiday,50,December 2018,"Loved our stay for our family trip away to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.
Family aged from 12 to 73
We booked 4 rooms, double and twin rooms. Elevator was handy to have to get to level 4.
They put us all on the same floor
Beautiful onsite restaurant that served great meals and breakfast everyday was to die for. Fresh juices and smoothies made to order.
Great pool with swim up pool bar
Perfect location off the main road
Could not fault the place
Room, bed, bathroom everything was beautiful, worth the price"
603,Highly recommended!,40,August 2018,"Pros
Great location - 5 minute walk from the beach
Spacious rooms
Huge swimming pools
pool bar available
Awesome staff

Con
Street noise at night

All in all, we had a great stay! The staff were superb. My favorite touch of the hotel was the unlimited popcorn at the lobby and the taco foodtruck up front!"
604,"Excellent Experience from the Marriott Group, Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak",50,June 2019,"We decided to choose the hotel based on specific reason, first is the majority of people review, second is the name of the chain hotel, the third is the location and fourth is the staff. And Courtyard by Marriott at Seminyak is the first name in our list. There are positive feedback from the guest.s. The check in was good and fast. The Suite Room was great, clean and family friendly. They have some activities inside the hotel. Location is nearby to the beach by 5 minutes walk or you can use golf cart to take you to some tourist points at Seminyak. They have great breakfast with international food including gluten free food as alternate breakfast for you. The staffs were friendly, professional and made you feel at home. Great People is company aset and special kudos to Ms. Priscillia Chandra, Elite Guest Relation Supervisor who helped us with some information about the hotel, surroundings and also things about the hotel chain for my future stay reference We recommend you to stay at this hotel."
605,Best service ever,50,June 2019,"This place was above and beyond any expectations we had, all the staff we extremely helpful and friendly. We have a family member with special dietary requirements which were perfectly catered for. The accommodation was immaculately presented ultra modern and safe. Our family found this to be the perfect base for our Bali holiday."
606,Nice hotel - centrally located and close to beach.,40,June 2019,"I enjoyed my time at this hotel. Seminyak is superb and the hotel is located quite close to the beach area. The service was good and the staff were quite attentive.

Only problem I found was the location v the nightlife areas.... its a confusing road to get to the streets with the main bars... and when coming home late at night you can get accosted by some unsavoury sorts offering trips to here there and everywhere.

My advice is to take a taxi to most places away from the hotel main street.

All in all I would return. Bali is awesome."
607,lovely,50,August 2018,aboslutely lovely resort. lots of activities and fun. amazing pool areas and food. best hotel ive been to. extremely large area and very nice staff. had fun with family and friends. 5 min walk to beach
608,"Pampered, Trip made more memorable",50,June 2019,"Planned to celebrate our wedding anniversary and birthday for my daughter in Bali , couldn‚Äôt think that our celebration would be made more memorable. Thanks Marriott for the hospitality and they way entire staff treated us.

Check in - one of the smooth checkin I have been to, directly taken in to room for check in and explaining to us on the facility along with details in Bali. Upgrade to one bedroom
Suite - wow, clean and nice room overlooking the pool

Food - Definitely put on weight after the trip. Pizza, pastas, fish and chips ... loved everything served with excellent taste and affection. Had most of the meals in seminayak kitchen and few in pool, all very simply astonishing.

Staff - one of the best. Pampering to the core. Each and everyone had same laugh and care to entire family , for each meal there would be minimum 4-5 staff coming to us and ask us on the food and anything we needed. Thanks üôè will not be enough for the team. Just loved them

Romantic dinner arranged for us on rooftop was simply astonishing. Decoration in roof top and care in which food was served , we loved every moment of it and will cherish for life time.

Want to personally thank few of staff whom I could remember - Ari(Concierge), Donni, Dodi, Agus, Harry(Seminayak kitchen). Sorry for forgetting few as couldn‚Äôt recollect team. Our special kudos and thanks to entire team.

Special thanks to John Woolley for personally meeting and checking on us.

Thanks once again for making our holiday very memorable one and memories that we have taken back will live in our hearts.

Loved to be back"
609,"Not the relaxing, peaceful stay I was hoping for",30,June 2019,"The hotel is nice and clean and what you would expect from the Marriot. My room looked out onto a grey wall and didn‚Äôt get any sun which was disappointing. I also thought it was overkill that I had to put my purse through security every time I entered the building. It was cramped and noisy around the pool from the pool bar music and there were kids playing football and screaming.

Nice hotel but I would look for somewhere more peaceful next time."
610,Superb...loved our stay here!,50,July 2018,"Stayed here with my wife and toddler son and cannot fault the place. Rooms were great and comfortable. Food was excellent and varied, particularly the breakfast spread. But their best asset is their staff. Super friendly, plentiful and highly professional, they made our stay a brilliant one. Their care was genuine, particularly towards our son. You can tell how much effort the Australian managers have put into training their staff and they are to be commended. No views but as a base of operations, it's A-1. Trendy and modern, we would happily recommend this hotel to everyone."
611,Cool pool in the Courtyard,30,June 2019,"This hotel is really well located being only a few minutes walk to the beachüëçThey also have a private allocated space on the beach front for exclusive use by guests. They provide a complimentary shuttle, towels & water. But you could easily walk to it within 10 minutes. Across the road from the hotel is a really large supermarket which had everything you might need! In the opposite direction, we found heaps of great little restaurants and again, all within 10 minutes walk. Hotel staff are friendly, attentive and polite. Breakfast was awesome! Great selection üôå Bedding was incredibly comfortable & my daily request for wine glasses & an ice bucket to be delivered to our room was fast & efficient which was fabulous! ü•ÇüëçSo ok, here comes just a few tiny negatives but they are things the hotel cannot change. The pool is in shade for most of the day which makes the water a bit on the cool side. (Maybe they could heat the pool?) I found the cupboard space for hanging too small. There was also nowhere to hang your wet bathers & only one rail to hang a bath towel. We did ask for a fold up towel rail but they said they didn‚Äôt have any. We saw drying racks on other balconies which was a bit puzzling ü§î
Overall, it was a great 6 days which we really enjoyed. We had a pool view room on level 6 which is the top floor. Higher the better to get away from any noise."
612,Simply wonderful,50,June 2019,"We stayed at the Courtyard for 8 nights, we were very warmly welcomed after a long journey over and settled into our lovely/spacious and clean room, which conveniently had room safe, fridge and nice big walk in shower. Breakfast was second to none and we felt literally cater for every need, we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast. The hotel is conveniently located with lots of decent restaurants/bars and of course the beach just 10 mins (max) walking down the road! But most importantly all the staff were just so friendly, polite and helpful, we genuinely felt like all the staff really did want to make our stay at the Courtyard a special holiday, and Thank-you all you certainly did that :)"
613,Amazing Hotel,50,June 2019,"This hotel is absolutely fabulous, i cant fault it in any way. The staff are soooo friendly, polite and helpful, they are always smiling. All the facilities are brilliant. The spa was lovely and Parsini gave the best massage ever. Would highly recommend this hotel. 10/10"
614,Wonderful Resort with Marvellous Staff,50,June 2019,"My husband and I spent 10 nights here with two other couples for our friends 50th‚Äôs......couldn‚Äôt have picked a nicer place to stay and the inclusions and staff were amazing! We spent a lot of time around the pool bar and the staff here were so attentive. A big shout out to Gus Dek, my husbands favourite....Sri, Narita, Aedos and Kesawa of whom nothing was too much trouble and the amazing cocktails and Hendra for going over and above to ensure our time at the hotel was perfect. I can‚Äôt thank you all enough for your kind hospitality and I look forward to returning."
615,Mrs,50,June 2019,"Love this place much, the staff all very friendly , breakfast very goodüëãhotel near from double six beach only need 5-10 minute walk, room very clean, there are so many activities at kids club.. Around hotel so many good restaurant. Surely will come back soonüòç"
616,Best Marriott property!,50,June 2019,"I am Marriot gold status, so I stay in several properties throughout the year and this property was hands down the best I have seen. Yes, the building was clean, rooms were luxurious and the amenities were great-. BUT, that is not what makes thia the best property. To say the staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome is an understatement. I was greeted by name by every manager who worked there and was made to feel like royalty. I was invited to an elite status reception one night, given great advice about possible tours and attractions, and welcomed warmly at every meal I ate on site. This should be the flagship for training every other property in the bonvoy portfolio! I want to specifically mention Priscilla who was always available to give advice on things to do or ways to make our stay more comfortable. Also, Donald in seminyak kitchen was delightful as well, each day making a point to greet us at meals. This really was a top notch experience and I whole-heartedly did not want to leave. I will return to Bali again and you guarantee that I will be staying at the courtyard Marriott in seminyak!"
617,The staff!,50,June 2019,"What an amazing experience! From our arrival to our departure we felt so welcome no matter what we were doing. This goes for everyone from the people cleaning our rooms to the management. Since our contacts with the staff mainly were with the persons working in the restaurant and the poolbar we want to give a shoutout to them. They were amazingly nice, friendly and serviceminded our whole stay! If we are going back to Bali there is only one place where we would considering to stay, Courtyard by Marriot! Thank you for the best hotel experience we ever had! Kudos to Grant for having (and keeping) such an fantastic staff where everyone made us feel almost at home. We couldn¬¥t and wouldn¬¥t ask for more! I hope we¬¥ll meet again in a few years time. A lot of love to the staff from a happy family from Sweden!"
618,Wonderful place,50,June 2019,"I have been staying in this Lovley hotel from Jun 13 to Jun 23
I would say it‚Äôs a very convenient price with exceptional services and spacious rooms

All the staff are helpful,friendly and smiling all the time

I would like to thank special associate who made my stay starting of the duty manager Mr. Wahyo ,arya, widi and the friendly front office manger Ramo ( sorry if spilling wrong)

I would recommend this place as one of best destinations in Bali

Yazeed
Room 623"
619,Amazing hotel,50,June 2019,"Thank you courtyard by Marriott for a fantastic family holiday. The staff were lovely and accommodating, the food delicious and house keeping exceptional. We will definitely be back again and we would like to expend our warm thanks to Chinta for her hospitality"
620,A great place to stay at seminyak,50,June 2019,"I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is convenient in seminyak and around 500 m to the beach.
Lot of varieties at the breakfast and we loved it.
We enjoyed our stay üëçüèΩ"
621,Taking Care of Us!,50,June 2019,"It was an absolute pleasure staying at Courtyard by Marriott. The room was quiet and cool and very comfortable. Loved the view over the pools and courtyard areas. We enjoyed an amazingly blissful massage with their team at Zanti Spa.
Loved the buffet breakfast each morning with every type of indulgence available. The highlight was the friendly staff who made sure we were enjoying our stay with them. It was lovely to be greeted by name and asked how we were, what we were doing that day, and to share some of their own experiences too.
Big Hi to Widi their champion waiter, I feel we have met lots of new friends.
No hesitation to recommend this gorgeous place!"
622,Wonderful staff,50,June 2019,"Courtyard by Marriott is located well, being central to the hustle of Seminyak, but just far enough away to be slightly chilled.

The hotel facilities are reasonable and clean, although the pool bar is showing some wear and could be improved.

The staff at courtyard really make the difference though.They are a friendly team who work well and attend promptly to all reasonable requests.

Special mention to Widi and Gita, such a credit to themselves and the hotel. They have made our stay so welcoming and have such an infectious positive outlook. Thank you guys - well done"
623,Loved every minute here,50,June 2019,"We had a great time here from start to finish. The rooms are lovely and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever had, from fresh juices to the smashed avocado there is so much choice. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you and Widi in particular in the Seminyak Kitchen was lovely. We also took part in the sunrise yoga and the aqua aerobics. The yoga was nice but the aqua aerobics was a bit short - only about 15 minutes. It was still enjoyable though."
624,VIP treatment for an extremely good rate,50,June 2019,"Loved every minute at this place. Staff were all very accommodating and everyone went the extra mile, such as Grant, the manager, personally greeting us at check-in. Favourite parts of this hotel include:
- the swim up bar
- the BREAKFAST BUFFET! (it is as good as all the reviews say and we got it at a great rate. Defs recommend this.
- the hotel buggy which drives you to the hotel's private beach area!
- the private beach area- there is WiFi, towels, and cold water. And the staff walked around and gave us all popsicles.
- the spacious bathroom in our room
- the phone charging speaker by our bed that we used to play music
- the homemade bracelets housekeeping left in our room (so cute!)"
625,Safety,50,June 2019,"I love the safety of this hotel, every time before u come in u need to pass by to their manual and machine security check. Good location 10 minutes walk to beach, they have a free shuttle going to beach. A lot of restaurant, spa and shop store nearby."
626,"COURTYARD, IM IN LOVE‚ù§Ô∏è",50,May 2019,"Can't say anything more but EVERYTHING is so pleasant!

Stayed here for 2 nights: for work and holiday after works are done.
The meeting room is spacious enough and facilitated well, meetings done smoothly, thanks to the very helpful staff! What I'm amazed about is the amenities/toiletries, they even provide face soap while from hotel(s) I've ever visited didn't, a good oneüòÑ

All staffs from securities and indoor one are very nice, though I'm used with the ""individuality"" living and working in Jakarta, they made me feel warm by just being greeted LOL why I'm so softüòÇ started from the very first time we arrived at the hotel!

They provide free ride to & from the beach nearby starts from around 3 or 4 PM until 5 PM (if im not mistaken). Location near many shops, restaurants & bars, the restaurant inside the hotel also very great. Loving all the dish & beverages with a very comfy place & view >.< love it so much!

Managed to swim at 7AM since it will be a bit crowded before afternoon comes. The pool bar is available but didn't manage to try it.

You don't need to think twice to stay here."
627,Great first family holiday!,50,June 2019,"My partner and I took out 16 month old there for his first overseas holiday!
Couldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel high enough for kids! The big grassed area was great for him to run around and the kids pool down the end was fantastic!
Hendra who worked by the pool was amazing, he looked after us everyday he was there and made sure our stay was perfect!! He was so friendly and would play with our son! We can‚Äôt wait to come back!!"
628,Returning guests,50,June 2019,"We had yet another fantastic stay at the Courtyard Marriott. Hence the reason we returned. The kids had a great time in the Kids club with Komang Dewi and Ayu. They are so welcoming, friendly and caring, my children aged 8 and 5 felt very comfortable with them.

Breakfast buffet was amazing again with a great variety. It was great to see familiar staff members from previous stays. Especially Widi, he is always so helpful and making sure we have everything we need. The kids love him and he makes them feel comfortable.
Thanks again for a great stay, we will be back."
629,BEST HOTEL IN BALI,50,May 2019,"What can I say a dream holiday staying at Bali best hotel. From the minute you arrive at the courtyard greeted by wonderful reception staff to the minute you leave you honestly are treated like your the only guest in the hotel.

The hotel has wonderful amenities the pool and pool bar are pristine and serviced by a great team at the pool area. Our room was cleaned daily, fresh towels supplied everyday and even twice daily if we needed. It was lovely coming home from dinner with a towel animal on the bed such lovely thoughts. The housekeeping staff were fabulous.

Priscilla and her reception team along with Grant Young were always there for any request it just to chat about our day. They followed up on numerous occasions to see if we needed anything or if they could help us with our stay. They went beyond normal guest service.

I had just been to Europe only six months prior and didn‚Äôt have the attention or service like courtyard provides anywhere in Europe.

I couldn‚Äôt recommend Courtyard Marriott Seminyak more highly for your next trip to Bali

See you all when I‚Äôm back in October."
630,Relaxing stay!,40,February 2019,"We stayed for 8 nights and had the best time here. The huge pool was the highlight, and I came back from my holiday feeling super refreshed after many days lounging around it.

The staff were exceptionally accomodating, organising airport pick up/drop off, taxis for day trips and providing recommendations on where to eat. The restaurant was great, both for breakfast buffet and a la carte at night. They even let me use the pool and gym bathrooms after checking out for no extra cost since we had a late evening flight.

Location is also really good, near to the main street with lots of restaurants.

One gripe was that the air-conditioning in the room was oddly regulated. It was way too strong and there was no way to turn down the breeze, only the temperature. I got a little bit of a headache coming in and out of the room because outside was so hot and humid, and when I woke up too since the aircon was blowing on my head all night.

Only other downside was the massages and facials, I don't feel they are worth the money. The oils smell a bit strange and I had a rash for a few days after, and this is the only reason I can think.

Overall, this was a great hotel! I highly recommend it for a relaxing escape."
631,Perhaps more a family vibe.,30,June 2019,"We thought the hotel was great - the rooms were excellent. They were clean and relatively spacious. The hotel felt like it may have been more suited to a family situation. There were lots of children, which the hotel catered for very well. If you are after a hotel that is quiet and relaxing - there are probably other places more suited. But if you are travelling with kids - it‚Äôs probably perfect! The brekky was busy! But certainly catered for everyone."
632,Great Option in Seminyak for a Great Price,40,June 2019,"Went here for a couples' getaway in June 2019. The hotel is really attractive! The huge open pool area in the center of the hotel creates a ton of light and air, and gave us a great impression from the moment we entered. The breakfast options are plentiful and tasty (great juice bar!!!), rooms were light and clean, the gym is adequate, and the spa (Zenti) is superb (Ita & Nadia were outstanding therapist/masseuses (we got the Stress Release and Zanti Signature massages). The location is a bit loud, but it's a great location close to bars, restaurants, and the beach. Fortitude/Crossfit Petitenget was a 20 minute walk away. My one (small) quibble is that the doors closed extremely loudly. I was embarrassed and worried I'd woken up my whole floor when I left for the gym in the morning.

Recommended for couples and families who want a bit of luxury at a really reasonable price."
633,Just a stylish hotel,30,June 2019,"Good location if you like walking around.. coz the traffic bad between 2-7 pm in this area. Small room compare to it‚Äôs price. Nice freshy pool but the water a bit cool.
Breakfast were good, love the juices and the crispy bacon."
634,Great hotel stay,40,May 2019,"Very enjoyable stay in this hotel, not far from the beach and the shops. Hotel service was very warm and friendly. Really enjoyed the gym and 2 swimming pools. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel provides a small shuttle service via golf cart to the shops or beach, which we found helpful."
635,Family Holiday,50,June 2019,"We have just returned from our first family holiday where we spent our time at Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort. I highly recommend this hotel, very family friendly, great kids club, my 4 and 7 year old had a great time. Staff were very friendly food was yummy. We got to spend quality time together as a family. We will definitely go back."
636,Great stay,50,June 2019,"Stayed with family and kids. Great time had by all. Kids club and pool are great. Pool bar is great for adults üçπ
Seminyak kitchen has a great breakfast buffet.üçΩ
Chinta and concierge helped with anything I needed to organise.üëçüèº
Close to beach.üå¥
Close to sports bar üçª"
637,Very enjoyable stay,50,June 2019,"7 night stay for us and our son and partner which we booked via an Asia escapes deal. Lovely hotel, very modern spacious clean rooms, ours overlooking pool area. Great pool bar. Amazing breakfasts! Service from ALL staff exceptional. Loved the towel animals in our room! Beautiful spa experience with an included 6o min massage. Also made the most of nightly included free flow cocktails from 4 to 5 (part of our Asia escapes deal). Great location with plenty shops and restaurants nearby and easy walk to beach for sunset. Highly recommend."
638,Most definitely not your average 'Marriott Courtyard',50,June 2019,"Amazing stay at the Hotel and a tribute to John Woolley the GM, and his team, who appears to have created his own atmospheric fusion of Asia, Europe and the Caribbean combined.

It would be little unfair to pick out individuals among the staff because everybody - and I do mean everybody - had a smile on their face, a pleasant greeting and a kind word or deed from arriving at the hotel on the Saturday evening to checking out on the Wednesday night - from the bell hops, to security, to the the front desk, the guys at the Pool Bar/Restaurant, etc. but a special mention must go to Priscilla who just seemed to be everywhere and couldn't have been more helpful, to the girls in the Spa notably Hari, and to Widi, too, in the Seminyak Restaurant who's enthusiasm and smile lit up a couple of meals there !

With the subject of food very dear to my heart too, a final mention must go to the Chefs too for the variety and quality of the food served up daily that again subtly embraced the fusion of local cuisine with European and Caribbean influences - outstanding !

Truly a pleasure to stay."
639,Nice and relaxing,50,June 2019,"Clean rooms and good for couples. Had a getaway with my Boyfriend and he booked this hotel since he had stayed here during his last visit. That little balcony was nice for chilling. The checks at the hotel lobby made us feel safe. And it‚Äôs near the beach with about 10mins walking distance or less. Food and shops were near and easily accessible. The only downside was probably because the room was near the stairs. So when other tourists were passing by, we could hear them pretty well. It was overall a very nice experience and the Balinese were really friendly!"
640,"Rooms, location, pools, staff...PERFECT!",50,April 2019,"The pool and hotel grounds were immaculate. Great happy hour offerings at the swim up bar, and the on-site restaurant was very tasty as well. Within our week there they had live entertainment options at pool, restaurant and at night on the front lawn. They were offering an activity every day, either for kids, or families. All the staff members, even security, were beyond helpful. We found the location to be perfect as it sits off the main road just a few minuets from a beach so it was always quiet. Easy walking distance to clubs, plenty of GREAT restaurants and shops offering clothing, art, and duty free items. There is also a convenience store just outside. They also have booking options for touring and travel."
641,Good place to chill,50,June 2019,Excellent stay. The cart drops you off at the beach. Chill watching the waves in the Indian Ocean and walk 10mins back to hotel. Eka and Dania were so helpful in making reservations and ensuring we knew exactly where we were going and helped with Grabs. They are planning gurus. The property is gorgeous and our room was small but lovely. I love the natural light in the shower. It gives a showering outdoor vibe. The cheese tray as an elite member arrival gift from John looked so delicious I wish I had a bottle of wine to go with it. Sunrise yoga on the roof was a special treat.
642,Nice hotel but noisy rooms,30,June 2019,"Currently in the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak, it is a lovely hotel with extremely helpful and friendly staff. The food at breakfast is nice and the food selection at the pool bar is great. We have a pool access room which would be nicer if it wasn‚Äôt right by the children‚Äôs pool which is extremely noisy and there seems to be very little soundproofing in the room. The room itself is nice by with a baby there is limited space as the desk in the room cannot be moved and although the bathroom is spacious the aircon doesn‚Äôt go in in it so you cannot move the cot in there for more space. Also if you head out to the pool through your pool access room you can‚Äôt lock it. The only way is to lock your patio doors from the inside and walk round which defeats the purpose.
The pool is lovely but cold as they don‚Äôt have a heating system and only half of the pool gets the sun through the day so 50% of the sunbeds are shaded all day. We are going to try sitting up at the pool bar with as is seems to be the warmest part of the pool.
The entertainment put on by the hotel is nice and the location is great but due to the small issues I‚Äôm unsure we would stay here again."
643,Good service and super clean,40,June 2019,"It was a great experience for our first time in Seminyak. Lovely staff great service and super clean room. Breakfast was amazing. Location wise was good as well. Walking distance to shops an good bars and restaurants. The only inconvenience is that you have to buy credit when you check in for food and drinks, otherwise you have to pay when you buy. Normally you can buy under you room number and pay in check out which in this hotel is not possible. We really enjoy our time in the hotel."
644,Excellent hospitality by the Marriott team,50,June 2019,"After a not so good experience with Marriott in Chennai, India. It took some courage to try again. We were looking for a venue to host our annual APAC partners‚Äô event and my team shortlisted Marriott Bali. My team feedback the concerns to the Marriott Bali event team and to our surprise, the GM of Marriot Bali called my Marcom and assure her that everything will be in place. Convinced by the sincerity of the hotel, I decided to give it another try. I am glad that we did.
The hotel was very accommodative in numerous requests. Examples last minute requests for extra use of the function room for last minute business discussion, arranging of chairs and table for our group photoshoot in the garden and the kind gesture from the GM to waive a couple of rooms for late check out till 6pm. Just to name a few actions that the hotel did out of normal to make our entire stay memorable. Our gala dinner by the lawn area was beautiful.
The room was spacious. The only feedback that I probably had was my room at level 2. There is no lift access so the only way up there is via a few steps of stairs. Not a big deal for me but I can imagine if you were carrying lot of luggage, it may pose some issue. Breakfast spread was nice and the outdoor seating was good. The pools were beautiful with lots of sun beds and bean bags around for your to laze around. There is also a bar by the pool.
Definitely a place to consider again in my next trip to Bali."
645,Amazing hotel and friendly helpful staff,50,March 2019,"This Hotel is very welcoming, clean and friendly
The rooms are spacious and clean
Breakfast buffet is so tasty with so much variety to choose from
Kids friendly too
Thank you so much
Will definitely be back"
646,Clean & value for $$,50,May 2019,"The hotel location is convenient, near to eating place, spa & shops. Easy walk to double six beach. The room is in good size and clean. For the price you pay, this is a highly recommended hotel. We will come back again for the stay."
647,Best weeks holiday,50,May 2019,"Trip was a 50th Birthday for myself arranged by my husband from the time we got there to the time we left it was exceptional when we go to check in and are asked would you like a complimentary iced tea or Bintang your know things are going to be good all of the staff were so welcoming from the breakfast, bar, massages, pool area everywhere was clean and tidy and the vouchers given for cocktails, the food truck, restaurant and the massage. I can not thank you all enough for the special day I was given on my 50th finding a towel animal made on the bed after cleaning, which was always spotless, the happy birthday cake left in the room and having happy birthday sung to you by lovely people one playing the guitar. This trip was a wonderful experience and no faults can be found."
648,Loved it here,50,May 2019,"Clean, comfortable rooms. We booked the King poolside suite, I think there is only 4 of them but worth it. Easy access to the pool, bar and restaurant. Not noisy as I feared. The restaurants here are very good and the pool and bar food were also well above my expectations. Value for money, its excellent. Short walk to the beach or catch the golf cart if you want. Loads of bars and restaurants up the street outside. Not as busy or touristy as the main Seminyak area which we loved. Only $3 or less for a taxi to the main area if that's what you want. We tried a day at the beach but preferred the hotel pool."
649,Virgins to bali,50,May 2019,"This was our first visit to Bali , and everything we were told about is 80% myths , the hotel was exceptional , in everything , very friendly staff always happy to help , the bar pool team are your best friends in a couple of days of knowing you as are the whole staff . Breakfast was amazing , with the variety you‚Äôd expect from this kind of hotel , the a la carte restaurant has a great variety to cater for all people and beautifully cooked , we have eaten here often .
The bar food during the day has been well presented with a great variety ,Margherita pizza was a winner in the arvo ,with a G&T or cocktail by the pool .
The management and staff were only to happy to help with everything we asked for ,
In case your wondering (we‚Äôll be back ) If only for the happy hour"
650,What The Truck Just Happened???,40,May 2019,"...now that I got your attention. ""What The Truck"" was the name of a cool late night food spot adjacent to the Courtyard that my hubby and I enjoyed after a late evening check-in. We had chicken wraps and refreshing adult beverages that were tasty and reasonably priced. There was only two sitting spots (that we were able to grab) which allowed you to people watch and catch a nice evening breeze. Would certainly recommend.

Re: the hotel stay. Let me just say this...I did not expect to walk into a marbled-floor/counter ""Courtyard Marriott"". The staff was welcoming, the rooms were comfortable, the pool was great, and the location was even better. While I know it is not considered Semiyak's best hotel stay, I would certainly put it high up on the ""give it a try"" list. What sealed the deal was the all you can eat breakfast feast. Omelettes, juicing stations, indian food, pastries, just to name a few was on the menu during the morning breakfast. Did I say the value was certainly there??? Overall, great stay!"
651,"Nice hotel, good location, great service, nice staff",40,May 2019,"We stayed 4 days at this hotel. As a titanium member, the hotel were kind enough to upgrade us to a suite for free.

The room was spacious, clean and everything worked. We received complimentary Bali magnets which were a nice touch.

The breakfast was good, but I would have preferred more variety. The smoothie bar got quite busy and could do with more staff helping out to match the demand and keep the fridge stocked up with normal juice.

When requesting coffee at breakfast we found the service to be a bit slow on some days. We had to remind staff.

Similar problem at the pool bar. We visited for happy hour and it took nearly 30 mins to bring some simple cocktails and some fries.

Finally, we were out all day and upon returning we found that some other guests luggage had been placed in our room. It was promptly reunited with the owner once we notified reception (seems like it was missing for a while by the owners reaction - yes the porter brought these other guests to our room which I thought was a bit odd). Anyway, no harm done, although I would have expected the porter to think twice when placing luggage in a room and finding there is already luggage unpacked in there. However, the tags on this other luggage did have our room number so not necessarily his fault.

Overall, a great hotel in a great location and they treated us well. I would definitely stay here again if I was in town. They only lose a star due to the slow service and luggage thing."
652,Best place to stay in Seminyak,50,May 2019,"Words could not speak high enough for this Brilliant Hotel!
It has everything here that you need and the rooms are immaculate. The Seminyak Kitchen has the best food with a wide variety menu to choose from. The breakfast is just heaven and not to mention it has the friendliest staff on earth to name a few, Widi, Maria, Arja, Dwi, Juli, Yoga, Ayu, Darma and so many more! Chinta is also a great hostess when they hold a buffet menu of World dishes or traditional Balinese dinners.
The swimming pools are fantastic and the pool and bar tender/waiters are friendly with impeccable service. Thank you to Hendra, Kesawa, Narita, Angga, Andry, Alit and Sri for making our stay so fun and memorable.
It also has Zanti Retreat for Massages which we had and they were unbelievable and professional leaving us feeling great.
Honestly you could not look past this Hotel as it‚Äôs definitely the best place to stay and we will keep coming back."
653,Lovely stay at The Courtyard,50,March 2019,"Took a spontaneous decision to stay at this property. Being staff of Hyatt, we were very surprised by the level of service offered!!! It was impressive and competent. Kudos to the team, especially Calvin & Yani from the restaurant at level 3 & the pool bar team!"
654,What the Truck!!!,50,May 2019,"Best quick cheap lunch or snack ever, soft tacos, 2 for $50k.

Out the front of the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak.

Clean and good quality food!!!

Love the chicken and pork!!!

Also have great cocktails, love the What the Punch!!"
655,Amazing Stay,50,April 2019,"highly reccomend this hotel, we travelled in a large group for a family holiday. The staff were amazing, very accomodating and super friendly.
The pool staff went out of ther way each day to ensure that we were all well looked after with what ever we needed. Hendra from the pool bar is one of the most amazing staff i have ever dealt with in Bali. He was always so warm and friendly and nothing was to much trouble. He is an absolute asset to the hotel and anyone that stays there make sure you find him at the pool bar.
Breakfast food was so yummy with loads of varieties and the pool side menu to die for and very reasonably cheap"
656,Matt,50,May 2019,We are currently staying here. We cannot recommend highly enough. We indulged in the romantic rooftop dinner our host Dodi was very professional and made our Anniversary dinner one we won't forget. Extremely clean rooms and areas. The photos on the web don't do this place justice.Professional and courteous staff. We will definitely be coming back.
657,I had the most amazing stay here!,50,May 2019,"First of all the staff are amazing and there is spectacular service! The hotel is so clean and they clean your room every day! I loved staying at courtyard by Marriott and you definetly don‚Äôt want to leave cause you are just so relaxed and having the time of your life! I could not speak more highly of the staff and the rooms! I would definetly not even consider looking at staying at other hotels and it is a massive credit to them for making the hotel so amazing! A few of the staff that were incredible were, Widi, Maria, Yoga, Arga, Hendra, Juli, Dwi, Ayu and many many more!"
658,Close to beach and shops,30,May 2019,"Stayed here while attending a wedding. Location is good. Away from the hectic bar scene.
Rooms are clean and the pool has bar.
Only thing that put me off was the number of people smoking in the bar area while people were eating..
As a non smoker, that would put me off going back."
659,"Excellent stay, good location",50,May 2019,"Well appointed rooms Comfortable stay. Professional service. Courteous staff. Close to beach. Located in the midst of shopping and restaurants. Value for money.
Property is however rather small with limited common area."
660,Best hotel in seminyak,50,May 2019,"We have stayed at the courtyard 3 times now. We just love it! The location is great, just a short distance to the beach, just 5 minutes walking. Or you can take the free shuttle. The breakfast is amazing with a lot of variety to choose from. The stuff is very nice and friendly. Especially Arina and Darma. We met Arini when we stayed there the first time, always so helpful and polite, and she remembered us when we came back. The gm
Must be proud of his staff! We come back for sure !"
661,Wahyu,50,May 2019,We are only part way through our stay at this wonderful resort but I had to make a special mention of Wahyu. We did a free boot camp class with Wahyu today at 7am before the heat set in. We are both in our late fifties and early sixties and we're the only participants on this occasion. Wahyu was very respectful of our reduced fitness levels and capabilities and adjusted the class accordingly. Although the class was quite challenging we felt encouraged by Wahyus enthusiasm and professional guidance. We highly recommend his classes. Everything about this resort is first class. Well done to the staff and management.
662,Visiting for a Wedding,50,March 2019,"Great hotel! We got a complimentary drinks upon check in, and the staffs were really helpful and friendly. The breakfast was decent. The room is quite spacious for 2 person. Will definitely coming back to stay here."
663,Boxing Fit on Holiday - Thank you Wahyu!,50,May 2019,"I‚Äôm not really a fitness person but I didn‚Äôt want to put on too much weight on holiday (the hotel breakfast is 10/10!)
In the lobby I saw that they offered personal trainers for Boxing. My trainer (Wahyu) was absolutely fantastic! I had a lot of fun and it didn‚Äôt seem like I was working out at all. They have an awesome package and I did 5 classes over a week. The session is catered for your abilities and Wahyu is incredibly dedicated and pushes you each day to increase your fitness. Highly recommend if you want to remain fit whilst on holiday or just wanna eat guilt free on holiday like me!"
664,Boxing Fit class,50,May 2019,"I did the boxing Fit class sessions with WAHYU and he did a fantastic job of catering to my fitness needs and let me go at my own pace. If you're looking to try something different rather than your normal gym session. Contact WAHYU at Zanti and he can put you through your paces.

Thankyou again WAHYU I enjoyed every session 5*"
665,Visiting for a Wedding,50,May 2019,"Great Hotel - Pool Bar, Penny & Dodi made it very personal - room was always left clean with a lovely message each day - have as much popcorn & fairyfloss as you like included - the food truck was absolutely great value. Great Breakfast everyday."
666,Most Romantic Weekend Ever!!!!,50,May 2019,"This resort is truly 5 star, from the extremely helpful and friendly staff to the immaculate room and the most relaxing poolside ever !! They even organised a romantic couple rooftop dinner with a 8 course meal that was superb!!! And our waiter Dodi was so friendly and professional. This weekend I will never forget and always cherish. Thank you so much Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak."
667,A hive of activity,50,May 2019,"We loved this hotel from the moment we walked in.
The swim up bar was vibrant and made us feel like we wanted to jump in immediately.
The bedroom was large with a spacious well appointed bathroom. The shower was hot with good water pressure.
Security was at an all time high but it did make us feel like we were well protected.
The hotel staff were attentive, cheery and lovely.
Food at the poolside was great however they really need more lounges around the pool, its a little over crowded.
3 minutes from the beach and 7 minutes from the heart of seminyak makes this location really awesome"
668,Fantastic,40,May 2019,"Thi is our second stay at this hotel and we love it!! It is such great value for money. We got a deal when we booked that entitles us to two 60 minute massages, two course dinner for two and two tacos at the taco truck! Fabulous deal!
The taco truck out the front does delicious tacos at all times of the day. The massages in the spa were very relaxing and the quality was amazing!
Location is great and very easy to walk to the beach or catch a Bluebird anywhere."
669,Excellent property in great location,50,May 2019,"Modern resort, great staff, great food, great location close to beach at Double Six Street, great facilities.

673,Good position,40,April 2019,"Hotel, is very pleasant, with in walking distance to beach, or they will take you in golf cart to their private beach area.
Good selection at buffet breakfast.
Restaurant food was lovely with attentive staff.
Room we had was pool view, with good balcony.
Very clean.
The staff are good at managing Pool chairs as people , leave things and go off. 30min rule which is great, due to numbers.
Only let down was, porters didn't bring up our bags, waited 40ms. When we went down, they were just left in foyer near Concierge, but would not put us off from staying here again"
674,First timers to Bali,50,March 2019,"We had 3 days in Bali before boarding our cruise ship for an Asian Adventure. We had no idea what to expect and stayed at this resort because of a recommendation from friends.
It was really lovely. Very friendly staff and the room was beautiful. Great view of the pool and really very quiet. Used the gym every morning and it was very well equiped.
We were here for ""quiet day"" so we organised a package which included breakfast and dinners for that reason as on this festive day you cannot leave the resort.
The hotel put a few things on to keep guests occupied which was good as there was only a couple of channels working on the TV and on our occasion it was raining.
In a great spot close to shops, restaurants and convience stores.
I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone"
675,Beautiful resort,50,May 2019,"Fabulous holiday spent at the courtyard Marriott, staff are very friendly and service is brilliant. Chinta was especially friendly and helpful. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Breakfast was always lovely and we were spoilt for choice."

678,Courtyard Marriott,50,May 2019,"We have stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak many times and will continue to return. We booked our accommodation via the online booking website without any problems and also spoke to reservations regarding package inclusions and they were very helpful. When we arrived at the hotel our check in was very efficient and staff were very friendly and helpful. The front office manager - Ramu has always been very friendly and helpful and always goes above and beyond to ensure our holiday is the best it can be. We are very appreciative of his help and all the staff at the hotel. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Seminyak Kitchen is amazing and even with a great selection they are always happy to make a different dish if requested. Chef Bento was fantastic during a cooking class our family did, we thoroughly enjoyed it, thank you! We highly recommend the cooking class, even our 10 and 12 year old were involved and loved it. Thank you very much Courtyard Marriott, we had a fantastic stay!!!!"
679,"Great Family Hotel, Super location.",40,May 2019,"Best part of the hotel is the size of the Suite rooms. Nice large, clean, functional rooms especially for families. Great pool vibe though the poolside beds get full pretty soon in the morning. The kids pool is a bonus. Best part is the hotel, even though not on the beach, has a reserved spot with beach loungers bang on Double Six beach. Great location in the thick of all the beach action. Lots of restaurants, bars around to choose from. Loved the welcome drink which was a chilled Bintang beer!!"
680,"""Brilliant resort and beautiful facility with good staff""",50,May 2019,"The rooms were extremely clean with little to no issues.The facilities pool,spa,gym,kidsclub and Seminyak kitchen restaurant where all to a high standard. The breakfast option which was included in our package was excellent and catered to a variety of cultures.And the activities that were held by the resort were also quite enjoyable. The biggest highlight of the resort would be the friendly staff,who will always greet you with a great big smile, especially chinta from food and beverage sales were amazing and super accommodating,a good conversation and friendly tips to navigate your trip.we enjoy every moment"
681,Worth every cent!!,50,May 2019,"Absolutely loved this place, couldn't speak more highly of it. The staff would go above and beyond to help you, faculties were amazing, fantastic swim up bar and rooms spacious. Highly recommend and will definitely return!!"
682,@ Bali Great Stay with Committed Customer Service n Appreciation,50,May 2019,"4 day stay was indeed very good. Just the breakfast could be little better with an Indian chef would do wonders. Located in a crowded Seminyak area, however quite convenient from all fronts. Staff is well trained, they apologised for noise during dinner times and were poltite, although was not very impressed on their e-mailing before I went there. Their transportation costs are high. Good part is they have a portion allocated in a private beach area @ Bali close to the property where in you can get their buggy pick n drop to this beach called Seminyak beach.

Over and all a good property , hope same standards are maintained in future"
683,Delightful Stay as Always,50,May 2019,"It is always a real pleasure to stay at The Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak. Lovely property and staffs are all accommodating and attentive. Priscilla, Cica, Eka and Pak Ketut are genuinely friendly. Agus and Wahyu from Recreation Team are very professional and enjoyed their Yoga and Bootcamp classes. F&B and Culinary teams of Seminyak Kitchen serve great variety of food. Calvin, Perbi, Mita and Chanti are always helpful. Penny and Mob from Pool Bar are very attentive. Most importantly, the Housekeeping Team who provided a spotlessly clean room for us and beautiful decors and souvenirs - Weda, Rich (Rig) and Apriana. Overall, it‚Äôs yet again a memorable stay!"
684,Amazing romantic dinner at rooftop,50,May 2019,Had a great meal on the roof top with my partner very romantic ambience. Highly recommended. Chinta was especially helpful all night when I we were there. Give that girl a promotion. Thank u so much üôèüôè

686,"Best time, great staff üç∏üçªüòò",50,May 2019,"We visited friends at the Marriott Courtyard. Hendra‚Äôs team : Mob, Dede, Penny, Arca, & Widya at the pool bar were so fantastic, attentive and so friendly. Great place to relax, in & out of the pool. Drinks & food was excellent üòä Thanks guys for making our visit so much fun. üòò
Highly recommend visiting the bar."
687,Greatest bar staff ever,50,May 2019,"Had the most wonderful time at this bar, great bar staff, good food and delicious drinks. Hendra and his team Narita, Widya, Dedi, Mob were especially accommodating, always with a smile. Amazing service and care for their customers."
688,Exceeded expectations,50,May 2019,"Wife and I visited for 10 days while undergoing dental work in Bali. The hotel was very nice and exceeded our expectations. The food served was delicious and the day spa exceedingly good also. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Of special note to us Arja, Pina and Feby were very nice. Had a very good gym with modern cardio machines, weights and dumbells. The location is great also with plenty of nice bars and restaurants nearby also only a short walk from the beach. It's not cheap but you pay for what you get and what you get here is amongst the best. We will definitely be back!"
689,The resort overall.,50,September 2018,"My wife and i have been to this resort on a number of occasions, it has been a wonderful experience. Everything here has been amazing the service and the food along with all the attentive staff who are all happy and go out of there way to satisfy your needs. Finally i would like to compliment one of your staff members Chinta, this your lady is a wonderful asset for your company, the service she provides is absolutely brilliant. We will be returning to this resort again in the future."
690,Decent overnight stay,40,May 2019,"Arrived 1 am into Dps airport and needed some sleep before heading out towards Ubud the next day. The Courtyard is reasonably priced, good and responsive service from pre-arrival all the way to departure, my room on the top floor overlooking the pool was small but cheerful, Seminyak is a great place to stay for shopping /restaurants/beach etc especially for first time visitors, the welcome beer @ check in was a nice touch. I was just surprised to find that the mini bar/fridge was completely empty. Nor was there a kettle/tea bags. Otherwise this is a good choice for a first night in Bali before venturing elsewhere"
691,Awesome hotel,50,May 2019,"Amazing food and service, especially from Chinta from FB Sales! They were super accommodating to my dietary needs and even substituted something else for an item I didn‚Äôt like with no aggravation or fee! I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better food experience while staying at the Marriott. Don‚Äôt hesitate to try it when you stay here :) Good job Chinta,Thank you"
692,Excellent hotel with wonderful friendly management and staff,50,May 2019,"Great service overall - exceptional service at Seminyak Kitchen [main restaurants] - very friendly, professional service team. Great food selections at breakfast [all you can eat] and also great at dinner time. Thanks to GM, John; Operation Mgr., Grant; Restaurant mgrs.: Kadek, Anka and Ayu, Edo and the rest of the wonderful friendly team members."
693,Perfection,50,May 2019,"Highly recommend this hotel is amazing
Staff is excellent
Service is high standard
Sri looked after us amazingly around the pool.
Great location
Breakfast has such a great variety
Definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed"
694,Excellent Staff!,50,May 2019,"We stayed at Marriott for just 1 night in Seminyak prior to moving to Ubud. And yet we had an excellent stay, we even contemplated on extending had we not already booked activities in Ubud beforehand.

We have mentioned upon check-in that my friends and I are celebrating ur birthdays together for the trip. Eka had left us a surprise gift in the evening! The staff in the hotel is beyond amazing with their attentiveness and high level of hospitality.

Keep up the great work, team! We look forward to staying back at your property soon. üôÇ"
695,Amazing Hotel!! Highly recommended!!,50,May 2019,"This is my third stay at this hotel and it just keeps impressing me every time. The family room was spacious and great with 2 kids, very clean, comfortable and nice ammenities. The pool area is great, kids pool perfect next to kids club and lots of pool chairs, pool menu is great and cheap. Breakfast had a lot of options. The location is so convenient for going out to dinner in Seminyak without the hassle of a long taxi ride. Will go back for sure! Highly recommended!"
696,Amazing Resort,50,May 2019,"Spent 7 nights at Courtyard, like being in heaven. Staff are fantastic always smiling. Rooms are great, comfortable the pool bar is amazing. Specials thanks to poll bar staff Hendra, Pina, Sri, Apca and Widya for looking after us and making amazing cocktails."
697,Family holiday,40,April 2019,This is hotel is very clean and the staff are willing to help with any request. The buffet Breakfast is possibly one of the best for variety and quality that I have come across. It is difficult to get a chair around the pool unless you get there early and most chairs are in the shade. There is a security that you need to go through every time you enter the hotel. Bag to be scanned and walk through security (like an airport). A bit annoying I thought but if you‚Äôre concerned about safety then hotel is definitely very secure. Hotel itself is very modern. It doesn‚Äôt have a traditional Bali feel. Music played around the swim up bar with cocktails around $12 and beer around $5. Food reasonably priced for around the pool and room service.
698,Excellent stay and disability consideration,50,April 2019,"Having MS I was a bit concerned on how I would manage, I provided a headsup to John Woolley. On our family arrival they had provided rooms nearer the lift to make things easier.
Thank you John for your understanding.

Everything went fine for the week's stay. John has an excellent team and special appreciation of good service and conversations with Grant, Bobby and Chinta.
Would recommend to friends or family who want to visit Bali."
699,Fantastic hotel,50,May 2019,"Our stay at the Marriott courtyard was amazing.
Breakfast was 10/10 with good coffee.
Chinta one of the staff was excellent in helping out with all our needs.everthing good for breakfast,lunch and dinner.."
700,Fantastic Hotel,50,May 2019,"We have visited 3 previous times and the service the staff the food the degastastion meal was absolutely amazing. It was so romantic. The staff especially chinta, pina, and Grant the manager have been so hospitable. We highly recommend you stay here you will not be disappointed and you will definitely start to plan your next visit like we have."
701,friendly,50,September 2018,"Staff are friendly and polite. I love the variety of activities they have had each day. Breakfast and dinner at Seminyak kitchen is good. Great location in Seminyak, short distance to the beach or you can take a buggy service. Will definitely go back again"
702,Amazing staff,50,May 2019,"The staff make this hotel a brilliant place to stay! From housekeeping to the restaurant waiters everyone is friendly and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.

The breakfast is one of the best hotel buffets I‚Äôve had with a range from local foods to a smoothie/fresh juice station and an omelette station.

It‚Äôs a five minute walk from the beach and nice shops and cafes and has a great pool and gym"
703,Excellent place to stay!,50,April 2019,"Stayed here for two weeks, all of the staff were very friendly, accomodating and always greeted with a smile, the room was clean and tidy and the hotel is just 10 min to the beach. Dedhe and his staff at the pool were great and easy to get along with. Also thanks to Intan and Iyu for keeping the rooms spotless every day. the food here is great so I would recommend this hotel to all types of travellers!"
704,Amazing hotel,50,May 2019,"Their buffet is highly so recommended and credit to all the staff especially Chinta,saih,Arista,feby,arja,dodi thank you for your great service and always smilling to us‚ù§Ô∏èvery nice setting in the garden,the breakfast,lunch and dinner is amazing.I can highly recommend it"
705,Great hotel,50,April 2019,"Stayed here for 7 nights and it was a fabulous stay. Great location - market store across the street to buy water, etc. 10 min walk to the public beach. We had a private airport transfer organised and it took about 30mins (but we arrived on a Sunday when the traffic wasn't too bad). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. Ate at Seminyak Kitchen for breakfast and dinner and the food was fantastic. Ate at What the Truck too which was very tasty. Pools are nice. Hotel has a golf cart to take you to their private beach area or Eat Street, etc."
706,Best Buffet Breakfast Ever!,50,March 2019,Went here with friends for a few nights. Has a great atmosphere! Very clean and tidy rooms! Friendly staff! Great housekeeping! Awesome buffet! Close to the beach. Has two massive pools and a pool bar! The staff were excellent with organising our transport and organising scooters for us. We'll be back in the future for that buffet breakfast!
707,Awesome stay and heaps of fun!,50,April 2019,"Stayed at the vacation club section of the resort and it was fantastic. The grounds, room and facilities were top notch. The lazy river and pool a big hit for the kids. The kids club was also well managed and entertained the k8ds. Highly recommended for the travelling family."
708,Great hotel,50,April 2019,"Stayed here for my first night in Bali - was a great hotel and would have happily stayed here for much longer. Checkin process was really smooth and quick. Room was modern and clean. Staff were really friendly. Their spa is highly rated so recommend booking in advance as they had no slots left when I enquired. Breakfast was brilliant as well! I didn‚Äôt use the pool, but shuttle to the hotel was really handy in the heat."
709,Super property in Seminyak,50,April 2019,"Our family of 4 including 2 teenagers stayed 6 nights from the 23rd to the 29th April at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort. After reviewing many hotels in the Seminyak area we finally zeroed in on the Courtyard as per our budget, location etc & what a brilliant choice it was. Right from the Balinese hospitality to the location of the property to the cleanliness of the hotel to the awesome breakfast & huge clean swimming pool everything was perfect.

The Courtyard is not on the beach but a nice 5 min walk to the Seminyak beach. It‚Äôs teamwork which is making Courtyard work. A special mention of Ramu - front desk Manager & the staff who cleaned our room had cute gifts almost everyday to make our stay that much more special. I would definitely recommend The Courtyard to people travelling to Bali, which we used as a hub to travel all over. Would most certainly stay at the hotel again."
710,Great hotel,40,April 2019,"We stayed for 3 nights at the end of our Bali trip. It‚Äôs a great 4star standard. The staff are genuinely helpful and friendly, especially the concierge- they have a free golf buggy that takes you to some designated spots however if they aren‚Äôt busy they will take you close by if needed which they did when we wanted to get laundry done. Santi at check-in was great ! She is such an asset to the hotel.
* very thorough hotel security
* awesome pool area and swim up bar
* nice poolside meals & cocktails, free popcorn and fairy floss at reception which is exciting for kids
* very clean & comfy rooms. True king size bed. The cleaning staff are fantastic. I wish I kept the names of our ones but they did a few special things with our room that was appreciated. (Room #605)
* 10 min walk to beach area. Also the block that the hotel is on has shopping markets, grocery store, spas and a few laundry which only charged $2 kg. It‚Äôs not in the heart of Seminyak eating & shopping but only $3 taxi ride away or the golf buggy. We preferred the quieter location.
*it took us a while to figure out but if you walk around the block after turning right there are a few little cafes for breakfast & coffee near Wacko burger
* we tried the hotel buffet breakfast once but we were not impressed, it was too busy, there is a lot of variety but it lacks quality and they charge full price for kids.
* the hotel spa looked great but I discovered it too late - I wish it was highlighted at check in as I regret not using it.
* this hotel is also VERY Very popular with Aussie tourists !

The hotel also is very generous if you have a late flight out by allowing guests to stay at the pool and have a shower at the gym before heading to airport. This was very kind and helpful for us and I‚Äôm sure many other travellers."
711,Great stay and value!,40,April 2019,"The rooms are excellent. So is the location of Seminyak which is right in the heart of the tourist area, near Petitenget, Legian and Kuta, but quieter. Area has good shopping and plenty of good restaurants serving a variety of countries' cuisines. Hotel staff are friendly and very helpful. Hotel food is good with a mostly Western breakfast and while we were there, an Indonesian street food dinner which had very good roast chicken and barbecue sticks (satay). My only complaint is their provision of bath amenities; the shampoo and conditioner could have been better as they were a bit harsh on the scalp."
712,enjoyable stay,40,March 2019,"stayed for 3 nights, really enjoyable and relaxing, apart from a few minor things everything else was good.
pros:
great pool and swim up bar,
good cocktails,
-very clean rooms, modern and comfortable,
-breakfast has a wide range and is fresh,
-staff are friendly and helpful for the most part,
-great location, minutes walk to the beach and a short distance to bars, restaurants and shops,
-wifi worked good most of the time,
-keep in mind that this is a hotel, meaning not much greenery or a garden
-a little food truck is at the entrance where you can buy coffee, food and drinks from

Cons:
-Reception staff at the time of our check in dismissed our request that we had also mentioned while booking online, had requested a surprise for a friend in the room which we offered to be billed for as well. My general experience with this chain previously was very positive when it came to guest special requests and hence we booked there.
-Missing a couple of room amenities.

overall location is very central and great, swim up bar and pool are clean and good size."
713,Would definitely stay again,50,March 2019,"My partner and I stayed here for 6 nights for a babymoon. We were very happy with the resort and spent a lot of our time using the wide range of facilities available to guests.
Staff were very relaxed and friendly with no request too much trouble.
We ate at the onsite restaurant a lot because we were really wanting to be cautious with food. The food is really good quality with staff often bringing around specials the chef had made and delicious garlic butter bread rolls.
We had breakfast included which was well worth it, it's an amazing spread!

The room was really comfortable and made up daily with little gifts left by the room attendants each day.

We would definitely come back to stay here again when we are a family of 3! Well done to all the team for making this such a great experience for guests."
714,Another great stay !,50,March 2019,"With friendly staff who went above and beyond to make our anniversary stay a special one this is a great hotel.
Clean rooms
Good location
Great food @ drinks
Large pool area
Breakfast is huge, great variety !

We will be back"
715,One of the best Marriott properties I have ever been to.,50,April 2019,"I am extremely happy with my stay at Courtyard Seminyak. In particular, the hotel's staff and management are one of the best I have come across staying at Marriott (I am a lifetime plat). Hotel's management (Grant in particular) has done an amazing job training and managing staff--they genuinely take care of customers' need. All Marriott properties should learn from this property.

I will be back next time I go back to Bali. Also, for those who stay at the hotel, personal training with Wahyu is a must! He is an excellent trainer."
716,Chill Location with Good Breakfast,50,April 2019,"This is a really relaxed place to stay and the food is good, which means you can sleep in a little and enjoy a great breakfast. I liked taking the shuttle buggy to the beach every day so that i could spend my time outside."
717,the quintessence of definition of a good hotel,50,April 2019,"As a professional manager, I salute to the manager of this hotel and his great team! The hotel is simply fantastic in every way. Me and my wife are enchanted by the entire 4-day stay. 90 years of Marriott experience combined with commitment and hard work put into the management of Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort bring effect - we have never felt so good in any hotel, even in much more expensive. The entire facility is superbly designed and thought out in every detail. It is super comfortable and customer-friendly. The staff are incredibly polite and very well trained - reception, restaurant, house keeping, kids club. I have never come across such a professional team anywhere in my life at every level of hotel management. You can see that the management staff is professional, clearly presents their expectations to the staff, the goals are clear, measurable and real, and the employees know what they are valued for and well rewarded for. The food in the restaurant is outstanding, as in 1 Michelin Star restaurant. The prices of food and wine in relation to quality are very affordable. Comfortable and large swimming pool. A private beach with towels and water is very close and takes you there with a comfortable electric car. The breakfasts are wonderful and the best I have seen in my life. The quality of food is fantastic, everything is natural and solidly made. Waiters in the restaurant could work in Melbourne or New York, especially WIDI and ARJA. Every matter in the hotel is handled in favor of the client - even when I was wrong. Students of the best business universities should learn from this hotel how management should look at HORECA. We got nice vouchers for meals and massages, and daily house keeping gave a small gift for the child. The highest quality of facility security. Everything in the hotel and room is functional and works great, for example, an electronic system for calling the pool service.
The whole hotel is VERY, VERY clean - like a hospital.
Hotel transport to airport - very good and clean cars, cheap."
718,Excellent Hotel,50,April 2019,Absolutely loved everything about the hotel. Super good vibes at the pool. Excellent food all around. Good cocktails. Very safe esp good for families. Also for solo travelling. Location not within walking from late nightclubs so you‚Äôll need a taxi but it‚Äôs cheap. (There is only one main night club in Seminyak) Great buzz in hotel. Nice gym. Overall great place to chill out and enjoy üòä
719,Paradise Bliss,50,April 2019,"Our family of four spent 8 beautiful nights at this wonderful property. We were all very impressed with the resort and our room. In particular the buffet breakfast was one of the best we had experienced. The level of service across all areas was first class in particular Grant & Bobby, who both made our stay even better always making themseleves available to assist with any request."
720,Amazing placeüíï,50,April 2019,"Gorgeous resort feel and wonderful breakfast! Friendly and relaxed place to be.
Clean modern and great position,Chinta beautiful person and very friendly staffüíïüíïThank you so much..Nice breakfast,lunch and American BBQ very good Quality and Especially Chinta we love love and love Chintaüíïüíïthanks for looking after us and being so accomodating..."
721,Ultimate hotel !!,50,April 2019,"Me and my boyfriends second time staying here. We love it. Specifically, we love the way this place has a good mix of a fun and relaxing atmosphere. It‚Äôs not too boring but also not too loud where you cannot relax.
Most importantly , we LOVE LOVE LOVE the service, Hendra‚Äôs team down by the pool are so accommodating and friendly. It honestly feels like home here. And I cannot forget to mention penny behind the bar. She is absolutely gorgeous and we look forward to seeing her !!!
The drinks and food are also amazing. Can not fault this place. I highly highly !!! Recommend !!!!
For families and for couples, the perfect hotel."
722,Superb Seminyak Location,50,April 2019,"I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort earlier this month as a simple one-night stopover, but truly wished I could have stayed longer. After arriving on a late flight, to wake up and view the gorgeous pool from your room was mesmerising. I only wish I had taken note of their early morning rooftop yoga as I would have jumped at that. They have a late check out of 12noon, so I had plenty of time to saunter down for deliecious and fresh late breakfast at the in-house Seminyak Kitchen and day restaurant serving up a great mix of local and international food & beverages including freshly blended and cold-pressed juices. The gym looked well appointed and the swim up pool bar was a joy. I'll be sure to stop by for a longer stay next time I visit Bali in the Seminyak area."
723,Personal Trainer,50,April 2019,"Relaxing time at the Courtyard Marriot for the family. My partner & I bought a fitness package at the Spa to ensure we were not completely lazy. Thank you Wahyu for our training sessions. It was lots of fun and I feel stronger and fitter.
Jeremy"
724,Family holiday,50,April 2019,"Fantastic resort could not fault. The poolside waitress Sri was amazing as we had a small child and didn‚Äôt leave the resort much, she attended to us so well and made sure if we needed anything. Thanks"
725,Great family hotel and kids club!,50,April 2019,"Just spent a lovely 6 days here. Excellent staff and service throughout the hotel - nothing was too much trouble. The pool was true to it's pictures with plenty of space and different areas for all ages. The fairy floss and popcorn machine were a big hit with our children as was the kids club - they kept asking to go! Komang, Ayu and Candra in kids club were lots of fun and we booked them as babysitters for a couple of grown up nights out!"
726,Holiday,50,April 2019,"An outstanding hotel in all respects. Efficient, friendly, nothing too much trouble and the food very good. A well maintained and super building with security paramount. Excellent! Espesially prisilia,Chinta,ebiet,sri thank you so much"
727,Mrs,50,April 2019,"Our last day of a 10 day stay at the Marriott courtyard Bali
What a great experience... hotel staff friendly obliging and NOTHING was too difficult for them to make us feel comfortable and ‚Äúat home .‚Äù Chef Edo , Chef Donald and Dodik were amazing and so eager to share their beautiful Indonesian recipes. Aryn was prompt with coffee each morning. Well done guys. A great stayüòÄ"
728,Amazing Food by Chef Panda!!,50,April 2019,"We enjoyed a relaxing evening by the Pool Bar and ordered the Samosa Curry Puff, Chicken LTA, and Mighty Mo burger (Chef Panda's specialty). The food was AMAZING, and Chef Panda even came out to greet us. Beautiful ambiance, great food, and a wonderful night out. Thank you Chef Panda and manager Ebit!!"
729,Holiday,50,April 2019,"The food is good
The manager mr ebit so kind
And the chef panda his really giid chef i like him...
The pool also nice..
Thank you courtyard hotel seminyak bali we got so much fun from here..
Always success for all of you"
730,first time visit,40,April 2019,"First time visit to this hotel at Seminyak in Bali Island. Nice and relaxing place with a large pool in its middle for relaxing after a hot day out in the street, on the beach or under the sun.
The medium size room is all set and complete for a comfortable stay. Enjoy the friendly atmosphere."
731,Perfect for a relaxing holiday,50,April 2019,"Family friendly well located property, great food and great happy staff make the world of difference..
Excellent buffet breakfast with Western and Asian choices - special mention to Maria, Geta and Vany who were such great ambassadors for the hotel..super professional and always great ensuring good service.
The rooms were a great size and recommend pool view would recommend a USB charger port somewhere in the room as many now require. Rudi from house keeping was also another staff members who stood out went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect ..
We booked the indulgence package and highly recommend definitely felt it was great value with massage, lunch, dinner and cocktails included..
Easy to stay at the hotel and just relax or venture out as great location to eat street and the beach.
Thanks so much for a great stay.."
732,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,April 2019,"Friendly staff, great atmosphere, welcoming personal, always smiling sending positive vibes to all the residents.

The best experience ever, for sure i will come back again.

All at your assistance with a full smile."
733,Superb experience,50,April 2019,"I stayed here for 2 nights. Hotel is modern and comfortable, staffs are all helpful and gentle. Pool is great and there is a pool side bar for you to enjoy drinking while swimming. Location is wonderful, easy to find and every driver knows where it is.
Heard that the spa is good also but it was full when I want to try. Next time will certainly book it beforehand."
734,I am permanently stuck in the pool bar,50,April 2019,"Room is fantastic and the service is amazing - spent full days at the pool bar getting the best drinks with Hendra and his team - Arca, Gusdek, Penny and Dede! Thanks guys!

Room service was also amazing"
735,I never want to leave,50,April 2019,"Honestly I could‚Äôve stayed in this resort for my whole holiday! The pool bar is amazing and the staff are so friendly!! We spent basically the whole first half of our time here sitting at this bar drinking and eating, and I would 10/10 recommend!
Strawberry dacquiris are incredible!!!"
736,An amazing hotel in the heart of Bali,50,April 2019,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Courtyard Marriott, from the warm welcome to the amazing rooms. All the staff were so friendly and always had a smile on their face. The pool area was amazing and very family friendly (although we didn't have kids there lots of our friends did!) The food was amazing and it was hard to leave the hotel as it was so inviting to stay! Thank you for such a great stay, we will be back!"
737,Good vibe,50,April 2019,"It‚Äôs our fifth stay here..we love to stay in this hotel,all the staff are very friendly especially the staff who cleaned our room rudi,cintya,and Satria. They‚Äôre so lovely. Made animal towel for us. Superb!! Will definitely come back to this lovely hotel"
738,Top Hotel,50,April 2019,"We had a great stay here made all the better by the wonderful staff ,everyone took the time to chat and it was always with a smile amazing how many remembered my name I loved being Mr David .The room cleaning was very impressive and we loved the gifts and the towel animals they left for us .The breakfast was excellent so much choice and the food in the evening was as good put this with the great chefs and super friendly staff can't be beat . We used the buggy for the beach and found the concierge staff friendly and informative they too were also smiling .
It's not fair to pick out one staff member when all were excellent but a big thanks to Eke always found time to chat with her lovely smile .
Our only drawback with the hotel is the smoking policy we were very disappointed that there is a smoking area right in front of the entrance to the seminyak kitchen ,so going in and coming out was not very pleasant for us ,also around the pool people would get up and stand behind the beds to smoke we moved a few times due to this .
We would still highly recommend this hotel and will visit again if we come back to Bali ."
739,Home away from home with my extended Balinese family. (The Staff),50,April 2019,"Stayed there 23 days, the Security to the Resort is first class, may take you longer to gain entry but your safety is worth the delay.

The Staff from the Reception to the groundsman are the most friendliest and are there to help you enjoy your stay, nothing is a bother to them, just ask and you will receive. The restaurant is first class, the breakfast was included and there was everything there to please everybody, my favourite was the omelet with the lot, cooked to perfection with a smile and love. Thanks Vani, Maria, Gita, Arini, Indah, etc.

The Pool was very well policed for those people who try and reserve a pool chair whilst they go out on a tour, but the pool supervisor was right onto it, which helps when you see all the chairs taken and only 3 or 4 people in the pool.

The pool bar was just the place finish off the day before dinner, with Abit, Rudi, Hendra, Bottom, Narita, Sri, Kesawa, Wiki.etc. People think happy hour is cheap drinks but with these people it is happy hour all the time with their smile and conversation with the guests, they always find time to make the guests welcome.

""What the Truck"" Yoga makes the best Burritos, my mouth waters everytime I think about them, thanks Yoga.

The room was very spacious and the cleaning staff were the same as the rest of the staff nothing is a hassle for them, just ask and it will be done. Thank you Weda. The Laundry service was also first class.

The Concierge staff are very helpful, always friendly always ask if there is anything they can help you with. I made good use of the Trolley cart, going up the street or to the beach. Thanks Yogi and Rubi.

The location of the Resort is great with a large range of different types of restaurants within walking distance so you can sample Balinese food."
740,Everything You Need,50,April 2019,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for six nights, loved the pool, having a pool terrace room and the great service. The Concierge, Reception and Pool staff took such excellent care of us and made it so easy to have a great holiday with our 2yo. We also booked babysitters through the kids club and they were all excellent.

Because of the hectic nature of traveling with a toddler, our requests were usually pretty last minute for the things we needed. It was no trouble for the staff, they always met our needs which was deeply appreciated."
741,Amazingly brilliant,50,April 2019,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. Staff were amazing in every area. One bedroom suite was fantastic and our toddler loved the kids club. We will def be back.. esp for breakfast buffet. Lovely hotel
742,Best hospitality I've ever experienced,50,April 2019,"We arrived at the Courtyard Seminyak after our first accommodation turned out to be far from what we expected. I can't explain our relief when we arrived at this stunning oasis, and it all began with Ivan on the front desk, who was patient and kind with all of our questions and concerns.

The rooms and the hotel are beautiful, fresh, and bright. I highly recommend getting the breakfast deal with the room, because their breakfast buffet in Seminyak is next level with their amount of western and asian options. Divine! Plus, their dinner menu is delicious -- and I highly recommend getting involved in the American BBQ buffet on Saturday night. But more than anything, it's the staff that make this place so wonderful.

In Seminyak Kitchen, Hendra, Dodi, Widi, Calvin and Widi all played extremely important parts in giving us such an exceptional experience. They remembered our names, went the extra mile to make sure we had what we needed, made conversation, and, most importantly, were endlessly kind and positive.

Down by the pool bar, you experience another level of luxury in the way they provide service. Narita and Penny were especially notable; always down for a chat and welcoming. Narita remembered our order after just one interaction, and that attention to detail is indicative of the kind of staff they bring in to the hotel.

Couldn't recommend this hotel more, especially for people who are new to Bali and want something away from the fanfare -- I was travelling with my mother, and the Courtyard was perfect for her as she was experiencing a new culture for the first time.

I will say this, however: since it's a hotel chain and is family friendly, I struggled with the children at the pool. They were literally everywhere, and the hotel can't control badly mannered children, but perhaps there could be a pool that is child-free. Even where they have a great pool bar, you can't enjoy it without children splashing and screaming at you. So I suggest there be a pool area that's restricted to 18 and over.

Another suggestion would be more hooks in the bathroom -- there was only one double hook and one small towel rack, then one other towel rack on the balcony. Between our towels, our cozy hotel bathrobes and our swimsuits, it was hard to find places to hang our wet things.

Thanks for a memorable stay in Seminyak!"
743,Highly recommended,50,March 2019,"Awesome hotel and more importantly awesome service. The GM personally emailed me well ahead of my stay to ask if anything is required. My holiday was a trip with friends so I asked him to sort out connecting rooms and upgrades. He arranged an upgrade to a two bed suite and a connecting 3rd room with met my requirement perfectly. I decided to extend my stay there and even tho I could not get the cheaper rate on Marriott website anymore, the hotel extended my stay on the same rate I booked originally which was awesome.

The hotel location is also superb in Seminyak, the walk to Seminyak beach was less than 2 mins.

Hotel facilities and upkeep was great. Breakfast was awesome with a massive spread, lots of fresh juices and fruits and different cuisines.

I highly recommend this hotel for a single, family or friends holiday as well as business.

The team is superb and will make sure if you have any concerns these will be taken care of.

Thank you John and team for an awesome experience"
744,Mr & Mrs Borg,50,April 2019,"This place is amazing the rooms are very clean, great view and the stuff really are wonderful iv stayed here twice now and will definitely come back I also love the location of the resort also the food is very good you can't fault it"
745,"Great Hotel, Location & Staff",50,April 2019,"After researching as most do for a hotel on trip away. I booked the Marriott with package inclusions of transfers, pool view room, breakfast, massage, cocktail hour, set lunch & dinner inclusions was worth extra money.

Our room was immaculate, clean and fabulous views of the resort pool. Rain shower was Devine in bathroom. Bed comfortable

Zanti Spa is a must during your visit. I booked myself 3 times during my stay and enjoyed the pampering. The girls there are wonderful

I also used the gym facilities, to be honest I was surprised
There are 3 treadmills, 2 cross trainers, a bike, skipping rope, yoga mats, weights, dumbbells, medicine balls. Clean towels, cold water, a well equipped gym which did get busy at times.

The pool is great, there‚Äôs the pool bar section up top with bean bags along side, the adjoining pool below has deck chair either side.

Seminyak Kitchen for breakfast is a must. An amazing range of food western, Asian, Indian. So much variety to select from.

I really cannot fault much about this hotel and staff. The staff stop for a chat and are always so helpful and smiling. With such amazing quality of customer service I will definitely be returning back to this hotel and recommending it."
746,Best place to stay.....,50,February 2019,"Just back from our 3rd stay at The Courtyard, Seminyak. This hotel is absolutely fantastic, great location, staff are wonderful,spotless, amazing breakfast, rooms great, absolutely nothing to fault. I‚Äôve stayed in many great hotels and by far this has to be one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. The management and staff have got it spot on! Here‚Äôs a few points.....

Location great, 5 mins walk from beach, step outside hotel and restaurants, bars are within walking distance or free shuttle buggy can take to Eat Street, where there‚Äôs an array or places to eat. Restaurant and pool bar food great too so some nights we ate there. Happy hour at pool bar is fantastic, atmosphere great, cocktails, beers etc with swim up bar is fab. Live music starts early evening too which is a bonus. Sri, Widya and Hendra looked after us most days at the pool. They‚Äôre amazing and always happy! Surta at pool was great too, great fun, so helpful.

Amazing breakfast - everything you would ever want and more, choice is amazing and the fresh smoothie station is great. All the staff are fantastic but the ones that we chatted to everyday and looked after us were Widi and Maria. Always smiling and nothing was any trouble and always interested in our stories about home and what we were up to. Great start to our days.

Rooms are great, spotlessly clean, plenty of space. We stayed in pool terrace room which is great when u want to pop in from the pool but have previously stayed in the higher floors and both are lovely rooms but the convenience of being right at the pool is definitely worth booking and paying extra.

The hotel seems to have lots of return guests as we seen a few couples we had seen on a previous stay so that speaks volumes. Thank you Courtyard for an amazing stay and thank you John, Grant and Priscilla for once again looking after us. we can‚Äôt wait to come back. It‚Äôs well worth the long flight from UK!"
747,Amazing as always,50,April 2019,"This hotel is beyond amazing. The pool, the food, the staff and rooms are all amazing. Hendra, as always, went out of his way to make us feel welcome. This is the second time back and he was just as lovely then too. Housekeeping, Rai and Widi, were amazing and kept our room beauitful and made adorable towel animals. I will be back that is no doubt."
748,Best Hotel,50,April 2019,"We are a family of 4 and regular visitors to Bali.

Courtyard is extremely clean, the rooms are modern, the location is perfect!

But the best thing about the Courtyard is the staff, from the reception, to the pool bar staff, everyone is extremely polite and helpful.

Perfect example, Chanti recognized us from our previous visits she came over and said Hello to my wife, my wife battling a cold for the past 2 days wasn‚Äôt 100% Chanti then went off and came back with a warm ginger and lemon tea.

She didn‚Äôt have to do this but this is the kind of stuff that really makes a difference.

I have already and will continue to recommend this hotel to all my friends and family."
749,Seminyak visit,40,April 2019,We just left the courtyard marriot and we loved it! The breakfast was amazing. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen such an epic spread of different breakfast foods. Gelato for breakfast was a real treat. Drinks are expensive so wait for happy hour and drink then. Staff are helpful and very friendly. We will be back
750,Better options for value in Bali,30,April 2019,"Having been to Bali many times over the past decade, this was my most disappointing stay of the Marriott/SPG hotel offerings in Bali overall. Whilst the hotel itself was well comfortable and visually appealing, and the pool and gym were great, the service was average and some things can be improved.

Although in Seminyak, the hotel is not close to most of the popular cafes and restaurants that you would find in the Petitenget area. The x ray and body scanner at the property was an overkill and strange given that Four Points, Westin, W, Laguna and other Bali properties in Kuta, Seminyak and Nusa Dua don't have this.

Check in was a mess. After we arrived, we had trouble checking in because Ade at reception couldn't find our booking, neither by name (after looking at my passport) or the confirmation umber (after looking at the Marriott Bonvoy booking app). He asked if we had just made the booking but all the details that he needed was on the screen infront of him. Eventually we were checked in by Eka, who was very friendly and helpful. She went the extra mile to ensure that we were well looked after, so thank you for this.

We stayed at a pool facing room and it was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is of a generous size. A couple of things here were disappointing. Other than toothbrush sets and shower gel/shampoo/conditioner there were no other amenities that you would usually expect to find at a hotel like this. Had to ask for shavers and cotton buds. The walls and doors are very thin, to the extent that we heard housekeeping knocking on the room doors around us, and we had to get up to check that it wasn't our door. The singing and band from the restaurant was also very loud, so they were basically forcing everyone to listen to the music in a karaoke style from 6pm onwards. I've never stayed at a hotel anywhere in the world where the ""entertainment"" from a public area is being blasted throughout the hotel such that you have no choice but to listen to it, even if you are not in the actual area where the performance is. If you are into this, then you will enjoy it but if you prefer to save this for stays at the Hard Rock Caf√©, Disneyland or a theme park then this will be a nuisance to you.

When we went to have dinner at the restaurant after 8pm it was extremely rowdy. Big rows of tables yelling and singing loudly. It was a private function I think but given that it was held at a public area it was very distracting for everyone else and a complete mood-killer. I think the hotel should consider this and be aware that there are many other guests at the property who may not want to be bombarded with loud singing and people cheering for more than an hour. The restaurant wait staff were very nice and friendly, the service was quick and the local food offering was very delicious. They really took pride in the presentation of their food.

Overall this isn't up to the standard you would expect of a Marriott Courtyard property. Stayed at the Four Points Seminyak on this same trip and it was much better value for money and the service was noticeably better. I wouldn't go back here if I had a choice."
751,"Amazing hotel, spa, and people",50,April 2019,"Excellent location, very clean, modern room and facilities. Proactive and friendly staffs. Good dinning experience and BEST SPA in town but limited availability. Suggest to make booking at earlier time. Highly recommended for any occasion when visit Bali. Worth paying for Terrace room or Suite. Great value for money.

752,Good family hotel,40,April 2019,"We had a short stay here. Really nice hotel. We had a twin room by the pool, upgraded from a city view. Nice to be by the pool but of course doesn't guarantee you the sun loungers right outside your room. The pool is great. Staff a super friendly and helpful.
There were renovations going on but it wasn't annoying at all and to be honest, when isn't there renovations going on in Bali??üòÜ.

Really close to the beach and all the beach activities. Only 5 mins walk, and walk the other way and you have shops so a great location.

Buffet breakfast was AMAZING!!! It's been reported one of the best in seminyak. I've just found better at my next hotel but only marginally and a lot dearer.

Our breakfast was included for two and I paid for one which was only an extra IRP14k. Bagel station, pastries amazing, egg station fast and delicious and the biggest selection of fresh squeezed juices I've ever seen. Any coffee you like including cold brew.
Room service food was fast but room service for other things, not so much.
Beds comfortable but I think for 3 people (1 adult, 2 kids) we need 3 beds as the twin room beds are only a super king single.
Possibly my only 1st world gripe is lack of teabags... I'm really scraping for things to complain about there. How and some loud drunken guests. But that was really only in the early evening.
So good activities and shows also on offer."
753,Amazing all round!,50,March 2019,"This is the second time we've stayed at the Marriott in Seminyak now and we're about to book our next trip back for December.

The hotel/rooms/pool & other facilities like the spa and gym are brilliant and the staff are exceptional.

We had some quite specific requests as we were staying with both our young children, my elderly mother and a mix of friends in their 30-40's. Everything we asked for was taken care of for us by the hotel manager personally which we really appreciated.

Have stayed in many other hotels in Asia with included breakfast buffets and the breakfast/brunch here is the best we've experienced by far!

The kids club here is brilliant too and the hotel provides a great baby sitting service too. Would particularly recommend Chandra Setiawati from the kids clubs to baby sit in the evenings. She has always been wonderful with our two girls who love being looked after by Chandra while we go out for dinner - shes brilliant with kids!

We are really looking forward to getting back here again later this year!"
754,Wonderful stay,50,April 2019,"I had wonderful stay in Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak, I can feel the great hospitality from this hotel. I specially would like to recognize Eka from Front Desk and Dodi from Seminyak Kitchen who is going beyond expectation for us as a guest in the hotel.

The daily buffet breakfast is must try in the hotel!!

Once again, thank you very much to the hotel team for giving me a wonderful experience throughout my stay."
755,Very surprising,50,April 2019,"We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our 3 week holiday in bali. The staff at this holiday are amazing, very chatty, always interested in your travel plans and so helpful with tips. The hotel is spotless. We travelled as a couple, however, also seemed like a nice complex for families with children. Still low season so alot of the bars around the hotel empty, but head to la plancha beach for sunset."
756,Short but sweet stay,50,April 2019,"We just stayed one night but we were really impressed with this property. We had a nice, compact room overlooking the interior. Pool was huge, and we appreciated the adult section of the pool. Breakfast was excellent. Best bacon eggs benedict ever. Staff was professional."
757,friendly staff,50,April 2019,"I had a great stay at Courtyard Hotel for weeks

All the facilities, including the gym, are excellent.

The seminyak kitchen's food was also delicious.

Staff always smiled and greeted me.

especially Bintang, Komang, Lubi, Eka, Gita. Thank you.

The Courtyard Hotel made me a good memory in Bali.

I'll be back at this hotel next time.

758,Perfect !,50,April 2019,"All the staff at the hotel go over and above expectations to make you feel welcome and be friendly and helpful. My room was clean and pleasant. The meals I had were excellent, and all served with a smile. Great facilities. The spa treatments were superb, and again the Zanti receptionists and staff were so efficient and friendly.
I booked a daily 'Wellness"" gym session. The trainer was Wahyu and I cannot speak highly enough of him. He was cheerful, courteous and very professional and clearly put thought into each day's exercises. I really enjoyed the sessions which started each day in such a positive manner. Thank you Wahyu!! I hope to visit again and will definitely be booking more sessions at the gym with Wahyu and more spa treatments."
759,"If you are going to Bali, DEFINITELY stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort",50,April 2019,"The staff are very professional, friendly, warm, extremely accommodating and welcoming. The rooms are modern, clean and the wifi is fast and reliable. Located close to shops, restaurants, cafes and the beach. Extremely secure and safe hotel. The pools are massive and the pool bar prices are very affordable. The buffet breakfast is delicious with an extensive variety of foods. The staff made me feel very special and I take pride in sharing my experience."
760,Staff is Fantastic,40,April 2019,"Well trained and attentive staff make this resort a great choice. Nice facility with good amenities. The breakfast is very nice with wide variety. Pools are lovely. Well located near beach and shopping. Lots of activities for kids. Bikes could be in better shape, check brakes and tire pressure before you leave but very reasonably priced.
I would choose it again, it is a good value and I can‚Äôt say enough about how helpful and attentive their staff is."
761,Overall great experience,50,March 2019,"Stayed for 5 days, the staff was extremely helpful and nice! Tried the spa and the cooking class and it was great! No other participants so we got time with the chef alone to learn more! Highly recommended!"
762,Superb!!!,50,March 2019,We stayed two nights at a pool view room. This property is amazing and a little walk to the seminyak beach. The pool is as nice as the pic posted below. The staffs are friendly. Breakfast is also excellent. No need to think twice to select it once again.
763,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE, WE WILL BE BACK!",50,February 2019,"My Mum and I stayed at the Courtyard By Marriott from the 6th-16th of Feb. We had the 'Seminyak Ultimate Relaxation"" package and it was so amazing. Our room was perfect, the daily buffet breakfast was perfect, Zanti the retreat was perfect, absolutely everything we thought was just perfect. We got a Bintang Radler upon arrival which we loved, we also had our free daily cocktails and canap√©s from 4-5pm which we made sure we came to every day, we enjoyed it so much! The service at the hotel was just fantastic. Chinta at the pool bar was amazing, she was always so friendly to us and always came upto us and looked after us. Hendra at the pool bar was also great and made us a couple of special drinks which we loved. Calvin, who made our juices every day was an absolute sweetheart and always made our morning, along with Pina, who always came up to our table at breakfast was also an absolute sweetheart. She always made sure that our breakfast was the best it could be, and we would talk to her every single morning and she always brightened our morning. We Also met Pebri on our last day at breakfast time, and she was also very sweet and caring and made sure our breakfast was good. Our whole experience was just superb here, we cannot wait to return to Courtyard very soon!!!!!"
764,Calling all gym rats,40,February 2019,"Well we started off great, until I had the ice water at breakfast, rookie move...three days of the most intense Bali belly.

Pros:
- Lots of fit and good looking people. I'm pretty sure I was the only one in a moo moo
- Staff were quite friendly and the doctors on staff, as I had two incidents that required medical attention
- Food was quite tasty, and enough variety to feed even the picky eaters
- Spa was worth every penny, must do

Cons:
- Location is right in the middle of hustle and bustle, a bit too urban for me, horns beeping throughout the night
- Slow bar service, waited almost 30 mins to get a drink at swim up bar
- Conceirge, bit disappointing, seemed bothered we tried to book trips and the trips they recommend weren't that great

This hotel seems ideal for young couples, I prefer Nusa Dua for families, it was hard to walk on the rubble they called a sidewalk. The noise, the trash everywhere, the lack of family friendly activities, would probably not return but I could see young couples enjoying this hotel."
765,Jungle oasis,50,May 2018,Lovely hotel in Nusa Dua. Rooms were decent and we love the pool as you can choose the room that leads to the swimming pool. Overall landscape were tidy and lush with greenery. We truly enjoyed our stay. If you like to try the street food there's a small shack by the end of the junction across the hotel for local taste.
766,One of the best hotels in the area with excellent facilities and choices of food,50,March 2019,"situated near the end of the pretty busy main street the courtyard has all the facilities you would expect, pool bar, restaurant, gym etc etc. everything was kept very clean and tidy with plenty of activities should you want them. choice of food for the breakfasts was amazing with ""european"", far eastern, fruit, pastries, even ice-cream"
767,Great place for an anniversary trip away,50,March 2019,"We really loved the hotel, the superior pool view room was beautiful, especially loved the huge shower with the waterfall shower head. Lots of space in the room to sit and also enjoy some room service. The seat on the balcony was good to sit outside and watch all the activity in the pool.
The breakfast was really amazing all the usual things but my husband really enjoyed all the local and Asian dishes. I loved the eggs Benedict and the bagels with cream cheese. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We also had a couple if lunches and one dinner there and it was all really tasty and enjoyable.
The spa was amazing we had a couples massage and the room was the best I‚Äôve ever seen, really beautiful with two massage tables, a picturesque bath and your own private shower and toilet. The massage was great and really started our break away relaxing.
We spent time in the bar every afternoon for cocktails which were delicious. Staff were very friendly happy and attentive. Especially liked Narita looking after us she was really lovely.
Was a great break away and hopefully we will get back there another day."
768,Amazing stay at Courtyard,50,April 2019,"We really had amazing stay here. Love the bed. Had a really good sleep. Love that they have kids club n so many activities offered for kids. My baby had a great time there. Staff speak very good english! Im impressed. They have free shuttle to the beach and around Seminyak as well. One comment though, i just wish the hotel is more stroller friendly. Our room 234 not easily accessible by elevator. Had to make a big round to go to our room from the elevator if we have strollers. Other than that, amazing! Thank you Courtyard."
769,5 stars!,50,March 2019,"Such a wonderful hotel, happy and accommodating staff, breakfast was the best we‚Äôve ever had, such variety. We will bring our children back next time, it‚Äôs a wonderful couples or family hotel. Short walk to the beach, shops down the road, drinks and lunch poolside, you couldn‚Äôt want for much more."
770,Food Truck - Tacos are amazing!!,50,March 2019,Found out about their Mexican food truck on our last day but still managed to try it and we are glad that we did. Generous portion too you get two tacos for the price of one around $5.00 AUD. Must try!
771,Holiday by courtyard by Marriott,50,March 2019,If your looking for a great hotel in Seminyak courtyard by Marriott is definitely the way to go stayed here for a week and the service food drinks and staff are amazing and loved there pool and location too
772,"Amazing time, beautiful people",50,March 2019,"I can‚Äôt rate this place highly enough. We came for my husbands birthday and they sang happy birthday at breakfast time and gave a beautiful little cake. The food is beyond amazing, the cocktails are fantastic and all of the staff made us feel like royalty and really welcomed us in their country and hotel. 10/10 I will be back! Thankyou to the team here at Courtyard it‚Äôs a truly beautiful place!"
773,Not your typical ‚Äúcourtyard‚Äù,50,March 2019,"This place was incredible. I checked in after 2am due to my flight and was welcomed warmly even with complimentary beer or water. Check in was quick and I was able to get some sleep before exploring the property and area. The rooms were extremely clean and the floor plan was unique. I luckily had a balcony so I spent a lot of my evenings and mid days out there.

The food was cheap compared to resort prices as well as being tasty and they had a great happy hour from 5-7 and 9-10. The hospitality was above and beyond incredible throughout my entire stay. One day I went out to explore the area and came back to my clean room. I was impressed to find the housekeeper (Ayu and someone else I cannot remember their name) had made a towel animal for my bed plus folded my clothes that I had on the bench. The bar staff around the pool was incredible as well which left a great impression on me.

I was a Bonvoy gold member so the perks of the hotel were nice. They really treated me beyond well but they did it for all guests which is awesome.

The area around the hotel is rather lively as well. You can walk to the beach in 5 minutes for an awesome sunset at a bunch of cool beach bars. Prices there are very reasonable. As soon as you walk outside the hotel you‚Äôre in a lively part of seminyak where you can find a plethora of pubs and massages for cheap.

I took a taxi from the airport which was 150k flat rate as I couldn‚Äôt locate the blue bird taxis which are the most trustworthy for meter usage. However 150k is about 12-15 usd which is very reasonable for a 30 min taxi ride.

Overall, this is not your courtyard you would stay at in the USA where it‚Äôs a cheap room. This truly is a resort tucked into seminyak for a great price. Easily will stay here again!"
774,AWESOME,50,March 2019,No complaints only compliments! They were like new friends by the time I was leaving and they went out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home. Activities & Facilities provided were above & beyond and the staff guaranteed no question was left unanswered.
775,"Great Resort, Good location",50,March 2019,"From the welcome smiles to the surrounds - Check-in was swift, It was a great place to stay, All the staff are very helpful and very friendly. Breakfast is to die for. Seminyak Kitchen Food is very good. Pool/Bar area is set up beautiful and a way to relax, Staff in this area very attentive."
776,Wonderful,50,March 2019,"Stayed there for 1 night in Bali. Had a great experience. The staff are very professional and jolly. That is what you expect from top class hotel. Specially, the pool bar and it's environment and staff. Wonderful."
777,A great resort with very nice staff,50,March 2019,"This resort has everything one could ask for if looking for a grand getaway. Located in the exclusive Nusa Dua area, this Marriott does not disappoint. With a great lobby, hotel rooms with a glass door leading to the large pools, a river pool, jacuzzi, great restaurant among others, the hotel resort is indeed a paradise. Buffet breakfast is really good."
778,A week in paradise!,50,February 2019,"We stayed here (3 adults in a family room) for 7 nights at the end of February. What an incredible hotel! Breakfast is fabulous, the staff were lovely and helpful, the rooms are modern, comfortable and well appointed and the pool is perfect ‚Äì with lots of beds, a swim up bar and the pool bar has a great cocktail hour. There are plenty of activities and lots going on ‚Äì this fire dancers, live music every night, aquarobics, bingo in the pool ect. We ordered room service one night and ate snacks at the poor bar often as well with all the food and drink at the hotel being of a very high standard. Everything was delicious and super reasonably priced! As we were there when it was my birthday, my friends let the staff know ahead of time and they decorated the room in rose petals and left me a cake while we were out for my birthday dinner. Such a nice touch! Would absolutely stay here again."
779,This place feels like home!,50,March 2019,"It's our second time staying at this amazing property. Last year when my husband and I came here - we felt in love with how nice and warm people who work here are. And this year we just couldn't resist, but go back. I truly believe that the main power of this place is not all the stunning facilities that they have, but rather people who work here. You guys are the face of this hotel and your team is what makes this resort so special. Not to mention that the rooms are meticulously maintained. Everything is sparkling clean and nothing is ever a problem.
When you are here make sure you check out a morning yoga class with Bintang, with amazing rooftop views. He is very calm and leads you through the class in a gentle manner. Also, he was very kind to take some photos of me during my practice. Otherwise, try the aquaerobics with Suriya. He will definitely bring a smile on your face with his positive and upbeat energy. Iva at the security station is very welcoming. And an amazing friend I've made here - Ayu. She is very kind and has such a big heart. I loved seeing her everyday at breakfast and chatting. And also, Grant - thank you for always checking on us and making sure we are having a great time. And of course there is so many more nice people to meet here üòä thank you for the wonderful stay and absolutely the best breakfast we've ever had!!! Also so happy to see the paper straws being used, instead of plastic onesüëå

A small suggestion to the management - please look into placing refillable water bottles, and refillable shower gel and shampoo units in the rooms. Also it would be great to have an initiative at the hotel (maybe once a week, or every other evening) on a volunteer basis to collectively go and clean up seminyak beach from the plastic pollution.

Thank you again for everything and we can't wait to be back!"
780,Great Hotel - Great Staff,50,March 2019,"My wife and I stayed at the Courtyard between 9th - 15th, March 2019, during our recent far eastern holiday. The hotel had been recommended to us, and the hotel did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived to the point of departure we had a terrific stay at the hotel. The booking in procedure was very simple and the staff even provided us with a free bottle of beer on arrival !!

We stayed in Room 614. The room itself was very comfortable - king size double bed, lots of storage space, well stocked bathroom and well furnished room. The room came with free Wi-Fi and free safety deposit box. The room had a large TV with a number of English speaking channels. The room was comfortable and the hotel provided free bottles of water every day.

We stayed at the hotel on a bed and breakfast basis. Having travelled all over the world I can say that the breakfast fayre on offer at the hotel is the best I have ever encountered. The selection of food on offer is immense. There are traditional Asian dishes and western type cooked food. The cooks will make you whatever you want. There is a large selection of fruit, juices, drinks, pastries and cereals. The quality of the food was excellent.

The Hotel is in a busy area of Seminyak. You are 5 minutes walk from the beach, indeed the Hotel has its own section of the beach for Hotel guests. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the beach and other parts of Seminyak. The area around the Hotel is full of bars and restaurants, supermarket's etc.

What is so striking about the Hotel is the quality of the staff. Every single member of staff you meet in whatever capacity, are so friendly, polite and helpful. They are a real asset to the Hotel. It would be remiss of me not to mention Priscilla, a member of staff, who was present in the reception area and the breakfast area. Priscilla was always so friendly and engaging. A real credit to the Hotel.

I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to fellow travellers."
781,The best Bar The awesome guys,50,March 2019,"I spend must of my times in the bar and the kitchen because awesome guys work there, look after you, you won't lose any second to enjoy,the guys I admire are Sri,Angga,pina,Rud.
Marital and Wanya are always the best as well."
782,Wedding of my daughter,50,March 2019,"We have two stays at the Courtyard 4 days befor and after our daughters wedding

783,A must stay!,50,March 2019,"We HIGHLY recommend this hotel! My husband and I spent four days in Seminyak on holiday and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The hotel is perfectly situated within close walking range to the beach, although there is a free hotel golf cart shuttle that drops you off. A few steps away are an abundance of shops and restaurants but not overwhelmingly busy. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was exactly what we needed. Breakfast is a buffet of literally any food you want- from any egg to waffles and ice cream, smoothies and museli to local Indonesian foods and curries. This was my husbands highlight! The pool has a beautiful setting and the pool bar has live background music every night. What the Truck food truck is located within the hotel grounds at the gate selling delicious wraps and tacos if you want food on the go. What an awesome hotel!"
784,Nice turndown service,50,March 2019,"Me and my friends were a bit disappointed with the ‚Äòcity view‚Äô room, coz there is no view at all on level 3. But our room attendant Ingurah Oko Pastika surprised us with the towel art when we returned back the room. Credit to our room attendant who made up our room every day, the person noticed our preferences and made up the room so. Breakfast was great, staff are friendly, especially the boy from the fresh juice bar, he is very positive and friendly, unfortunately I didn‚Äôt catch his name, he was on duty on 10th. I would definitely come back to this hotel, hope with a better view room."
785,Courtyard By Marriott Seminyak,50,February 2019,"Stayed at Marriott a a number of times and they never ever disappoint you. They always make sure to keep  customer happy. 

We stayed here for 5 nights during our visit to Bali.

LOCATION - It is located in and around a busy street and at 10 minutes walk to the beach 66. The hotel also provides complimentary baggi service to the beach between specific timings of the day. 

There are many clubs and hotels in and around the hotel. There is a petrol pump nearby. 

Spa and gym - is present on the premises. Though we didn't get much time to use any of it. They also conduct water aerobics everyday  at 11 am at the pool. 

KIDS FRIENDLY - there were many activities planned for the kids like pottery, painting etc. 

ROOM - We were staying at the pool facing suite. Rooms were very clean and tidy. Interiors are classy. Seating for two is provided outside the suite facing the pool. 

POOL BAR - There is pool bar and interesting thing is they have a bell and menu card kept between each pool chair for placing food and drinks order easily.

STAFF-  the staff is very friendly and helpful. And we were introduced to special Sambal by one of the staff members. 

Wi-Fi -  pretty good speed without disturbances. 

Food- quantities are huge and you can ask them while ordering to customise your dish as per your taste ( less or more spicy). They serve complimentary buns with butter with every dinner and lunch, we were crazy for that as the buns had garlic and cheese fillings and they were served hot. It used to get finished within minutes. Their restaurant runs till 10.30 pm. On weekends they have live bbq. 

BREAKFAST -  is between 6.30 am  to 11 am. There are a number of options available in breakfast and there is a special dish  for the day ..they also have a few live counter. Healthy drinks are made as per customisation. 

Concerge service - available at the front gate. You can book motorbike through them as they have local contacts and transaction becomes hassle free. Also if you book through them then chances of getting troubled by the bike owner are pretty less. Various tours can also be booked here. 

COUPLE PARTY - On the second day of our stay we were invited to a cocktail party. We met a lot of new people there. On our discussion with  the staff and manager we  got a lot of information about tours , places to visit, any places hyped and to be skipped. Such information can never be got through internet. 

There is a food truck in the hotel premises serving snacks and drinks. 

Complimentary popcorn and sugar candy is available at a stall near the reception. 

On arrival they provide complimentary alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as per choice."
786,Fantastic hotel and staff.,50,March 2019,"My daughter and I had the pleasure to visit Bali and this hotel.
What a fantastic vacation we had. From the moment you step into this hotel you feel so welcome. The staff is so helpful, smiling, warm hearted and with a nice sense of humour. You really feel that they like to work at the hotel.
The facilities are perfect, nice spacious room with balcony with view over the pool. House keeping did a perfect job with small messages and gifts on the bed some of the days we stayed.
We had lunch some of the days at the pool, the food was very tasty and very reasonable prices. We also had dinner in the meat shop and had one of the best ribeye steak I‚Äôve ever had and again very reasonable prices.
The breakfast buffet is a chapter for it self, such a fantastic buffet with all you can imagine with a variety of Indonesian and western food, including a smoothie and fresh juice station and of course bread, lots of different bread, pastry, waffles, fresh fruit and ice cream.
The pool is lovely and in 3 levels and nice sun beds.
I only have nice words to say about Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak.
A last thing my daughter was not travelling with me back to Europe as she had to go to a surf camp, the hotel manager John knew this and came to us, giving my daughter his business card saying ‚Äúif you need anything or gets in any sort of problems then remember that you have friends here and don‚Äôt hesitate to call me‚Äù for this it can‚Äôt thank him enough.
I‚Äôll be back."
787,Value for money and lovely staff,50,March 2019,"My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights. The hotel was clean, the staff were very friendly in particulalry Siah who remembered our names, food and drink we liked etc. The pool and facilities were just awesome and all in all it was exactly what we were dreaming of when we were searching for a place to stay"
788,Great choice,50,March 2019,"We looked at many options before selecting Courtyard Marriott for the first of our Bali hotels (we stayed five nights in March 2019). It turned out to be a great choice.

The double room with garden view was a good size and very comfortable, especially the bed. The bathroom had both a bath and a walk-in shower (with rainwater head) which is always nice to find. The balcony was also a good size.

The hotel has two fabulous outdoor pools. All the staff we encountered were friendly and proficient. The hotel shuttle to Seminyak centre and to the hotel‚Äôs own private beach area (which has towels, free water and WiFi) was useful. The hotel is well located for exploring Seminyak and Double Six areas on foot.

We are twice in the hotel and were happy with the food - the breakfast is extensive. We found the drinks to be on the expensive side at the Pool Bar but not ridiculously so.

We arranged our airport pick up through Concierge which collected us on time and was fairly priced at INR 350k - certainly more reliable and less stressful than dealing with the multitude of taxi touts at the airport.

Overall a very pleasant stay."
789,Perfect hotel.,50,March 2019,"The Courtyard is close enough to everything like beaches, shopping and a lot of restaurants. The staff were lovely and the hotel is very well appointed. On arrival our room wasn't quite ready (we were early also) but the staff gifted us a free dinner for 2 and free 60 minute balinese massage at Zanti Spa which was amazing."
790,An amazing experience! Would return in a heartbeat,50,March 2019,"We decided at the last minute that we wanted to take our 2 year old daughter on her first overseas holiday and thought Bali would be the perfect place My husband and I had visited Bali 3 years prior and had an amazing time. A friend recommended the Courtyard Marriott from previous experience and boy were we glad that we took her advice. We had the most amazing holiday experience. We had a pool side suite which was perfect for when our toddler took a nap because it meant my husband and I could still sit beside the pool and not cooped up in a room for 2 hours, it also meant we didn‚Äôt need to worry about having a toddler near a balcony. The rooms were lovely and clean, the service from staff was outstanding and extremely efficient. I was hesitant at first about leaving my daughter in the kids club however the girls running the program were lovely, welcoming and very professional. As a teacher myself I was very impressed with the activities and interactions my daughter experienced and each time I collected her she was smiling and didn‚Äôt want to leave. Grant the manager was lovely and friendly and ensured that we were content at all times. One particular member of their staff is Sri, made our experience would not have been the same if it wasn‚Äôt for her, my daughter in particular grew very fond of her and I would come back to the courtyard Marriott in a heartbeat just to see her again. Staff like her, make any good holiday, a great and memorable one."
791,A fantatic weekend !!,50,January 2019,"Some friends and I organised a meeting at the Hotel from 11 to 13 January 2019 and it was well recevied by the group.
we own our thanks to ms Tiffany, Asst banquet Manager, who not only met us upon arrival but was with us throughout the weekend to ensure all was well. She is indeed an asset to the Hotel and did a marvelous job in ensuring all details were covered and attended to. I can honestly say she went up and beyond the call of duty. Definately made our stay simply awesome!
The meeting set up and dinner was also very well done and arranged as per our requests. Although we had to make some last minute changes and requested a few additional items - all these were very efficiently delivered with ease by Tiffany nd the entire Banquet team that looked after us on both days of our event. Kudos to them for a very efficient and professional delivery of their duties.
The food for the coffee break and dinner was extraordinary. Again our thnaks to the Kitchen team for producing an excellent coffee break and more so an awesome dinner. The service, the presentations nd quality of food was outstanding. A great Indonesian meal. We owe it to the Chefs and Banquet team.
The rooms were very comfortable and added to the pleasantness of the stay. Only at times some noise from the pool guests can be heard but not an issue. Breakfast was also great as it has a whole lot of variety eac day and quality excellent.
I must also mention the Concierge staff Hardi who was very helpful and courteous plus knowledgeable. He provided us with good information and assisted us well. Thank you Hardi.
All in all, we had a wonderful though very short weekend trip to Bali and the Courtyard Marriott. Nonetheless we plan to return and hopefully for a few more days.
Thanks to GM John Woolley and Operations Director Grant Young who also helped ensure all was well.
Well Done."
792,Beautiful hotel with great staff,50,March 2019,"Stayed here for a week recently and would really recommend it. The whole central area is a pool and its far prettier than the main photo they show you on this page. Its one of the nicest layouts I've seen. Staff are very friendly, always smiling and trying to get it right. Food was also very good. Decent gym. Rovina (duty manager) could not have been more helpful when I had to work and leave the hotel during Nyepi, something that generally just isn't allowed. An easy 5/5."
793,Everything was perfect,50,March 2019,"I stayed with my husband and kids in the Courtyard, and i enjoyed it, the place to be, specially for families and kids, we visited the kids club and my 3 years kids and my one year baby just loved everything, the nannies were perfect, special thanks to chandra and to the other nice girls who watched my kids , i also had the opportunity to test different activities such us the aquagym and yoga with Bintang he s Great, i would came back to this resort and also recommend it the couples"
794,Amazing staff!!!!! Hendra and the pool bar crew,50,March 2019,"Another AMAZING stay at the marriot because of their amazing staff. This is our 5th trip back to the marriot in 3 years and not only does it have an amazing location, we come back because of the staff. We have travelled around Europe and many other countries but we continue to come back to Bali and the marriot because of the outstanding service the workers give, they go above and beyond and we look forward to seeing them every time as we now consider them close friends! Hendra is an absolute gentleman we have never had someone look after us like him, we continue to recommend people to stay at the marriot because of him. He now runs the bar and pool staff and we love them too! They always have a smile, always ask how your day has been and if there is anything they can do for you. Penny makes the best drinks! She is friendly and bubbly which lifts your mood instantly! She is fun to be around and we have loved chatting to her by the pool. The service by all the staff by the pool and bar continues to amaze us at the high standards of service they give to everyone who they meet, we feel privileged to come back every year and see these beautiful people!!!! Funny enough we booked our honey moon and could have chosen any luxurious accommodation but my husband and I just couldn‚Äôt go pass coming back to see the staff at the marriot, we booked in for 4 night, just loved it even more this time so extended another 3! You just can‚Äôt go past the marriot courtyard for amazing service!
Eliza and Adam"
795,Just okay and definitely not a relaxation resort,30,March 2019,"Good:
- smooth check-in
- nice pool size (you can indeed get a good swim here)
- nice rainfall shower and air conditioning worked well in the room
- close to the beach (under 10 minutes walk)

Okay:
- room and amenities (lacked of bathtub for my standards)
- breakfast and in-room dinning were just okay, all the food weren‚Äôt as tasty as all the other reviews kept on saying
- bed; had other better experience
- location was okay, had convenience store, restaurants, bars, massage and tattoo parlors close by

Definitely needs improvements:
- the security check at the hotel entrance (EVERY SINGLE Time you enter, you should be checked, even if you were buying water from the store across the street >> really inconvenient for someone on a holiday, makes you feel extremely unwelcome; though for security reasons)
- staff during breakfast need to learn hospitality basics, especially when they keep differentiating between domestic and international guests and especially when the GM says in his response to a review ‚ÄúWe at Courtyard Marriott do welcome guests from all over the world on daily basis‚Äù; haven‚Äôt felt that unwelcome in while now, this wasn‚Äôt the case for the in-room dinning staffs though.
- the position of the lift (though this cannot be changed easily), from floors 3 to 6, you can only go to the second floor and must go through stairs to reach the reception area, that is just inconvenient, really no ways that doesn‚Äôt require stairs to head to the reception area; imagine lifting two suitcases on your own cause the staffs weren‚Äôt that attentive to help you out.
- cleanliness; I have no clue on how long that beer bottle was on that balcony, I mean does it take a review to get things like this cleaned?
- noisy, every doors shut above or next to your room can be heard.

If you‚Äôre under 25 years old, not in need for good sleep, this place is great for you.
For elderly, couples and people with taste and high standards, definitely not the resort to spend your money at. Stayed 3 nights at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak to refresh myself, but this experience made me realize to opt for other resorts in Seminyak when I come visit Bali in the future. Thanks again for the experience Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak."
796,"Beautiful Property, Convenient Location in Bali",50,March 2019,"I stayed here for a weekend solo adventure around Bali. I wanted somewhere not too far from the airport but close enough to Ubud and Carugo for touring around. A personal highlight was the massage (60 minute came out to ~ $30 USD total), especially the wonderful massage therapist (Ayu) and Reception Coordinator (Puji) who guided me in which massage would suit my needs. Food was tasty, pool was clean/ comfy chairs, and room was very clean/ well appointed. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beautiful hotel, great food, and VERY reasonably priced amenities!!"
797,Fire Dance was awesome to us!!,50,March 2019,"we've just arrived here in courtyard seminyak, we had great moment with free fire dancing, I never seen before.
As i heard that only Sunday can possible to see in front of lobby at 18:30.
especially thanks for Surya and Nengah."
798,Fabulous little Getaway,50,March 2019,Loved this hotel. Had a pool side terrace room over the Nyepi break. Rooms were well appointed and the hotel has excellent guest facilities. Special mention to Wahyu in the gym. I did a PT session and he was fantastic! My abs are still sore 3 days later! Really enjoyed our stay.
799,Pool & Ping Pong,50,March 2019,"Such a nice clean pool with super comfy loungers! The pool bar staff are friendly and efficient and the entertainment is fun but not too much. Shout out to Surya who tried his best to beat me at ping pong but ended up handing over a free cocktail after a thrilling beat of 3 matches! Thanks for having us, will definitely be back!"
800,Bali,50,February 2019,"I stayed 18 nights at Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak and I just want to write a review regarding the exceptional service at this Hotel. The staff were so helpful and courteous. A special mention to the Duty Manager Ketut Ramu who always made himself available to assist us and help with any queries. Also special thank you to the breakfast staff; Widie, Arja and Dodie. Their service was exceptional and they always delivered service with a smile on their faces. Thanks for my fussy coffee orders! You all made my holiday just that little bit more special!"
801,A pleasure to stay. Even for a third date,50,March 2019,"This is my third visit to this fantastic hotel. And it gets better each time. The pool terrace suite is excellent. The pool bar has the best cocktails in Bali and the breakfast is so delicious. I was served by Priscilla, a friendly guest relation officer and she did her job so well. She is attentive, caring and always ensures we are comfortable. If you want to stay in seminyak, this is the hotel to consider. It has a nice location, beautiful pool and excellent service with an affordable price. Go try it."
802,""" Boot Camp """,50,March 2019,"I just want to thank Wahyu for a great "" Boot Camp "" session and for his motivation - you can really see he does it with a passion.

A great work out to start the day and now off to a well deserved massage !"
803,The hotel staff made the experience all the more memorable!,50,January 2019,"I had the most amazing two week stay at the Courtyard by Marriott in January following a severe motorbike accident and week-long hospitalization. Once I was finally discharged from the hospital, I arrived at the Marriott and knew I was in good hands. The staff was so accommodating with my injuries (broken leg and pelvis) and they assisted me every step of the way. They helped me get in and out of their vehicles for hospital check-ups, they lent me a wheelchair for the entire stay, they wheeled me to and from my room whenever I needed assistance, and they even brought my meals into the room so that I wouldn't need to get out of bed more than I needed. My stay would not have been this comfortable had it not been for the incredible staff. I need to give a special shout out to Andri (thank you SO much!), Ramu, Anna, Priscilla and many more! I cannot wait to return to Bali and the Courtyard by Mariott some day so that I can fully enjoy the hotel grounds and revisit some familiar and friendly faces. Thank you so much for your amazing hospitality during these sensitive times :)"
804,Great tel with a warm welcome,50,March 2019,"Stayed at the hotel for 4 days before a cruise. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was amazing and room and amenities clean. We particularly liked the design of the room and balcony. Internet, food and pool bar area attractive. Good location for walking to the beach or into town. We were there during Nypei and it was good seeing all the different parades and ceremonies close to the hotel. The hotel staff put on some good entertainment in the hotel for Day of Silence. Would recommend this hotel."
805,Just keeps getting better.,50,March 2019,"This is our 7th visit to this hotel. We love the resort and love the people who work it. We are staying here at the moment and cannot fault any aspects of this amazing hotel.
We were here in Nyepi day and we had a great day. Played games organised by Yudi Supya and Wahyu. We had so much fun , they were just awesome.
The we did Sunset yoga on the same day with Bintag. Fantatic yoga instructor. A big thank you goes out to him as wel.
Ayu at the restaurant makes us feel that we have come back Home to visit. She is absolutely amazing and love seeing her every year. She is definitely an asset to this resort. Rovina and Grant ( Managers of the hotel ) are just so friendly welcoming it makes this hotel our home whilst in Bali.
We travel very often and usually we go back to hotels that we love, however never have we been back to the same hotel for over 6 years.
Keep doing what your doing as you guys are perfect at it.

Thanks"
806,Bingo fun!,40,March 2019,"Nyepi day was relaxing and fun! Thank you to Surya, Watu, yudi, Bintang and Neuhah for the fun games! Beautiful hotel and lovely staff. Really recommend for fun, safe and clean stay. The weather was ordinary but the staff went out of their way to host a fun bingo game- lots of laughs üòä"
807,The best or nothing !,50,March 2019,This is undoubtedly one of the best hotels I have stayed in . The rooms are very well organised . The staff is very warm . They go absolutely out of their way to help you in any way they can . Please continue to do this . I was here on the ‚Äú silent day ‚Äú and they organised so many things to keep the tourist busy ! The pool is great ! The highlight is the breakfast. The spread is gigantic . Absolutely loving it . Will be back for sure ! The Seminyak beach is 5 minutes and absolutely worth the walk .
808,Couldn't ask for more !,50,January 2019,"Stayed during new year holiday with my mom, I was truly mesmerized by the service provided by the team of Courtyard Seminyak Bali from check in until check out time..
Prior to check in, John sent a personal email to welcome my arrival. During check in, I was upgraded to a suite, however since the room was not ready yet, they give me another room so me and my mother can rest for a while.. Thank you for support and assistance from lovely Ms.Christina during our stay..
The suite room is large and spacious, with different partition for bedroom, living room and dinner table. If only they can add additional toilet and bathtub it would be perfect.
Breakfast was simply amazing, various food were available, and all taste great. F&B team were so attentive to every request, even the restaurant was crowded.
Swimming pool is big and nice. well maintained too. This hotel is walking distance and has private area on Seminyak beach. Also close to Seminyak's shops and restaurant.
What a pleasant stay.. definitely will come back again :)"
809,Pool Bar,50,March 2019,"The Courtyard Marriott is amazing. The staff are absolutely fantastic, friendly, caring and go beyond making your stay amazing. I can‚Äôt recommend staying here highly enough. The Pool Bar crew are amazing Hendra, Jaya, Rudi, Alit, Penny, Kes make the best cocktails ever and have the best service you could ask for!!! Highly recommend!"
810,Courtyard Marriott,50,March 2019,My first time in Bali and I got to stay at the wonderful Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. The amenities are superb and the staff are fantastic. So welcoming and engaging and always smiling. Always wanting to know if there was anything I needed and how my stay and holiday was going. They were always there to help me with anything I needed and I felt like I was staying in their home ... not their workplace. A special shout out to Ayu who works front of house at the restaurant ... beautiful big smile each time I saw her. And to Hendra and Penny at the poolside bar ... two beautiful natured persons always wanting to make sure I had everything I needed. Thank you everyone for a wonderful experience.
811,The little extras!,50,February 2019,"We stayed again for 9 nights from February 23rd. Yet again we thought it was one of the friendliest hotels in Bali. Of course the rooms are modern and well laid out, and the breakfast is sensational, and the staff ultra friendly, but just the little extras made a difference. e.g. The bar were slow delivering our drinks at the pool bar, and they gave us our round of drinks free of charge because they had kept us waiting. We weren't complaining even. Also, we were always being offered glasses of ice for our cans of coke round the pool. No begging for help! We really like it."
812,"Great Hotel, Great Staff",50,February 2019,We absolutely loved our stay. You cannot fault the place. The room was very clean and well maintained. The staff were the best we have ever come across. They were always smiling and eager to help. Two staff members stood out ARI & BAYUI they were always super helpful. We highly recommend this hotel you will not be dissappinted.
813,Fantastic hotel and wonderful staff,50,March 2019,"We enjoyed 3 nights stay at Courtyard by Marriott and it did not disappoint! The location was perfect, the staff were wonderful and the facilities amazing.
We got offered an upgrade on our room when we arrived at a discounted price and couldn't have been happier to accept. We had a two bedroom room which was very spacious and beautiful. All staff were incredibly friendly and nothing was a bother. The kids Club in particular was amazing, both my 6 and 4 year old begged to go each day. The staff in kids club were so friendly and caring, special mention to both Chandra and Komang - my kids loved you Guys!
We will definitely be back!"
814,"Fantastic Hotel, couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough",50,February 2019,"The Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak is a fantastic place to stay. We stayed for 7 nights and it was a dream location. The facilities and rooms are fantastic as the hotel is quite new compared to other places around the area, with a really nice pool bar which features excellent acoustic bands every night. The breakfast was included in our package which really furthered the value of this hotel, and had a rotational menu of special items being freshly made each day like crepes and quesadillas. There‚Äôs activities on everyday, not to mention free popcorn and fairy floss in the lobby! The staff are amazing and are some of the friendliest in Bali. Big shout outs to Arja who always went out his way to make sure we were looked after any time we were after anything from a coffee to a cocktail. Can‚Äôt recommend this place highly enough!"
815,Great hotel with wonderful staff,50,March 2019,Stayed for a night at this hotel. Nice hotel in a good location with shops and restaurants nearby. The staff in this hotel are amazing . They always go out of their way to serve with a smile. Thanks to Eka who checked me in and her friendly disposition set the tone for my stay. Thanks to Grant Young who sent an email to welcome me and also met me at breakfast to find out how my stay was. I was sharing my good experience with my family and we want to stay in this hotel the next time we are Bali.
816,Hospitality at its best!,50,February 2019,"Weq enjoyed 8 nights at the Marriott Courtyard & are very happy with every aspect of our stay. The staff are amazing, they always greeted us with a smile and went above and beyond to look after us. I‚Äôd like to especially acknowledge ‚ÄòSri‚Äô who worked poolside and was an absolute pleasure. Sri not only greeted my husband and I by name every day but she always went out of her way to make sure we were well looked after. Her smile is contagious and her presence a pleasure.
Thank you ‚ÄòCourtyard by Marriott‚Äô for looking after your customers...we will definitely be back!"
817,Courtyard Seminyak,50,May 2018,"Superb. Location and breakfasts are amazing. Special thanks to the front desk manager Ramu who made the stay even greater - always attentive to guests‚Äô needs, fun to spend time with and very efficient!"
818,Wonderful stay here,50,February 2019,"We had an exceptional wonderful time here. The service and food was amazing and all the staff were so helpful and friendly. Our server, Widi, at the restaurant at the hotel gave us amazing and unforgettable service. We will definitely come back again soon!‚Äô"
819,Wonderful stay!,50,February 2019,"Everything about this hotel is simply wonderful. The staffs are helpful, the courtyard and the pools are beautiful, and the pool-bar has great varieties of foods and beverages. The room was spotless and super comfortable. The location was just perfect! It‚Äôs a walking distance to the closest beach and the buggy is always ready to take you to the nearest shopping street"
820,Break Time,50,February 2019,"Excellent location. Very clean very helpful staff and always smiling and cheering
Organised a great birthday dinner. Anna and her staff made the party very satisfying.
Drop off points for the beach and city in the golf cart was very exciting
Good food at the pool bar."
821,Upgrading or renovation of rooms would help!,30,October 2018,"Bali has everything a place can offer any tourist. It has the shopping, food and culture components all within an island.

My family stayed in Courtyard for a week. I am disappointed at the level of service - the reaction of staff is slow, the room is old and urgently need upgrading and please maintain afterwards.

It is surprisingly Marriott. I do hope Marriott will try and check this property as it is badly maintained.

Nonetheless, the pool is lovely. My son loves the pool with all its not usual design."
822,One Stop Vacation,50,July 2018,"One of greatest staycation at Bali,

location are great, just 5 minutes walk to seminyak beach.
breakfast is one of the best, lovely!
big pool with pool bar are just really great!
the also have kids club and it's lovey.
staffs are friendly and helpfull.

Hope to see you again!"
823,Lovely hotel,40,February 2019,"We stayed here for 7 nights and had a brilliant time. The hotel is clean and well maintained, and the staff are exceptional, so friendly and go out of their way to help. The reason I would not give 5 stars is that the cocktails were disappointing, and food ordered via room service was average. We purchased a package which included free cocktails from 4pm-5pm and i could barely taste any alcohol in them, not worth it. The attached restaurant does amazing steaks, and the spa is one of the best iv been to. Overall high quality hotel would definitely stay again. My tips are if you want drinks it‚Äôs best to drink elsewhere, and eat in the restaurant rather than room service."
824,Best family holiday,50,January 2019,"We had a fantastic stay at seminyak Marriott courtyard. Besides the amazing food, great pool, beautiful customer service... there was one thing in particular that made our stay more relaxing, peaceful, at ease and this was Ketut from kids club, (at the seminyak Marriott). Ketut was honest, supportive, genuine with our two little boys (age 3 and 1). Ketut from kids club was outstanding and gave my husband and I the reassurance that we could have time away from the kids and feel they were safe, loved and well cared for."
825,Can not wait to return ‚ò∫Ô∏è,50,February 2019,"We had our first trip to Bali Feb 2019 with our 2 children 7/10. We had the most incredible stay at Courtyard. I wasn‚Äôt sure where to book & I could not of gotten better.

We had the most relaxing & welcoming stay. Rooms were great, service was absolutely next level for us. They ran fitness classes our Coach Wanyu was great!

Before heading to Bali I said I would never use a kids room (small minded Aussie lol) my kids went there once & fell in LOVE. Ketut one of the careers was so beautiful, she made me so at ease, stayed in contact with me when the kids stayed. Interacted so well.. My kids wanted to goneveryday.

Food was exceptional, buffet breakfast is HIGHLY worth it. We honestly just loved it & will definitely be back üòä"
826,Outstanding service,50,February 2019,"Our second visit to the courtyard, first time as a family (with our 14 month old). Absolutely outstanding service, stellar!
- The staff at breakfast who patiently met every request and cleared up with a smile, - the babysitter (ketut) from the kids club, I have never seen my baby warm to anyone so quickly! She was an absolute god send!
-the lovely pool staff (Sri) who walked out food orders back to the room when it started raining and also came back to the room to check on us,
- the housekeeping team. Apart from making the room super comfy, they catered to our numerous requests like chopping up fruit, cleaning between baby naps, extra water

This place really deserves its rating for the level of service."
827,Excellent stay with family,50,February 2019,The Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak is simply one of the better hotels for families on vacation. The hotel staff are very accommodating. The food is great. The rooms are clean. But the most outstanding of all is their Kids Club. It was the first time for us to leave our son with baby sitters. Ketut and Komang really took care of our son well. He had lotsa fun from the pictures they sent as regular updates. We were impressed with how they handled him and how they interacted with him. Great job!
828,Lovely stay with family,50,February 2019,"We love much our stay at Courtyard, nice food, great kids club and amazing stiaff, service..., Ramu the manager, pool bar team all well done, we really love this place and will come back
All the staff from security was very nice as well. Buggy service, pool and the restaurant are the best we have in Bali and thanks for ketut n komang at kids club and thanks to for Yindi , wahyu n nengah at pool bar.. they are all nice person"
829,BEST PLACE IN BALI!,50,February 2019,"The Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak is amazing! The staff are very friendly and accommodated to all of our needs. The breakfast is exquisite as the variety changes daily along with fresh juices, egg station and great coffee. We made a visit to the pool bar every afternoon/night and indulged in a lot of cocktails! Happy hour is excellent with buy one get one free. The staff at the pool bar are very friendly and are able to have fun with you. In particular, Jaya, Mob, Penny, Gus dok, Dede, Hendra, Arca, Kesawa, Wika, Rudi, Alit, Agik all deserve 5 stars!!!!!! They are the reason we will be back! Penny deserves 10 stars!!! She is extra amazing! Smiling faces all over the hotel. Concierge and reception staff were also very helpful to us and willing to assist us with anything we needed!

We cannot wait to return to this amazing hotel. Thank you for a very memorable stay!
Madi and Felix

830,Everything was perfect!,50,February 2019,"I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott with a friend. The hotel itself is lovely and well looked after. Every morning you look forward to the endless delicious breakfast options! The pool is wonderfully big and the water temp is perfection. On top of all this, in my opinion the most wonderful thing about the hotel is definitely the staff. A young staff member by the name Aanga (who asked for my name only once) always made the time to address me by my name and engage in friendly conversation. I will definitely be staying here next time I am in Bali."
831,A very very happy place!,50,February 2019,"We have just landed back from Bali after staying one week in the courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. We have lived in Asia as expats for over 12 years and travels to all around the world, but few places have made us as happy as this amazing community. It was not a perfect stay, but the service, warmth and love that radiates from all the staff is infectious!
We arrived late at night from a long flight with 2 very small children (1.5 and 3.5 years). I'd booked the deluxe family room city view on hotels.com. Upon arrival we thought the room was ok and were too tired to give a full inspection, until i noticed there were no black out curtains only horizontal blinds through which the neon lights outside were glaring. We hen noticed the room had not been cleaned well either. We made the best of it, tried to sleep, but woke early, jet lagged and blasted by the sun through the transparent blinds. At breakfast we met the manager, Katut and after breakfast explained the situation - black out blinds are essential, they are on the photos on the website and the room was disappointing prepared. Katut wasted little time, apologizing sincerely for our last sleep and promptly upgrading us to the best room in the hotel, a pool terrace suite at not extra charge. The amazing staff promptly moved our things to an incredible room right on the kid's pool and next door to Kids club and spa - absolutely spot on for our needs as a family! Later the same week, we requested a late check out as our flight was midnight, again they accommodated this giving us an 8pm check out complementary and inviting us to a VIP cocktail party.
Everything at this hotel feels genuine, warm, happy and guest focused in a natural, unpretentious way. The breakfast was exceptional, the pool side service and cocktails were amazing, everything that came out of Seminyak Kitchen was fantastic.
We dined at some outstanding international restaurants around Seminyak each night - and would highly recommend Motel Mexicola, Da Maria, Faun at Potato Head and Barbacoa, all booked through the incredibly polite and super happy hotel concierge desk - Ari was a big stand out with his killer watt smile! These boys on the concierge arranged transport and dining all week for us and were so helpful, knowledgeable and fun.
We visited the hotel spa twice - once for a massage and once for a facial - both exceptionally fantastic. This lovely experience was only made possible by the wonderful staff babysitting our boys in the Kids club whilst we hit the spa - Chandra and Katut were simply perfect, fun, loving and affection with my small boys and the cost of this service was extremely reasonable.
Every single staff member we encounters was so very very buoyantly, infectiously happy and so glad to meet our every want and need. Perfect response from Katut the manager, who left us pleasantly wowed by our feedback on the first room with the fantastic upgrade and careful, attentive service. Dania the receptionist couldn't have been more friendly, and on check out we were surprised - our bill was less than we'd guessed it would be considering we'd charged meals, drinks, cocktails, babysitting, spa treatments and airport transportation to the room all week and left the room charge payment until check out. Other staff we loved Rubi concierge, Widi and Pina in the restaurant and whoever our lovely housekeeper was twisting the towels into animals everyday to make my boys giggle when we came in. Literally nothing was too much trouble, staff are well trained and really care about doing a fantastic job every day. We were utterly wowed, can't wait to return! Well done and thanks for a wonderful, memorable family holiday!"
832,fullmoon meditation at courtyard Seminyark resort,50,February 2019,"My name is choi
I stayed for 3 night at courtyard Seminyark resort. I had a very interesting experience two days ago. There was a event of fullmoon reiki meditation on the hotel rooftop.
The teacher was Agus.He was good at teaching and nicely.
I put a lot of energy in my whole body from the nature.
Unfortunately, we couldn't see a fullmoon during meditation
because of weather was cloud. But I imagined fullmoon and draw it in my heart so I put super energies in my heart and I felt spirited sensation,free and relaxing. I just opened my eyes after finished the meditation the real super fullmoon appeared through the clouds.I was so happy to see a real fullmoon.
Very thanks the Hotel and Agus to special experience for me."
833,Excellent ! Must Stay if in Bali !,50,February 2019,"Stayed here for about 5 nights. Nice hotel.
Breakfast spread was excellent. More over the smiling faces all over made the trip more worth while!
Place is very well managed by the GM; Mr. John W!
Best part of stay was courteous service by every one.
My thanks to Nysa; Ola; Ramu; Bayu; Natamia; Rovina; Airin Ana Muslim and all others for treating us very well.
House keeping was excellent. Rooms were extremely clean every day!
Special thanks to the gentleman from the breakfast area; who made ‚Äúspecial‚Äù juices for my daughter!
If in Bali will again come to this heaven on earth!
And yes they have their own space in the beach area; where Jonni took great care of us!

834,"Terrible location , rude staff, dirty food",10,January 2019,"Booked a pool view room and got a garden view room instead, Terrible locations, found hair in the room service food we ordered, restaurant was dirty and staff were extremely rude . Me and my partner got sick for 3 days after eating their food and cancelled the remaining of our stay and got partially refunded . will highly recommend the stones hotel bali"
835,Great Staff,50,February 2019,Exactly what you‚Äôd expect from Marriott - clean rooms with the friendliest and most helpful staff. Ari @ concierge made sure we had everything we needed for our stay! Convenient location and superb security. Will definitely be back.
836,Highly recommended,50,February 2019,"I highly recommend this wonderful resort to anyone wanting somewhere nice to stay in Seminyak. The staff at this resort are so helpful and really ensure that you are comfortable and enjoying your stay and certainly go above and beyond to help you. The room we were in was really nice - modern, clean, good size with a lovely view of the pool. It was nice each night to come back to the room to little surprises from the housekeeping staff. The restaurant at the hotel is one of the best I have seen and the breakfast is amazing. I have never seen so much choice. I recommend doing their cooking class which is the best I have done. The spa and gym here are really good and their Balinese massage was the best massage out of quite a few done on this trip. The pool and bar area are fantastic with plenty of room to sunbake, swim and enjoy a cocktail or cocktails during happy hour, or two. This resort is brilliantly located, right near the beach and shops with a shuttle buggy to take you there is you don‚Äôt want to walk. Overall ran amazing hotel with such beautiful people and I can‚Äôt wait to come back."
837,Courtyard Seminyak Marrriott,50,January 2019,"We stayed for a week at the Courtyard in Bali.
The staff were excellent at the Restaurant, housekeeping and reception. the Courtyard arranged Balinese Dancers and Fire Dancers while there. The breakfasts were great as was the Meat House Restaurant. It featured 2 large swimming pools, a well equipped gym among other things. A supermarket was opposite and a variety of tourist shops. There were many options close by for massages, facials, pedicure and manicure and so forth. They had their own shuttle and private beach area close by. The only thing I would suggest is that you decide what you want to do beforehand as I did not receive a lot of assistance from the concierge. However we booked a car with a driver. It is possible to rent a bike or a car while there or do organised tours."
838,One of the nicest and friendliest hotels I have stayed at,50,February 2019,"I stayed here with my partner for 7 nights on our first trip to Bali. I have to say I didn‚Äôt want to leave!! I‚Äôve stayed at many hotels across the world and have to say that this was one of the nicest places I have stayed at.

What impressed me the most was the genuine friendliness of all the staff. Every single staff member said hello as we passed them whilst they worked e.g. if we passed them in the hallway staff would always acknowledge us (I was really impressed with this). Every single staff member we met seemed to genuinely want to be there and enjoy their work. Plus I was impressed that the hotel's senior managers were visible, out on the floor greeting guests, helping out and providing support to their teams (never seen that anywhere else).

Our room was really lovely and clean and had everything you would need. Also housekeeping did an amazing job every day, such leaving little notes wishing us a lovely day and on a few days the really cute towel animals on the bed! Again, little touches like that just add the pleasure of staying there.

The in-house resort activities were also awesome including:
- Saturday morning boot-camp on the resort roof top (thanks Wahyu for a challenging but enjoyable session!!!). This session was at 7am but worth it for the nice view from the rooftop.
- Monday morning yoga (thanks Bintang!!!) and Wednesday evening yoga (thanks Agus!!!) on the resort rooftop. You don't need to be a yoga expert to do this session, again worth it for view from rooftop but also makes you feel soooo good afterwards. I'm definitely taking yoga up when I return home!
- Balinese cooking class - definitely worth trying if you are into cooking! I've done a few cooking classes but I really enjoyed this one and learning a bit about traditional Balinese cooking. You will learn an entree, main and a dessert and again the staff were amazing (thanks Bento and team!!).

Also, going to the Zanti the Retreat Spa for a massage was heavenly and one of the highlights. Yes there's heaps of cheap massage places on the street, but this is a proper luxury experience with beautiful facilities that will leave you feeling like a new person (thanks Ayu for one of the best massages I've ever had!!).The prices for all their treatments are very very reasonable and definitely worth doing!!!

Other things about this resort that were great include:
- Buggy available to take guests to one of three spots in Seminyak - Eat Street, Seminyak beach or to Jl Raya Basangkasa (shopping street) - very handy!!
- well-stocked gym
- awesome pool area including a main pool, kids pool and smaller pool with beach bar
- the taco truck ""What the Truck"" out the front of the hotel is definitely with trying for their tacos with an Indonesian twist.
- welcome drink on arrival
- Breakfast buffet in Seminyak Kitchen is one of the better ones I've experienced with a wide variety of Western and Asian dishes
- Dinner at Seminyak Kitchen also very good and well worth it (recommend trying their salt and pepper calamari which was excellent!!).
- Also you can get thing like welcome cocktails if you book for Potato Head, Motel Mexicola and a few other places through the hotel

We really had the best stay at this resort. Yes the location is not next to a beach, but I didn't miss anything as a result. I can't really fault anything here, everything for me was great!

A big thank you to all the staff at Courtyard Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort who made our stay wonderful. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Bali :-)"
839,Courtyard Marriot Semniyak,50,February 2019,"If you want the best breakfast choices in Semniyak , this place is a winner .
The choices were fantastic! Ranging from your normal eggs and bacon to Indian , Chinese , donuts , pastries , freshly squeezed juices , cheeses , cereals , pancakes , waffles and can even have a takeaway smoothie if you like ! The service was 10/10. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The pools were clean as well as the rooms . With the daily cleaning of the rooms , the cleaners left a lovley little gift on the bed too. A really nice touch from the cleaners
Also it‚Äôs Not far to the beach either to see beautiful sunsets . They have complimentary golf buggies to take you to the beach if needed
Would definitely go there again"
840,Great hotel.,50,February 2019,"Great service - drinks - comfy beds.
Hendra and Sri are amazing workers- always helpful.
Yoga was very fun and the food van out the front was so yum and cheap !
I can not wait to come back and visit the courtyard again ! Loved it ."
841,Great time at a beautiful hotel,50,February 2019,"We came for a family holiday and we were so impressed with the whole experience. The rooms were spacious with the most comfortable beds. The staff were so friendly and efficient, most notably Hendra from the pool bar who provided us with delicious drinks and also yoga from the taco van out the front.

I would definitely recommend anybody coming to Bali to seriously consider staying at the courtyard by Marriott, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
842,AMAZING HOTEL,50,February 2019,"Amazing place to stay, food was great, cocktails was amazing!! I really liked the vibes, everyone was super friendly! Pool was awesome. Staff were so kind and helpful! Hendra is leading the team really well, good bar boys Arca, Dede, Dewa, Mob!! Will definitely be back!"
843,Marriott standards,40,February 2019,"We stayed 4nights here and it was a very nice experience. Breakfast buffet has a lot of choices with freshly made juices, western and asian food options. Rooms are clean and new, nicely furnished. Pool area is enough big and nice atmosphere. They offer bikes for rent for 30k per day. They also have buggy service to their beach beds on request. The beach is only 10minutes walk anyway. Gym is well equipped. Everything is perfect.
I can mention only one thing what needs to be improved in my opinion. The dividing doors in between two rooms. I understand that hotels need to have these kind of rooms, but when it doesnt have a proper soundproof between like in our case it can cause big inconvenience. Waking up 2am for the neighbours using the toilet or laughing is not good. This was sorted perfectly as the staff is amazing and they tried their best. Definitely a good value for money if you prefer to stay in a hotel rather than in a villa and its also approx half price of the hotels located on the beach."
844,Thrilled to have found this place!,50,February 2019,"Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak, was like no other hotel or place I or my partner had ever stayed before.

If you are looking at location, it's so central and a five minute walk to the beach and super-close to the restaurant strip, shopping spots, etc - so 10/10 there!

Then there is the hotel itself. Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak showed up as evidently five star in every respect: the service, the cleanliness, the all round quality, and attention to detail was *phenomenal*. Yet, there was an X-factor that made this place really unique and set it apart. In fact, both my partner and I have stayed at five star hotels and resorts in Bali in the past, and as beautiful as these have been, absolutely none of them came close to achieving the same atmosphere that Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak managed to whip up.

The difference here is the staff and the service they offer at this hotel. Everything is done with real heart, and the management culture is obviously working because this filters right into a guests experience. The smiles you receive are so genuine and the friendly, warm vibe at this hotel is truly amazing. In every way, they make you feel extremely cared for and looked after.

Needless to say, I'll definitely be back as soon as I possibly can!"
845,"Lovely Resort, We Will Come Back",50,February 2019,My partner and I decided for our first trip to Bali to stay at the Courtyard which was influenced online by others saying how lovely it was (plus the great reviews) and they were definitely not wrong! whilst we were checking in because it was our 10 year anniversary we got a complimentary room upgrade and lovely in room extra details (chocolates plus rose petals) we also tried out first Bingtangs at the reception which was a great touch! Now to talk about the resort the room is absolutely lovely very big and comfortable bed. The room itself is stylish and has a lot of room which we liked! I also tried the laundry service which was great and quick as well. Now the pool was absolutely amazing we spent a lot of hours each day relaxing plus loved how you could order food and drink to the beach cabanas!! Overall we are very sad to leave and will be coming back!!
846,Warm and hospitable stay,50,January 2019,"We stayed at the Courtyard in Seminyak. From the moment we arrived we got the feeling that we've come home. All the staff were so warm and welcoming. They had the option of iced tea, or, Bintang as a welcome drink...how appropriate for the weather in Bali at this time of the year!

We stayed for just under a week, and never had a reason to complain. The rooms were of an exceptional standard, our family room had a generous size, and bathrooms were well laid out.

The pool was lovely. We also used the private beach on a couple of occassions. Breakfast at the hotel was a treat everyday, and the choices changed daily. The staff were on a mission to make you feel at home, always serving with a smile, and nothing was too much trouble. One day I loved the tempeh they were serving as part of the Indonesian breakfast options, and the kitchen staff actually ran me through the process of how it's made!

All in all, a lovely stay, and one that I would definitely return for! Thanks to the team at Marriott for a delightful holiday!"
847,Bali Weekend,50,February 2019,Arrived Friday. Left Monday. Birthday weekend short stay. Great location. All staff were so accommodating and customer focused. Spotlessly clean. Great breakfast. Hotel food high standard. Happy hours great and entertainment good. Will definitely be back.
848,Best Babysitters in Courtyard Mariott,50,February 2019,"I had the best babysitting service from Courtyard Mariott staff. Big THANK YOU to Chandra, Ketut and Dewi. They are all beyond sweet and caring!!

During the day, if I needed an hour or two to myself, I was able to leave my 19 month old daughter at the Kids Club and they would play with her the whole time and take good care of her, I didn‚Äôt feel one bit hesitant to leave her there. They are so sweet and so caring. Even during the night time when my husband and I wanted to go out, one of the babysitters at the kids club comes over, and stay with my daughter til we are back, and I can tell my baby is so happy with them and she truly enjoys their company."
849,Great holiday,50,February 2019,"The hotel was fine, service very good. Pool was good. The breakfast buffet is incredible.
Recommend that you do the morning yoga with Bintang if you get the chance. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to welcome the day."
850,Birthday weekend,50,February 2019,"This hotel is everything you could hope for. The security is amazing and you feel extremely safe. The hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The pool is amazing big, right temperature and the pool staff and pool bar were fabulous. Very attentive and friendly. Now for breakfast, you must include breakfast in your package. It is without a doubt the best breakfast ever. Every food from every continent in a Buffett style. We had a brilliant time in a wonderful location."
851,Terrific Stay at Courtyard Marriott,50,February 2019,"We loved our stay at Courtyard Marriott. Our room (133) stepped out to the pool and was perfect for our stay. The pools were great and we enjoyed many days lazing there. The staff were amazing, they go above and beyond and are always happy to have a chat. When our luggage went missing at the airport on arrival they jumped into action and kept us updated on the progress of getting that luggage back. The food (including the breakfast buffet) was great. We will be back!"
852,Service was top notch,50,November 2018,"I do not normally write reviews however when a place goes above and beyond I feel compelled to write something! Although the amenities and little touches of the resort was 5 star, the service was some of the best we had received in Bali... from knowing our coffee order for breakfast to surprising us with a birthday treat - it made our holiday that much more special! A warm thank you to the whole team!"
853,Five Star Service,50,February 2019,"First off, the hotel is great. It has all the amenities of a 5 star hotel - and for a courtyard property, this is amazing value for money. I got early check in and a lot of freebies including a massage and dinner. The location is also very convenient. But, the real star of this hotel is the service. Everyone is super friendly and would somehow remember your name very quickly. I was most impressed by the security staff at 3am one night. It was pouring outside and I was dripping wet by the time I got back to the hotel. The moment I stepped in the property, I was welcomed back with a pleasant greeting and a beach towel to dry myself before heading back to my room. Did I mention this was at 3 in the morning? Thank you for an amazing first time in Bali. I‚Äôll definitely be back."
854,Cozy placeüíñ,50,January 2019,"Our fist trip to Bali we stayed 9 nights in Marriott. It was the best thing we could do. The atmosphere was amazing. The people working there were so nice that I felt like I want to hug and thank each of them. Every morning Mira, Intan,Ayu and others would‚Äôve cleaned our room and put some small gifts in the bed near the interesting animals made of the towels. They had so many activities. I did some morning yoga with Yudi at it was amazing. Many thanks to Yudi for being so good at yoga. Also they had everyday free shuttle to the center which was convenient. Everyday at 11am they had Zumba at the pool and the guy Siriya was very good at it. Our package included one free full massage at ‚ÄúZanti the retreat‚Äù. My girl was Yulia. It was probably one of the most premium massages I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Excellent. Also we had free tacos once at ‚Äúwhat the truck‚Äù. They were better than any other Mexican restaurant in Bali. Must try the beef tacosüòã The breakfast was probably the Biggest in Bali hotels. It had everything! The people working in there were soooo lovely! I‚Äôll never forget the smiling face of Arja. My favorite in there! Also the friendly guys Widi, Vani, Rai, and all the rest that I don‚Äôt know their names. I loved waking up and having breakfast in the buffet. We also had everyday from 4 to 5 free cocktails and canap√©s. One free dinner and lunch. We loved staying by the pool smoking sisha eating snacks and listening to the acoustic live music every night. Overall because everyone was so kind and friendly and the place was cozy and comfortable that you could feel like at home I‚Äôd definitely recommend and I‚Äôd go back there. And the packages they include for the price it‚Äôs so worth it! Thank you everyone. I love you all. Until next time üíñ"
855,Great massage at Zanti Spa!,50,February 2019,"Ayu from the spa was fantastic! She reviewed my information sheet and targeted my back, shoulders, and feet (areas that I requested due to some recent strain). I‚Äôd go back and request her for another massage if I had more time in Bali! Thank you!"
856,Comfortable and convenient,50,February 2019,Great location - minutes away from excellent dining and shopping options. The rooms were a bit small but very neat and overlooking the pool ... and pool quite popular and always busy with guests enjoying themselves. courteous staff always willing to help. And of course a great breakfast spread ... will come back again whenever we come to Bali next. The only experience that we keep complaining about is the taxis in Bali - almost no one wants to go by the meter. Got fleeced more than once .. then realised that even for shorter trips was better to use grab or Uber ... the wait was not too Long and the prices were always reasonable. Overall a great trip thanks to courtyard Marriott
857,Amazing stay!,50,February 2019,"Our room and the resort were both beautiful and clean.

There is absolutely nothing to fault about the experience we had.

The staff were brilliant and ensured we had the most relaxing time whilst in Bali.

Special thanks to Sri who tended to our every need by the pool - she was very attentive and lovely, Bayu for friendly and exceptional customer service and also to our transfer driver who took us to and from the airport, he was attentive, on time and happy to engage in conversation with us.

Zanti spa was wonderful and I had two treatments with Kurti who was lovely and highly skilled at performing treatments, both massage and facials.

Everyone at the resort greeted us with a friendly smile and were always happy to go out of their way to assist us.

The breakfast buffet was far beyond our expectations and the meals at Seminyak Kitchen were also brilliant.

We will be back and highly recommend the resort for both families & couples."
858,OutstandingüíØ,50,January 2019,"This is my first review on TripAdvisor and could not let go an opportunity to recognise such a wonderful hotel !!

All the staff always gave us a warm, genuine friendly smile. This also extends to the Security, for the safety of all guests everyone was checked and scanned everyday as we entered the building. This however, did not burden us.

The kids loved the free popcorn machine. Special mention to Dewi from the Kid's Club who played fun games with the kids with a caring nature.

Eka from Reception was so welcoming and went above and beyond to get to know us as guests.

Penny from the Pool Bar making sure our drink orders were taken with a bubbly smile.

Wahyu and Agus from Boxing Fit class and pool side area. We thoroughly enjoyed your PT session.

Widi our waiter at breakfast who went out of his way to ensure our meal was enjoyable.

Dodi and Yuda our room attendant's who were impeccable at making our room clean and fresh everyday.

Swastika and Rosid from the Concierge were attentive to any special request and assistance.

The hotel is situated in a prime location with trendy cafes, restaurants, shops, the beach and Bintang supermarket all close by.

The complimentary hotel buggy will drop you off at the end of the street by request without any hassle.

Big thank you to Grant the Director of Operations who was a perfect example of high class customer service.

Credit must go to Hotel Management for employing a team of highly mannered individuals who all had personalities that were unforgettable.

Apologies if I missed any names, everything about the Hotel was positive from the get go. So much that we returned to stay a extra few nights due to our canceled flight.
Thank you to Wayu one of the Duty Managers who was efficient in processing our returned accomodation booking.

We are sad that the holiday came by so quick but most definitely be back in the not so distant future.

Kudos to Courtyard at Marriott Seminyak!!
Thank you for making our stay as one of the highlights of our trip.

Thuy and family xo"
859,Pure paradise,50,January 2019,"Such a beautiful hotel with friendly staff. Through out our stay they had a variety of thing to do including water aerobics with Yudi, yoga and much more. Would definitely recommend a will be coming back."
860,I return here again...and again...and again...with good reason,50,February 2019,"Every time I visit Bali (annually), I make a point of staying at the Courtyard in Seminyak. I am never disappointed by the quality of product and service. Not only is the location very convenient (a short walk to the beach, laundry around the corner, plenty to see just walking down the street from the hotel, a short quick shuttle to the main area upon request), the hotel is a tightly-run hospitality business which aims to provide the best in the Balinese experience at a reasonable price. I am sorry I had to check out today but look forward to coming back to this lovely oasis again soon!"
861,Amazing yoga classes thanks to very professional yoga instructor Agus!,50,January 2019,"Amazing yoga classes thanks to very professional yoga instructor Agus! Agus is very attentive and during the classes pays a lot of attention to personal needs of each participant according to their physical shape. I liked a lot that he always pays attention to how each of us was breathing and I finally learnt to breathe the right way when doing exercises. Also, Agus performs very very good meditation session after the class and creates really good atmosphere during the classes. Yoga classes with Agus is a must when you stay at Marriott and it will make your wonderful vacation in Bali even better!!!"
862,Great way to spend a relaxing 10 days,40,August 2018,"I spent 10 days the the Coutyard by Marriott and was not disappointed.
The hotel was recommended to me and everything from the pre-arranged airport pick-up to the reassurance of staff after a large earthquake was done with ease.
My room was spacious, clean and had a great balcony view of the pool.
There was a slight musty smell but I put this down to the humidity and the need to have the aircon constantly running.
Excellent bathroom and very comfortable bed!

The breakfast buffet was probably the best I have every experienced in a resort - and the staff were incredibly helpful. I loved the iced coffees!

Resort is located a 5 min walk from Seminyak beach and also has its own private beach area with bar service and Wifi. There a plenty of eating and drinking options within easy walk and the shopping is plentiful.

One thing I liked was that the resort put on different activities each day. The poolside beach party was extremely memorable - copious well-mixed mojito's were consumed!
And the pool is fantastic - although one side did not really get any sun during the day and you had to claim your spot early to be on the sunny side.
The staff around the pool were excellent.
The 2 for 1 happy hour (or 2) is a great way to start the evening!

All in all I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend to anyone."
863,Nice property,50,December 2018,"I have been to a Courtyard before and it wasn't the best one so I had mixed feelings about staying here for three nights and guess what? I totally loved it.
Huge pool area, very good looking rooms with a balcony which make them massive too. Food was great whether it was taken by the pool or in one of their restaurants. The breakfast spread was huge and the hotel is perfectly located."
864,Wonderful stay at Courtyard Seminyak,50,January 2019,"From the moment we checked in (at 11pm) until the day we checked out, we were greeted with smiling faces and courteous staff. The breakfast was delicious with plenty to choose from. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The pool deck had two areas - a swim up pool bar with some music and a more quiet pool with a small waterfall which was perfect for reading and relaxing. Would recommend this hotel for everyone looking to explore the Seminyak area!"
865,Beautiful Hotel,50,January 2019,"The Courtyard Marriott is a beautiful place to stay in Bali. The facilities here are exceptional, and we were blown away by the pool and lesuire areas. Seminyak Kitchen and Zanti Retreat are amazing places to have a meal and relax, but it was the lovely staff that made this stay so perfect. All the staff here are incredibly kind, I would definitely recommend staying here, we had the best time here."
866,Could not be faulted,50,January 2019,"By far the best hotel experience i‚Äôve ever had! This is for a number of reasons - the wonderful people you have working here, the gorgeous hotel, pool and location.

Every staff member from the security, including the bag checkers, as well as the concierge, drivers, cleaners, reception staff and food and beverage servers were all so friendly and helpful.

The hotel itself is beautifully designed, with a focus on planting and as the name suggests, a lovely courtyard area accompanied by a huge pool, and if you prefer the beach, they also have a designated area on the beach with chairs and towels readily available. Its location is perfect, with the hotel also offering a free shuttle service operating within certain hours to take you to popular areas in Seminyak - super convenient!! The room was perfect and clean, nothing to fault!

We had a wonderful time here, thankyou so much for an unforgettable stay, definitely a highlight of our Bali trip."
867,Loved it!,50,January 2019,"My partner and I spent 11 nights here in January. The facility is immaculate, the staff are always attentive, happy and greet you with a smile. Nothing was too much trouble for them, they go above and beyond for their guests. Kisawa in the pool bar looked after us as if we were royalty! The rooms were spacious, very clean and had a great bathroom. The on-site activities were great; I enjoyed the sunset yoga session on the rooftop overlooking the beach. We had so many inclusions: 2 full course dinners, a full course lunch, breakfast daily, 2 massages, private airport transfers and daily free flow cocktails as I‚Äôm a Marriott member. We couldn‚Äôt fault this resort and will definitely recommend it to anyone whose coming to Seminyak."
868,Lunch...inedible !,10,January 2019,"Poolside ordered the dip platter.
Flavour in all three unregonisable.
Normal consistency of dips was a glaring absence. Instead a limp liquid lacking in taste and appeal. ...remained virtually untouched.
Never again !!"
869,Marry Me Marriott!,50,January 2019,"My partner and I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 10 nights and can not fault the hotel, staff, location and facilities. Our pool view room and buffet breakfast a highlight!

Every staff member holds a warm and friendly demeanor and never fails to go above and beyond no matter your request. A special mention to Penny in the pool bar and Arjay in Seminyak Kitchen, as well as the wonderful reception and house keeping staff and many more names that we fail to remember.

We are sad to say goodbye, but we will most certainly be back in the not so distant future.

Thank you Courtyard Marriott Seminyak!"
870,A Week in Bali,40,January 2019,"A fantastic place central to all of Bali‚Äôs locations. The rooms and bathroom are modern and clean ( although a tad on the small size for the price!) the staff are the asset here. Always welcoming with gorgeous smiles. From check in ( I didn‚Äôt catch the young lady‚Äôs name who took care of us!), Ari and the guys at concierge, house keeping who tidied up after us - such a good thorough job I wish I could take them home with me. The staff in the restaurant where fabulous although admittedly the breakfast host woman is kind of rude, and refused to take a coffee order. Had a little problem each morning with the term ‚Äú warm latte‚Äù as it always came out super hot and undrinkable for the first 15 minutes, but maybe that was a Language barrier? The chefs especially little Linda, teaching me about the soup at breakfast! Oh and I can‚Äôt forget the pool service people, considering we spent so much time there :) they do a fabulous job running back and forth in that heat. The hotel itself is secure, and the grounds are well kept. The only consideration which would prevent me from returning is the wind tunnel that occurs around the pool. Nothing the hotel management can do about it, it‚Äôs just the poorly designed layout of the hotel. The issues raised in this review were really minor, over all we had a wonderful stay."
871,Excellent stay!,50,January 2019,"We were a group of 4 and we were impressed within the 1st minute we entered the hotel. Fast and efficient check-in.
Breakfast spread was the best we've experienced. Arja needs to be especially commended for he's tireless effort in keeping us happy. He's an extraordinary waiter and felt welcome overtime we had breakfast or supper.
Food was top class, couldn't fault a single thing.
Pool and bar was beautiful and service was excellent. Would hight recommend this hotel to anyone who wants luxury and excellent facilities."
872,Simply the Best!,50,January 2019,"This was my third stay at the Courtyard Marriott but the first time for my husband and friends who joined us. We stayed 10th to 17th January 2019.
From the welcoming on arrival at the front office to the end of our stay the service was excellent. Thank you Dania at the front office for always being so helpful and happy, your smile was infectious. Thank you also to Ketuk Ramudayana the front office Manager for taking time out to gain feedback from us, which was all positive I might add!
The breakfasts are amazing, the buffet is so well organised, there‚Äôs such a variety of foods, it‚Äôs clean and you can see the chefs at work. Thank you Arja for looking after us so well at breakfast, how you remember so many names amazes me. üòä You even remember my name from previous stays. I miss our little chats in the mornings.
Narita and Sri at the pool bar were so welcoming and remembered our favourite tipples. There was a great atmosphere at the bar inside and out. It was buzzing on rainy days and winning the bingo was a bonus.
We were very impressed with the daily Water Aerobics, thank you so much to Wahyu and Yudi for our morning classes of fun and fitness, thank you also to Agus looking after us around the pool.
‚ÄòWhat the Truck‚Äô at the front of the hotel is definitely worth a visit. We had lunch on a couple of days, it was very tasty, and they make great iced coffees.
The hotel is spotlessly clean, thank you Dodi for keeping our room so lovely and clean.
I loved staying at the Marriott again so did my husband and our friends and we will most certainly be staying again. It‚Äôs all the little things that make it so special. On a couple of very hot days the chefs came around the pool with home made ice lollies for everyone. When you pass through reception, you‚Äôre offered popcorn and fairy floss, it‚Äôs not just for children üòâ. The golf buggy will drop you off at the beach and other close by destinations. Looking forward to my next stay.
We booked direct with the hotel on the Ultimate Relaxation package which I thoroughly recommend (see photo attached).
Just one other very important thing to mention about the Marriott. You get the best nights sleep, the beds and pillows are the most comfortable I've ever had."
873,Home from home,50,January 2019,I loved this hotel. Rooms were spacious and bed was enormous! Very attentive staff especially the restaurant staff who were more than helpful with getting drinks. Breakfast was one of the best with something for everyone. Hotel was in great location near to restaurants and bars. Very close to the beach with regular shuttle. L
874,Best in Seminyak - will be back!,50,January 2019,"My son and I absolutely loved our 12 night stay at the Courtyard. The breakfast was amazing. The staff went above and beyond for us, organising trips and were super friendly. Beds were very comfortable, and the hotel location was perfect. House keepers were amazing, we loved the surprises they left for us. Pool was very nice, as were all the hotel facilities. We loved the free popcorn and fairy floss! We have recommended the Courtyard to family and friends and will definitely be back!!"
875,Mrs Crawford,50,January 2019,"The hotel is amazing. The staff cannot do enough for you, they are so polite and they will go out of their way to help you with anything.
Our room was very clean and spacious, there is an iron,hairdryer &ironing board. A mini fridge is in the room toput your own things in, you get tea/coffee topped up daily with shampoo,shower gel & conditioner (they are only small tubes) there is also a safety deposit box inside your wardrobe.
The rooms are cleaned daily unless you put your do not disturb on. Clean towels daily. The hotel also has a towel service by the pool, you just sign for your towels when collecting and handing back.
The hotel has a shuttle service that goes to the local beach where they have a small area for sun bathing and again towels and water are supplied (no charge). The shuttle will also take you near to Seminyak Square where there are more bars and shops.

The breakfast choices are unbelievable, from Balinesian, cerels, pancakes,waffles, fresh juices, yogurt, fresh fruit, pastries, choices of breads and bagels, to English breakfasts. Also ice cream for children.

Definitely recommend the fillet mignon in the Seminyak Kitchen in the evening. Amazing food.

The standards here are fantastic. The staff are the nicest we have ever come across on our travels.

I would definitely recommend this hotel it‚Äôs a perfect place & location."
876,Meat Shop,50,January 2019,"As always, great fresh quality steak that I had this evening. Chef Kadek was personally on hand to ensure that all was well and Arin, nothing but good things to speak of when it comes to her level of service, interaction and care for the ding guest. Keep up the good work folks!"
877,Excellent family hotel,50,January 2019,"We stayed here for a week in January 2019 and loved the place. The staff are incredible and nothing is too much trouble. We really enjoyed the variety and quality of the breakfast and the kids loved the free popcorn and fairy floss machine.
We stayed in a family room which had to large beds (they seemed bigger than queen but not quite king) and a well appointed bathroom with overhead shower and hand held option.
The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the beach and they have a private spot at the beach set up for hotel guests. There are several shops, convenience stores and restaurants within a 10 minute walk.
The pool was great and has a two separate areas as well as a kids area and the poolside food was good also. We had a couple of days where family members were sick (not hotel related) and had the do not disturb light on. Reception and security called and came to the room to check if everything was OK which was a nice touch.
We would stay here again if we return to this part of Bali."
878,1st Visit to Seminyak,50,January 2019,"It's a 5 star place with a 5 star price tag and worth every star.
Only annoying part was the prepayed, to get a 20% discount on stuff (not including happy hour or transfers) at check in when you have no idea of how much anything is yet. Reception fixed it up on check out but my advice is not to bother with it.
Apart from that, highly recommend it to anyone who loves a drink at a swim up bar. Arca is the man you want to see practicing his freestyle cocktail bar stuff. Top bloke!"
879,AMAZING,50,January 2019,"I‚Äôm currently enjoying my second stay at the Courtyard with my partner and family. We visited last April and we returned as soon as we could. I can not fault this resort. We have travelled a far bit - to places like Bali, Thailand, Europe, Fiji and more. This is seriously up there with the best. The staff go above and beyond (special mention to pool staff Abit, Penny and Rudi, as well as a past employee - Bayu). The resort caters for couples, family, elderly, EVERYTHING. Nothing is ever a bother. Beautiful people - beautiful food, beautiful everything. Worth every penny. Stay at the Courtyard, you will not be disappointed!"
880,Courtyard Seminyak resort Bali,50,January 2019,"Extremely clean, very dedicated staff, good food, good service, made my first stay in Bali very pleasurable. Highly recommend !
Got left daily presents, awesome facilities and good entertainment. Good resort to stay at ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
881,Amazing Family Holiday,50,January 2019,"I recently stayed at the court yard Marriott in seminyak and it was unbelievable! The staff were incredible and the service was 10/10!!! I would recommend staying here with family or friends as it caters to all groups of people! The kids club was great for my nephews and they provided us with a babysitter who was absolutely fantastic! Her name was Chandra and I would highly recommend her as our little Leni fell in love with her, she attended to all her needs with such care and love that my husband and I felt at ease leaving Leni with her!"
882,Great location,50,January 2019,Loved our stay here. Fantastic location. Short walk to the beach and restaurants. Rooms are really comfortable and extremely clean. The onsite spa is amazing we did the signature package for couples. Was really value for money came out of the spa treatment feeling10 years younger.
883,Excellent Hotel,50,January 2019,"This hotel is perfect! The staff are welcoming and left gifts and kind notes in our room every day! The rooms are very clean and it is nice to come home to fresh sheets and towels (complimentary housekeeping). It is located in a safe street in Seminyak with a 24 hour shop nearby for alcohol, food and water. There is also an ATM nearby. The restaurant food is excellent including the breakfast. The pool and pool facilities are great and the poolside food and drink service is excellent. What makes the hotel special is how kind and friendly all the staff are and the exceptional room and pool facilities. Goes above and beyond expectations :)"
884,Great hotel!,50,January 2019,"This hotel was great. Very welcoming staff, amazing rooms and a perfect pool to spend hours relaxing.
The hotel has a golf buggy that can take you to eat street or down to the beach which is walk able. A shop across the road is perfect to be able to get the basics and get cash from an ATM. Very highly recommended hotel"
885,The Perfect Holiday Vacation,50,December 2018,"Our family spent part of the holidays in Bali and stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Seminyak. The hotel room, food, location and especially the staff were phenomenal! John Woolley, the hotel manager checked in on us to ensure we were enjoying our stay. Priscillia provided superior customer service! She cared for my families needs, recommended great restaurants and touched base everyday to make sure that all was going well.

I stay at Marriott hotels over 100 nights per year for work and play. John and Priscillia set a high standard. Now that we are living in Singapore, we will be back multiple times per year! Thanks again Priscillia and John!"
886,A Pleasant Stay,40,January 2019,"We stayed here for three nights and I can say that this is a nice place to stay.

Located in the heart of Seminyak, this is a great base camp, it's also great to spend your time in the resort itself. They have tons of activities, for kids and kids at heart. A friend of mine, a yoga enthusiast, really enjoyed her Sunrise Yoga session with Bintang; compliment for their guests. They have a lot daily activities, you won't be bored if you decide to just relax at the resort.

Our room was impeccable; clean, comfortable, bed was comfortable, no problems during our stay.

Staffs were friendly and eager to assist, but not the securities that refused to lend us umbrella on one rainy night.

Breakfast spread is always mouthwatering and I love their egg station! Eggs benedict made to order, yum!

We enjoyed our stay, and we look forward to come to Bali again."
887,Water aerobics,50,January 2019,"Surai the water aerobics teacher was super funny and really lovely

Really good fun and would highly recommend you try this class when visiting this hotel

Thank you Surai love from Lisa from Scotland xxx
üéâü§£üòÇüçæüèñüíÉüèº‚ù§Ô∏è"
888,Fun hotel,50,January 2019,Smashing hotel-lots to do -particularly the aqua aerobics with Surya at 11am each day ! Fantastic breakfast with every cuisine which sets you up for the day. Beautiful well laid out rooms. Regular shuttle bus to the beach -take care when walking on pavements in Seminyak.
889,"Genuine, happy and caring staff",50,January 2019,"This is my second year in a row at the Marriott and I am undoubtedly blown away (yet again) by the cleanliness, hospitality and inclusive nature attributed by the staff. Special shout out to Arja Dwi for taking such good care of us and being the epitome of service with a smile!
Highly reccomend!"
890,THANKYOU!!!,50,January 2019,"This hotel was our 'Oasis of Normality' whilst in Bali!!! Cleanliness is the same high standard as Australia, decor was fresh and updated, beds/linen/pillows were wonderful quality, reception staff have excellent english, pools were clean, breakfast and any food ordered was of a high standard.

Plenty of news and movie channels on the TV, excellent air con, free popcorn and fairyfloss for the kids, a complimentary shuttle to drop you off at the beach (which is an easy 8 min walk), or Eat Street....it was a relief to get back after a day out and know the standards you are used to everyday are being practiced here. A special mention to Prisi, she was outstanding. A home away from home!"
891,Great hotel can‚Äôt wait to visit again,50,January 2019,We had an incredible stay at the Marriott! The staff are so friendly and so helpful! They are very quick to respond to your requests and nothing is a problem or issue for them! The location is also great. We had a pool room which is excellent and if we come again we would definitely book pool rooms again we had interconnecting with our kids. Komang from kids club was excellent and amazing with our 9 month old baby. Overall this hotel ticks many if not all the boxes and was very reasonable in terms of price. We got the luxury escape package which included a dinner and massages and a lunch plus free cocktails everyday from 4-5pm. The breakfast buffet is amazing and one of the best in the world! The day spa was also incredible and we went twice we loved it so much!
892,Amazing staff,50,January 2019,"Had an amazing time at the Courtyard by Marriott, would highly recomend!!!! Would like to make a special mention to Sri for her being an amazing attendant by the pool and for being so lovely and beautiful. Also to our room attendants Ayra and Surya for being the most wonderful people and always putting our needs first. Thankyou very much Marriott, you have the most amazing and caring staff!!!"
893,Sri,50,January 2019,"Sri was a lovely helpful member of the staff who went out of her way to help us.
We loved the Marriott!!!!
We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
Rooms were clean
Pool was awesome
Cocktails were divine"
894,Recommend,40,August 2018,Noisy rooms. Awesome food and a great pool. Friendly and helpful staff. Recommend for anyone. Close to the beach and some shopping malls. Great place to relax. Would like to go back with the family. Thanks
895,One word- AMAAAAZING!!!,50,September 2018,"This is a long overdue review!

Where do I start? I just want to say a big thank you to Ramu- front desk manager, Elizabeth- Director of Finance,Pool Bar manager (can‚Äôt remember his name), Arja- from Seminyak Kitchen, Visnu- Recreational manager, and I can‚Äôt remember the rest of the names but a thank you to all the staff at Courtyard by Marriot!

We had an amaaazing stay there, all of the above mentioned names- went above and beyond to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. I honestly cannot thank you all enough for everything!

Everything from the cocktails, to the food, to the amazing staff was just PERFECT! All the staff Members greeted us with a smile, everything was a can do, and nothing was too much trouble!

And guess what? We are returning again this year and we can‚Äôt wait!!

Thanks again so much!! And Ramu- thank you again sooooo much for everything!! We look forward to seeing you soon!!"
896,Nice new hotel in a good location,40,January 2019,"New Marriott property locates in a fine area closes to the beach and main streets.
Staffs are attentive and service minded, the pool area is very nice with several large pools connected to each other and nice chill out area.
Breakfast is great with plenty of choices and good atmosphere. The room is fine with modern touch and very comfortable bed. Very tight security control to get in hotel.
Look forward to stay here again next time."
897,Happy Holiday,50,January 2019,"Spent 6 nights from 5/1/19 and had a great stay. Staff were very friendly, the pool is great and our room was clean and air conditioner was not noisey unlike some I have come across. I visited the hotel on site Spa and had a great Hot Stone Massage which was very relaxing.. if I go back to Bali, I would definitely stay at the Courtyard again."
898,Holiday,50,January 2019,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. Staff are amazing.. Chinta will bring tissues a hug what ever you need.. just gorgeous. So blessed with our stay, cant recommended highly recommended. Location amazing!!.......‚ù§‚ù§"
899,The Beach,40,January 2019,"I walked quite a long way to the ‚Äúprivate beach‚Äù as there was a queue at the Buggy service to the beach. I was quite disappointed as the hotel should have provide more than just ONE buggy to serve the guests.
Anyway, I was very happy to be received by Surya at the beach. He was very friendly & helpful, great service with a warm smily face! Thank you :)"
900,Tours swim with the Manta,50,January 2019,"This is a Marriott

901,Faultless! The staff are exceptional,50,January 2019,"From the moment we arrived we couldn't fault anything! We stayed for 4 nights and for the entire duration we revived impeccable service.

A special mention must go to Dodi in the restaurant! We dined in the balinese buffet the first evening and Dodi was our waitor! He was professional, attentive and gave us lots of advice to go to places in Bali. He learned our names and greeted us every time we saw him. Made us feel extremely welcome.

Feby again in the restaurant was outstanding! Nothing was ever to much, he would explain all the dishes to us and again was extremely attentive and friendly.

A final mention to Arja. He helped us on the first night at the balinese buffet but we didn't see him again till our final night. When we did he was asking all about our stay. I ordered a dish on the menu but unfortunately they had ran out! Arja went out his way to find the components of the dish and gave me something similar! Fantastic service.

These are only three of the staff I have mentioned but from reception to house keeping to the spa I cannot fault a single thing. I have worked in hotels for many years and I have never been a hotel with this standard of service and such a quality setting."
902,Excellent,50,January 2019,"From the moment we arrived you could tell this resort was going to be good.

Great service at every touch point.

Pool is excellent whether you wish to swim laps, chill out at the swim up bar or have a splash with kids.

Breakfast selection and customer service was excellent.

Definitely put this on your hotel list when visiting Bali, you won't be disappointed. Great family resort or couples retreat."
903,Courtyard Marriott - 29 Dec ‚Äì 04 Jan,50,January 2019,"Having stayed with Courtyard Marriott last year over the festive season, our decision to return was the right one. Even before reaching reception both security and the concierge team certainly made us feel welcome. From the Pool staff to Housekeeping, Gym, Spa and the Customer Service team, it appears that going above and beyond is part of their daily ritual. They do it well with ease. I look for to our next stay"
904,Magical Christmas,50,December 2018,We dined at Seminyak Kitchen for Christmas Eve dinner. The food was exceptional! There was a wide variety of food and it was beautifully presented. The staff went above and beyond to look after our table. It felt truly magical with the local choir singing Christmas carols. It made our Christmas in Bali one to remember
905,Awesome stay..,50,January 2019,"Stayed at the Marriott over new years, wow what an incredible hotel, staff amazing rooms beautiful and clean,breakfast delish, would recommend staying here for sure. Thank you for an enjoyable stay will definitely be back."
906,Fantastic Time,50,January 2019,"Well done to all the amazing staff at the Courtyard Marriot...our rooms were brilliant the food & drinks just awesome can't wait to get back to Bali and stay there again.

So thank you very much once again ."
907,Awesome Hotel stay with family,50,January 2019,We booked 9 rooms at this hotel for 5 days. it's the second time we have been here and as always the service was impeccable. The breakfast was included and it was an awesome spread of Asian and continental breakfast. the hotel has a resort feel and with a nice pool with a bar. the hotel organizes a lot of events and is suitable for family with young children. would recommend to stay here.
908,Your a Star üëçüëç,50,January 2019,"Yes I‚Äôve read the reviews ... Geezus some people should just stay at home ..
the rooms were clean tidy , the grounds were immaculate ..
Breakfast every morning cooked for me for 6 days was majic!!
The selection was amazing
Asian for my hubby n Eggs Bene for me
Crossiants outta the oven , everything was fresh fresh fresh ..
The pool was warm n clean n the food at the pool side was great I managed to have buffalo wings with blue vein dip twice mm mm .
I don‚Äôt know what people expect when they come here but staff were extra friendly n very attentive .. would I come back ?? Absolutely .... your a STAR ü•∞ü•∞
Room service was great toooooo xx"
909,Disappointed second time round,30,January 2019,"This is the second time we chose to stay here. There were 3 families staying 7 nights. We had stayed here 18 months ago.

Unfortunately everything has deteriorated. Don‚Äôt be fooled into paying for a pool view unless you have a full pool view. Actually seeing a glimpse of the pool is considered pool view. Late check out was a drama - no desire to accommodate even though we had paid for 21 nights. The food at pool bar takes FOREVER and the quality is average. The coffee machine at the pool bar was broken for our entire trip. They made them upstairs and brought them down which was helpful.

The room towels need to go into the bin. We took pool towels to use instead. The towels were old, torn and terrible to use.

The smoking in the pool is a turn off. Having everyone light up in the pool at the swim up bar drinks and is revolting.

The staff are friendly and do their best to be helpful and accommodating.

I‚Äôm not sure who said this is the best breakfast - it‚Äôs far from it. It was included in our package and we skipped it after 3 days.

I expected more from the Marriott."
910,Has gone downhill,30,January 2019,"Came here 18 months ago and had a great holiday so I brought the family this time. Very disappointing

Firstly this is NOT the best breakfast in Bali. There is plenty of choice but the quality is average. Foods sit out in the heat for hours on end.

One of my daughters got a ‚Äúpool view ‚Äú room. You can see from the photo it is a pool glimpse. Surely they should charge a reduced rate when you can‚Äôt see the pool at all.

I booked three rooms for 7 nights each -that‚Äôs 21 room nights - and we still had to argue for a late checkout

The food at the pool bar has deteriorated and they still allow smoking at the pool bar. Ridiculous.

The towels in the room were very old but the facilities otherwise were fine.

The pool is great as long as you escape the smoke. Location is pretty good and staff are friendly.

Needs to get back to the standards it set 18 months ago. In the mean time I will take my 21 room nights somewhere it is appreciated."
911,Disappointed,30,January 2019,"We haven‚Äôt been satisfied with our stay at this hotel. First of all when you arrive you see a security check you must go through every time you come in(?!) which makes you feel like you are entering an airport and doesn‚Äôt provide you any sense of holiday(which you would like to get since you here for holidays). That was really annoying. Then guy in reception refused to check us in our room until it‚Äôs 3 pm although I was sure they had a room at that time(it was 2 pm) But he kept saying that it‚Äôs a rule to not check in until 3 pm ( how stupid) Then NO ONE ever told us about the hotel amenities, like where and what time is the breakfast, transfer to the beach and etc, we had to chase staff and ask this ourselves, not very professional, right? Next thing, one day our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned till 4 pm until we went to reception and told about that, for what I got an answer- So do you want your room to be cleaned? Really??! This is a decent answer when your guests saying that their room wasn‚Äôt cleaned? Not even an apology? During the breakfast waiters never come to you proposing tea or coffee, if you don‚Äôt ask yourself, you won‚Äôt get any! The last but not least was the amount of sun beds. If you won‚Äôt get up at 7 am, don‚Äôt expect to get a sun bed! By 9 am everything is taken already. On one of those days we took bean bags that are located around the pool (getting to them is a challenge) I can‚Äôt even imagine whose idea it was to locate them that way which is completely unsafe and life threatening!!!! These bean bags ar arranged this way that if there are people laying on them on the left or on the right of you, you won‚Äôt be able to leave other then either through the pool or jumping down. I was alone on this day so there was no one to help me and I decided to get down and eventually fell on my stomach and leg which led to few bruises thank God!! But what if it was something much more serious? I would‚Äôve go to the court with this case since the hotel does not respect the safety rules. What if it was a kid?? Hw can you locate any spots for sunbathing without safe way to it? This is just unacceptable. Never coming back to this hotel"
912,Kids Club,50,January 2019,"Both my kids loved the kids club. The activities and movie nights were the best as we could sit in t bar or go out for dinner whilst the kids were well looked after! A special thanks to Komang & Ketut!

Thank you ladies. You made our holiday a lot more relaxing :)"
913,A bit over priced due to the size of the room.,40,December 2018,"I found the hotel great, but over priced for what we pay.
The location isn't amazing. It's a 10 minute walk to the central beach, which isn't the best I've been to.
One has to get a shuttle, that drops you off on the main road. You then need to walk. It's not a bad thing, as the traffic in Seminyak is chaos.
The room size is small for the amount of money one pays disappointed me.
It's perfect for 1 person, but for 2 people, it's a bit of a squash.
The staff are amazing, especially Grant Young, who went out of his way to facilitate and help us with whatever we required.
The breakfasts and food in general gets 10/10!
The pool also gets a 9/10.
There are 2 sections to the pool. One at the top with beanbags and the bar and 2, further down with loungers.
All in all, it's a great hotel. I give it 4/5."
914,Enjoyable short stay,40,January 2019,"We stayed for two nights and were mostly out; the room was pleasant and clean - the lobby is adjacent to the pool, which was busy the days we were there. Good proximity to hip Seminyak area and there are buggies that can drop off guests at some predetermined locations - making it closer to some destinations around Seminyak.

We spent one whole day out in the Courtyard beach club - close to Double Six. There were approx 20 loungers in the small space that we can use for free. We did however rented the beachfront beds from the locals because we wanted to. Towels and cold bottled water were provided, unlimited (it wasn‚Äôt a busy day when we went).

Special call out to the staff, Surya, he was very helpful and accommodating - giving tips on food ordering and ensuring that we were comfortable - thank you Surya!!"
915,Aquarobic,50,January 2019,My family took part of the aquarobic pool activity! And we all loved it! It was so much fun and such a good activity to break up your day! The instructor was great and is very talented at his job! Would highly recommend! Thank you Surya for a great class
916,"Breakfast is great, good location, and staffs are very friendly",50,November 2018,"My parents and I stayed here in the beginning of November. Since I‚Äôm a platinum premier elite member, they upgraded us to a family room before we checked in. When we checked in, they upgraded us again to a suit. Some of the staffs greeted us by calling our name. That‚Äôs very personable, and I felt very good when they called our name. My parents were so excited because we were treated like royal.
Since we chose Food & Beverage voucher as a welcome gift for platinum premier, we had a dinner at their restaurant. They offer steak and it was pretty good. The breakfast is also very good. My parents love mango very much, and the staff got it for them from back when they asked one. They were very happy.
They have their own private beach. They have a scheduled transportation to the beach. They also offer a cart transportation to city center as first come first serve, however, you need to come back to the hotel by yourself, which is just a couple of minutes. I strongly recommend this hotel because the staffs are very friendly."
917,"Great, room a little small.",40,August 2018,"It is approachable, welcoming, so close to the beach that you can as well go walking! It has 2 big swimming pools for adults and a 3rd one for the kids. The kids club takes care of your children while you are away. There‚Äôs popcorn and cotton candy all the time in the lobby.

The service in general is good.
Only problem is the rooms which are tiny or cramped. The bathroom is 1/3 rd size of the room and actually feels bigger than the room itself and same with the balcony!"
918,Highly recommended,50,January 2019,"I been to Bali a few times, but this is the 1st time i stayed in Courtyard Marriott Seminyak hotel. Can't find any fault in this hotel. Walking distance to Seminyak beach, lots of restaurant and spa choices around hotel too.

Swimming pool here is the facility that u don't want to miss when u stay here.

The General manager John was the best General Manager i have came across, he dress up like normal staff (not in business suit) greet the loyal guest of Marriott Rewards member in breakfast time and check with them make sure everything is fine with their stay.

As a Marriott Rewards Platinum Premier Elite member, i stayed 3 nights and got upgraded to suite with pool view for 1 last night when the suit is available.

I will definitely come back to this hotel again and recommend it to my friends and family who wanna stay in Seminyak area."
919,Relaxing Quiet Getaway,50,November 2018,"We stayed for four nights with other family members for our daughter's wedding. The staff were accommodating and friendly. The rooms were clean and comfortable.
We enjoyed the pool and the bar but there could have been a few more umbrellas to sit under.
Breakfast was excellent with a large choice for any taste."
920,"Great place to stay for Couples, Family or Friends.",50,February 2018,"Will continue to recommend the Courtyard Seminyak to anyone looking to stay in Seminyak. Loved my stay here it is a great location and could not fault anything. Highly recommend.

Great coffee in the morning too from the truck just outside the resort. Love how serious they were about security also."
921,Affordable yet incredibly well managed,50,December 2018,"My group of 20 spent 5 days over Christmas holiday here. Located 10-15 minutes walk from the Seminyak beach (there's a buggy to take guests if you don't want to walk). Great service, easy check in and out. Love the breakfast spread, a lot of varieties, many of which are good quality and freshly and well prepared. I particularly like the layout, the hotel grounds are not large but you don't feel overcrowded. We had the rooms on the 3rd floor and have no problems with noises. The concierge was helpful (despite being so busy) and got us the activities we are looking for. Keep up the good work."
922,Excellent from the moment we walked in.,50,December 2018,"Service beyond compare. Felt like royalty as every person with whom you come into contact remembers your name and personally greets you each time he/she sees you. From John, Elizabeth, Priscillia, Grant, Anka, Bayu, Arja, Dhani, Muslimin, Chyanti (sp?), Yoga, and so many others who helped ensure we enjoyed each moment of our stay. No request went unanswered. Whether it was a recommendation for food or how to get our money back from an unscrupulous money exchange, everyone at this property was available for assistance. Breakfast daily at The Seminyak Kitchen, headed by Anka, did not disappoint. From the personal greeting upon arrival, to our morning coffee and tea arriving as soon as we were seated, to the unbelievable selection of eats and the willingness of the staff to custom make our special pancakes, we easily (and happily) gained a few extra pounds! By the time we had to depart, we felt like family. This does not happen often, so when it does, it bears mentioning. This property knows how to make guests feel appreciated. Thank you!"
923,WelCUM,30,January 2019,"Amazing breakfast, nice pool, staff are a bit slow but that‚Äôs ok as nice to slowdown m. The Tacos from outside are nice.

Seminyak is a really fun place in Bali.

The pic is what is in our room which is really disappointing"
924,Family Vacay,50,January 2019,"We just spent 6 days in a interconnecting room with our small boys, so much room, the food is redic!! The breaky so much variety!! I wish they had a normal porridge option or dairy free options but that‚Äôs only coz I‚Äôm vegan lol
The New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner was spectacular!! You should be so proud of what you have created!! To be honest one of the main standouts for us was the energy and vibe of the staff?? They seems so happy to be at work, so helpful!! And the fact you have the managers walking around the complex is incredible!! Made everyone feel important and so friendly!! We were Travelling as a group of 8 and all felt the same!

We will be back for sure!! The spa was beautiful, boys my boys enjoyed the kids club!

I would stay jan the 2bdr next time we come!

But standout was the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner so much variety and the staff were so helpful, friendly and great moral!!"
925,Great stay right in the heart of it all. Friendly staff great breakfast great spa great food all round,50,January 2019,"Fantastic service great prices and wonderful staff commutable bedand rooms with a great pool bar entertainment and fantastic breakfast lunches and dinner. Ticks all the boxes it like our second home only where they do everything for you loved the staff, food, rooms live entertainment every night in the pool bar area. Great allrounder."
926,Normal Hotel - With Great Staff,30,November 2018,"The pool isn't that big and you'll find it difficult to find chairs / beanbags around the pool. It was quite busy when we attended and that is to be expected?

Room was quite nice, however, had no aircon for the first night. Had technicians working in the room for two hours in our room.

Popcorn was a nice touch while waiting for the room to be fixed.

Had issues with the restaurant and the serving sizes. If your a normal sized adult that likes steak, you would be lucky to get 70 grams. Ended up sending the meal back as it was a ridiculous. Staff handled the situation quite well."
927,Family of nine,50,January 2019,"Would like to thank Surya and his team for contributing to our fun stay at the hotel playing a minute to win it and at the private beach getting a great deal on surf boards. It was awesome.
Thank you also to the rest of the staff
Who also made our stay enjoyable."
928,Good service,50,December 2018,"5 star . Most of a staff are super friendly and this is our 2nd time staying at the hotel room is awesome nice pool and many more
Thank you to surya Yudi jaya and Wahyu you guys are so awesome keep the good work and also to the rest of the staff üëçüëçüëç"
929,Classically Home,50,January 2018,"We stay at our fair share of Marriotts when my boyfriend and I travel for work. This Marriott was a breath of fresh air after a long day of traveling. How the grounds were laid out and the pool set up had a calming effect. You just felt welcomed and relaxed as you walked through the lobby and the grounds.

The international breakfast was out of this world!! When you can have ramen for breakfast you know you‚Äôre not in California anymore. The food was delicious and we easily ate way too much, but we were so happy!

The rooms were clean and neat. Very pretty simple architectural touches that made you know you were out of the states and overseas (in the best way possible!). The chocolates that they place in your room to welcome you were positively heavenly!"
930,Love this hotel so much!!,50,December 2018,"Amazing place fantastic and brilliant!!! We just spent three wonderful nights here! Special mention to miss Penny, Jaya and Wika, Jeri, Digo and all the staff here what a fantastic hotel we loved it so much!! We left today and didn't get to say goodbye to everyone, we have arrived at Mulia today and I want to be back at Courtyard!! Everyone is so warm and friendly and the staff really make this place special. I am a first timer to Bali and the experience I had here makes me want to go back to courtyard again! I loved it so much here and highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Bali as it is so special
THANK YOU COURTYARD BY MARRIOTT
WE LOVE YOU! LISA & MR DANIEL Rm 160 Om Swastiastu!!!"
931,The Staffs Make it Special,50,November 2018,"I would have given 3 stars if it was not because of the staffs. Nothing to rave about the location (beach is walking distance, they have mini market doorstep) and the ammenities in the room is so mediocre. The room itself is good with flat TV, working desk, and well designed spacious bathroom.

During my 3-night stay, we are pleased by the attention of the staffs and they way they treat us as their guests. It‚Äôs like they are trying to be your friend. It applies to the waiters in Seminyak Kitchen and even to the room service people where they leave you small gifts with kind notes

They are also welcome to LGBT people..
I observed quite a number of guests coming to this hotel and enjoy their time together.

To sum up:
+ room is spacious with good lighting

+ breakfast is excellent for service and quality! They even bother to change some of the menu every day so the guests do not get bored. Well done Seminyak Kitchen!!

- ammenities in the room can be made better. Provide comb and better toothbrush, for example. My toothbrush broke after two times of ussage. It hurts my gum

- insulation from the noise outside or maube a bigger gym to accomodate the number of guests (barely enough for 7 people)"
932,The Perfect Place to Stay - 3rd visit,50,October 2018,"This was our family‚Äôs 3rd stay at CY and the charm is still there.
We were is room 137 which is a pool access room. It is worth paying extra for this so we could move between pool lounge and our room with ease. We found this super helpful with the kids (8&6).

The breakfast is still one of the best is Bali and is the best way to start your day. So many options and all great quality.

The food around the pool was also great and the taco truck is the driveway is perfect for an easy lunch.

The atmosphere around the pool suits everyone. Great music and plenty of sun. There weren‚Äôt as many families here as we had experienced previously but still enough children to play with.

My son was sick when we arrived after getting gastro from his sister. Our room was thoroughly cleaned with extensive sanitising. They even put an air purifier in our room so the rest of us didn‚Äôt get sick. Little touches like this are what sets this resort apart from the rest.

Location is spot on, short walk to beach for sunset and a 15 minute walk to eat street for dinner.

We love making memories at CY Marriott and can‚Äôt wait to come back again soon."
933,Nice Hotel,40,December 2018,"The room and bathroom size was okay, not too spacious. It can only fit 2 adult people at most. The amenities were standard, no cotton pads or cotton buds provided. The breakfast has a lot of varieties, but taste wise was standard. Luckily, you can always go out of the hotel for a better breakfast since it is in Seminyak. They provide a free shuttle to bring you to the courtyard's private beach (free water and towel) and eat street. The whole staff was great, from the receptionists, concierge, housekeeping and others. They always greet and welcome you warmly. I was given a free wooden boat from BAGUS, the housekeeping staff on Christmas Eve. Thanks for the hospitality."
934,Great hotel for families!,40,December 2018,"We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 9 nights in December and had a wonderful time. We booked the hotel based on positive reviews we had read, its central location in Seminyak and the fact that it had a kids club which would cater for our four children. The rooms were clean and we were able to arrange interconnecting rooms. Housekeeping always did a good job of cleaning the room and we would often come back to the room to find towels made into the shapes of animals and small gifts like keyrings, magnets, etc. A special mention to Surya (and there were another 2 room attendants whos names I have sadly forgotten). Staff at the hotel were always polite and helpful. The buffet breakfast was good - we also got some additional inclusions in our package including a free dinner, lunch, 2 x tacos and massage. The kids loved the kidsclub - a special mention to Chandra and Ketut who looked after our children including our 6 month old daughter. They were great with the kids and the kids thoroughly enjoyed their time in the kids club (particularly the movie nights). The hotel is located in a good location in Seminyak and is a rough 5 minute drive to many popular restaurants. There is also the hotel shuttle which will take you into the heart of Seminyak or the beach. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Seminyak, particularly to families!"
935,"Nice, but things missing...",30,December 2018,"The resort has lovely and friendly staff who always greet you with a smile. We stayed in a deluxe pool view room on the 3rd floor. It was right next to the breakfast area which was great. The room; however, was fairly basic. Nothing too special, some limited bathroom amenities and kitchenette supplies.
The resort does not have a hot tub or jacuzzi which was noted quickly, having visited many other resorts. The pool is clean, however, the swim up bar area didn‚Äôt have much seating/tanning space.
The breakfast buffet was nice, nothing extra that other resorts don‚Äôt have. Fairly good location if you‚Äôre willing to walk about 10-15 minutes to get to ‚ÄúEat Street‚Äù"
936,Best Hotel by far,50,December 2018,"We stayed at the hotel for 8 days in December. What an amazing time we had. The hotel had shuttles to the beach and a spot just for residents with free WiFi and cold water.
The staff is just amazing. They are actually happy to go to work and they are hard working, kind and caring. The room was spotless. The breakfast was just amazing. I cannot speak enough about this hotel. I will definately return and recommend it to family and friends."
937,Loved our stay here!,50,December 2018,"Stayed there for 2 days and simply loved the place. The facilities offered are really good be it the pool / pool bar, kids care, beach club (Dedicated space for Courtyard customers at Seminyak beach. The beach is at walking distance. They also have a shuttle service to the beach club.)

The staff is very courteous and room services are quite efficient.
The big breakfast spread is scrumptious (specially loved the Ice creams in the breakfast :D)

Happy to recommend this place to anyone visiting Bali!"
938,Pool bar,50,December 2018,"Come here. Great pool bar. Great service. Very fair prices. You need to hope it rains, you‚Äôll understand.friendly and beautiful smile for Chinta at pool bar she make me fell good and I‚Äôm so happy...everything good..I will come to the next years..and see chinta again...‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
939,Such an amazing resort! Couldn‚Äôt be happier,50,December 2018,"We stayed here for 4 nights and we are so beyond impressed with the resort facilities, staff, food and drinks. Room service was always delivered within half an hour, the cleaners went to extra lengths daily to add little touches eg towel animals and chocolates to our room, the breakfast buffet was amazing and the staff were always super friendly. Some particular staff members ets really stood out for us and made our time very memorable and feel like family during our stay.
Ari from conceirge - went above and beyond to fetch us a taxi when it was raining, he insisted on waiting on the street for us and then loaded our bags into the car
Hari from the Mexican truck out front - was always up for a chat and laugh, we ordered cocktails on the go daily and he would always make sure we were happy with them & recommended several great things around the resort to do
Widya- served us several times around the pool bar and was always smiling and super friendly.
We had such an unforgettable stay and will definitely be back - Thankyou SO much!"
940,Wonderful family getaway,50,December 2018,"We stayed 8 nights and enjoyed every one of them. Great final night service at Seminyak Kitchen by Feby. Rooms were great, well serviced. Highly recommend the Balinese banquet on the Wednesday night. Good location with beach and markets close by. Ubud well accessible with car hire for a daily rate of around $50 Aus. Will return."
941,Another happy return,50,December 2018,"We cant fault this hotel. Andi and Rudi thank you for all the gifts left for the children each day in the room and your immaculate cleaning.
Thanks to the breakfast staff and the buggy coordinator...always sp helpful. The pool, breakfast and rooms remain a high standard and it's a perfect location. Look forward to returning soon."
942,Amazing time!,50,December 2018,"This hotel offered myself and my daughter a truly amazing experience from start to finsish! From the moment we stepped in the door everyone bent over backwards to ensure we had a wonderful time! If you‚Äôre traveling to Bali, I highly recommend you stay here. A personal highlight I really enjoyed was the Balinese tradional dinner, and our host for the evening, Widi Juli Darma was just such a treat! They get 5+ from me for offering an excellent customer experience!!!"
943,Great as always,50,December 2018,"Great hotel, centrally located . Very attentive staff.

This was our 5th visit to the courtyard Marriott and as always it did not disappoint. Breakfast was great. The pool menu has reduced in size over the years but was sufficient. Staff are very good and remember your name which makes it very personal and are always willing to help. Something new we found was a little gift everyday in your rooms . Haven't tried the spa so cannot comment though heard its great.
All the staff were great but some names to mention. At the front dest Wahyu and Francisca, Guest relations - Eka who made a point to ask if we were comfortable and if there was anything she could help with. Concierge (they are amazing in assisting you with resturant bookings and what to get where and taking you to eat street or the beach by buggy. Names to mention here are Hardi, Arya, Spari and Ari. At the pool Penni and her team including Chinta and Narita were great. And at breakfast Oka at the egg station was such a happy chap always going over and above.

Will be back next year."
944,Exceeded Expectations,50,December 2018,"We stayed at this Courtyard for 4 nights and it was a wonderful experience. The employees were all very friendly and helpful, and the concierge staff were always reliable and had very good recommendations. Specifically, I'd like to mention Chinta and Hardi. Chinta works at the pool bar and spent time with us answering questions about all kinds of things, from help with the menu to fair local prices for t-shirts. She was wonderful, and was indicative of the service oriented atmosphere of all the employees there. Hardi was one of the concierges and he went out of his way to give us the best recommendations, book meals, answer all our questions, and made us feel like he was assigned only to us. It felt like everyone there had the same ability to focus everything on the one person they were helping at that moment.

Overall, the room and facilities were comfortable. The pool was clean with plenty of room, and the food was good.

We would love to return next time we have the opportunity.

One thing to mention is stay away from the tour agency called ""Awesome Nusa Penida"". We wanted to have a great experience and tour of that island and the concierge recommended this agency and helped us book with them. You can search for that agency on TripAdvisor and read the review I wrote, it isn't good. If you want to see that island you're better off going with a tour agency that has a lot of good feedback on TripAdvisor, so do a little research before booking like we should have.

Otherwise, this hotel was great and, to reiterate, the staff were by far the best thing about it."
945,Honeymoon,50,December 2018,"My husband and I eloped to Bali and when we were discussing where to stay, it was an absolute no brainer.

We stayed at the courtyard Marriott the same time last year, and I am so happy to report that not only have they matched our expectations based on our previous stay, but somehow they have managed to exceed them!

The maintenance and cleanliness of the Courtyard is second to none. The amenities leave you wanting for nothing, and can I just say that the staff are incredible! The pool bar has the most attentive, friendly and courteous staff - I could hang down there all day! They make you feel like you‚Äôre hanging out with old friends. We were so pleased to see Penny and Arca were still working here, and we made new friends in Mob, Wika, Dede, Ayu, Rehan, Narita and Hendra. Maria and Arja in Seminyak kitchen remembered us too which is just so lovely!

I wish I could give this place and their staff so many more stars than just 5!

Keep up the good work, we can‚Äôt wait to see you all again in 2019!"
946,Excellent pool facilities,50,September 2018,"A long boys weekend with my son. Room was fine, huge shower with good pressure. The best part of this hotel are the swimming pools and swim up bar. The drinks and snacks were very well priced with also happy hour. Great base for Seminyak."
947,Beyond fantastic (here's why):,50,December 2018,"I had a good impression of the Courtyard by Marriott chain after staying in your Nusa Dua hotel the last time I was in Bali so this time round, when we decided to be based in Seminyak, the choice was clear.

Delighted to say that you were able to surpass our expectations again. Happy to list down the reasons:

1. Hotel layout and rooms: much as I expected, very pleasant with 2 pools, pool bar, nice gym, spa and garden. Rooms were clean, new and well equipped. Wifi worked with no issues.

2. Service was consistently excellent, prompt and friendly. Staff appeared well trained.

3. Bonus points for the breakfast buffet, good spread of local and the usual western dishes. Egg station was excellent, offering eggs benedict which was a pleasant surprise.

4. Seems like they are trying to move towards Club Med's model of providing things to do over the day - we can highly recommend the morning Yoga on Fridays, great instructor.

5. We were very pleased also by the freebies that were given to us on check in (not sure how long this will go on) - 2 course free dinner at the restaurant, free Balinese massage (note: the spa is excellent and comparable to prices in town so really no reason not to go) and a free taco from their food truck outside.

Needless to say, if you are staying in the Seminyak area, this is a very excellent choice. Highly recommended!"
948,Amazing Service,50,December 2018,"We stayed here twice on our trip; at the start and the end. The location is amazing and they have excellent service.

Our deepest appreciation to Priscilla, who knowing it was our last day in Bali and that we had returned - upgraded our room to one with a pool view even before we had requested anything!

Their breakfast buffet is one of the best I‚Äôve seen and the room was comfortable beyond comfort!

Their pool bar is also lovely! We would definitely come back more often!"
949,GREAT LOCATION,50,December 2018,"I wouyld like to thank Widi, beacuse he was very helpful to us, he drove us to the beach and gave us a great time during our stay here.
The Hotel was very nice, central to a lot of very good restaurants, has a great pool and bar, probably the best attribute of this Hotel is its proximity to the beach with its own private beach bar, we were able to hire a surf board and swim between the flags, plenty of restaurants on offer, cheap beer and a great time overall here at the Marriot Court Yard Bali."
950,Our stay at the Courtyard seminyak,50,December 2018,"We enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard as part of our honeymoon, the staff were very welcoming on our arrival especially Chinta at the pool bar, she is an amazing person and so friendly. Her service was impeccable and treated us like long time friends. People like this makes your stay even more special. Megan and Envor"
951,Lovely Hotel,40,December 2018,"We checked out of The Breezes early and checked into the Courtyard by Marriot instead, the staff were so lovely, helpful and friendly.
The restaurant had delicious food, we are quite healthy eaters so our special food requests was never a problem for the Chefs which was much appreciated that they were so willing to accomodate what we liked to have.
The popcorn was also a nice gesture in the lobby if you were feeling peckish.
Good Location a bit out of the hustle and bustle however still able to walk around the area easily to find a 7/11 or a massage, money exchange etc.
The room was nice, bright and modern.
Couldn‚Äôt really fault anything here and will definitely go back to stay there again."
952,Beer pong game with Wahyu and Surya,50,December 2018,The staff waved us over to play a game of beer pong by the pool and it was great fun!! Surya and Wahyu were very friendly and encouraging. They were also very good at the game! This definitely is one of the highlights of my trip :-) it is great that the hotel offers such activities to engage the guests.
953,Best Courtyard ever,50,November 2018,"It's a long over due review. Stayed for one week in November for business, the hotel well exceeded my expectation.

You get a large size room, very nice pool and pool bar, good restaurants, and most importantly everyone in the hotel from GM to receptionist to people in the restaurants are all warm and attentive, go over and beyond to meet our request. It's safe to say the service in this hotel is better than some of the Ritz Carltons. Nothing to complaint over the one week stay there, highly recommended."
954,Courtyard Marriot Seminyak,50,December 2018,"Chinta is amazing in the bar. Very friendly and accommodating.
The motel is lovely and seems relaxed with a nice atmosphere. Clean and comfortable, all the staff are lovely and can‚Äôt do enough for you. The food seems to be quite ok so far."
955,"Outstanding Service, Value for Money, Excellent Location, Awesome Pool and Suitable for all Travellers",50,November 2018,"This Resort is my number 1 choice when staying in Bali. The staff are amazing and the service standards are exceptional. The hotel is conveniently located near the beach, cafes, restaurants and the shopping district. You can step out from the hotel to the shopping and restaurant strip and transport is easy from the front of the hotel. The restaurant and bars are great value for money and the food is delicious. The rooms are very clean, well maintained, quiet, modern and the beds are very comfortable. The pool is massive and targets for everyone and there are ample sun bed and bean bags. As a repeat guest, I would definitely recommend this resort to all travellers ÔÅä"
956,Modern & Chilled,40,October 2018,"Modern western-styled hotel with a wonderful spa.

Excellent customer service by reception, spa and room service staff. Rovina was very helpful and was able to make reservations at local restaurants for us. Nothing was too much trouble at reception.

-The pool area was relaxing and had plenty of space for guests.
-Blissful spa and massage experience.
-Rooms were a good size and comfortable. -Room service was easy to order and tasty.
-Unfortunately, breakfast was a bit of a cattle market, great selection but way too busy and we went off-season.
-Golf buggies to beach were very handy and a good laugh.

I would not stay again, as I felt the hotel was typical of any large chain and lacked individual authenticity. There was no real authentic Balinese charm and I would seek a hotel that at least tried to embrace local Balinese culture."
957,Pleasant 3 nights stay,50,December 2018,"My sister and I stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 3 nights and we enjoyed our time here. The location was great; there's a buggy service that drop us at the eat street. There are also food places and shops down the hotel stretch, which makes it really convenient.

During our stay, we also attended the morning yoga class with Yudi. He was patient and ensure that could keep up. We enjoyed the session.

Also, special thanks to Priscilla, Grant Young and Arya who were ever friendly and hospitable who made our stay a pleasant one. A big thank you to the team!"
958,50th birthday celebration,50,November 2018,"What a fabulous hotel. It‚Äôs in a great location. Very clean, comfortable rooms. We had a room in the ground floor which stepped straight into the pool. Fabulous. The food is delicious. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again. Thank you for the cake for my birthday."
959,Pool Bar,50,December 2018,The service at the pool bar is excellent. We were always greeted with friendly smiles and a chat. All the staff were great. We spoke a lot to Chinta who was really nice and helpful and went out of her way to make our stay pleasurable. There was also another girl who unfortunately I didn't get her name but my husband had a problem with his sandal and she went and got some super glue and it was fixed. We were planning to look for a shop that sold super glue but it was not a problem for the staff. Thank you so much you were all great.
960,Disorganised & Not Properly Trained Staff,30,December 2018,"Checking was smooth and appreciated the upgrade based on my Lifetime Marriott Platinum Premier status to a suite.

Breakfast was a mess and waiter couldn't understand my order for a pot of Jasmin tea. Getting Manager on Duty to deal with the issue was an uphill battle and left without eating anything.

Front desk called me two minutes past noon informing about noon checkout time when I have confirmed 4PM.

When I was checking out they had a very noisy group of 30 or so mainlanders checking in."
961,"Great hotel, great hospitality.",50,December 2018,"Super convininient, from the check-in experience, thanks to Ms with a beautiful and Curly hair (i forgot to write down her name)
The pool bar staff was excellent, Hendra especially! thank you!
Oh not to mention David from reservation who sincerly kind to make all my demand happened.
Wonderful hotel, excelent service!"
962,Your the Best!,50,November 2018,"Wow, we had an amazing 5 days here, would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to anyone.
Staff were always friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble.
Thankyou to Baskara, who kept our room spotless, left lovely little notes which brought a smile to our faces once we returned to the room.
Thank you to Penni, Wadyi, Angaa, Jaya and the rest of the pool bar staff who were always smiling and ready to help with any questions we had.
Thank you to Ita from Zanti Spa and retreat, a wonderful 60 minute Balinese Massage with my husband."
963,Above & Beyond,50,December 2018,"On a day trip to Nusa Penida Island, I cut my hand pretty badly, resulting in minor surgery. I contacted the hotel for information about Medical Services. The General Manager, Mr John Woolley, who happened to be on Duty coordinated it with the Front Office Manager Pak Ramu, to have the Doctor ready on my return.

It is reassuring that the hotel has a Doctor on site available for guests needing medical care. BIG THANKS to both Mr John Woolley, Pak Ramu & team for their care and attention, as well as the medical team for their swift action attending to my injury."
964,Amazing resort & friendly staff!,50,December 2018,"Amazing resort & friendly staff!
So immaculate and clean, food is amazing! staff so friendly, especially Hendra, Dewa, Mob, Atro and Peni!
Breakfast was sooo yum, popcorn machine could use some butter! Lacking sun beds for busy times!
But apart from that amazing place and definitely coming back!!"
965,Best hotel,50,December 2018,"This is my second time back to the courtyard. Love this place during the day I can choose to socialize by the pool bar or relaxing on the sun lounge. The vibe can be compared to a beach club.
But what keeps me coming back? Is the staff. Never have I been to a hotel with more enduring than the courtyard. Hendra at the pool bar makes a day by the pool a party for everyone around the bar!
Be back very soon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
966,"Honest, Helpful and Immaculate",50,December 2018,"This is a lovely hotel. It‚Äôs modern, immaculate and so close to everything. Can‚Äôt thank them enough when I panicked and called to say I thought I had left my room safe open. They reassured me and took immediate action and secured and photographed my room. All was fine and I went on to enjoy enjoy my day trip. Thanks to Tika and all involved for your honesty and amazing security and service. Highly recommend."
967,Outstanding,50,December 2018,This resort was just stunning with fabulous service and an amazing pool which is too easy to laze by every day. The staff here are extremely friendly and ready to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Special thanks to WIDYA and HENDRA for their standout hospitality and also MARIA from the hotel restaurant for her care and compassion to my sick friend. 10/10 would recommend
968,"Big, busy and noisy resort",30,November 2018,"Big, busy and noisy - these are the words I can use about Courtyard by Marriott. The rooms are large, clean and very well equipped. Bathroom is also big, but has just shower. Everything is ok, but somehow lacks individuality and charm.

Breakfast is like the hotel itself: huge selection, even ice cream, but looks better than tastes. You can choose from a variety of fresh juices, but - yes they did it - they did make fresh juices worse than the concentrated ones. Chicken dim sum was totally spoiled and smelled awful. After we showed it to the personnel, they quickly removed it without any apologies.

Very friendly, helpful staff."
969,The Best place to stay in Seminyak Bali,50,November 2018,"Excellent Stay! This is probably the best stay ever with my family in Marriott Group of Hotels. You set the bar so high that now I start expecting this kind of excellent services from every Marriott group hotel I will stay in in future.

Hotel staff have gone to extra mile to provide excellent services to us. Guest Relations team - Prisallia, Bayu, Concierge team, Housekeeping team - Diandini, Dewi, Pool bar team, Seminyak Kitchen team - all have made us feel so special and made our stay so comfortable and enjoyable.

Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen was really one of the best we had in so far. My family really enjoyed the stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali.

Thank you to Grant Young and his team's unmatched hospitality. It exceeded our expectations.

We look forward to stay at this amazing hotel again."
970,Pool bar,50,December 2018,"Everyone had been kind and fast at respite my requests to make my stay here be the best I have experienced. I ate at the Pool Bar for lunch, my waitress Chinta was amazing, so sweet and made sure my drink stayed full and that my meal was perfect! I most certainly will come back."
971,Meeting,50,November 2018,"Good location not far from the beach. Plenty of restaurants and bars around the hotel.
Rooms are rather nice size with good internet connection. The breakfast buffet is excellent with plenty to choose from. There is a big pool in the courtyard with a nice pool bar. The bars and restaurants in the hotel close at 10 pm every night after which no loud noise is allowed in the hotel. A bit unusual for the bars to close so early in the evening but luckily just outside the hotel you can enjoy refreshements all night long.
As one might guess this hotel is packed with tourists.
The location could not be much better. I recommend highly to try this hotel."
972,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff,50,November 2018,"We stayed for a week at your lovely hotel and had a wonderful time. The rooms were lovely and clean and your housekeeping staff are to be commended. Actually, all your staff should be commended. They were helpful and friendly, and were very gracious with my attempts at learning balinease and indonesian. Both restaurant staff and bar staff addressed us by name which was amazing considering the number of guests the hotel must see. As did the concierge.

I should specifically mention Baskara, our extremely thorough room attendant and also the attendant that folded my roommates clothing during our trip. Agna, one of your bar staff should also be acknowledged for his wonderful service and the fact he remember our names. Lastly, one of your breakfast attendants went the extra mile to go across to the mini-mart and purchase a specific drink one of your guests requested. Unfortunately, I did not see his name.

Breakfast caters for everyone, and the iced lattes are lovely. The pool bar offers a good range of food and drinks throughout the day. Not to mention the various happy hour offers.

I will definitely stay here again. It exceeded my expectations."
973,Marriott has it all worked out !!,50,November 2018,"Stayed at the Marriott and they know what customers want. From great packages deals etc to fantastic assistance, guidance when heading out around Bali. Great pool and kids club. Here we are at the buffet dinner (whole pig on a spit) with the super helpful widi - thanks for a great stay"
974,WOW!,50,November 2018,"We checked in after a 6 hour flight so we were a bit tired. The hotel's location is extremely convenient as there are alot of restaurants around the area that are acessible by foot ( there are also plenty of taxis that stop by). The beach is also only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. When we checked in, we were greeted with a delicious tea as well as a warm towel to clean with. The hotel itself is very modern and nice looking. There is a nice sized pool with a water bar. Considering that I am from the U.S, I found everything from room service to the drinks to be extremely cheap! The breakfast was extremely good so make sure to try it out. As far as the room goes, the room was nice and clean and very spacious. The shower is huge! so that was pretty nice! Our room had a view of the pool and so it was nice to relax outside in the balcony at night. Down by the bar, there are alot of activities that go on in the afternoon. We got to see some a fire dance, as well as live music that was very pleasant. Overall, I had an amazing experience with Courtyard, the staff was amazing and very attentive to detail. Although this hotel might be a bit pricey, I definitely would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a great vacation."
975,Incredible Staff,50,November 2018,"This is my second time staying at the Courtyard by Mariott. The location is really convenient and central, the rooms are great, but the most outstanding thing about the Courtyard Mariott is its staff.

The staff throughout the hotel, especially in Seminyak Kitchen could not do enough to help me. They provided a range of gluten-free options, they also offered a range of Asian food, Indonesian food, and Western food.

I would like to say a huge thank you to Widi, he helped me out so much and his service was incredible!
I will definitely stay here again :)"
976,AMAZING HOTEL,50,November 2018,"It‚Äôs my first time staying at Courtyard Seminyak. The room is fantastic and big enough for me and my friend. Spent time a lot by the pool and having some cocktails. I always get the frozen mojito! The staff are so friendly. Thank you HENDRA for always looking after me. Also the bar boys Mob, Arca, Dewa, Dede! Going to miss this place a lot!"
977,Such a sanctuary in busy busy Seminyak,50,November 2018,"The staff are out of this world, everyone goes out of their way to help, All the guys at the pool bar made us feel like part of the family - special mention to Chinta xxxxxxx breakfast is great and the location perfect and central - also close enough to the beach"
978,Perfect place to Stay,40,November 2018,"The hotel is centrally located, middle of the main hub of Seminyank area.
The check inn and check out was quick and hassle free and we were offered beers/ice tea as welcome drink.
The rooms and bathrooms were pretty huge as we were given a free upgrade. The rooms had balconies with sitting.
The room service is a little slow and we had to call 4 times(45 minutes) for water and glasses.
The breakfast spread is too good, Indian food has been taken into consideration.
The pool side of the hotel is extremely classy and has a perfect ambiance.
Overall we had a very good stay and enjoyed ourselves."
979,Short but amazing stay,50,November 2018,"My husband and I stayed there last week, a really brief trip to escape work. Most staffs were attentive and friendly - with few that left us with a very positive impression.

We arrived at midnight and was greeted by Nyssa. Her warm welcome and kind assistance was definitely appreciated. She helped us to get a bike ready for us the next morning eventhough we requested upon check-in past midnight.

Arja from the restaurant stood out as well. Despite of busy breakfast service, he stopped to check on us and chatted with us. When he realised my husband was out having a smoke, he quickly rushed to bring him his coffee. His thoughtfulness really is worth mentioning.

One more person who left a positive remark was Arca from the pool bar (hopefully we get his name right). Knowing that we didn‚Äôt have extra copies of the Marriott discount card, upon settling the bill, he came back with extra copies for us. All that without even asking!

All and all, our stay was great, food was amazing (we also had midnight in-room dining both night - first night was because we‚Äôre hungry, second night was because we knew the food was good). Spa was great, we ended our trip with a relaxing massage before heading to airport.

Thank you for making our mini-honeymoon memorable üòä"
980,Family holiday,40,November 2018,"A stunning resort with amazing staff to ensure your stay is first class. The huge pool with pool bar was a hit with our teenage kids, as was the popcorn machine at the foyer. Buffet breakfast has a huge variety in the Seminyak kitchen and we ate lunch by the pool most days. Our two bedroom suite was very spacious and immaculately clean. The friendly housekeeping staff greeted us each morning with a pleasant smile and I have to say a huge thank you to Baskara for his effort. My only criticism is the constant noise of people stomping, dragging chairs and slamming doors from the floor above was annoying and hard to sleep some nights. I would love to return again if this problem were fixed somehow."
981,Hotel,50,November 2018,"Great place great vibe
Service is wonderful staff are very friendly
Pool and swim up bar great music and cocktails
Rooms are spacious and clean
Very relaxed atmosphere and close to restaurant and Seminyak beach only a few hundred metres down the road"
982,The perfect hotel for our first time in Bali,50,November 2018,"We could not have asked for more from this hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful and made check in seamless. The breakfast was delicious and had so much choice! The pool and pool bar were the perfect place to spend an afternoon in the sun (frozen mojitos were incredible). The room was modern, large bed, gorgeous bathroom and a balcony looking out to the pools. Finally the location was ideal for the beach or walking to the nearby restaurants and bars! We would definitely go back!"
983,Great stay,40,November 2018,Had a wonderful experience with this hotel. right from the pre-arrival till check out. The service level of this hotel is great. Keep it up guys. Very helpful staff and very friendly atmosphere. Definitely would recommend this hotel for couples and especially families. there are alot of children friendly activities and there is a kids room. the pool is awesome. pool bar great to chill out. location is great. 5mins walk to seminyak beach and 10mins to the shopping areas and popular restaurants.
984,A Pleasant Brief Stay,40,November 2018,"Stayed in this hotel for a business meeting. I arrived around 6 pm for check in and there were 3 guests queueing. Since my office has made the reservation, check in was a quick one. The resort was located in the central area if activity in Seminyak. When you get out of the resort, plenty of reataurants, local shops, groceries, and many else were around. Beach was about 400m away from this resort.
The room itself was a standard one. I took the kingbed room and it has free wifi. The bed was very cozy and the quilt is very comforting, not warm. i had nice sleep on the 2 nights here.
Bathroom has separate shower and toilet. Hair dryer is available and it has full amenities such as bath gel, shampoo, conditioner, brush kit. However the hoisekeeper has forgotten to add the bath kit on the second night, fortunately I have brought mine along just in case. Also my room was facing the street in front of the hotel and it was not sound proofed. The sound of motorbikes passing by especially at night was clearly heard. Since I am a ‚Äòdead-sleeper‚Äô this was not affecting my sleep. This is why I gave it a four stars.
Breakfast was great. Meals were various including nice healthy options you can self picked on the fridge such as various infused water, berries, cheese, sugarless yoghurt, muesli etc. You can also ask for freshly brewed coffee. The Balinese coffee is a must to try.
Overall, it is a good option for your stay in Seminyak. But since there are lots of options in Seminyak, I will have to try some other resorts next time."
985,25th Anniversary 2 week Bali trip,50,November 2018,Hotel üè® here is great Good location and 5-10 min walk to the beachfront. Hotel staff amazing at front desk bell boy and Pool servers Sri was our server yesterday and was very attentive and helped us out with things to do in the area. Can‚Äôt say enough about the staff here. Rooms were great as well. Recommend this hotel
986,Amazing Hotel with even better staff,50,November 2018,"I have been coming to Bali for many years and have stayed in many resorts. This time I came to Bali I wanted to propose to my partner. We arrived at the hotel and I saw they had a romantic dinner on the rooftop. This would be the perfect opportunity. The staff went out of their way to make sure everything went according to plan, as of course it was a surprise. A massive thank you to Vani, Dwi and Saih who took care of everything The food the atmosphere and the service was faultless. This was the perfect evening.
The hotel is amazing and the rooms are amazing. We have spent a lot of time by the pool and Arta was sensational and always made sure we had enough very cold bintang.
I would also like to make special mention of the management team especially John for making us feel like VIP's . This will be our hotel from now on. I can't thank you all enough."
987,Amazing stay,50,November 2018,"Currently staying at the Marriott and the experience has been nothing short of incredible. From the moment we checked in the staff have been so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble.

I would like to make a special mention of the staff at Seminyak Kitchen in particular Maria. She has been so friendly and made us feel very welcome from the first time we met her. A true asset to the team at Courtyard.

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, lounging around the pool and listening to the live music at night. The hotel is in a great location with restaurants, spas and other attractions located nearby. This is my 5th time in Bali and I will definitely be coming back to the Marriott next time. Thankyou to all the beautiful staff who made the experience so memorable."
988,Good hotel,50,December 2017,"I love the place. Beautiful pool. They even have activities planned. Their kids club has PS! Pool table and Table Tennis. Best of all, Spa Bali is next to the hotel. Everyday massage.

Breakfast is good too."
989,Great hotel in Seminyak with outstanding service !,50,October 2018,"If you want friendly outstanding service this hotel is for you. All staff were friendly, engaging and nothing was a problem. A special mention goes to Grant (Operations Manager) and Priscillia from the Customer service team who went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and easy - Thank you. Very good buffet breakfast, big variety, the Juice bar was great- Perhaps the bakery section could have been better. Staff are very attentive and helpful, its evident they are a good team and all work well together. Tip: if you want a sun bed around the pool get there early. The Gym was probably the best hotel Gym we have used. The hotel location was ideal, not far from the beach, restaurants and bars. The hotel golf buggy service will drop you at various locations. We will recommend this hotel to our friends, and will definitely be back"
990,Wonderful stay,50,November 2018,My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 days. Very happy with the level of service here. Everyone we met seemed enthusiastic and ready to help at all times. Especially impressed with the service staff at breakfast buffet and would like to commend Oka from the egg station as he was always smiley and often engaged us in conversation as we waited for our eggs to be done :) Even the staff who cleaned our room would leave us little trinkets and nice messages. We felt very much at home here.
991,Simply amazing,50,November 2018,"This place is incredible. From check in to check out our stay was absolutely seamless! Staff were incredible and genuinely lovely. Breakfast was unbelievable! The facilties and the pool and pool bar amazing! Short walk from the beach, shops and restaurants. Would highly recommended the room with a balcony over a pool side room. We had a lot more privacy. Would definitely come back!"
992,Great stay,50,November 2018,This was my third trip to Courtyard Marriott. Spent five days relaxing by the pool. Was a wonderful holiday. Will be back again soon. Special Thankyou to Grant who was very helpful both before and during my stay.
993,Brilliant stay,50,November 2018,"This hotel was brilliant the staff can‚Äôt do enough for you customer service 10/10 massive shout out to the snack van guys! Always made me a brilliant coffee ‚Äúweak skinny one sugar latte lady! ‚Äú the food also on the van absolutely delicious üòã

The hotel room cleaners made our rooms spotless everyday and even made Our daughter animals out of towels which you don‚Äôt tend to get anymore!

Breakfast ü•û is amazing freshly cooked on request eggs!

Pool is fab it‚Äôs huge! Love the fact that if you hog the beds and go off shopping or breakfast etc after 30mins you stuff gets taken Off! Good work guys!!!!!

Security is top notch always check when you walk in made me feel safe!

Overall a brilliant stay will return"
994,Wow!!,50,November 2018,"Had 3 nights here in early November- fantastic hotel - as you will see in other reviews the breakfast is amazing - I think the best I have ever had and I travel quite a lot.

Location is fab - close to beach, bars, restaurants, shops and spas

Feels v safe area to wander around and best of all the staff are super friendly and helpful

Totally recommend!!"
995,Courtyard Nailed it!!!,50,November 2018,"Prior to my stay I had read many reviews to get a feel for what guests thought. The repeated comments regarding friendly staff were spot on. Didn't matter where you were in the establishment there was always a smiling staff member to greet you and attend to your needs. Management should be very proud of the high standard their staff maintain. The resort itself is perfectly located with rooms superbly cleaned daily. As is always mentioned, the breakfast was excellent and the perfect way to start the day. We were also thrilled to be invited to the rooftop cocktails and express our thoughts to Grant and John. Congratulations Courtyard.....you won us over completely."
996,Niceish,30,November 2018,"Hotel is nice it‚Äôs clean and modern.

It‚Äôs in a good location, close to the beach and a 10min walk to ‚Äòeat street‚Äô.

Buffet breakfast is great, huge selection and fresh.

Staff are very friendly.

There‚Äôs a couple of things which I believe bring this fairly expensive price point hotel down a little.

It‚Äôs an actual challenge each day to get a sunbed around the pool, it‚Äôs a 50/50 if you get one, there‚Äôs not enough for this size hotel and this many people.

Secondly only one side of the pool gets sun which sucks if you actually want to lay in the sun and you only manage to get a bed on the non sun side, each bed has an umbrella and each one is up on the sunny side!

Thirdly almost every day it seems to be a wind tunnel through the hotel from one end of the pool to the other, seems to be a design fault as you go outside the hotel and no wind, the design seems to draw it in and sends it through like that.

We had direct pool access rooms (apparently) but in between the room and the pool was a wooden path walkway which had a continual stream of people (and children running) accessing areas of the hotel all day/night, the foot traffic of this wooden path is actually very noisy which sounds like baby elephants running back and forth and getting across the path to the pool is like crossing a busy highway and waiting for a gap to run across.

Other than that we had a good stay at this hotel, we stayed in a group booking 4 rooms based on the above I believe that rooms are overpriced and it would be unlikely we would stay again unless there was a price drop."
997,5 star resort at a 4 star price tag,50,November 2018,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. I really felt like part of a large family here. I have never stayed anywhere where the staff are soo friendly and cant do enough for you. They also obviously love working here and with each other which made the environment even better. Kesawa, Nerita, Gida, Gede Gede, Ana, Penny and the rest of the amazing staff made us feel immediately relaxed and well looked after. Roy was amazing cleaning our room and leaving us lovely notes and gifts. Had amazing food and drinks by the pool bar.. bintang chicken and calamari were so delicious. Seminyak kitchen for breakfast was the biggest buffet Ive seen and the steak place was really delicious. Also do yourself a favour and have Sunday roast..yum. Will definitely be booking again very soon"
998,Relaxing yoga,50,November 2018,"Yoga this morning was excellent. This is the perfect way to start your day in Bali. The classes are always small which makes it feel like a private class. Agus was our instructor. He has had many years experience in Yoga and Tai Chi. He told us the importance of setting an intention for the practice which made it a very spiritual experience.
I am an absolute beginner and found this achievable and inclusive for all levels to enjoy."
999,Great Hotel and Really Wonderful Staff,50,October 2018,"Stayed at this really great hotel close to double six beach in the heart of Seminyak. But above all else what really makes this hotel great to stay at is the wonderful friendly staff. From day one nothing was ever too much. I would like to give special mention to Sri who was so attentive around the pool and Arja in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner and last but not least Anggr who looked after us during the cocktail hour. Thank you all. The rooms are so well appointed, clean and very comfortable. The pool is good to hardly any trouble getting a sunbed. Like the splattering of bean bags all around also, though I prefer the padded sunbeds at my age easier to get off! The food is so good, the breakfast is a lavish affair, my eyes often more greedy than my belly, have to work that off now. The Spa is also very good enjoyed a couple massage. Thank you everyone at the hotel for making our stay so welcome, I will be back."
1000,Amazing place to stay,50,November 2018,"This was our first trip to Bali and we couldn‚Äôt fault the accommodation at all. The breakfast was sensational and the staff were so friendly and would bend over backwards for you to make sure you had everything you needed. The vibe of the hotel was awesome and we had lots of laughs.
The taco truck was awesome and recommend the beef tacos and strawberry daiquiris.
Our room was very clean and well maintained. We ate dinner in the kitchen and it was Devine we had the Nasi Goren. We had the greatest time and we would highly recommend this hotel. It will definitely be our first choice of accommodation on our return.
Thank you to everyone for making our first trip one to remember."
1001,End of the year A get away Break,50,November 2018,Second time I stayed at this hotel while on vacation. Still one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed at. I travelled for Holiday with friends and the staff were amazing. The Breakfast in the Seminyak Kitchen lounge is excellent and perhaps the best in town. The buggy shuttle service is very reliable and allows you very easy access to the beach and around we preferred to walk. Rooms are very spacious and classy. The recreation and pool area offers large space to unwind and have a drinks.
1002,Relaxing tropical escape!,50,November 2018,"We recently stayed 7 nights at the Marriott & loved our time there. As a family travelling with an 8month old baby we found the king suite met our needs perfectly, as it has the seperate living area. The staff, where so friendly, and willing to help in any way they could. They genuinely love children, and our baby loved the staff!! His confidence grew so much during the week we stayed, and he‚Äôs been smiling at EVERYONE since we got home (though unfortunately his smiles seem to be returned less often at home!)!

The breakfast buffet was great, huge range of food & beverages. Special mention to Jul who gave us wonderful service & we genuinely enjoyed chatting with in the mornings. Breakfasts just aren‚Äôt the same at home!!

The pool was fabulous, and the water aerobics was great fun- pretty sure I laughed/smiled through the entire class :) Sri gave lovely attentive service to us when we relaxed by the pool.

Location of the hotel is fantastic, plenty of massages, restaurants etc a short walk away. The complementary buggy to various locations was also fantastic- saved us walking with the baby in the heat numerous times.

House keeping was also fantastic, accomodating our requests for the room to be serviced at a particular time (so baby‚Äôs nap time‚Äôs weren‚Äôt disrupted). The room was always cleaned very thoroughly.

The only thing we would do differently next time is request a room further away from the pool bar as travelling with the little one meant the noise woke him occasionally (the live music at night was fine, but the occasionally drunk/noisy guest disrupted him)."
1003,Noisy,20,November 2018,"I tried to really like this hotel but my experience did not meet my expectations staying at a Marriot property. Positives are breakfast, cold airconditioning and friendly staff. Other then that, I did not enjoy the vibe of the hotel which seemed to be populated with scruffy and rough people affected by alcohol, walking around with no shirt on. The security detail when entering the property is a farce and not needed. Rooms were smaller then expected. But the biggest gripe was being woken up each morning by the heavy room doors being shut throughout the property. It literally vibrates and thumps so loudly it sounds like small bombs going off. We stayed on the 6th floor and we were hearing this constantly each morning, which affected our desire to sleep in. Pool area wasn't inviting as the day beds were literally side by side, so no privacy from your fellow neighbour. Loud music would play all afternoon in the pool area, and the Sunday night band was so loud I could not hear conversations in my room. Overall this place did not suit a couple in their 30s who was seeking a relaxing time."
1004,Home away from Home.,50,October 2018,"This was my fifth stay at this Hotel. Celebrating my 60th Birthday and the staff made an effort to make it very special. I find this hotel very relaxing and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Zanti‚Äôs Spa is brilliant, the pool bar area is the place to be during the day and the breakfast is the best I have experienced in Bali. The pool area beds is an ongoing issue like most hotels but this hotel has actually started to police the beds being taken but not being used for hours by setting a time limit of them not being used then removing the towel etc back to the towel pick up area."
1005,Hotel staff,50,October 2018,A very nice hotel. We appreciated the security check everytime we entered the hotel. But above all it's the staff that make the place so welcoming. Special thanks to Ulis at reception for her help and promptness. Ari (concierge) for his willingness to assist and Bayu. You all made our stay more enjoyable.
1006,Incredible,50,April 2018,"This hotel is excellent.
Best memories:
-comfy bed so comfy!
-free water from reception
-breakfast to die for, every taste catered for
-lovely pool and bar
-bar menu reasonable
-location location location

Improvements
-none (and I'm a natural critic)."
1007,Amazing serviceee,50,October 2018,"Most beautiful hotel, with the most friendliest staff ever always greeting with a smile and going an extra mile to help you. Breakfast is amazing there so much option , most clean hotel and secure ! Have kids activities and pool for everyone. Really stylish and friendly. Absolutely loved my stay. I made this account just to give them the feedback ! Cause they made my stay really welcoming !!!"
1008,Perfect location | Great Service | Lovely Staff,50,August 2018,"I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of August in a deluxe pool view room on level 3 just above the pool bar. I hosted some work colleagues as a prize for an incentive. This was my first trip to Bali.

The location was fantastic - an easy walk to some fun bars but I didn't find it noisy at any point. A reasonable walk/short car trip to some amazing restaurants - Ultimo, Breezes @ Samaya, Sarong. I spent half a day at the Day Spa. Very reasonably priced and the staff are lovely. Security - you can scanned every time you enter either on foot or by car. Not sure how diligent at times as one of my colleagues got through quite drunk at night with the buzzers going off - security just let him go through without checking what set it off. He was harmless but who knows? My experience was that I got scanned every time.

Food - Room service food was good and reasonably priced. Lunch and drinks at the bar were also reasonable for hotel prices. Happy Hour at the bar for cocktails was buy one get one free on a select menu. Service is fantastic. Breakfast was amazing. Such good quality and variety. Coffee was good and they took an order when you entered.

Transport - We used the hotel transfers which were more expensive than a local driver (as you'd expect) but very handy. Pick up at the airport was great and easy to find the sign in the sea of waiting drivers. Cheap to taxi and we also walked a bit at night. Traffic is crazy which I hear is normal. It is a very busy area but lot's to see.

Maintenance - my door on the balcony didn't lock - I rang reception and they were quick to send someone up to fix and change the lock which was appreciated.

Rooms - Level 3 Deluxe pool view above the pool bar - bed was super comfortable, room had plenty of space for me and would be fine for a couple (would be tight with a child), noise from the pool travels but it doesn't go late and wasn't a concern at all.

Verdict - I loved it enough that I've just booked 5 nights as part of our family stay in a 2 bedroom suite for Easter school holidays in 2019. Can't wait."
1009,"Value for money, clean, friendly and attentive service",50,October 2018,"Exceptional service from the moment we checked in. All staff members were genuinely friendly and polite. And always had a warm smile.

We booked the pool terrace room which was steps away from the pool. It was clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable.

The food and drinks both at the pool and at breakfast were delicious. Breakfast options were abundant with both eastern and western cuisines. We were pleasantly surprised and the costs for the pool bar were reasonable for hotel rates.

We certainly recommend trying out the Zanti Spa but make sure you book in advance as it is very popular. We had the couples body scrub, balinese and hot stone massage. It was well worth the experience.

Special thanks to Grant, Pya and Priscilla for their warm hospitality (even before we even landed in Bali!) and help with the late check out and great suggestions for places to dine at.

Highly recommended!"
1010,Gorgeous,50,October 2018,"We have just returned to German after spending 5 nights at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. What an outstanding hotel! Great rooms, modern and clean - We stayed in a pool view room #261 closest to the pool bar and entrance. The cocktails at the pool bar were fabulous, and the live music at night was great! The buffet breakfast had a huge variety, and it was great quality. The Zanti spa definitely deserves its Trip Advisor rating of #1 in Seminyak - after having a full body massage there, no other spa compared. The hotel has high security which definitely makes you feel safe. And lastly the staff are second to none - always going above and beyond to help in any way they can. After losing my Celine sunnies, I was devastated! 2 days later and they hand delivered them to my room as soon as they found them ÔøΩ We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!"
1011,"Vibrant, great location and lovely staff",40,October 2018,"We visited Courtyard Marriott for a sisters week away. Great pools, bar and restaurant. Great location and price and surprised at size and quality of rooms. Saw a review on Getaway two years ago after staying at M Galleries down the road and much preferred the stay at Marriott. Better music, pool and more modern feel. Thanks Abit for kind gesture of courtesy champagne on last night at Marriott. Much appreciated and always admire the Balinese care and attention. Regards"
1012,Most amazing service - WIDI,50,October 2018,"Breakfast at the Marriott's Seminyak Kitchen is always a most pleasurable experience and it is even made more enjoyable by the care and attention that WIDI puts into every dining customer. Incomparable service! When dining at Seminyak kitchen, always ask for WIDI - he'll surely look after you. Thanks Widi."
1013,The most amazing holiday experience!!,50,October 2018,"We visited the Courtyard Marriott Hotel in Seminyak in early October 2018 with our young family. Immediately we were greeted with kindness and appreciation by Grant, the Assistant General manager and the beautiful reception staff with fresh, cold water, Bintang and plenty of smiles. Our amazing room with pool outlook and the daily service we experienced was second to none. Arya our regular housekeeper made sure our room was absolutely pristine and spotless each day and his artistic towel placements kept our children amused! Pool side service and care was outstanding! We never had to wait long for a drink! Breakfast each day was so delicious and with so much variety it had to be the best and cleanest buffet I‚Äôve ever had. The chefs in the kitchen are to be highly commended for their skills! Our favourite pool side lunch was the fabulous pizza!
Kids club was a total hit with our 3 and 5 year old! The staff were so kind and caring, attentive and the absolute sweetest people- our kids were begging to go each day! Lunch could be ordered for the kids while they were there and the beautiful staff including Komang was just the most delightful and professional carer of our kids. They had regular activities to keep the kids entertained for hours.
Particular thanks to Pricilla and Grant for making our stay so enjoyable and relaxed for our little family holiday!
We will be back for sure!
Highly highly recommend this hotel!!"
1014,Another amazing stay at courtyard!,50,September 2018,"We had an amazing 8 night stay in September (this was my 2nd stay at courtyard) ...bedroom was very clean and room service was fast if you needed extra towels etc..shower was HUGE and bathroom immaculate..our room had a beautiful view over the pool..pool bar had a great vibe with lots of friendly people but not too noisy..foyer and reception area is very welcoming and safe...it‚Äôs in a great location too, perfect quick walk down to the beach or up the street for shopping/spas/restaurant..buffet breakfast is insane...highly recommend staying at courtyard!!!"
1015,Awesome Hotel Awesome Location,50,October 2018,"This hotel made my first night in Bali fantastic. Everything from the hotel transport to check-in to the room, the pool bar to the spa. Grant took especially good care of me. I am a Marriott Gold member but I got the feeling everyone gets great treatment there. I highly recommend this hotel. Arrange for the hotel to have someone pick you up. And ask for Grant. He is the man! I will also say that I am a 5 yr Diamond with a different hotel chain and this Marriott stay has me fully converted!"
1016,Staff were brilliant!!!,50,October 2018,"The hotel was great! The room, breakfast and specifically the staff were all brilliant!! Just wanted to say a massive thankyou to the staff in the pool bar who took care of us! Peni, Aedos, Dede and darma truly made us feel special and took care of everything for us!!!!"
1017,Loved everything,50,October 2018,"Location, staff, services, everything top quality, priscilla was very sweet and upgraded our room since it was our first visit to Bali. Shuttle services to the beach,market, food spots etc sorts you out completely."
1018,Just Fab,50,October 2018,Stayed here for 7 days. Hotel is absolutely fantastic. I could go on for ages! If you are not sure where to book in Seminjak stop looking and book here. The beach is close by to the hotel with a free shuttle. Breakfast is also very good with plenty of choice.
1019,Very pleasant stay,50,October 2018,"The hotel was very good, nothing to complaint, room was clean with sufficient amenities.
The staffs around the hotel was very professional, the service at the pool bar was amazing, very nice cocktail served into a warm and clean pool.
breakfast was also very nice, large spread, my only negative comment will be the pastries corner, i found the quality of croissants, Danish and bread not matching with the 5 stars hotel, seems to be not freshly baked."
1020,Peni is a superstar,50,October 2018,We stayed at the Marriott for 3 nights. Absolutely amazing experience. Peni in the pool bar was outstanding and really looked after myself and the group I was with. Cannot thank her enough. Breakfast is yummy and the rooms are so nice. Will be back for sure!!!
1021,A great time in an always surprising place,30,October 2018,"A lovely hotel in a great location. Easy access to beach, shopping and restaurants. I feel the Marriott has crammed too many rooms into one hotel. Limited access to pool and lounges as they are squeezed into one courtyard. Our room was simple with all you need. We had a room in the corner of the building facing onto two very very noisy streets with the balcony overlooking the vacant lot where they park all their buses for day trips and cars and drivers for hire. The buses are left running too keep the air conditioning on. So you can imagine how it was in our room. You would think they would double glaze the windows, but no!! Imagine out on the balcony. We had to be moved because of building works in a room nearby was just too much on top of all the other noise. But we were just moved to another room facing over the same carpark and backing onto the lift in which the very next day they were doing maintaince on and listened to a hammer drill that time and people coming and going. Apart from that the staff were fabulous and the breakfast everyday was fantastic."
1022,Fantastic hotel.,50,October 2018,"My wife and I spent our wedding anniversary in Bali and started off at this place. Awesome staff, best breakfast, and great location made for the beginning of our trip very special. Even better with Marriott status!"
1023,Fabulous resort hotel with amazing service and staff,50,October 2018,"We stayed in a pool view king room at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak for six nights recently. We could not have been happier with our stay and wish we had booked a longer visit! Everything was wonderful - our room, the friendly staff who constantly went above and beyond to ensure we had a terrific time in Bali, the Seminyak Kitchen buffet breakfasts, the pool (and pool bar), the gym, and the lovely treatments at the spa. They also offer a buggy service to central Seminyak and the beach. We left a mobile phone in the car on our way to the airport. We didn‚Äôt have a contact number for our driver, who worked for the hotel, but when we called the Concierge they advised the driver had brought the mobile back to the hotel. We had 30 minutes left before boarding our flight to Singapore and the hotel organised another driver to run the phone back to the airport for us. We were so incredibly grateful. We had already had such an amazing time, so this extra gesture was simply more than we could have asked. Thank you for taking such wonderful care of us, and we can‚Äôt wait for our next stay!! Ellen & Dan"
1024,Frank and Maria Magnone,50,October 2018,"Friends had recommended this resort for our second trip to Bali.We were impressed by the facilities along with the attentive staff who made our stay relaxing and enjoyable.Hendra along with Arca, Dewa and Dede worked tirelessly to ensure we were happy.Refreshing drinks, tasty meals were all part of the friendly service delivered with a smile. Their professionalism and customer service are to be commended. We would not hesitate like those friends before us to recommend this resort for a Bali getaway.The resort itself is well located and fabulous but it's the wonderful staff who ensure holiday makers experience the best on offer. We will definitely return to enjoy it all over again in the future."
1025,Amazing place to stay!,50,October 2018,"My friend and I stayed here for six nights and had an amazing time. So impressed with all the staff, the breakfast is absolutely incredible. Rooms are lovely, everything is clean and the beds and pillows are so comfortable. We will definitely be back to stay again! Thanks everyone!"
1026,Simply the Best,50,October 2018,"Stayed here for a second time and looking to stay again in January.
The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Thank you Arja for brightening up our mornings every breakfast time. Breakfast in the Seminyak Kitchen is to die for!
You can grab a quick tasty snack from the 'Food truck' outside the hotel, very convenient for a light lunch when you're having a day by the pool.
The rooms are immaculately clean and well serviced, beds and pillows are very comfy.
We thoroughly enjoyed the complementary yoga and water aerobics classes, thank you Wahyu and Sun (Sorry Sun, I'm not sure how to spell your name but hopefully the management know who I mean;) ).
Be sure you make use of the free shuttle, it will take you to the beach or through the back roads to Seminyak, fantastic service.
Love the swim up bar and at happy hour (5-7pm) they have live music and some evenings there are shows such as Fire dancers and Balinese dancers.
Another great touch was during those hot humid afternoons one of the chefs came around the pool and handed out home make ice lollies which was very much appreciated.
The Courtyard Marriot is in a great location, close to the beach and in easy walk of many shops, market stands and restaurants.
I didn't go to the spa this time but have done on a previous visit and would thoroughly recommend."
1027,Great hotel to stay in Seminyak,40,October 2018,"Stayed here for 6 nights & this is a fabulous place to stay in Seminyak. Asked for an early check in and the staff tried their best to accommodate with follow up text message which was great, however the manager could offer breakfast for guests who arrived in the early hours. Room was clean and bed was super comfortable, however didn‚Äôt receive a welcome card which i‚Äôve seen many other travellers posted on their TA reviews. The staff are all very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is an excellent spread but the pastries are not always fresh. We love the pool very much. The cocktails were fantastic and the pool snacks were delicious .The happy hours from 5-7 PM is such a great deal and the shuttle to the beach is very much appreciated. Overall a fabulous holiday and would recommend to other fellow travellers."
1028,Great Stay at Marriot..Loyal to Marriot after this service,40,May 2018,"We stayed at Marriot for 2 nights and I must say the service and staff at the facility is beyond compare.

I'll start with Good Points as bad are very few and easy to ignore.

1. Easy and friendly checkin with good choices for welcome drinks.
2. Comfortable rooms
3. Great Location, very near to beach and within market. they have free shuttle to malls and beach.
4. Morning Buffet were good with lot of options and even customization is possible. My daughter is allergic to dairy and they made dishes for her in oil instead of butter and served on the table.
5. the chef customized even lunch and dinner options according to our preference.
6. Fabulous Spa service.
7. Good Pool area for children to play and relax
8. Perfect child care facility. they even entertained our request post checkout. and my daughter was really happy with activities and facility. she infact looked forward to going there.

Cons:
1. Rooms dont have view
2. its quite noisy when balcony is open.

Overall had a great experience and will always prefer Marriot going forward whenever we travel."
1029,Another Great Stay,50,October 2018,"Our 4th stay at this hotel and it continues to impress.
- Great staff
- Clean, comfortable rooms
- Good location and security
- Great food, amazing breakfast
- Resort credit promotion is a bonus
- Good kids club - 2 hrs free -small but sufficient for younger kids

We would love to see the floating beanbags and pool lounges in the pool back as well as some healthier poolside menu options again, otherwise it was perfect!"
1030,Great location,40,October 2018,"First time in Courtyard Marriot and was very impressed...location makes it easy to get to Canggu and Legian if needed. Close to Seminyak square and 500mts from the beach front.
Breakfast is the best ive ever had in a hotel buffet!!
Very impressive."
1031,Courtyard Marriott,50,October 2018,"We have just come home from a lovely holiday in Bali. We had an amazing time at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. The pool was great, buffet was lovely and the rooms were very modern. In particular l would like to mention our cleaner by the name of Rudi who left us lovely notes whenever he cleaned our rooms on level 2. He did a wonderful job. Thank you."
1032,Outstanding,50,May 2018,"We stayed here for 5 nights in a large room overlooking the pool. Far enough away from any noise. Exceptional stay in every way. Plenty of variety for breakfast and great coffee. Great pool for adults and children. All staff were absolutely amazing so helpful and friendly. Had a little issue outside of the hotel and staff were extremely kind and helpful in trying to sort things out. Hotel is close to the beach although this was extremely polluted with plastic and I would not recommend swimming here but interesting for a walk.
Close to the hustle and bustle of Seminyak with plenty of interesting shops and nice restaurants. Love, love this hotel.."
1033,Fantastic resort. Exceptional service.,50,October 2018,"What a great hotel. We stayed in a poolside room. Great view and room.

We are Marriott members so we‚Äôre able to take advantage of free wifi and other membership perks along the way.

The hotel is close to everything in Seminyak from the beach, to cafes and shopping.

Our experience was continuously exceptional from the buffet breakfast, and wait for it, room service food that was truly great. (The chicken Parma is amazing).

The training of the employees is second to none. The customer service is consistent and friendly.

The management team were approachable and offered great advice to various dining locations and organised transport there.

I regularly stay in Marriott resorts and this by far the best I have stayed in."
1034,AMAZING! Highly recommended,50,October 2018,"This place is amazing! The staff are all great and go over and above to ensure your stay is perfect. The Buffett breakfast is huge and great fresh food. The pool is great and I used the kids club every day. We also uses an in room nanny from the hotel her name was Chandra and she was so great! She made our holiday, she had my 8 month old each day and my daughter loved her!!! I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough and will be coming back again. We stayed in the two bedroom suite and it was very big, comfortable beds and a great big bath. This is the place to stay in seminyak"
1035,Amazing!,50,October 2018,"Such a beautiful hotel, stunning rooms, first class service, awesome pool and delicious food. Really has everything you could possibly need. Absolutely loved our stay and couldn't recommend highly enough!"
1036,SPOILT ROTTEN,50,October 2018,"I cannot speak highly enough of this fabulous hotel. We arrived late at night after our flight from Melbourne and advised by the duty manager that we had been upgraded to a suite. We were thrilled as the suite was lovely. The next morning we went to the breakfast buffet, which is the best buffet we have ever experienced in a hotel. The variety was fabulous and all delicious. We stayed for two nights and, as we were so impressed, booked another two nights on our return fr Ubud and Candidasa. This time we were given an upgrade on our original upgrade - another gorgeous suite with access to the pool.Fabulous. As we are checking out today and checkout time is noon, I asked if we may stay an extra couple of hours. To my delight the manager offered us another room, complimentary, to stay in until 6pm. So here we are in a deluxe room till 6.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are very friendly, the hotel spotless and we love the location. I forgot to mention the pool which is very big and a delight to enjoy. We will be back."
1037,Service Outstanding,50,October 2018,"This was our first time staying in Seminyak, we have previously stayed at a number of large family resorts in Legian/Kuta our main focus is usually pool area/kid friendly. So after doing a little research I thought I would give Courtyard Marriott a go. Firstly I really appreciated the option with the welcome drinks, Bintang and water! Staff are groomed 5* ...extremely helpful and friendly, nothing is ever too much. I booked a pool terrace room, room is exactly how it's advertised, it's small, modern, comfortable bed, bathroom is really nice and huge shower. The only negative with the room is the lack of area to dry swimmers. Breakfast is amazing.... I probably would book this hotel for their breakfast. Pool area is nice a little snug with all the lounges around it. Lounges were in high demand, not sure if that was because of school holidays. Loved the buggy that took us to their beach area, nice to be able to lounge at their area, towels, water and even refreshing icy poles were available. Kids club, you get 2 hours each day, which my son was happy to go and do a few activities and the staff in there were very welcoming. The gym was good, air conditioned well! My son managed to make the most of the fairy floss and popcorn in the lobby area. Taco's at the entrance are amazing! Overall the Courtyard Marriott delivered impeccable service and for those looking for a smaller family friendly resort I would recommend this hotel."
1038,just wow!!,50,August 2018,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and experienced pure luxury. Can not fault this hotel from checkin to checkout!
The rooms were immaculate, breakfast was to die for and the cocktails were delicious!!"
1039,Amazing hotel,40,October 2018,"We stayed for 5 nights in the hotel. Crew was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, tidy, and modern. The pool was nice. The location is good almost close to everything. Free area shuttle was a good service too. Highly recommend."
1040,Truly wonderful hotel,50,September 2018,"From the very start of our holiday on check in until the moment we left for the airport was truly a wonderful holiday.Its literally impossible to single out individual members of staff,as without fail all the staff were friendly,helpful,and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect.The breakfast selection and quality is as good as ive had anywhere and ive travelled a lot through work and on holidays.Loved the pool,with separate pool with swim up bar.Rooms we lovely as well.....The management team invited us twice for cocktails on the roof which we both enjoyed and thought it a nice touch...All in all,would recommend it to anyone....SUPERB."
1041,This hotel was the best part of our trip to Bali!,50,July 2018,We visited for a week in late July.. couldn‚Äôt be happier with the hotel. All the staff (especially F&B) were amazing! Compliments to the Exec Chef for such an awesome array of food and personal service. Great room.. and pool! Couldn‚Äôt want anything more. We miss this hotel already and can‚Äôt wait to be back!
1042,Fantastic Resort,50,October 2018,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay at Courtyard Marriott with close friends. The staff were fantastic, from the front desk, to kitchen and pool staff. Special mention goes out to Hendra and his team such as Widya and Mob. Thanks for the great cocktails. Nick"
1043,everything was fantastic,50,September 2018,"My partner and I had a very relaxing and comfortable stay. Our room was lovely, clean, great bed and awesome shower.
Breakfast every morning is delicious and presented so well.
Pool Bar staff are great and a perfect setting for drinks every afternoon.
The spa is beautiful, staff are very professional and great at what they do.
All the staff throughout the resort were just lovely and the service spot on.
Thank you Courtyard by Marriott, we hope to be back."
1044,Great Place,50,February 2018,"Near from the beach. I Stay for a week and the service is good... great pool.. many variations of breakfast. great bedroom. and i love the view, i got a room with balcony. i will stay here again one day"
1045,High expectations,50,September 2018,"We had very high expectations for the Courtyard Marriott. Reviews were great, friends had stayed and said it was fantastic. Well, we were not disappointed. From check in to check out, everything was as expected. Check in was super smooth and very friendly staff greeted us. We were given directions to our room and it was just lovely. We had a pool view room (room 328 right across from the pool bar). Great view. The grounds of the hotel are wonderful, lots of deck chairs and bean bags to sit on. Happy hour 5-7 and 9-10 was a huge hit. Buffett breakfast was probably one of the best we've ever had. Variety was huge including smoothies made to order and iced coffee's and latte's included. I was thrilled to see churro's on offer one of the mornings (would only ever eat these for breakfast while on holiday of course). We had a couple of lunches and snacks by the pool which were reasonably priced and very tasty. Free shuttle to the beach and down to Eat Street was a great touch and pretty much available on demand. We LOVED the cocktail and taco truck outside the hotel....what a great idea. Security is tight and you are scanned every time you walk back into the hotel which made as feel very safe. Lots of restaurants, massage places etc. etc. as soon as you walk out of the hotel. Honestly couldn't fault anything. We will definitely stay again."
1046,Pool Bar,50,October 2018,"Awesome staff!
Special thanks to Sri, she was always willing to help and offer her advice if required, she went out of her way to ensure we were looked after. We wish her well with her Hospitality Course, you will do very well in this industry."
1047,Wonderful accomodation,50,September 2018,"This is our second time staying at the Courtyard and it will definitely not be our last. The rooms are fresh,spacious and modern.Breakfast is truly amazing, juice of your own choice made in front of you and the variety of food available is eye boggling.Above all the staff are all very friendly and helpful. A special mention must go to Anna who always with her lovely smile went out of her way to be of assistance and to Gus Dek who is a fabulous barrister and a big reason why we chose to stay here again. The General Manager John is to be congratulated on creating such a lovely and relaxing environment."
1048,The best buffet breakfast I have seen.,50,October 2018,"We stayed here after a late flight before heading off to Ubud. We wished we could stay longer. The rooms were beautiful and clean and the bed like a cloud, the pool area was glorious and we were lucky to get two sun loungers together (they are popular but also monitored well) there is pool service too. But what is outstanding is the buffet breakfast. Well so much is made to order (eggs, broths, coffee, juice) and a huge mix of Asian and western influence. You won't hardly believe it. Grrat location and they arranged a cheap transfer for us to Ubud. Do it!!"
1049,"Good Hotel, Not Luxurious - Very Crowded!",40,October 2018,"We stayed here for 3 Nights after our Trip to Ubud.
First thing that hit us coming from a luxurious stay in a Private Pool Villa at The Udaya Resorts in Ubud, was that this place was packed and crowded with people.

It is a big hotel with 200+ Rooms and all the facilities such as a huge Pool, Gym and Spa.

However, Rooms are pretty standard. It's a 5-7 minute walk to the Beach.
Breakfast spread is Huge and Amazing. So thumbs up for that.

If you want Luxury and Privacy, opt for some villas in Seminyak or Kuta or go to Nusa Dua Beach Hotels. This is a very public place. I guess all Hotels on the Seminyak/Kuta beach suffer the same fate due to the huge number of tourists pouring in Bali."
1050,Make sure you get the context right.,40,October 2018,"My experience with Marriott in 1994 was exceptional. With memories that had sustained me until the present. Fast forward to 2018 and I wanted a few days to relax.
Thus the problem was mine noot the hotel. No it does not have quiet areas or rooms that offer any respite from the noise. Do not chose city view since the windows are not double glazed and very noisy. The Ac does not work as efficiently on this side.

The Pool has loud music blaring from 1.00pm until 6 when the live music takes over.
This was a child/family friendly hotel and met every every expectation in that regard.
However if you have work to do, need an office chair to sit at the desk then do not make this hotel your priority.

The staff as mentioned in every review try their best to make your stay memorable. This review was based on the needs I had and not a reflection per se on the service provided."
1051,Relaxing holiday,50,September 2018,"I found the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful- especially the staff at reception - A special mention to the staff at the gate who assisted us to find transport - got the best deal - also when we needed to transfer to another hotel the ""gate welcoming team"" took us and our luggage on the Hotel in a ""golf buggy"" which certainly was better than lugging our luggage down the rough roads in the area - nothing was too much trouble and they offered to help and never had to be asked - they always anticipated our needs and met them with a smile."
1052,EXCELLENT!!! We will be back,50,October 2018,"This hotel is outstanding!!! The staff are al extremely helpful, friendly and go above and beyond. The location is excellent, easy walking to shops, beach and restaurant. The food is amazing... especially breakfast!
The rooms are big and spacious and extremely clean. This hotel caters for all types traveling, singles, couples or families. I really cannot say enough of this hotel, they are just so accommodating.

Thank you Courtyard.. we cannot wait to come back"
1053,Amazing Hotel,50,August 2018,"This hotel is excellent - location is near the beach , close to bars , restaurants and shops.
Also the hotel breakfast was fantastic so much variety everyday.
Highly recommend if you are going to stay in Seminyak to stay at Courtyard by Marriott."
1054,CY Marriott Seminyak....is the best.,50,September 2018,"Thank you to John and all your staff for giving us the BEST experience ever. The staff at the CY Marriott Seminyak are truly the best.

#seminkyakKitchen staff also go above and beyond. Thank you Anna, Gita and Denny for everything. Bali is amazing!!! ‚ù§Donya"
1055,Amazing Hotel and Stay,50,September 2018,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was amazing. The rooms are clean and spacious. We had the city view and it was great, we were able to sleep through the night as everything calms down around 10 pm. The hotel has a lot of security and you can't enter without your bags being scanned and you being checked by metal detectors. Keep in mind, scissors and sharp objects are not allowed for the safety of guests but are provided by the hotel. Overall, it was a good experience.

The hotel shuttle drops you off at main places and it's not a bad walk back to the hotel. Alternatively, we used the grab app to be driven back and it was cheap and reliable.

Room: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Location: 10/10
Food: We didn't try but we did try the Moonlite restaurant close by and it was delicious and the best sunset experience :)"
1056,Welcome back~~~,50,August 2018,"This was our 5th annual stay at Courtyard Seminyak and it just keeps getting better! Some of the Staff recognized us and we felt like we were home with family again. The room was excellent and the breakfast buffet was outstanding. The food choices were just incredible and the chocolate ice cream was a real treat! The ""What The Truck"" food cart is a great way to nibble away the day between outrageous meals in the Courtyard restaurant. Easy walk to beach, or take the free shuttle to a 'private' Marriott area. Not many sun beds available, but the beach area is very nice. Lots of great restaurants within 5 minutes of the resort and shopping is a joy.... We will return for #6 next year. Beach Bum Bill"

1058,60th birthday holiday treat,50,September 2018,"From the time we arrived till the time we left could not have asked for a better experience.The hotel is well situated for easy access to explore surrounding area .The beach is within easy walking distance and more than enough bars restaurants and shops to cater for all tastes.The hotel itself is spotless and with pleasing decor .The rooms are large and comfy .Food is of a high standard, breakfast had such a large choice from full cooked breakfast to freshly made omelettesfried or even eggs Benedict to fresh bagels pancakes waffles with icecream, noodles rice dishes to freshly made smoothie.There was something for all nationalities.Had a meal in the evening and used room service can say all food is of high quality and every tastey.I would highly recommend this hotel.Staffing is of a high standard and they are always happy to help and make your stay as enjoyable as possible .This start from the general manager John vooley (thank you for our farewell drink served by chinta at pool bar )to sri also pool bar and widi in the reastrant all other staff aswell cant remember all names.Would like to say a big thank you to Ana reastrant manager for making our romantic rooftop dinner a very memorable night and all the staff that made it specail with the persoal touches.even if you are not staying in this hotel you can still use the reastrant you won't be disappointed.Starting to save for another stay ."
1059,Mega hospitality,50,September 2018,"From the moment you walk in reception staff makes you feel special, Bagus offered us beer or tea, cold towels etc. etc. Have stayed in Bali over the years in many luxury hotels but none made us feel so welcome. Abit is the pool assistant manager and has a beautiful outgoing personality I could go on forever as everyone that works here goes out of their way to please. Breakfast is top notch. This will be our hotel destination for years to come. Thank you all for looking after us"
1060,FANTASTIC,50,September 2018,love this resort service and staff are fantastic can not fault anything i will be back highly recommend the resort also offered free shuttle service this resort is in a great location within close proximity to beach and shops
1061,Great Holiday,40,September 2018,"We are on our second last day of our holiday at Courtyard by Marriott and have loved every minute of it. The breakfast is amazing, catering to every taste possible. The staff are so happy, helpful and friendly. My only criticism is the people that saved pool beds every morning while we were there. One family reserved 4 double beds every day. Some days they would not use them until a few hours later. This is a shame as many times people would wander looking for a bed but could not get one even though some were not used for hours. It also makes it unpleasant for pool staff who have to deal with this selfish behaviour."
1062,Breakfast was amazing,50,September 2018,Hotel is lovely room was clean bar staff and pool lovely. My son loved the kids club. Stayed at novotel after and wished we stayed at the Marriott.Room key worked every time. Good for gf options for breakfast.
1063,Amazing experience,50,September 2018,"From the moment we arrived until we left 3 weeks later we could not have felt more welcoming. Receptionists the most helpful I have cone across. All the staff are smiling, helpful and make you feel wonderful. Rooms are great and excellent choice at breakfast. The team at breakfast are really sweet, Maria in particular and the girl (cant remember her name) who does the best omelettes made us feel special. Buggy to beach 5 mins away from hotel and to Seminyak sqaure were always available. The security staff are really nice and friendly and I cannot faukt the cleaning team. Our room was always immaculate and they left some lovely gifts and notes which was a really nice touch. John the manager is very nice and hands on. We could see the impact he has in how the staff are very professional, helpful and take time to engage with their customers. Highly recommend this hotel if coming to Seminyak. We will definitely return."
1064,Amazing!,50,September 2018,"Love this hotel. Everything about it is amazing. This was our third time here and we will definitely be back!
The staff at the pool bar are super friendly! Especially Hendra in particular! He was super friendly and makes the best cocktails.
Highly recommend this hotel!"
1065,"Nice Hotel, Nice staff, not so great service",40,September 2018,"We had 3 rooms booked and the hotel was aware we were travelling together, however rooms were not pre-allocated before hand on the same floor so we had to wait for rooms to be allocated together which could ve been easily avoided and saved us the wait. Additional rollaway bed was placed in a small room and the same room type which was much bigger was given to 2 people staying. We were moved the next day to the same room but on another floor, would've made sense to put 3 people in the bigger room to start off with to avoid the hassle. The hotel itself is good, however had higher expectations based on reviews and photos - not that special, nothing different, not so new. Front desk staff very nice, as well as housekeeping. However lacks little but annoying things, Eg - 1 of each amenity when there was 3 people in the room (they were aware as there was a rollaway), dirty towels taken and not replaced, some amenities replaced some not, bed was made with obvious stains on the bed and pillow."
1066,Great value and excellent location,50,September 2018,"Great value hotel, excellent buffet breakfast. Super clean hotel ant to too far in a taxi from eat street etc. we loved the swim up bar!

The highlight of this hotel must be the super professional, friendly staff. Spending a lot of time around the pool we got chatting to the pool bar area staff. They were all incredibly professional helpful and friendly. Our thanks go the the following who made our time there enjoyable: Hendra, Angga, Marita, Kesha, Cinta, Penny, Darsana, Area, Warsukman jays, Feby, Ebiet, Dewa, Alit. Thank you for being so happy and smiley each day and for all the wonderful cocktail creations:) . We would return to this hotel....."
1067,Staff cannot do enough for you,50,September 2018,"Huge thank you to Grant and the staff at the CY.
We stayed here for our wedding - with 28 other guests. The staff at the CY cannot do enough for you to make your stay perfect.
There were 2 separate occasions when important items were left at the hotel while we were at the wedding villa in the Umalas - Grant organised with the staff to have the items brought to the villa, both times in under an hour.
My husband got ill while we were in bali and they delivered a beautiful fruit platter to him, wishing him a speedy recovery.
Thank you all again, we will be back :)"
1068,Top Notch place,50,September 2018,"This place has the wow factor, not just in looks but the service also. On checking in we were offered a free drink, Bintang included! Nice change from the fruity punch drink normally offered in most Bali hotels. The place looks amazing, nice and new, beautifully kept garden lots of places to lounge around the pool and lawn, bean bags galore!
Our room was spacious and fresh, bathroom was incredible!
Mini bar empty for your own cheaper beverage purchases,great idea!
The breakfast spread was impressive, more choices than I‚Äôve ever seen, plus proper coffee made by a barista and unlimited too.
I was very impressed to see the manager clearing tables and helping out , little things like that leave a lasting impression.
As did the little gift of two hand made bracelets left with a card from the lady that cleaned our room on our last day‚ù§Ô∏è
A shout out to the ever ready and friendly bar staff, your service and attitude are also impeccable. Customer service is the best I‚Äôve seen, well done to all of you.
Also loved the couple who sang and played guitar every night, really enjoyed your lovely voices.
Can‚Äôt forget to mention the ‚ÄúWhat The Truck‚Äù cocktail, coffee and taco combi van out the front of the hotel. You guys make the best Long Island Iced Tea in Bali !
We had a room on the very top 6th floor, At the very end over looking the pool. It is a very long way from the main lift so any one who wants something a bit closer to the pool and breakfast look at the third floor where breakfast is served or lower.
Great place and service I was a very happy guest !"
1069,Not Perfect But Put Right,50,September 2018,"Room was fantastic, functional & very comfortable. We had the package which included breakfast, 1 lunch, 1 dinner & 1 foodtruck, plus massage. All the food was fabulous - my only suggestion would be that lunch & dinner offered were off the same menu - which you don't know until you order. We had kept our dinner for the last night to have something ""special"" but that wasn't an option. Perhaps have a couple of **asteriked** dishes that are only available for dinner??

Staff were all very attentive & professional - the spa was exceptional and you can see why it is rated so highly.

On our last night we had an incident whereby an ashtray was ""delivered"" to our room - despite the do not disturb sign & the fact we didn't request it. We were in bed, answered the door and informed the staff member of this. About 10 minutes later as we settled down again, a phone call. The next morning I addressed this with Wahyu, the Duty Manager. He was most apologetic & was going to look into the situation.

We returned to our room after our last minute shopping to an apology note, a very valid explanation (wrong room number) and a gesture of goodwill in the form of a complimentary lunch before our departure. As a seasoned traveler I have had a few occasions to voice my concerns when something goes wrong - & it's how a business handles the criticism that is a true indicator of their worth. In this instance I was delighted that I was listened to, staff were going to be re-trained due to the incident & a very generous gesture was offered.

I cannot recommend Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak more highly - you won't be disappointed! Rest assured this will be our ""go to"" hotel in Seminyak going forward."
1070,Fabulous stay,50,September 2018,"Thank you to John and his staff for the excellent service! We had a wonderful vacation!

We really had a great time and we loved the friendly welcoming atmosphere and the great food.

I have already been telling everyone if they travel to Bali they need to stay at Courtyard Seminyak. You guys really look out for your customers and it‚Äôs so comforting when you are on vacation and to know people are there for you.

Thank you again for making our vacation something special and something to remember.

We hope to come back in Bali!"
1071,Simply perfection at it's best,50,September 2018,"What can I say about this hotel?? It is simply perfect. The hotel is spotless..rooms are immaculate the staff are so kind..friendly and polite..nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast is out of this world and there is an abundance of food to suit everyone. Breakfast gets my vote for best I've ever had. The coffee is amazing..latte, iced coffee..perfection! The hotel although huge is extremely quiet and not once did we get woke up by noisy neighbours. One slight criticism there was a wedding at the hotel and it was impossible to get by the pool as part of the garden sunbathing area had been blocked off for wedding use and all available sunbeds and bean bags for sitting on had been taken but on the plus side the beach is a short stroll away. The hotel food my partner had several times and really enjoyed it. I had nasi goreng which wasn't to my liking or my partners it was actually far far to spicy so if you like spice then try it. Overall this is probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in..and would definitely come back again."
1072,Lovely 6 nights stay,50,September 2018,"Courtyard Marriott Seminyak was our base during 9 days vacation in Bali. We arrived after 2 nights stay in Uluwatu and I was quite surprised at the size of the hotel. I was expecting it to be much larger. The size of our room was also smaller than expected. However, I quickly adapted to the layout of the hotel and grew to love it.

Breakfast buffet that came with the room was always a nice way to start the day. Menu is changed daily and it came with heaps of choices available.

Our beds were super comfortable and I also loved our bathroom. It wasn‚Äôt massive but it was highly functional and the shower had amazing water pressure.

A big thank you to all housekeeping and Seminyak Kitchen staffs who are all so friendly, professional and helpful. They are always ready to give us a hand with a smile no matter how late we call them."
1073,Hotel and pool bar review,50,September 2018,My fianc√© and I travelled to Bali in 2018 and we were blown away by the amazing courtyard Marriott hotel and it‚Äôs amazing staff. Chinta was our waitress and she is a shining example of what customer service is. Would definitely come back again! Thank you Chinta for making our holiday so special. üòÉüòÉüòÉ
1074,Came in clutch!,50,August 2018,"My husband and I wanted to finish our Bali trip in a private city villa in Seminyak, having enjoyed ourselves in Ubud. Upon arrival to another property, we learned that we had been duped. The website pictures were several years old and the whole place was dirty and rundown. There was a mouse on the ceiling beam. Need I say more? x_x

My resourceful husband found Courtyard Marriott and we took one of the city view rooms for three night as it was a last minute booking. The room itself was clean, cold AC, and artfully designed. This was a totally different presentation of the Courtyard Marriotts in the U.S. which are plain and frumpy in comparison. We did not expect all the perks: two free tacos, a free dinner, and free 1 hour massage at Zanti (relaxing and professional)! Daily breakfast buffet was included and it was scrumptious and varied. The pools were clean and all the lounge areas were inviting. Upbeat music was always playing in the daytime and live bands at night contributed to a fun atmosphere. Wifi signal was strong throughout the hotel. The staff were charismatic and had fluent English. The location was close to the beach and downtown. We would return if we ever do Bali again. Thanks for saving our honeymoon!"
1075,Best holiday in Bali,50,September 2018,"We just came back from 10 days at this amazing hotel .. We‚Äôd especially like to thank ADI Putra our fantastic room attendant .. he was truly amazing
And to all the pool bar staff especially Hendra , Narita and Chinta .. all made our stay so happy and enjoyable.. we wil definitely be back and recommend the courtyard Marriott to all our friends .. the above staff are a credit to this awesome hotel .. Thank you for the best 10 days .. Mr Rosin and family"
1076,Fantastic Family Holiday at the Courtyard Marriott in Bali,50,August 2018,We had an amazing two weeks at the Courtyard Marriott in Bali - such lovely and friendly staff who made us feel so welcome. Wonderful breakfast to start the day and then the choice of being by the pool for lazy times or helpful staff on hand who assisted us when planning outings or booking places to see. We will definitely be back to stay - our thanks to all at the Marriott who made our Bali holiday such a great and memorable experience.
1077,Fantastic customer service on a last minute booking,40,August 2018,"We booked this very last minute as we had arranged to go to Gili Trawangan for a week following a week in Nusa Dua. Unfortunately we had to cancel Gili T due to the earthquake and the islands being evacuated so decided to do a week in Seminyak instead.Upon arrival we were told that the room we had booked the previous day was now not available. All of the managers were brilliant and especially Ramu who went out of his way to put things right. Although we did not get the room that we wanted we still had a lovely room on the sunny side.
The bed was super comfy. Fab shower, hair dryer, toiletries, kettle, fridge, bathrobes and flip flops. Safe, iron and board, i pod docking station and sockets the same as uk. Bottled water provided daily.Small balcony which was in the sun most of the day.
Pool area not great with one side constantly in the shade. The other side in the sun the beds were packed together in a long row and towels reserving them from quite early in the morning. There were also a couple of bean bags in the grassed area. We chose to get the free golf cart down to the section of beach reserved for hotel guests which was not so crammed in together. You were provided with water there and ice lollies as well as beach towels.
It was very clean and contemporary and we enjoyed our stay there. Seminyak was totally different to Nusa Dua, more bustly. Easy to walk into Seminyak or to get a taxi."

This stay was really enjoyable. From the moment ARYA contacted me by e-mail and arranged for the check-in plan, I deeply felt the joy of being a loyal member.
Although the airport shuttle staff only worked for three days, I felt the respect of his job. Tony who helped me check in was a bit rusty, but he was very polite. What made me feel most pleasant was the whole breakfast process. They all greeted me with a smile, and the girl who made the juice found the avocado and finished the avocado milk I wanted.
The enthusiasm of all people for work makes me very moved and infected with their happy mood, which is a perfect resort."

1080,Pool bar staff,50,September 2018,"A special thanks goes to the wonderful pool staff Narita, Ikesawa, Chinta, Ebiet, Alit and especially Hendra ... they all made our stay at the pool a delight and they were always happy and super helpful . Thank you so much we will definitely visit again .. The Rosin‚Äôs"
1081,Great location and service!,50,September 2018,Just had a wonderful week stay here. Very close 10 minute walk to the beach and 20/30min walk to siminyak square. The staff was extremely hospitable and willing to help and always checking in on how our stay was. We had great experiences with Sri & Hendra were both very friendly and always making sure were well looked after. Would definitely come back and stay at the Courtyard by Marriot in Seminyak!
1082,Breakfast is best ever!,50,September 2018,"Clean spacious room. We chose one straight out onto the pool where we could pop in and out from our oh so comfortable sun bed to cool down and use our own private facilities. Though it is situated in a very busy resort it was a great choice after scrolling through so many ahead of our first time visit to the beautiful island of Bali.
The great idea of large bean bags around the pool area which we tried on another day prompted us to purchase a couple for our own home upon our return because they were also so comfortable to lounge in the sun on!
The beach was a five to ten minute walk away and it was right in the town with shops and supermarkets easily reachable within seconds.
Security was superb with airport style x ray facilities set up for every hotel visitor to have to go through before entering every time they arrived or returned to the entrance.
The breakfast had a huge choice of food which offered practically everything you would wish to consume on your trip to this stunning place and the staff were genuinely welcoming and eager to make your stay with them as enjoyable as they could.
One of the nicest hotels we have used and there have been many worldwide!"
1083,Great hotel in Seminyak,40,September 2018,"Recently stayed for a week with friends. We all had a package that included transfers, massage, some meals and drinks. It was fantastic value. The staff at the hotel were fabulous. They were friendly and attentive. Our room looked over the pool. It was clean and the bed was so comfortable. The breakfast buffet included almost everything you could think of with traditional choices and Asian and Indian food as well. The egg station and the fresh juice was a highlight. The pool was lovely and even though the hotel was fully booked it didn‚Äôt feel crowded. We were almost always able to get a sun bed. The band that plays in the pool bar in the evening was a highlight. The hotel itself is in a great area. Not far from the beach and a short walk to the heart of Seminyak. We‚Äôll definitely be back."
1084,Will be back,50,September 2018,"Gorgeous lush place with delicious food, friendly staff and amazing facilities. The beach is a quick walk away but we spent most of our time swimming here and sunbathing. Seriously relaxing. Also dont miss out on the buffet breakfast!"
1085,"Great hotel, could use more space",40,May 2018,"Very good place but a bit crowded. Good service, staff has good English. A bit too much rooms for the limited space.
Great pools but there isn't much space for sunbeds, they are tightly packed, not much space to move them and the sun umbrella are fixed, so it's tricky to follow the shade. the sunbeds have nice mattresses but they keep slipping down. One side of the pool has the sunbeds with pratically no sun due to shade of the building."
1086,You have to stay here,50,September 2018,"Just back from 6 nights and it was phenomenal from start to finish. Staff are so friendly, I honestly haven‚Äôt come across a place that each staff member would go out of their way to say hello and offer to help. Check in is so smooth and there is a choice of welcome drinks including beer! The room was so clean and modern with robes and flip flops, beds provided at the pool. Swim up bar is amazing. Pools are lovely. If you‚Äôre a sun worshiper and want to be beside the pool then get there early as only one side of the pool gets the sun. But there‚Äôs loads of room in the fake grass area with bean bags and beds to lie on. The breakfast is what really makes it. There‚Äôs so much choice I literally felt like I was walking into a shop and being allowed take what I want off the shelves. So much variety and choice. So many staff to help. It was incredible. We had dinner in the seminyak kitchen one night too and it was lovely. The head chef Patrick came round to us at breakfast to check if we wanted anything in particular or anything he could do to help. Also on check out I saw the general manager John introducing himself to new guests. Such a lovely touch. The staff are a credit to the hotel. Special mention to Anna in food and beverages, so helpful, angaa at the pool bar and Patrick the head chef. Wonderful staff. Already wishing to go back someday"
1087,Great hotel,50,September 2018,Hotel was great. Would definitely recommend staying here. Everyone is so friendly from the cleaners to the bar staff. Biggest choice of breakfast dishes. And food was excellent. Rooms was so clean. Could not recommend enough
1088,Fabulous stay,50,September 2018,"The hotel is absolutely amazing! It did not disappoint. From start to finish the staff was so helpful, from welcome drinks when you arrive to room service they could not do anymore for you. Nothing was too much trouble. So friendly and always smiling. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean. The rooms were big and spacious. Our room was always super clean after we returned from our days out. Food and drink was amazing too. You didn‚Äôt even need to leave your sunbed if you wanted a drink or food you could just ring the bell an they would attend. Pool was lovely. The 24hour room service was spot on. Location was also great, close to the beach, shops, bars and restaurants, and super markets. I definitely would recommend a staying in this hotel if you are visiting Seminyak. Not a bad thing to say. 5 star stay x"
1089,Yes,50,July 2018,"Very nice hotel , in great location great for family, as you would expect from the marriot.
Hade a great stay music great good vibe for older family ,buffet breakfast is the best u will find any where in the world."
1090,Loved this Bali Resort,50,September 2018,"They stay was quite enjoyable at this Courtyard Resort! My team came in for the annual Bali Marathon and we loved our time here. The staff are all very accommodating and genuine when talking to you and asking how your stay is progressing. The facilities are well maintained and the resort has plenty of grade A amenities. Also the beach is a calm 10 minute walk or a few minutes free shuttle ride from the Courtyard. The rooms are very comfortable and I got some of the best rest in days while staying here.

I can't remember all of the staff that I interacted with so many wonderful persons but just to mention a few special thanks to Grant, Arya, Ari, Dewi, Ketut, Priscilla, Diane, and everyone that made the trip memorable."
1091,Reasonably good hotel,40,September 2018,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times. It is tucked away in a not so busy street are (relatively speaking). It is a good hotel with good people who are happy to help and accommodate to your reasonable requests.

It is a popular hotel among Australians tourists of all ages. It has a good pool area with adjoining pool bar for a good pool party. Breakfast is great, plenty of choices and a good feeling for a start of the day kind of place.

The room is good and clean, a good place to come back for a relax evening after a fun filled day outside. I'll definitely come back."
1092,We love this Hotel,50,September 2018,"Yes, straight from the title of this review we are biased. Why?
Our first visit to Bali we stayed at a recommended hotel in Sanur and it was horrible.
Our daughter travelled to Bali the following year and stayed at the Marriot in Seminyak. On her recommendation we travelled over. Sure big chain hotels take a system of management and apply it over and over again.
Marriot Seminyak is in the middle of an area that is bustling. It is clean, the food is fantastic, staff are friendly without being intrusive. As a base for shopping, exploring or being pampered in a spa it is superb. For us though it is about being looked after. We both have busy jobs and it is just so good to be in a place where you get looked after. Yes, there are systems in place that mean the pool water is checked several times a day, everything works, food quality is high and it is clean. Most importantly the people that look after you do so with interest and curiosity and enjoy seeing you relax."
1093,Very nice Hotel!! Amazing Staffs!!,40,September 2018,"For me and my family- We could say, this is the great place to stay, we feel very safe. Staffs are very friendly, one of them name is ARJA who works in Seminyak Kitchen. He always put a smile no matter how busy he is and never forget to greet us.
Then there‚Äôs always something to do for the kids. My kids loved the popcorn and cotton candy compliments from the hotel. And also Shout out to RUDI!!! who cleans our room -leave notes to us to enjoy our stays. He is Very creative in folding towels that made me don‚Äôt want to mess it up.üòÄ"
1094,Mel,50,September 2018,"Amazing hotel in a great location with amazing staff also and the best cocktails by the pool. Highly recommend!! Close to great restaurants in Seminyak also.Thanks to Hendra, Arta, Reyhan, Sri, Mob & Arca"
1095,Quick Break,50,September 2018,"I have been to Bali before many times and stayed in various hotels. Some great and some pretty average.

My sincere commendation to the General Manager Mr John Woolley on the appearance , quality and hospitality of your establishment the Courtyard by the Marriott.

This clearly is the best hotel I have stayed so far. Food : excellent , Staff : brilliant, warm , friendly and very helpful.
Accommodation and rooms were clean, well maintained and very modern.

Breakfast: excellent to much to choose from which is great.

Amenities were excellent and the hotel provided for everything that a person would require while on holiday.

The staff that stood out for me was Hendra with his great interpersonal skills and great aussie accent. This guy has class and really knows how to be a host. I wish him all the best and he definatley has a great future. The remaining staff at the pool and pool bar were also excellent.

Overall the Courtyard by Marriott is an outstanding hotel in a great location with brilliant personnel.

I will be coming back again.

Thank you for a great holiday and relaxing break."
1096,Best Bali holiday... ever!,50,August 2018,"My wife and I spent one week at Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort and absolutely loved it. The position of the property is great - surrounded by so many fantastic restaurants, bars, caf√©s and shops that are just a short stroll away.

The hotel staff were fantastic, very friendly and professional. Nothing to was too much trouble for them, which was clearly a reflection of the senior management.

The General Manager, John Woolley and Director of Operations, Grant Young are a formidable duo who were approachable, extremely helpful and hospitable. It was a real tonic to stay at a property where management are so personable and frequently mingling with the guests. There‚Äôs no doubt that their ethos and professionalism has filtered down to the rest of the staff and created a wonderful environment to stay in.

Our room was great. Well appointed, modern and housekeeping was second to none.

It was a real pleasure to stay here and we can not wait to do Seminyak again!

A big heartfelt ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù goes out to all the Courtyard Marriott staff that made this such a wonderful experience!"
1097,Great place to stay,50,September 2018,"We stayed for a week and had a great visit. Staff are very friendly, our room was big and comfortable. The breakfast was very good and once again staff were helpful with any dietary requirements. It‚Äôs just out of Seminyak central, but golf cart was available to drop us off."
1098,"Relaxed, calm, welcoming experience",50,March 2018,"From Austin, TX USA, I visited a dear friend of mine here in Seminyak and we were astonished by the service received by the staff upon arrival and the patience with the agents. Upon arrival at the drive, I received the frangipani flower and a chilled tea at the front desk. I was exhausted from my unexpected layover and I felt more than welcomed, at home. I would definitely come back to this destination for my next visit in Bali with my family and would love to show them around. My friend and I were out a lot hiking and visiting places around the area, so when we returned back to our room, it was always great to see our beds made perfectly and our items folded. Every morning we would walk out our rooms and hear the peaceful wildlife outside the fenced walls of greenery. Bali is a beautiful destination and I would highly recommend Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort, it is a great location in distance to everything you need!"
1099,Great hotel in Seminyak,50,September 2018,"This Courtyard is as nice as a full service Marriott Resort. The staff is super friendly and genuinely wants to see you have a good time. I was greeted by the amazing Pricilla at check-in and she treated me like the one and only guest. The service was amazing. The location is great, rooms are super nice and clean, and the breakfast buffet is huge and full of variety. I will stay here again."
1100,Second visit and as good as the first,50,August 2018,"this is a second visit to Courtyard. What makes this property so good. is the staff from management to all the other staff who work in the kitchen at breakfast time, to the staff around pool, to those young guys who are there to take you in the complimentary buggy to Eat Street, Double 6 Beach and to Seminyak street, Front desk staff, and to the cleaners. Not one of them passes you without saying hello. It is a credit to them.
Breakfast is great, a lot of choice. Even bagels with cream cheese, salmon and capers and so many other dishes, freshly squeezed fruit juices, smoothies, detox drinks
Coffee is whatever you order, from cappucino, iced coffees, hot chocolate and lattes. Very spoilt..
Beach is within walking distance from hotel approx 200 metres.
there is a gym,bingo by the pool for a bit of fun and water aerobics.
The fact that the hotel has John Woolley, General Manager, an American and Grant Young, Operations Manager, an Australian so there is no language barrier and their presnce is felt every day, asking you if everything is O.K.
Rooms are quite a good size, but my tip would be to pay extra for a pool view room rather than face the street.
Cant wait until we go back and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
Restaurants which came recommended by both Managers were Sardines, Zibiru, Barbacoa, Hanks Pizza and Gado Gado, all great and we also went to Ultimo, Happy Chappy, Da Maria and Batik. Cant complain.."
1101,Vacation,50,August 2018,"It was really nice stay in courtyard by Marriott.... swimming pool is really clean , kids will enjoy it there , private beach area is there that was too good , shuttle bus is there , feel so special, love to stay again there"
1102,Fantastic! exceeded all my expectations,50,September 2018,"I am a well travelled millennial and use Marriott 99% of the time. I was cautious when booking this hotel, as my experience with Courtyard hotels are normally very basic, but this hotel has a pool and 5 Star, so I thought I would give it a try.

From the moment I walked in, I could see a well maintained hotel, beautiful interior and exterior. The facilities in the hotel were excellent and the staff was the most impressive especially those from Breakfast. Even the chefs spoke with you as you was collecting food, even walking past the chefs would say hello and ask you how you was. The maintenance team also interacted with you when passing. This hotel blew my mind and exceeded all my expectations.

Even now I am in my fourth Marriott Hotel in Bali since leaving and none compare to how amazing this hotel was. I am a hard person to please and have very high expectations, especially of Marriott and this hotel surprised me every time.

Only downside is the bar closes at 9:30 for last orders which is relatively earlier considering the area located in. There are lots of entertainment but this is not advertised well. One night I heard balinese music and lots of clapping to find it was a show. When I asked where this was advertised I was shown a leaflet on the coffee station for breakfast. This should have been issued on arrival or in the room to allow guests to maximise their experience onsite.

I will defiantly be returning and recommending this hotel."
1103,Over and above!,50,June 2018,The facilities and cleanliness were top notch and the staff REALLY went out of their way to ensure our stay was great. Top marks for management who really care about their guests - going over and above to solve a small issue we had. Very much appreciated.
1104,Great staff giving excellent service.,50,September 2018,"A gorgeous hotel with helpful friendly staff throughout.
Had particularly good food and service from Widi and the whole team at the Seminyak Kitchen.

The fillet mignon and pork ribs were

perfect. Highly recommended."
1105,Very comfortable hotel,40,September 2018,"First time staying at this hotel and very impressed. Good pools, beanbags if you a sick of sun lounges and areas just to lay around on the grass (well fake grass). The rooms a well fitted out and most importantly the beds a very comfortable. Not on the beach but just 5 minutes down the street. If you don‚Äôt like to walk then I am sure someone will toot you for a taxi, but that is Bali."
1106,"PERFECT for solo travellers, couples, groups and families with young children.....",50,July 2018,"My recent return visit to the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak was a true sample of excellent hospitality! My children joined me for this trip and we shared an amazing experience together. The hotel management and staff were very friendly, warm and extremely accommodating and welcoming. They made my us feel very special and it will definitely be a lifetime memory for us all. I commend the General Manager, John, his management team and wonderful professional staff. I will be returning next month to stay again and look forward to the stay. This hotel is suitable for solo travellers, couples, groups and families with young children. I would defiantly recommend this hotel, the facilities, staff and management."
1107,Lived up to expectations,50,August 2018,"Just returned to the UK from a lovely holiday in Bali. Our last 4 nights were spent at the CY Marriott Seminyak. We had 2 interconnecting pool access rooms which were perfect in every way. The breakfast is as good if not better than the reviews would lead you to believe. The staff are all super friendly and will do anything for you. Priscilla in Guest Relations is a stand out member of staff for me. She always greeted us by name, would stop and chat when she saw us to make sure our stay was going well and on our wedding anniversary she arranged for chocolates to be sent to our room and for some beautiful romantic towel art and petals to be left on our bed which was extremely thoughtful and gratefully received. The hotel is excellent value for money. The pool bar serve some amazing cocktails at very reasonable prices and even more reasonable during happy hour. The Zanti Spa is out of this world. My husband and I had a joint treatment in their couples room. It was nothing short of amazing. A memory we will treasure forever. The hotel is well placed for everything Seminyak has to offer and the hotel buggy is a great help getting you to the beach or Eat Street. The private beach area isn't very big and we preferred to relax at the pool. They have a strict 30 min time on the sunbeds by the pool and if you are away for longer your towel will be removed. Whereas I agree with this as I do hate people who save sunbeds and then don't turn up to use them until 4pm I think that they should extend this to 60 mins to enable you to have a break for lunch, have a wander around or a game of table tennis or whatever else takes your fancy. 30 mins does pretty much restrict you to not moving all day! The hotel has a great vibe and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Security is top-notch. Thank you for making us feel so safe. Loved the taco truck outside. Again excellent value for money and very tasty! Hope to return one day."
1108,Loved our stay here :),50,August 2018,"We loved our stay here!!! The resort is very clean, food is amazing and we loved our choice of breakfast, great for kids also.. Reakly enjoyed the gym very very nice and clean.. I would definitely stay here again."
1109,Great Value,50,August 2018,Spend some days here as part of an Air NZ Grabaseat deal. Great deal with all inclusions. This was our second visit and we enjoyed this visit as much as the first. The hotel offers great value and is located close to the beach (10 minute walk or golf cart shuttle) and restaurants. Breakfast is excellent although the voucher lunch and dinner with set menu wasn't quite up to standard. Pool bar got well used. While not five star standard this is a modern well maintained resort hotel.
1110,Excellent!,50,August 2018,Enjoyed 6 days at this hotel. Friendly service from helpful well trained considerate staff. Well presented with a wide variety of delicious food. Wonderful clean facilities and excellent full length swimming pools! Convenient location with complimentary drop off service to various shops nearby.
1111,"Best luxury hotel, best hospitality service!!",50,August 2018,"The hotel is fantastic!! There is Comfortable rooms, wonderful view , big pools with bar, ... The breakfast is the best moment for starting your day! I can't even describe how it's so delicious and various ,.. Fibally they have a very very good service! The personals are so professional and friendly, specially DEVI & Priscilla ."
1112,A warm welcome back.,50,August 2018,"- Rooms are new, very clean (to my OCD standard!), and bed is very comfortable with clean bed sheets.
- Buffet breakfast has a very wide variety of foods to cater to many appetites
- The management and hotel staff are very warm and welcoming, always attended to our needs.
- The buggy will take you directly to eat street, where all of the restaurants and shopping is!
- Located conveniently on a street of restaurants and shops but more importantly walking distance from the beach.
- We comfortably left our valuable items in the hotel room safe.
- The rooms are comfortably quiet and very private, the pool is fun and has music during the day which is nice. It quietens down at night.
- Concierge will organise any trips for you as well.

This was our second stay. We'll go back on the regular to this hotel."
1113,Love everything with this hotel,50,February 2018,"Location, breakfast, the room everything was great. Stayed 3 nights there for honeymoon. Was the best decision because turn out the hotel very quite ( maybe because its not holiday season) and the pool is awesome!!!! The hotel staffs also very friendly even tho im a local tourist ( you know what i meant :p )
So thank you courtyard !!"
1114,By far my favourite hotel in Bali.,50,July 2018,"Hotel is amazing, it‚Äôs clean, modern, and such a great vibe. The staff are incredible. I‚Äôve stayed here about 8 times now and whether it was a month or a year ago they never forget you and make you feel welcome. Hendra in particular is such a legend."
1115,lovely place to stay,50,June 2018,"It is a nice hotel with good rooms, large swimming pools and close to the beach.Staff was exceptionally good with their service.Definitely nice place to relax and enjoy..One can easily walk around for shopping and restaurants for food."
1116,cozy and recommended,50,August 2018,"the place is nice and cozy, the staffs are full of hospitality. I think this place is really recommended.The price is also worth it. They know how to make you feel like home when you are there. Just go for it."
1117,Wonderful!,50,August 2018,"I love this Hotel its one of my fave's! If I needed a hotel this would be one of my Go-To's in Seminyak. The staff are wonderful and inviting and you just feel at home here. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, its simply amazing! The breakfasts are to die for!"
1118,Fantastic experience,50,August 2018,"The crew were so friendly and genuine It was difficult to say good bye. Exceptional service, amazing crew, beautiful resort, magical place ! a special thanks to Sudi and Gear and to the entire management team. There was nothing they could have done better. Thank you so much for making our journey unforgettable. we shall see you again soon ! Regards from Dubai"
1119,Amazing service and excellent stay two years in a row,50,August 2018,"I recently returned home from Courtyard Marriott after a 10 night stay with my family.

After having had such a great experience at this hotel with my husband last year, I quickly convinced my family to return with us again this year and they loved it as much as us.

First and foremost - the service is outstanding. The staff in this hotel are friendly, knowledgeable, genuine, plentiful and professional; always saying hello and smiling. A special mention goes out to Priscillia and Sista. Priscillia heard from my mum that I had not been feeling well and having remembered me from last year, kindly sent some ginger tea up to my room for me. It was such a small but thoughtful gesture, which I really appreciated. Sista always made an effort to say hello to us and stop for a chat, she even spent some time with my niece whenever she had a spare moment. Both wonderful staff that should be commended for their authentic service.

During our stay we experienced a large earthquake, which was quite frightening and unexpected. The hotel staff were fantastic - everyone was reassuring and I never once felt concerned. Hotel management handled the situation very professionally, keeping us in the loop, checking the building and informing us of any important information.

The hotel itself is modern and well appointed, located in a quieter street in Seminyak. Not far from Eat Street (5min car trip) or the beach (5min walk). The hotel has a buggy service to those areas but we had too many people with us and the taxis never cost more than $10 AUD anyway.

We stayed in the deluxe pool view rooms on the 5th floor, which are spacious and a good size. We had stayed in this room type last year also.

Although the design of the hotel means half the sun beds are in the shade, we always managed to find a bean bag or cushion to lie on in the grassed area in the sun. We also made the effort to visit some different beach clubs so the lack of available sun beds was not a big issue.

The only feedback I have is regarding the pool menu - last year‚Äôs was more extensive and had some healthier options. There were even some smoothie bowls that we loved but were no longer offered. Perhaps a review of this is needed?

Both times we have had really positive experiences and I believe it‚Äôs all to do with the service. We went on to stay in two different places after our ten night stay, and nothing compared to our time at this hotel. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back!"
1120,Fantastic stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak,50,August 2018,"Was staying 4 nights all up in between my visit to Ubud. The Courtyard Seminyak exceeded my expectations. I love the atmosphere of this hotel, from the breakfast restaurant, which serves a delicious selection of fresh breakfast, to the pool ambience, which is a nice place to relax during the day.
During the last two nights of my stay we had a couple of earth quakes, which I couldn‚Äôt feel whilst in the room as the hotel is pretty solid. However the Manager on Duty quickly reacted and made a PA to ensure everyone was safe and sound. He communicated steps taken by the management prior to the earth quakes, which made me feel reassured that I‚Äôm in a good hand.
The staff were always friendly and welcoming. They went the extra miles to make my stay most comfortable and enjoyable, and remembered my name straight away after my second stay.
Special mention to Pak Ramu and his Front Office Team for the warm welcome and service, as well Pak Mulyana and the F&B team for always remembering what beverage I order in the morning. Would definitely looking forward for my next stay."
1121,"This hotel is a welcome respite in touristy, crowded Seminyak",50,August 2018,"As a Marriott rewards member, I was very satisfied with my overnight stay here; the rooms are a tad on the small side for the price tag, but the large shower area more than makes up for it. Honestly, I'd recommend just staying inside the hotel instead of navigating the swarms of tourists on Seminyak Beach. The spa prices are exorbitant given that massage places are less than 100 meters away from the hotel, but do offer more privacy and variety in their packages."
1122,Very welcoming and friendly hotel staff during my stay for 7 nights on 7th August 2018,50,August 2018,"Arrived at the courtyard during a trip around Bali for 23 days, stayed at the courtyard for 7 nights could not fault anything food, room service, cleanliness, hospitality. All the Pool bar staff were very friendly and could not do enough to make our stay brilliant would like to say an extra thank you to the following staff Rudi, Hendra, Ebiet, Ayu, Chinta, Marita, Delva, Arca, Dede who became friends and bent over backwards going above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The food from the What the truck Mexican food truck was lovely and well worth visiting. After staying in several different hotels around Bali this was definitely the best and the most comfiest beds of the whole trip. Would just like to thank everyone once again we will definitely return to this hotel again next time we travel near Bali would highly recommend if you are looking for a hotel that ticks all the boxes then i recommend you book to stay here. Thanks again will return soon hopefully :-)"
1123,What a welcome to this great hotel on august 5 2018,40,August 2018,"we had just checked into this hotel after a 10 hour flight and stop-over - from dubai via singapore- and i was resting in my pyjamas- when at about 7.00 pm bali time - my wife starting shouting in fear- the room is shaking, the furniture is moving, i got up in fright - all guests were screaming - it was an earthquake- about 6.8 in the neighbouring island of lombek- where it seems over 400 people died--- we in bali were safe by god's grace- anyway the hotel operations ceo - was a great person- kudos to him for his reassuring approach to all guests- the hotel is good , staff very good, we enjoyed our stay in this nice hotel- Seminyak is a pretty place - worth visiting if you do not mind a few tremors or after-shocks ....."
1124,Thank you,50,August 2018,"My husband and I checked out of the Marriot after a 5 night stay only to realise we had left our iPad in the hotel. They checked the room and confirmed it was still there now the one thing that I find amazing is that they returned the iPad to our new hotel! I spoke with reception I wish I got his name (It wasn't the Aussie manager) whom arranged to have it delivered. Thank you, thank you & thank you!! This was greatly appreciated. You didn't have to go out of your way & you did it."
1125,"Great experience, but too short.",50,August 2018,"We had booked 12 nights at the Marriott, but due to some unfortunate circumstances, we had to shorten our visit unexpectedly. The front desk staff were enormously helpful with this process ( special mention to Tony ) as we had to checkout and leave Bail earlier than planned.

The location of this property is ideal, as it is located on one of the main streets of the Seminyak area. The hotel provides a buggy to a reserved area on the beachfront, or to Eat street in Seminyak.

They regularly provide entertainment and nightly events for families and guests staying...

We would definitely stay here again!"
1126,Excellent service staffs,50,August 2018,"Stayed at Courtyard for 4 nights. The guest relations team surprised my boyfriend and I with a birthday cake placed on our room table when we got back to the hotel. We mentioned casually that we were here to celebrate his birthday when the receptionist asked us about our plans upon check in. Pleasantly surprised. All the staffs are so friendly and approachable, always asking if we need any help. The breakfast buffet is unbeatable. There are shuttle services to a couple of more happening areas in Seminyak and there is private access to Double Six beach. The rooms are clean and modern. I cannot wish for a better stay for the price I paid. Thank you Courtyard!"
1127,Great rooms; nice pool bar.,50,August 2018,"Stayed here with some friends on a bucks weekend trip. Staff were really friendly. They have music and other events in the courtyard many nights, and happy hour by the pool bar each night. Great breakfast too. In a nice part of Seminyak. And well priced for 5 star. I would happily come back. My friends had been before also. Seminyak is great for nicer shopping and a much nicer vibe than Kuta. üëç"
1128,Pre- wedding bliss,50,August 2018,"Beatiful pool area qith swim up bar; pool bingo competitions.the daiquiri is a stand out. lovely staff- in paticular abit and andi who were very helpful. Great facilities, clean rooms, good atmosphere"
1129,Great stay at the Courtyard Marriott,50,August 2018,"Had booked a holiday for a week at the Courtyard Marriott as part of
My sons 30th birthday celebration. It is our first stay at this hotel although I have visited Bali some 25 times before. The hotel has been an absolute joy to stay at. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. They help to create the warm holiday atmosphere you want when staying somewhere. Our room was ready early when we arrived and was impeccable in its presentation. We have enjoyed many a happy hour around the pools area and have enjoyed a hearty breakfast every day.
We will certainly be returning to this hotel. It for a longer period next time.

Ray and Shane"
1130,Wonderful place!,50,August 2018,"Room is wonderful, clean, and bathroom is very big. Location is very near to everywhere, the eateries, beaches etc. Like the strict security feeling very safe, also the staffs are all very friendly with positive and proactive attitude in assisting us. Personally wants to thank the Manager, Bagus! We are so glad to stay in Marriott."
1131,Building work,50,July 2018,"The hotel started demolishing the balconies in the three rooms on a Sunday afternoon opposite our room on contacting the reception we were informed that the work would cease in 15 minutes that being 5pm.
For the next four days work continued with bolster chisels and lump hammers the noise was unbearable we contacted the manager as we thought only to find out it was the manager of the reception not the hotel manager we were fobbed of with a bottle of wine and a cheese board .

The restaurant facilities and food were excellent, The staff in the food hall were to be commended for there customer service.

The moral of this review is speak to the organ grinder not his workers ."
1132,Perfect place!,50,July 2018,"Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak is certainly the place to stay! This resort has everything you need from amazing staff to great amenities. I'd like to thank Hendra (pool bar manager) for his great work in making us feel comfortable, making sure we had anything we needed and his positive attitude.Thank you Marriott for our amazing stay! We will defiantly be back."
1133,A place to call home!,50,August 2018,"Our family loves to travel however our children are small age 5 and 3. Therefore we do not like to move around to much and wanted to choose a place where we can call home for 10 days. And we found it!

We initially choose Courtyard by Marriott because of its security protocols (which is not over the top) and great location. But we fell in love with their staff.

Every morning we had breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen and we were greeted with warm welcome and beautiful smiles. We were lucky enough to get to know a lot of the wait staff. So I would like to say thank you to Maria, Tania, Arjay and Damanyanti (who makes the breakfast juices). This restaurant gets super busy especially during breakfast service and these guys especially we marvellous and hard working under pressure. Also try their
mie goreng it‚Äôs really good.

We also got to know the house keeping staff. And our favourite was Buda. We met him coming back early after breakfast and he just finished cleaning our room. This young man took time from he‚Äôs busy schedule to fold the towels into animals. It was a thrill for my kids to see what animal he would fold next.

Nestled in the corner near the pool of this hotel is the hidden gem of this hotel (you will thank me especially if you have kids). It is their kids club! The interior is very cute and welcoming however maybe because of the amount of kids they have go through the kids clubs the toys are a little bit out dated. But and this is a big BUT what makes this place are the amazing people who work there (Komang and Dewi). My husband and I watched these ladies look after other people children with love, care but they were also firm when required. We do not really leave our children with strangers especially in a foreign country but a few hours with Komang our apprehension was put at ease. There is something about this young lady that made my gut told me my child would be fine and I could trust her with my own child. Or maybe it was the fact my children were so drawn to her. She had so much patience and love for the kids and she can also fold a great origami frog. You can really see the passion she has for her job. So thank you thank you Komang for making my children‚Äôs holiday so special. My children can not stop talking about you to our family and friends.

Thank you so much for making our family holiday very memorable. Because of the staff in this hotel we would return again. And we highly recommend it!"
1134,Great hotel,50,August 2018,Abit from pool bar area is extreamly nice and is able to assist you in anyway. Super good guy. Also the hotel is amazing from the food to the rooms to the pool area. Best place ive stayed in and ive been to bali 15 times.
1135,Wonderful service,50,August 2018,Currently staying at this hotel and the service has been fantastic! The staff in the pool bar Sista and Abit are so incredibly friendly and go out of their way to help us. Massage is also a bonus and my goodness the breakfast is the best I‚Äôve had in a hotel. Two for one cocktails at pool bar are wicked and very moreish!
1136,Anniversary,50,August 2018,"We had a wonderful time staying at this hotel. All of your staff we interacted with in all departments were amazing. I Travel for a living and my husband works at a worldwide hotel brand. From check in to upcoming departure was smooth. We were so tired at checking in due to our long travels and Nyssma made it very for us . She even helped us to room. Breakfast was one of best in the world with the options.The hotel staff helped us out with smiles . I will copy this and post on trip advisor. Can‚Äôt say Thank you enough!
Mr.&Mrs Scott"
1137,great hotel good location,40,July 2018,"this Hotel was perfect for us and our 16 year old daughter, we spent 2 nights in Seminyak and the location is perfect, nearby restaurants and eat street, shops and the beach, the golf buggy was a plus to our stay, taking us to the beach hotel area with sun beds and free bottles of water. the swimming pool area is big with bean bags to relax and the pool bar staff are friendly and the drinks are reasonable price overall the experience in this hotel was fab. they offer free popcorn all day, breakfast was good with bagel station, fresh juices, fresh egg benedicts, coffee station with cappuccino, lattes and the room was very clean and confortable beds and pillows of good quality, bathroom was good great shower and hot water. we had a swimming pool view room the balcony was spacious with a nice outdoor furniture. we recommend this hotel to stay in Seminyak."
1138,Amazing,50,July 2018,"Both my husband and myself would like to thank all the staff from the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak for making our first visit to Bali an amazing experience.

Choosing a hotel in a foreign country can be daunting but I would without a doubt thoroughly recommend this hotel for excellent food amazing facilities and exceptional staff.

Fellow travellers take my advice when booking this hotel definitely get the breakfast included.
The breakfast buffet is stupendous better than some cruises we have been on. The kitchen staff are a joy, service is always with a smile and they even remember your name, room number and your previous orders making it a very personalised experience.

Another service we used during our stay was the Spa the Zanti Retreat, a big thank you to the lovely ladies who did an amazing job of getting my husband‚Äôs bad back under control from the cramped flight from the plane.

In conclusion we would like to thank Johnny Cash our driver who went beyond the line of duty to accommodate all our requests in relation to the sights and experiences that we wanted to achieve during our stay.

Also a special thank you to Arin at the Seminyak kitchen for your friendly service and the lovely chats we had during our last two days at the hotel.

We will be back üòâ"
1139,Great hotel with great people,50,August 2018,"Stayed at this hotel after I got out of hospital. Very nice hotel, very clean. Always someone to help you out. Great services also. Always someone to make sure I was okay because I was in crutches and wheelchair. A big thank you to Hendra! Jaya, Kesawa, Mob and also Alit! Thank you for making this stay way more enjoyable! Always a good fun vibe! Big thank you from elise and david!"
1140,Nice wnough,30,July 2018,"We stayed at the courtyard last week. The hotel is nice enough, there are some good and some not so great things:
Good:
- close to beach and la plancha
- modern, clean rooms
- great staff
- amazing buffet breakfast, one of the best we have experienced

Not so good:
- the hotel was booked out when we arrived, I had booked 4 nights in a king room but they placed us in a twin room for two of the nights. Not ideal when this is the only yearly holiday with my fianc√©
- the pool is amongst the building meaning one side is always in the shade. It‚Äôs also quite cramped in there meaning you are laying right next to a stranger
- the pool water is quite cold
- the pool area is small and noise echos from the walls, I didn‚Äôt find the pool area a relaxing space
- the gym is quite small and packed in the morning
- the hotel staff tries to sell their own transport too much, we tried several times to get them to call us a taxi and they always tried to sell their own drivers. We ended up just getting taxis from the street

Overall we had a good stay but we wouldn‚Äôt stay again. This hotel might suit young people or professionals more than people wanting to relax."
1141,Wow! Staff are outstanding,50,August 2018,"We recently stayed with our adult sons for 7 nights. We didn't actually venture far from the Marriott as it had everything we wanted for a relaxing holiday. Your staff made my holiday. From Widi & Arja in Seminyak Kitchen at breakfast to Alit ,Hendra, Peny ,Wika ,Feby ,Anga
& Dede at the pool bar! You made our stay AMAZING! Terima Kasih ‚ù§"
1142,Amazing,50,July 2018,"The best to go to when you have kids..the pool is safe and clean..they also have a kids club and babysitting for couple of hours free free every day. You do pay a small hourly n fee if it's more. The breakfast buffet is out of this world, what a variety. Staff are friendly and kind. They treat their guests with a friendly smile every morning and do their best to make their stay comfy. I am going back there again."
1143,Nice trip,50,July 2018,Staffs are so helpful and friendly. Hotel location was very convenient and safety. They have shuttle bus from hotel to the beach. My room and all the hotel facilities were very nice. The Local tour can arrange at concierge. Is very comfortable hotel.

however each and every staff member always has a welcoming smile all day everyday...
please treat yourself and book Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak."
1145,Nice location but relatively small rooms,30,July 2018,"We spent 3 nights here recently for business meeting, and due to limited suits we were only upgraded to a pool view room, even though I am a platinum member. The GM is very kind and hospitable though, he sincerely apologize for not being able to provide better upgrade.
I would say the location of this hotel in Seminyak is quite good, pretty near to the beach and many good restaurants.
The rooms are relatively small though, especially the bathrooms. No bath is available in all of their rooms, except for 2 bedrooms suites type, which I think is very disappointing for a resort, especially when it is rated as a category 5 hotel by Starwood. It is good to know that their new category from 18th August onward would only be 3, since category 5 is definitely too high for the facilities they provide.
Food selections are great during breakfast, especially their freshly squeeze juice corner. The other food qualities are not bad but not too special as well, since some taste quite plain.
It is worth to stay in this hotel if the price is right."
1146,Amazing Short Stay,50,July 2018,"From the moment we arrived to our early morning check-out we were always treated with the highest attention and respect from all staff. We love coming to the Courtyard because of the location, the friendly staff and highest quality service. This time around was no exception.... many thanks to Ramu and Muliana.
Special thanks to Tya and Tony in Front Desk and of course Arini, Ayu, Dwi, Rai and Ana in SEMINYAK Kitchen who couldn't do enough to ensure we had a memorable time.
We spent some time at the pool bar and were treated to some fabulous entertainment. This husband and wife duet are amazing as are the staff (Abit and Delia).
We are already planning our next trip and the Courtyard by Marriott is our preferred accommodation.
See you soon guys."
1147,Absolutely perfect!,50,July 2018,"Staying 2says now everything PERFECT!:)
From the reception to pool bar and every corner of here are so nice and kind.
Specially stuff in reception Precilla and Chinta & Abit from pool bar they make us feel like home.
I will enjoy more while I stay here! Thank you everyone in Courtyard Bali Seminyak!!!;)"
1148,Wonderful place,50,July 2018,"Great experience in the pool bar in the hotel. Great cocktails and live music. Service was excellent, always somebody there to cater your needs. Especially chinta. Thanks for a great holiday we‚Äôll definitely be back üôÇ"
1149,Intruder in my room at 1am,10,May 2018,"I woke to find an intruder in my room, at the end of the bed who ran out the door into the pool area when I sat up and yelled out. Management didn't take my claim seriously, I flew out 5 hours later, an investigation (which when I checked out I was assured would happen immediately) only happened 5 days later when I followed up in Perth. Surprise, surprise no CCTV footage of anything suspicion.

Whilst I have discussed this matter with two senior employees, I am unsatisfied with the way this was handled and the lies and misinformation about door locks not working. If you do choose to stay here please check that the sliding doors can't be physical opened as when you turn the lock it makes a locking sound but ours didn't work which was confirmed by the night manager but later denied by the Director of Operations.

I would never step foot into this hotel again as it is obviously unsafe."
1150,Trying too hard,30,July 2018,"Stayed here for 5 nights and this hotel has a lot of positives, they are:
The rooms are very nice, well maintained, quiet and very clean. We were in a suite on the 5th floor and the only time we heard something was from the upstairs room. The ground floor rooms look interesting, you walk straight out to the pool area, so privacy might be something.
The reception and concierge staff are well trained and very friendly, you get a really good welcome and help when you need it.
The location is good, about a 20 min walk from ""eat street"" and about 5 min from the beach. There is a shuttle to eat street, which you have to ask for at the bell desk.
Breakfast has the longest span, 6.30 am to 11.00am and the buffet is great. Check out is also 12 noon.
The negatives are:
The hotel is built around the swimming pool, which is long and narrow and has one sunny side, which is always packed. Its also very much not a resort, so the pool area is small and its difficult to find a spot around at it at the best of times. The Marriott doesn't try and hide what its pool is like in its advertising but a fact is a fact, its always busy.
The security check as you go into the hotel each time is questionable. I understand that Marriott hotels may have historic issues in Indonesia but such checks should either be done properly or not at all, at the moment its just an inconvenience for guests, as the walk through metal detector was hit and miss and some times there was someone there to scan you, sometimes there wasn't.
Not sure if there is some sort of scam going on with the pool bar staff but they rang my room at 9.15pm to demand payment for purchases, even though I had a Rph3M hold on my credit card. Advised front reception and was provided an apology but no explanation. So if you get a phone call from the pool bar saying they want to come to your room right away to get payment, tell them to get lost.
There is only 1 restaurant and a pool bar, again Marriott doesn't hide this fact.
The gym is tiny and has the basics.
The baggage staff at the front entrance aren't very helpful, wouldn't get us a cab when we were leaving, unless it was the hotel's taxi service. We were advised to wait on the street.
Bean bags, fake grass and people sun bathing all day right next to reception - not my thing but I'm sure it appeals to some people.

Nice place, good location and trying a bit hard to be hipster friendly. The quality of the rooms and the breakfast do however make this an above average hotel."
1151,Great Hotel,50,July 2018,"This Hotel definitely met expectations. We stayed for two nights and found the whole experience great. Rooms were very clean, staff friendly and lots of choice for breakfast. I‚Äôd highly recommend a stay here!"
1152,This hotel never disappoints,50,July 2018,"This is the second time staying at the Courtyard Marriott and apart from the great location, facilities, pool and food here, the main attraction is the outstanding staff. From Santi at check in to Adel at breakfast, these friendly faces are so welcoming. Special mention to the pool bar staff, Hendra, Feby, Mob, Agik, Jaya & Alit for making each day so much fun!! Highly recommend this hotel!"
1153,A very relaxing 8 night stay,50,July 2018,"I just stayed here for 8 nights. When I was booking I wanted a relaxing holiday and to stay somewhere with sufficient facilities so I wouldn‚Äôt have to venture too far from the hotel. I found this hotel delivered this and was a good base while I was in Bali.

I had a Deluxe Pool View Room which was very good. I particularly liked the quite large rainfall shower which extended past the balcony and had an outdoor feel with some frosted glass.

I spent a lot of days laying by the pool and the pool bar. But when I did head out it was also close to the nearby gay bars and a walk or short taxi to Ku De Ta and Potato Head.

The staff were all friendly and attentive. The welcome beer while checking in was a nice touch.

Special mention to the staff at the hotel spa Zanti The Retreat. I don‚Äôt usually get massages but had 1 here on my first day and ended up going back for 2 more. I had the stress release massage twice as well as the traditional Balinese massage. Both were bliss. Do yourself a favour and go for the 90 minute massage instead of 60, as I did on my last day. You won‚Äôt regret it. You may pay more here than some of the cheaper places nearby but it is well worth it for a professional service.

I highly recommend this spa and hotel and would return."
1154,"Great hotel, excellent service!",50,July 2018,"Myself and the discerning wifey came to Bali to visit friends and get some warmth! We booked the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak as friends were staying there as well, and I'm very glad we did.

The check in was very pleasant, with a complimentary cold drink as soon as you arrive which was very well received. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, with excellent shower and bathroom facilities. Toothbrushes and hairdryer are provided, which minimises packing for your toiletries.

The bed was very comfortable and the lighting was excellent.

Facilities wise in the hotel, the pool and gym were both very good - in particular, the bar facilities are excellent!

I do recommend the room service, the service is prompt and very good.

Overall a fantastic place to stay in Seminyak, nice and central with free golf cart transfers to the beach and Seminyak Square. (Shopping Centre)

Would we stay again? Definitely!
Should you stay? Absolutely!"
1155,Wouldn‚Äôt stay again.,20,July 2018,"Booked this hotel in the middle of our holiday thinking it would be a treat. Cost was above average in Seminyak/Legian but it was a 5 star so thought it would be worth it. The room rate does NOT include breakfast. Breakfast has to be paid extra. Check in took a long time, we left luggage, if you read other reviews you will see you have to be sniffed by the security dog and patted down then walk though a body scanner EVERY time you enter the hotel. Which is fine for security but it gets abit annoying every time you pop in for food. So 3 nights at the hotel left our luggage and went shopping after a lengthy check in we were told come back at 5pm - came back at 5pm the lady tried to sell us packages for credit for the hotel we said we would pay cash as we go. Get finally get up to room. Room has 2 single Beds in it. We go back to lobby and the lady doesn‚Äôt say sorry she juts says I thought you said two single. We say we wanted double I am here with my partner she says the room won‚Äôt be ready until 8.30pm then. 8.30? I said we need to get ready for dinner. She dissapears out the back for 25 mins then come out with a key there is magically a room - still no sorry. Room is clean plain nice/ have paid less for nicer much bigger rooms. The pool is under shade the whole pool didn‚Äôt swim once too cold sat next to the pool once before you can even order they are shoving the bill at you asking if you have credit on your room - out other hotels you can drink and they give you the bill after . My partner became ill with Bali belly they called doctor for us which was nice. The second night he was still sick. We called and asked to be put through to a number so I could urgently change my flights as my partner had been vomiting for 2 days now , I was told my room doesn‚Äôt have credit if I want to make a call come down and add credit I said can you. It bring me a bill they said no. They did leave a fruit platter to say sorry for the check in, very worried about getting money for bill not service"
1156,Family will return again,50,July 2018,"Had a great time & extended our stay three days.
Breakfast was top notch with fresh fruit-carrot drinks. hot chocolate for the
grand kids. Complete buffet Western/Indonesia/ Indian/Chinese.
Swimming pool well kept along with poolside service with remote control for paging service. Wi-Fi coverage 100% throughout the hotel.
Had a Family suite more than enough room 4 people.
Beach 15 minute walk, but hotel has a free shuttle to a private beach with wi-fi, towels & restaurants galore. Area around hotel has plenty of restaurants sushi to pizza.
1st time I ever checked in a hotel that offered a free beer & popcorn for the kids.
checking in-out excellent. Hotel vans to tourist attractions reasonable price along with transportation to the airport.
From the Manager to the luggage handlers all professional & friendly making for a fantastic vacation and a return trip."
1157,Very happy with our stay BUT.....,50,June 2018,"This is the 2nd time we stayed in Bali and the second time in Seminyak. Please don't misjudge my title. The Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak is a beautiful hotel.
It is modern, clean, the staff are a pleasure to deal with and even though it is a cliche genuinely do want to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.

An example of this is that my wife has poor knees and we wanted to be as close as possible to the lifts. On checking in we were advised that for the first night they advised they could not accomodate our request and that the room was situated furthest from the lift. Reception advised that however from the next day that our room for the remainder of our stay was situated as close as possible to the lift and they were right!! Thank you for this as it made our stay so much more pleasurable.
All other reviews you will read on this site are correct:
Great WiFi
Lovely breakfast
Clean rooms
The restaurant at the hotel is nice - not spectacular but that is OK. Also found it reasonably priced.
Concierge was fantastic in booking our restaurant and taxi each night. Taxi always arrived with a meter.
There is strong security out the front where you get the wand and have to place your baggage or bags through the scanner each time you enter. We had no problem with this especially in this day and age and found it comforting.
The hotel is located in a great area - supermarket across the road to load up your empty bar fridge with drinks and to buy chips, chocolates, snacks etc. Good strip to do some shopping with some restaurants up the road. In the supermarket there is a little spot there where you can exchange your dollars. We found it safe and they had a reasonable rate each day and they don't charge a commission. The one in the hotel offers a poor rate.
The highlight of the hotel in our view was the pool area. It is huge and it is fantastic. From the first level of the pool bar to the 2nd level of the general swimming area with the 3rd level being the kids pool.

BUT and this is the but. We like to work on our tans when we go on holidays. We wish someone would have mentioned this in other reviews. Because of the configuration of the hotel and rooms we estimate that over 60% of the poolside area including the pool is in shade. To many this might not be an issue to others I'm sure it is. We did manage to find poolside lounges in the sun but you had to get to the pool area early.

Bottom line were we happy with the hotel? - YES
Would we come here again knowing about the pool / shade?.... YES

Oh yes the other thing is we loved the taco truck out the front - 2 tacos for 5,000IR is a bargain!!"
1158,Fabulous stay!,50,July 2018,"My sister and I got the five night package deal that included the room, welcome drink, daily buffet breakfast, a massage, a dinner, a lunch, tacos from the onsite taco truck, a daily bucket of beer and airport transfers. The best value at just over $100 each a night.

The room was great, shower especially amazing. All staff truely attentive at all times and lovely. Such a fantastic location, can walk to the beach and plenty of shopping, bars and restaurants close by. Well maintained, nothing really looked old and tired.

The only thing is one side of the pool gets zilch sun during the day due to the height of the buildings but hey, no need to slip slop slap! Loved my stay."
1159,Great accommodation,40,May 2018,"Great clean and comfortable accommodation. Our room overlooked the pool which was great. Plenty of spots around the pool for sunbathing and swimming. Pool bar if you‚Äôre into that. We had breakfast included and the choices were incredible. Everything to suit all appetites and tastes. The restaurant managers and staff could not have been more attentive to everyone‚Äôs needs. The accommodation is also near enough to the beach if you prefer to walk ,however for those who don‚Äôt, the hotel provides free transport to and from the beach. Shops are also within walking distance and transport to other areas in Bali is not too expensive. Biggest setback is the amount of traffic on the roads, thousands of motor cycles. The Marriott has entertainment and special evenings that you can book for an extra cost but there is free entertainment at the poolside bar. Due to the length of our stay we were invited to free drinks and nibbles on the roof top, which was very nice."
1160,Safe and clean hotel,50,July 2018,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The breakfast was amazing! It was the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel (talking about quantity and quality). We were felt safe staying at the hotel. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff was very friendly. In addition, free shuttle to the center."
1161,excelent !!!!!,50,July 2018,"im not really good in writting a review but i wanna take this chance to write one,

overall this hotel were very well maintain, and have so much facilty for such a 4 stars hotel really beyond my expectation.

thanks for all your great service"
1162,Outstanding service from all the staff,50,June 2018,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, nice hotel and good location. We were impressed by the outstanding service provided by the staff, super attentive they make you always feel welcomed. Front line staff are really nice and helpful. Smooth check-in by Francesca and speedy check-out. Room is very clean thanks to Roy. Pool bar staff are awesome. Special thanks to Arin and Tania at the Seminyak Kitchen for their exceptional service and for making my breakfast experience a fantastic one!"
1163,First time in Bali,50,July 2018,"Wow, what a place to stay. We are on the 2nd floor looking over the pool. Very comfortable beds and a very well appointed room. The ammenities are up to date. We got a great deal with lots of extras. Very close to the beach and a nice area of Seminyak. Very happy staying here. We walked into Kuta and back again."
1164,Birthday holiday,50,July 2018,"The staff were the freindliest most helpful and kind I have ever met. They made our experience all the better. The chef made me gluten free meals, pool bar staff so accomadating under the guidance of an efficient manager that took an interest in everyone. Thankyou to all the wonderful staff for your kindness and birthday wishes, making my 65th such an enjoyable time. Suksama!!!üòé
PS. Thankyou Sista for the mangoes! Good service Vani.
Wendy and Paul Dando"
1165,Team Sursur @ Bali,50,February 2018,"Very memorable stay in Bali mainly because of Arini, our favourite morning breakfast/dinner girl of the Seminyak Kitchen Restaurant at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort. Amazing 5 star breakfast buffet...we love the fresh fruits and a variety of local dishes. This resort hotel was a winner!!!"
1166,Very nice staff,40,July 2018,"This hotel has a very good location in Seminyak, close to the beach and lots of eateries in the neighborhood. The room was of good size and very clean, but with a lack of storage place. Breakfast was good with many choices. The room service was also good, but the fish market buffet was certainly not worth the money with few choices of fish and shellfish. The swimmingpool was of good size but cold. The best at this hotel is the staff. Everyone is kind and polite and I will especially mention Priscilla at the guest service."
1167,Amazing Hospitality,50,July 2018,"The hotel stay was great and comfortable. Special thanks to Young Grant for providing complimentary breakfast! David also made the check-in process really smooth. The breakfast buffet was amazing and had every variety one could ask for.

The hotel pools are amazing. The hospitality and staff friendliness was one of the best I've ever experienced. If you're in the area I'd definitely recommend!"
1168,Best location to stay in Seminyak....,50,July 2018,"Courtyard Seminyak has an excellent location with all the major attractions are at stone throw away.

Pros:
1. Best location
2. Fabulous breakfast
3. Good pricing for hotel facilities viz. spa and dining.
4. Hotel carts available for to and fro to nearby attractions.

Cons:
1. Signs of ageing
2. Small bathroom size"
1169,Very good hotel | Good Crowd | Good Food,40,July 2018,"So I was at this hotel for about a week. The hotel is one of the good properties in Bali. This property has big and clean rooms which is of primary importance. I took a room that had it balcony opening in the front side of the hotel which was an added advance to me.
The hotel offers two pool, one for adults and one for kids. However most of the times the pool water is so cold that it takes efforts to get in. The hotel also has a nice gym.
The hotel has a really nice kitchen offering lavish breakfast.

Specifically I want to thank the restaurant manager Mr Ambara for taking care of me at the dining personally every morning. He is really the best at his job. He practically takes care of everybody at the breakfast area.

The hotel has this really nice food truck standing at the exit of the main gate selling tacos. I highly recommend my 30000+ readers to must try them.

In all it was a great stay."
1170,Clean Room with Good Service Staff,40,July 2018,"Would really recommend Courtyard for the following reasons:
- Clean and spacious room and bathroom
- Powerful hairdryer
- Complete set of toiletries
- Service staff were friendly and always ready to help
- Breakfast with a wide selection (even though it can get really crowded)

The only complaint I have is while it is located seminyak, it is not in the main seminyak square area. It took us around 20mins to walk there along the road and there wasn‚Äôt really proper walking path for pedestrians.

Would really recommend courtyard if you don‚Äôt mind staying slightly further from the main square.

However, to prevent any bad experience with the ‚Äúcabs‚Äù, I would also recommend visitors to download the blue bird app to call for the official taxis if you are not using grab/ Uber.

We had a really bad experience with a cab driver who said he was going to use the meter. In the end, the meter was ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù and he wanted us to pay 500,000rupiah (SGD50) for a 7min ride which would usually cost not more then SGD3."
1171,Wedding of the year!,50,July 2018,"We recently spent four nights at this resort for a friends wedding and it did not disappoint. Tucked into a fabulous location one block back from the beach, loads of shops and eateries with in walking, bike or a short taxi ride away. But it‚Äôs the relaxation and serenity you feel once stepping into the resort that makes it so wonderful. Beautiful gardens with a two tier pop running straight through the centre of the establishment, substantial rooms, excellent customer service and a fantastic inclusive buffet breakfast made for a truly celebratory and joyous stay. We will be back - thank you!"
1172,Great stay all around,50,July 2018,"We just spend four nights at the Courtyard....
- Welcome, great welcome, with offer of a welcome drink although we declined.
- Nice room, very comfortable and clean. Noticed that one light bulbs was burned out in the bathroom, but it was replaced the next day without having to say anything - well done team!
- Breakfast was a wow - amazing variety and value - perhaps the best overall selection and value in the Marriott family of hotels. Lots of team members to help with coffees etc.
- Nice pool area, friendly staff, great location, all in all a very good stay?
- What would I change? The beach club was disappointing - tiny piece of sand at back of the beach with towels only. No beverages etc., although available from the bar next door."
1173,Comfortable & Safe,40,March 2018,"Very clean, helpful staffs and well organized hotel. Situated close to the beach and handful of convenience store nearby. Entry to hotel compounds require security checks. Hotel amenities were good and well rounded. The pool was a good place to catch the sky littered with stars!"
1174,They have it covered!,40,February 2018,"This hotel has all you need, really well priced for all it has to offer. Rooms are lovely, they seem more up to date than the rest of the hotel. Great linen, beds and bathrooms also really clean.. The staff are so so friendly and accommodating. I would stay again!"
1175,Not Your Typical Courtyard -- More like a Resort,50,June 2018,"I was used to the typical Courtyard in the US -- clean, good enough for business travel. But this place was like a resort! Beautiful spa, pool, taco truck, shuttle to the beach, room service (I recommend the margarita pizza, which is about USD 4), and a beautiful breakfast buffet that is amazing. The staff is also very welcoming and generally wonderful. I can't recommend this place enough."
1176,First class resort,50,July 2018,"As soon as we arrived we knew this place would be perfect for our week long visit to Seminyak. Amazing rooms..especially the bathroom & comfy beds. The location is awesome, the brekky amazing, the service was always prompt & best of all the awesome pool & bar. Would definitely recommend this resort"
1177,No loyalty,30,July 2018,"I recently stayed at the hotel which was my second visit in two years. I booked my room two months prior for a mother daughter holiday and then decided to bring rest of family two days before. I asked the hotel if they could match the room price that I secured by booking direct with them however instead they offered a lesser room and with a cost of an additional $2000 on top of the room rate for the week. Even booking.com was offering the room $1000 cheaper. I emailed twice as it was hard to get them to answer the phone and the rate differed from $1000 to $2000.
I thought it was better to book direct but would not bother in future. I ended up securing my husband and other kids a villa down the road for similar price to my room and we used both facilities throughout the week. Not ideal but was not about to be ripped off.

Very poor customer service for a returning customer. Would definitely book elsewhere next time."
1178,High quality service,50,July 2018,"If generally Marriott offers excellent service, this hotel is really outstanding. Is a perfect combination of Marriott‚Äôs standard and Balinese hospitality.
I‚Äôve enjoyed this hospitality and I really recommend it if you are looking for a good place to stay in Bali. And last but not least, it‚Äôs 5 minutes walk from the beach..."
1179,Solid Seminyak Hotel,40,May 2018,"The Courtyard Marriott Seminyak is a nice clean hotel with a nice pool and is pretty well located within Seminyak. The breakfast has tons of options and was very satisfying. Overall, this a solid but not spectacular choice in Seminyak."
1180,Great for Coeliac,50,April 2018,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff. I am coeliac and dairy free. Chef Patrick went above and beyond to make me Eggs Benedict with a truffle oil hollandaise sauce - absolutely delicious! Would definitely go back. Care was taken for all meals, staff were understanding and helpful."
1181,Follow Up to 1st Review...,30,July 2018,"I previously wrote a review for the Hotel Properties Reservations Department a week ago. Unsure, what has happened to that post since it was published. For your records, I've gone and pasted my first post down at the bottom.

After experiencing questionable customer service from PUTU RAIS in the reservations department. I was reached out to from SEKARTAJI - different associate from the reservations department.

She extended an apology for the level of service I received and informed me that is not how they'd like my experience with them to be. After a few email exchanges, my wife and I felt more encouraged to give them a second chance. While it's not excusable on how they handled the situation the first time around, we do believe that if a willingness to rectify a situation is apparent, we're willing to meet them half way and provide them w/ a second chance.

She helped me with the booking for 4 nights for our stay in September.

This review is strictly on their ability to follow up with a potential guest in making sure they understand the situation and how quickly they acted in working with us to rectify the situation. This again does not excuse our first experience. We gave them a one star in our first review and feel this is a good half way point as acknowledgement to the hard work they put to rectify the situation.

Later after our stay we will provide a full review of our complete experience with their service and their hotel property.

*Previous Review - that was removed for unknown reasons*

Please note I have not stayed @ this property & the review is for their reservations department. I'm very aware that this is my first post & people who make their first posts as a complaint need to be taken w/ a grain of salt. However, I do strongly feel this needs to be shared.

My wife & were considering staying at this property for our upcoming honeymoon in September 2018. We saw the property was offering a lovely promotion (5 night stay for $777 USD before taxes & fees). Unfortunately, we will only be in the area for 4nights.

We reached out to the hotel to see if they'd be able to offer the same promotion for 4nights. We were told that they could not accommodate but they ""are pleased to offer special rate at $3.2M IDR/per night ($230 USD/per night)"". This included daily breakfast & a deluxe pool view room.

Here is the warning!!! It would be in our best interest to book the 5night promotion for $777.00 USD as that would be cheaper than paying the ""special rate"" of $3.2M IDR. A 4night stay @ that ""special rate"" comes out to around $890 before taxes and fees. Almost $200 more for one less night. The $777 USD promotion is for the same room type, also includes daily breakfast, along w/ a 60min couples massage, dinner for two adults, transportation to airport, & food from the taco truck.

How does that make sense? Why would you make an offer to a customer who is looking to stay at your property that is NOT in their best interest? Why are you attempting to take advantage of us?

To make matters worse, if we were to book directly through the Courtyard website we could get the same exact ""special offer"" that was presented to us at a much lower cost. You can book the same exact offer for $2.5M IDR vs their offer of $3.2M IDR. This is very disappointing and disturbing that they would try & cheat & lie to a customer in order to make more money.

This type of practice & service should not be acceptable to anyone let alone to Courtyard. Shame on the reservation agent & Courtyard for allowing something like this to happen.

The agent we were in contact with directly is PUTU RAIS. Please be aware & when working w/ this reservation agent.

Please do your due diligence & make sure you're getting the best deal possible & not be fooled by any ""special offers"" from their reservation agents as they will lie & cheat you."
1182,"Flexible and friendly, especially when in need!",40,June 2018,"So, we got stuck in Bali after an volcano erupted and the airport closed and our flight was delayed a couple of days. After about a minute of research we ended up choosing Courtyard by Marriott on impulse, but were not disappointed. A nice room with a pool view, a great gym and good location but most important a friendly and extremely flexible staff that helped us out with everything we needed, including late check out, new tickets for our flight etc, etc.

The breakfast was a bit chaotic and the restaurant staff did not provide the high quality service that the front desk staff and drivers did, but still a nice experience to a more than reasonable price."
1183,Specious..Beautiful..with Great People,50,June 2018,"Located in beautiful Seminyak this property is very specious, clean, beautiful giving perfect spiritual and calm feeling of Bali. Pool and pool bar is big and amazing. All the staff working here offers great hospitality with smile all the time. Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen is awesome. This hotel is surrounded by few restaurants and they provide shuttle service to more happening area.

Thank you for the wonderful experience."
1184,An excellent stay overall,50,June 2018,"We had a couple of issues with an early check in before we arrived at this hotel, however these issues were resolved by Grant. Special thanks to Grant for his understanding of our circumstances. Grant did a great job in taking care of us and I also noted how he was with other guests he was very personable and welcoming. We were offered guest vouchers on our arrival and one of the vouchers entitled us with a spa massage, unfortunately due to an op I had a couple of months back I could not have the massage however they swapped the treatment on this occasion for me and I enjoyed an incredible facial instead. Staff are so warm and welcoming - nothing is genuinely a bother for them. The restaurant staff - absolutely amazing - special thanks to Maria - she instantly stopped what she was doing to help my mother who was suffering from low sugar - she immediately got her a coke and put her food order through straight away ( I know this sounds a simple request) however she was very concerned and was genuine in her service. We also received amazing service from Mira - a star employee who always had a smile on her face no matter how busy she was and almost was always there when we visited the restaurant- excellent service all round from the restaurant staff of course, but Maria and Mira really were great! I cannot fault this hotel one bit - the staff really made the experience for us - housekeeping was great, breakfast was good and fresh, the shuttle service was good too - the beds -oh they were so comfortable! A Great location and I will for sure return to this hotel. I have already recommended this to others I know. The only thing that was a little annoying was that I didn‚Äôt earn my rewards as I had booked via a third party website but I imagine this is the case for many reward led schemes."
1185,Friendliest staff ever !,50,June 2018,"My friend and I stayed at the Marriott hotel two weeks ago in seminyak. Greeted by the friendliest staff. They were really accommodating and helpful whether it was driving us around town, arranging tours, talking to us or simply smiling at us ‚ò∫Ô∏è I want to mention the waiter Hendra for his brilliant service and kind heart, we talked to him in the pool bar on our last day and we left the hotel feeling so happy and welcomed. And one last mention is chinta, yet another beautiful soul providing us with the best service and happy smiles:)"
1186,Great Facility with Great People,50,June 2018,"We have just returned from a great 3 night stay at this venue. It is great venue in a great location, close to beach, shops, seminyak square. If it is too hot for you to walk, they offer a shuttle to the major sites anyways.

The staff here were super friendly and take a keen interest in making sure that your stay is as great as possible. Special mention to the Pool Bar staff who apart from providing great service in keeping up with demand (it was quite busy some afternoons) played some games to encourage guests involvement (Bingo/music etc)

The room was comfortable with an amazing bathroom/shower and spoilt for choice at breakfast!

Hidden highlights were the table tennis in the lobby along with a popcorn machine. Great place and would happy stay there again when heading to Seminyak."
1187,Nice hotel & really recommended !!!,40,July 2018,"We are (still) staying in the hotel from July 2nd - 7th 2018.

All the staff are really nice ... congrats guys !!! The room also comfy & clean.

How about the food ? I may rating 9 out of 10 !!! Because of they are serving varieties of food & most of them are good.

Keep up the good job guys !!!!"
1188,DISAPPOINTING,10,July 2018,"I do not write reviews often as I find it a chore, but this really pissed me off.
Cancelled flight due to mount agung, Long hours at airport, last minute 2nights booking as me and my partner really needed a good rest. And....
WOKE UP TO COMMOTION OUTSIDE, AND SOMEONE CLEARLY TRYING TO OPEN MY DOOR.
GOT DRESSED, DOOR OPENED BEFORE I REACHED IT.
GUEST WAS THANKING STAFF/HOUSEKEEPER FOR HELPING HER OPEN.
GUEST SAW ME, APOLOGISED AND SAID SHE WAS ON THE WRONG FLOOR.
FEEDBACK TO RECEPTION, SAID WILL LOOK INTO IT BUT NO EXPLANATION OR PROPER APOLOGY FROM MANAGEMENT.

So... what would‚Äôve happened if we didn‚Äôt wake up, or if we weren‚Äôt in? Will you be responsible for the consequences? Can you?

It is absolutely ridiculous that you guys have such high security with entering the property (scans) yet NO VERIFICATION DONE WHEN OPENING ROOMS? You don‚Äôt check if guests are staying in the hotel at the entrance, so basically anyone can enter my room just by asking for help?
Appalled.

To be fair, room condition was great. I can see where all the good reviews come from but this incident should not be happening even in 3 star hotels."
1189,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,July 2018,"Could not fault this hotel!!
Fabulous stay from start to finish. From arriving into our beautifully decorated room with chocolates awaiting us, to the beautiful view and pool bar - everything was perfect!

Definitely the best breakfast we have ever had at a hotel - the granola, fruit, pastries, waffles, pancakes, smoothies were all to die for!! And the best coffees I‚Äôve ever tasted- all freshly made! Amazing value for money having breakfast added on!

The location is also perfect for exploring Seminyak- right in the centre, only a walk to the fabulous restaurants and bars!

Bedrooms have everything you need and the bed is massive, we had the best nights sleep.

Also the staff are all so amazing and friendly and polite- they would do anything for you!

I cannot wait to return already!! If I could give 10 stars I would!! Thanks for an amazing stay!"
1190,Absolutely perfect stay!,50,June 2018,"The staff at the hotel bent over backwards to make sure that our stay was fantastic. After a delay in getting our luggage from the flight, we arrived at the hotel at 11.30 at night with 3 exhausted children.
We were welcomed by the beautiful staff upon check in with refreshing welcome drinks and taken straight to our rooms.

Outstanding breakfasts (especially the salmon bagels!!), clean rooms, comfortable beds, the kids enjoyed participating in some of the activities that kids‚Äô club had to offer. We had a lot of relaxing time by the pool and as the kids were happy to swim most of the days, we generally ate lunch by the pool too. Prices were very reasonable and the food was lovely. I‚Äôd recommend the salads (after last year being obsessed with the burgers!!) Lychee martinis were also excellent!

My son has an ear infection and we had to visit the doctor in Seminyak for a script. After having the antibiotics made up for us at the pharmacy, there were no dosage directions on the box (& the writing on the generic label was in Indonesian). I asked one of the bar staff if he could read a dosage per kg or age and he offered to take it to the in house doctor downstairs for him to confirm the correct dosage. Again, we were grateful for Staff doing that extra bit for us. All of these small things make a stay so much more memorable.

We stayed at the Marriott for 4 nights before moving on to a villa in Seminyak for another 8 nights (our 9 year old daughter keeps asking to move back to the Marriott!!).

Because we have a late flight home next week and have to check out of our villa by 11am I asked the Marriott if we could spend the day back with them. They have once again been amazing and said we can spend the day by the pool and then use the shower facilities in the gym before we leave for the airport.

We are already organising to stay again with 2 other families next year at the Marriott as we can‚Äôt fault the facilities or service. Thanks again, we can‚Äôt wait to return next year!"
1191,We all loved this hotel!,50,July 2018,"Great place to stay in Seminyak. Location was in the midst of lots of bars, restaurants, spas and shopping! Just a few steps away from anything you needed. Our room was a good size - very well laid out and had a nice verandah. Airconditioning was cold when we needed it to be. Bathroom was comfortable and adequate. Gym was also very good - very clean and roomy. The breakfast buffet was superb!! Service was above and beyond what we expected! I loved this hotel. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Things they could improve on:
1. more hooks to hang stuff in the bathroom,
2. hot water kettle in the room (we could call for hot water when we needed it - but I prefer very hot water for my tea before I go to bed, and the hot water we‚Äôd order took a while to arrive and usually wasn‚Äôt piping hot anymore by the time it got to our room)
3. better sound proofing especially for the sliding door to the verandah"
1192,"Amazing stay, would recommend to anyone",50,June 2018,"This hotel had everything we could have asked for. Great location, fantastic room and awesome breakfast buffet (which I like to think I‚Äôm a connoisseur of).

Location: right on a main strip of shops, it was easy to pop out and grab a bite to eat at many of the local restaurants. Us being vegetarians, we had no problem finding plenty of options to eat. The hotel is also a five minute walk from the beach which was always lively and had lots of places to eat and drink.

Hotel room: the room was awesome. Big king bed, modern interior, fantastic bathroom. The room had everything as expected, well maintained and the balcony was nice with a comfy seat to hang out on. The bathroom was great with a bonus huge shower, felt very luxurious. Air conditioning was fantastic too, well needed!

Hotel food: Breakfast buffet was so much better than I expected. They had so many different food stations from fresh pastries, to Indonesian food, eggs made anyway, fresh juices, waffles and pancakes, the list goes on. To sum up, I was impressed. On the other hand while the hotel cafe had nice food and drinks, if you wanted food during the day it was pretty expensive compared to the places just a few minutes walk down the street - so we avoided ordering any food from the hotel. But this wasn‚Äôt surprising or a deal breaker for us."
1193,Wonderful staff,40,June 2018,"Courtyard Marriott are to be congratulated on their staff . Seems to be a happy place to work . Everyone from front desk to kitchen are happy , polite and attentive. The room was always very well cleaned . My only complaint was that some days it was well into the afternoon when our room was serviced . I expect with a large hotel all rooms can‚Äôt be done early however I don‚Äôt like returning to an untidy room on holidays . Other than that an excellent hotel to stay in ."
1194,Nice rooms and friendly staff,40,July 2018,"I stayed at the Courtyard in Seminyak for 2 nights in July 2018.

When I first arrived at the hotel, I was given a small flower petal by a hotel staff. This already somewhat lifted my spirits and heighten my expectations for this hotel. Check-in was smooth. I arrived at 1pm and my room was not ready yet. The receptionist told me to relax by the pool until 2pm.

I booked the room with the pool terrace. This room is situated directly outside the pool. There is a terrace for guests to walk out of the room and straight into the pool. The rooms were of average size with modern furnishing. There was a good selection of cable channels. The bed was comfortable. I loved the yellow lighting in the room. The bathroom was nice, big, and clean.

Breakfast was decent. I liked the freshly squeezed juice at the juice counter. The hotel offers Indonesia, Chinese, Japanese, and continental cuisine for breakfast. I also ordered room service for dinner for 1 night. The food was average.

The only two complains I have about the hotel are that I rudely awaken by mosquito bites during the first night. The second night was fine. I am not sure if this is an isolated incident or it is something that plagues this hotel (or maybe its because I chose the pool terrace room). I hope that the hotel takes pre-emptive action to ensure that mosquito breeding does not occur in their hotel. The second minor issue is that the lounge chairs by the pool are almost always full. It is hard finding a good seat if you want to lounge by the pool. Although I think this is a common sight for most hotels in the Seminyak area. If you prefer a quieter area, try Ubud.

Overall, it was a good stay. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the mosquitos and the crowded pool."
1195,excellent accommodation,50,June 2018,"We had everything we wanted - great service, large comfortable room, balcony. Very close to the beach. Breakfast was very good - lots of choices. I would happily recommend this accommodation for those visiting Seminyak. The staff were all very helpful and friendly - thank you."
1196,Would not go back,20,April 2018,"When we arrived our room wasn‚Äôt ready, we paid for a room with a view and that goes out to the pool, we were in the corner next to the kids club it was awful no view, having to listen to kids all the time,
The rooms are clean and the food was good but we didn‚Äôt like the hotel layout,"
1197,Excellent in all ways,50,June 2018,"This hotel is definitely one I'd return to. It is relatively new and very clean. All of the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly. The location is great- go out of the hotel and 5 mins walk to your right is the beach. Turn left out of the hotel and there are great restaurants and shopping and places for massages; and it's a short walk to JL Raya Seminyak which is a buzzing street, safe to walk at night. It is about a 20 min walk to Eat Street but the hotel provides a buggy and a friendly driver (Ari) to take you there whenever you want. The breakfast is great; various cuisines; fresh juices made to order; and great coffee brought to your table by friendly staff ( especially Febri). Bagus at reception was very helpful in making sure I was happy with my room. As a solo female traveller I felt very safe. I'd definitely stay here again."
1198,Excellent,50,June 2018,"Our 4th stay at The Courtyard Marriott Seminyak
We‚Äôre Always welcomed back as family members.
Great start to each day by being genuinely welcomed at breakfast by the smiling faces of Muliana& his team.. Ayu,Indah,Arja to name a few.
Scrumptious Breakfast with an array of plentiful food.
Want to know the places to go in Bali....ask Anna... very informative.
Lazy days by the pool were made more enjoyable by Hendra and his vibrant,friendly attentive team.
Loved the complimentary benefits of the beach club...short walk or hotel provided buggy.
Great clean rooms with pool view&amenities.
A big thanks to John&Grant on leading a professional team consistently delivering a positive Courtyard holiday experience for us from checkin to checkout.
Looking forward to seeing you all very soon

1199,Excellent.,50,June 2018,"Our 3rd stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak - ticks all the boxes for what we need. Exceptional staff- so warm and friendly. Especially Gita in Seminyak Kitchen - Indah was so lovely too.
The kids club was wonderful for Mr 3 - who had a ball. Dewy, Debby & Komang we‚Äôre so lovely at the kids club.
Can‚Äôt fault the hotel - awesome :)"
1200,We loved it so much we came back,50,June 2018,"It‚Äôs our second time. We love all the sneaky inclusions like hotel water aerobics., yoga, music and dance. Breakfast is fabulous. Staff super friendly. Poolside rooms are better. Heaps of free stuff for the kids. Gym is really good. Late check out. Everything is clean."
1201,The best one,50,May 2018,"We chooses this hotel already for the second time. The price corresponds to the quality. Madly tasty breakfasts, a wide choice of various options of a breakfast, there are smuz, lots of juices, fruits and the most important - tasty desserts. The hotel is near the sea (about 5 minuts by foot). To Bali unfortunately hotels have no personal beaches. But this hotel has an allocated zone on the beach with the sunbeds and umbrellas. Therefore, there existes a shuttle from the hotel to the beach. Excellent, clean and light rooms, the best one is with a balcony with pool view and opposite to bar. In the evenings there is live music, it is possible to sit at the balcony and to relax.There is a very nice contingent in the hotel. But the hugest merit of the hotel is personnel. They face and heart of this place. All are really very kind, polite and obliging. Always will make as fast as possible and as good as they can. And separately the greatest gratitude we express to Pak Ramu. Thanks to him we decided to live in the Marriott again and for the second time. In the second arrival he in the mildest terms has organized to us change of the room as when we came around there were no free rooms that we asked initially when booking the hotel. Ramu had invited us to the cocktail party on a rooftop of the hotel. He had generally done everything possible to make our stay in the Marriott even better than it could be. Many thanks to Pak Ramu and to the team of the hotel in general. We definitely will comeback once again!"
1202,Birthday Surprise,50,June 2018,Thanks Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak for surprising me on my birthday. It was such a lovely gesture and was greatly appreciated. My whole stay has been amazing. Great resort which has the most welcoming and friendly staff.
1203,AMAZING HOTEL! EVEN BETTER POOL BAR! üòç,50,June 2018,"Thankyou to the Courtyard Marriott for a amazing stay! I will definitely be back and recommend to all of my family & friends! A massive shoutout to the pool bar staff Peni, Hendra, Mob, Dewok & Dede for the best drinks and laughs. They definitely made our stay more memorable and will be missed! I‚Äôll be sure to return in future to have another drink with these amazing people! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1204,AMAZING PLACE TO STAY,50,June 2018,"Stayed at Courtyard by Marriott for 9 days, couldn‚Äôt have found a better place to spend my time in Bali. The people at the Marriott were amazing, genuine and very helpful.

Make sure you head down to the pool bar and visit Peni, Hendra, Mob, Dewok, and Dede for laughs and awesome drinks, they made our stay that much more special and they will be missed.

Will definitely be back!"
1205,Best service in bali,50,June 2018,"I stayed here for my honeymoon. I had a problem but they gave a wonderful service during my stay.
Specially, syla(?) who helped me at the first time,Tana(?) who really gave us wonderful trip and plan, tya(?) who care us very much and kuden(?) who took us to ubud. I am sorry for my bad memory.
Anyway, i really appreciate all of them, i can not remember their service and smile all the time!

As i work at service industry, i learned a lot from them.
Thank you very much!

1206,AMAZING RESORT!,50,June 2018,"Our time at the Marriott was absolutely unforgettable. The bonds we made with not only the incredible staff but also other guests staying here at the Marriott was truely unforgettable!

Till now I can‚Äôt thank this resort enough for their service. The service at the Marriott is like no other, they are always there when needed and are always up before you.
The most amazing memories were made at the incredible pool bar! Penny and Hendrea... you guys are amazing, you made our stay worthwhile. Also to the team at the Marriott, everyone is so helpful, kind and loving.

Hotel facilities as well as our room were very well maintained.
Buffet breakfast had beautiful food with a big variety suited for each individual.

Oh! And we can‚Äôt forget ‚Äúwhat the truck‚Äù!
These tarcos are to die for, without doubt that was my lunch on a daily basis. Clean, fresh and well portioned tarcos!! Absolutely amazing.

Overall, our stay at the courtyard Marriott was perfect! We wouldn‚Äôt have changed a thing. We can‚Äôt wait to be back here staying at the Marriott again next year!!"
1207,Holiday stay,40,June 2018,Just spent 7 nights at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali. Rooms are nice and have everything you need.Staff are amazing can't do enough to make sure you are comfy and have everything you need. The Seminyak Kitchen for the Buffett breakfast has for food a lot of different cultures. Not too far from beach.
1208,Amazing stay,50,June 2018,"We had an amazing stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for 3 nights.

Our biggest impression was how friendly, professional and welcoming all the staff here were. Everyone welcomed us with a big smile, and some even went out of their way to give us the best experience throughout our stay. My partner was not feeling well due to his cold, and the staff was very helpful in calling the doctor for us and providing every request that we asked for. The staff always greeted us by our names, which was very impressive and did make us feel like home.

Besides, our room & hotel facilities were very well maintained. Breakfast buffet was great with wide food selection and a customized juice bar made with fresh local fruits. The Seminyak Kitchen also provides great dinner and live music at night.

Overall, we were extremely happy and satisfied with our stay here. Thank you John and the team (Wyd, Patrick, and all the staff) for providing us such an amazing experience and making our Seminyak stay unforgettable.

Vivian & Erick Tanubrata"
1209,Must Do!,40,June 2018,"Spent three nights with my parents and they said it was the best hotel experience they have ever had. Staff were incredibly patient, thoughtful, attentive - i had a very bad cough and staff at the Seminyak Kitchen were particularly wonderful. Adel sent me to my room with a jug of honey which helped immensely. The breakfast buffet there will not disappoint!!
Security checks were very thorough which made us all feel so safe.
Slight hiccup with the room which was resolved promptly.
Very close to the beach and other shopping areas but prepare to sit in traffic if you are going further our to Ubud or Jimbaran.
Wonderful hotel, would go back in a heartbeat!"
1210,Amazing!,50,June 2018,"We travelled with our two young daughters (1 1/2 & 3 1/2) we stayed at the courtyard for 7 days. This was our honey moon as we got married in Bali on the 1st of june.

The breakfast was the BEST buffet we have ever had!

The hotel and the amenities were stunning and so well kept.

The location was a 2 minute walk to the beach and in a very easy location to get any where in a cab.

The best part about our stay was by far the staff, 1 in particular is Ana!
She went out of her way to make our entire stay more enjoyable, things that she may not have had to do (like get her friend to buy special mozzie cream for our daughter)

I couldnt rave about her enough, and all the staff! Grant was also amazing and amended the only hiccup we had very promptly!

Thank you to the Courtyard marriot Seminyak!

We will be back!"
1211,Ok stay,30,June 2018,"After moving from room 342 after no sleep due to light from bathroom windows Dian who is lovely, excellent English moved us to 524 bigger room over pool little noise from bar but ok. Had drinks and treats for us thank you!

Thank you house keeping for making towel animals for our daughter every morning made her day.

Pool service is terrible wait over 30 minutes for a beer and no menus you have to ask each time. Don‚Äôt pay upfront the food and beverage credit as there is no service waste of money.

For sun lovers like myself this is not the hotel for you pool gets sun a few hours of the day and is cold shade for the afternoon. Pool not so child friendly after leaving the Padma our daughter didn‚Äôt like the pool. More of a adults holiday.

We nearly missed our flight home after baggage boy had taken over 30 minutes to deliver our luggage to the lobby our driver then left us stranded having to arrange new transport last minute which the hotel ‚Äúdid not pay for very very disappointing‚Äù Baggage boy also left my daughters favourite bumble bee üêù pillow toy in the room. Could you please kindly arrange postage to Australia reservation in Ben Stephens please email ben@basepropertygroup.com.au for address

thank you Mr Ariana for driving us so quick from hotel life saver.

Kids club staff lovely - they charge you after 2 hours $6 per hour which is standed rate in bali

Tacos and cocktails from what the truck awesome!!

Have been coming to bali for 15 years. Overall average stay"
1212,Corporate Values done right,50,June 2018,"We have been to Bali and stayed in different hotels in several areas more than 10 times. Bali is always warm and welcoming, but this hotel, though not a high end establishment, has all the makings of one. I've never experienced sincerity more consistent from the start to the end and never thot it existed till this trip. Everyone from the bellhop to the cleaner to the electrician to the front office has a mission to make everyone's stay a comfortable one. Thank you everyone! Bakalis family"
1213,John Kristie,50,June 2018,"Very well run establishment, modern rooms, comfy lge suites, happiest staff, very attentive, and what a breakfast Choice... Pools are LGE and maintained regularly, swimup pool bar is like an Oasis. Gardens are well kept and colorful... Enjoyed our 5 day stay."
1214,Great place to stay in Seminyak,40,May 2018,"Spent 5 night here. The breakfast food was fantastic. All the staff couldn't help you enough, everyone had a smile on their faces. Totally enjoyed it. Very closed to all the great shops and only 5 mins lazy walk to the beach. Would recommend it to anyone."
1215,A friendly and pleasant stay in the busy area of Seminyak,50,June 2018,"We usually avoid staying in Seminyak area due to its crowd but staying in Courtyard by Marriott Bali gave us a pleasant experience. The location was great and the staff were always very friendly and professional. Special thanks to Kadek (Suyadna) from the gym, who taught us yoga and power stretching. Very patient, skilled and generous in sharing tips on health improvement. We enjoyed the private yoga class with him very much. Wish we could stay longer!!"
1216,Lovely room with pool view,40,June 2018,"We stayed here for a girls trip as the prices were competitive and we could each have our own room with pool view. We all loved our rooms. No mould nor damp, cotton sheets, great hairdryers, ample space in bedroom and bathroom. We did not include breakky but tried the restaurant there one morning. It was noisy, not on pool level and we left disappointed and headed for a local breakky spot nearby instead. However, I would recommend if you get a pool view room and exclude breakky. Pools were nice and service was good. There‚Äôs a shuttle to take you half way to Seminyak square or catch a taxi from there for around 40 000 rupees to the centre of Seminyak or the restaurants..."
1217,Great location and staff,50,May 2018,"My 1st time in Bali and was a great experience. Special thanks to a few staff members: Gant and Elizabeth (who were super friendly + customer oriented, always wearing their smiley faces), Arja (who looked after us so well when we were in the restaurant) and Ari at the Bell Desk (the car was late to pick us up to the sunrise trip and he helped us to call the tour agent and follow up through)! Wonderful team!
I hope I will come back soon!"
1218,Very good location and high standards,50,June 2018,"We were welcomed with complimentary drinks and cold face washers, bags were delivered to our rooms and our holiday had begun. Very high standard of cleanliness and professionalism by all staff who were all willing to have a chat and make you feel comfortable. We had the buffet breakfast included in our stay and my gosh what a fantastic assortment of food. Almost anything you could want for a breakfast meal. Pools were fantastic although the supplied pool towels had a feint damp /mouldy smell too most of them but this is a very minor problem. Fantastic location to the beach and to the shopping street as well as heaps of local food places. Overall the perfect hotel experience for us in Seminyak"
1219,Great location,40,June 2018,"Great hotel, one of the better places we have stayed at on our many trips to seminyak
Friendly staff, super secure (metal detector at entrance), good breakfast, pool food and drinks nice, great shower. Great location between beach and eats street
Only Negatives
Price of drinks differ from room to pool bar to food truck at entrance.
Pillows not so good.
No smoking signs yet people smoking everywhere and staff giving out ashtrays right next no smoking sign..

Overall will stay at again"
1220,Couple holiday without kids,50,June 2018,"Stayed seven nights at the Courtyard this June with my wife. My wife had visited before with a friend, but first time for me. Excellent hotel. The staff were so helpful in every way, from check in, reception, pool staff, housekeeping and especially the morning crew at Buffet Breakfast. They were more than happy to accommodate our requests at breakfast. Me with my fresh porridge and my wife with her Vegan meal requests. The chefs were more than happy to please. I also have to say, that the Seafood Market buffet night, was excellent. So many choices and very fresh. Very reasonable in price as well. We also had quite a few conversations with the General Manager, John Woolley, who was always approachable and eager to hear experiences. My wife and I also made use of the hotel gym. Not too bad for a hotel gym. For all the trainers out there, they have a smith machine and cable station. Another plus about the hotel, is the location. On a great street that has several restaurants and massage places. One massage place that my wife visited daily, was Mantra Spa. Just up the road from the hotel. Very professional, clean and great massages. Will most certainly visit again. Thank you for an excellent stay."
1221,PERFECT VACATION,50,May 2018,"My husband and I stayed at this wonderful property in May and our this was our first stop in Bali. From check in to check out, everything was amazing! We very much enjoyed each and every moment of our stay. i want to mention Front desk agent Ulis and bellhop Nova for being sooo fantasic at check in @ 1 am. They were so pleasant and welcoming, they made me forget how tired I was from taking 5 flights just to get to Bali. The welcome drinks (Bintang.. my new fave beer) was a refreshing gesture on check in as well. Thanks to Priscilla also for the lovely anniversary amenity!

I mostly enjoyed Seminyak Kitchen at breakfast times and being seated at my regular seat on the balcony. So many wonderful dishes to choose from, however,I mainly ate the traditional Indonesian breakfast.... (Nasi Goreng specifically) lol i think had gotten addicted. Rena at the juice station was always a breath of fresh air when my husband came for his daily morning cup of fresh juice, she was always anticipating his crazy requested concoctions.

We even saw the General Manager on Saturday and Sunday bussing tables and making sure everyone was enjoying their breakfast. Kudos to you Sir for being a great example to your staff!

Located on nice busy street, just a buggy ride away from the beach and eat street, restaurants, and spas in walking proximity,"
1222,Still an overall winner,50,June 2018,"Stayed here again after many return trips and can easily say it's still my favourite hotel on the island, especially when travelling with kids. Pool is fabulous for kids and adults with a great vibe poolside. The gym is excellent, the breakfast perfect and the location excellent wirh Spa Bali around the courner, shopping at your doorstep and a free buggy to the beach and ""eat street"". Plus all the staff are super friendly and excellent with their customer service.
A special thanks to Surya at pool for the daily activities... kids and adults loved them.
I can't wait to return."
1223,Nice place to stay in Seminyak,40,May 2018,"Courtyard Marriott is a lovely modern hotel with all the luxuries you need to enjoy your stay. We stayed in the basic room which was nice and big enough for the two of us with a modern bathroom. Our room faced the street and it was quite noisy late into the night with cars and bikes so may be a problem if you have children or are a light sleeper! We tried breakfast one day, it was a normal buffet breakfast with lots to choose from but after it cost $60AUD for two people to eat we decided against it for the rest of our trip. Basic gym, staff were nice and the golf buggy that drops you to certain locations in Seminyak is a great addition. We got a great deal on this hotel so cannot complain but i would probably try elsewhere next time."
1224,Great place to stay,50,June 2018,"Awesome breakfasts, lovely helpful staff, rooms are very nice (pool view balcony has a nice outlook), good location for beach and shopping, if we ever go back to Bali would stay here again for sure :)"
1225,The best breakfast ever,50,June 2018,"The most unforgettable moment in this hotel was the breakfast, very complete meals including ice cream which the kids love the most. My favorite was the salmon cream cheese bagel. So far none can beat the salmon cream cheese bagel in here.
The room were not too big but clean and modern. We were in deluxe twin room while the twin bed were quite spacious for 2 people.
But since we were in city view, it was quite noisy.
The hotel located in the heart of seminyak, you can find many nice stores and restaurants around there. Very recommended hotel for family."
1226,Great customer service!,40,June 2018,"We went for a holiday to Bali and stayed the initial leg of our trip at this place.
The staff was warm and courteous and need to give them brownie points for great service.
The only thing I would want to add was they should add the kettle as a must in their room as I am sure many people like me would like to have availability of hot/ warm drinking water or making tea in their rooms.
Otherwise the hotel was nice with a good pool. The best part was the pool bar which whipped out delicious cocktails/ mocktails while enjoying a swim.
The rooms were clean; though slightly smaller but with all basic amenities.
The hotel is very particular about the security and though some might find the everyday scanning troublesome but I think it was actually really great. We attended the Asian food festival but I wasn't much impressed by the options but the breakfast was a much nicer and enjoyable experience with lots of options for non vegetarians and vegetarians both.
The location of the Hotel is excellent with the beach and market very close by.
We also enjoyed food from the food truck they have in front which was very very good and affordable. It was a great experience to stay here and would def. recommend it to others."
1227,Great Hotel,50,May 2018,"Third stay in just over a year....... must be doing the right thing.

Great hotel, great team . Nothing is too much trouble. Centrally located with a buggy service to Eat street and the beach. Clean, tidy and well equipped rooms. We love the rooms over looking the pool bar on the higher floors. Hardi and his concierge team are very helpful , Hardi always goes over and above to assist , great welcome back by him also remembering my name . Penni and all the staff at the pool bar are great as well. Breakfast is great and so is the team working there. Will be back for sure in the next few months. Did not use the spa service so cannot comment on its quality though it seems to be way on the higher price side . Spa Bali around the corner is great."
1228,Best. Hotel. Ever.,50,May 2018,This was the second time we have stayed here and couldn‚Äôt recommend it more highly. The service is impeccable. Hotel rooms are clean and modern. The staff are so so helpful. This visit was with our 1 year old daughter and also another couple and their 9 month old son. Every member of the hotel staff knew the babies names and were so accommodating. We used the kids club that is free if you stay with the kids in there and only $6.50 an hour to leave them (that‚Äôs the small baby rate. Older kids are even cheaper!). Having somewhere to let the babies roam around was invaluable. And I trusted the girls completely when we left them to be looked after. I was nervous about going on a relaxing holiday with a one year old but staying here was the right decision.
1229,Great location and pool area,50,March 2018,"This is a great hotel in the heart of Seminyak. A few minute walk to the beach and shopping, and a 5-10 minute walk or 1 minute scooter ride to eat street restaurants. Staff were very friendly but still professional and the hotel takes security seriously and scans all bags and cars on the way in so you feel safe. Rooms were clean and nice and quite affordable in my opinion. It was my husband's birthday and they made it special by singing at breakfast with cake. The pool area is beautiful and many of the rooms get a nice view of it. They have a great happy hour at the pool. All the staff were lovely but the one staff member that was a stand out was Ebiet. He makes the yummiest cocktails and is very friendly and speaks fluent English which made communication easy. Can't give this hotel enough credit. Have already recommended to many friends and have some coming to stay here in a couple of months."
1230,Outstanding Service,50,June 2018,The restaurant service at breakfast each day was a very high standard with a large variety of quality food for all tastes. The restaurant manager and front desk manager were both extremely accommodating in any request and provided a very warm and friendly service. Both went that extra bit further to ensure a comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend this for any guests considering staying in Seminyak!
1231,Amazing Hotel With Amazing Hospitality,50,April 2018,"I stayed here on my final night during Bali trip last March.
Very welcoming attitude at reception, though I was expecting a little fancier welcome drink rather than just a glass of cold water.

The room was very comfortable, everything in the room works properly, and facilities were more than satisfying.

All the staff I met showed high enthusiasm about their job and they talk to their guest with genuine smile and care. You could tell if someone is just being professional or they are genuine, but the staff in Courtyard Seminyak seems really care and enjoy their interaction with their guests! Well done!

The guy in Pool Bar was very hospitable, and gave very good recommendation on cocktail.

I visited The Spa also but couldn't get the time slot as they were fully booked already. Though, the spa girl was kind enough to give a short tour around the spa.

A very recommended hotel and amazing breakfast buffet selection too!"
1232,Good location & service,40,June 2018,"Location

Plenty of restaurants and shops just outide the hotel. The hotel buggy takes you to the beach and within the vicinity. Bintang Supermarket is a big supermarket about 20 minutes walk from the hotel. You can enjoy your walk past many boutique shops, cafes, restaurants (to suit both asian and western palates) and pharmacies along the way. 

Service

Hotel staff are very friendly. Check in was a breeze. There is a kids club (more suited for children of ages 2-6) with activities to occupy them for a couple of hours, and child-minding services. Dewi at the Kids Club really gave us peace of mind and one could tell she really took care of the kids well.

Food

Breakfast had just enough variety and quality was pretty decent (I personally got a bit tired of the menu after 2 days). The juice counter was very popular, and the indian food counter (though very modest in size) was a delightful surprise in satisfying the tastebud.

Room and Pool

The size of the deluxe pool view room could fit an extra bed if needed. The design was minimalist and the layout maximized space. The only room for improvement was a slight odour (probably came from sheets or carpet that were not cleaned or dried properly). 

There was 3 parts to the pool, a quiet pool for adults, a larger pool for swimming, and a kids' pool. It is little wonder that most of the deck chairs were occupied during the day."
1233,Great 10 Day Stay,50,June 2018,"I stayed here for the for the first time and had an excellent 10 day stay.

The staff are very friendly and attentive. The buffet breakfast is amazing with lots of Western and local selections. The rooms are spacious and in excellent condition as is the rest of the property.

The hotel management are visible and interact with guests. I had the GM and the Front Office Manager asking me if there was anything that they could have done better and I could not suggest anything as I left very satisfied.

I highly recommend this hotel."
1234,Fantastic,50,June 2018,"I've just spent five days at the Courtyard by Marriott and had the nicest of stays.
We had a terrace room which opened directly onto the pool.
The rooms are spacious and very clean.
The facilities are definitely not lacking with plenty of pool area including a swim up bar, a great sitting area alongside the pool bar where you can enjoy entertainment most evenings, a gym, a beautiful day spa and treatment studio along with many other offerings.
This was my second stay at Courtyard by Marriott and will be my first choice for my next visit."
1235,Excellent location in Seminyak,40,May 2018,"We enjoyed our 3 nights stay here. Location in Seminyak is excellent just walking distance to the beach and shops. We appreciated the warm hospitality and friendly greetings of all the staff including the security officers. The rooms are well appointed in size and cleanliness is very good. We were very impressed with the young lady who remembered our preferred frappe each morning at breakfast. The front office manager, Wahyu (not sure of spelling) was very helpful. We will definitely recommend this hotel in Seminyak."
1236,Good Hotel,50,May 2018,"Stayed end of May with my daughters. Booked a 2 bedroom suite which was absolutely lovely, however, the location is in the far corner and your balcony view is of a wall which was disappointing as I had specifically phoned the hotel prior to booking to ask about the ‚Äúresort view‚Äù. It was explained by reservations that the 2 bedroom suites were located in the middle of the resort with a pool view. My daughter has a brace on her leg so location was important as we didn‚Äôt want to be walking too far. We were disappointed. The staff were lovely (Bugus, Tiku) did their best to sort out our situation and we were moved to 2 interconnecting pool view rooms after our first night with a much more convenient location and a much improved view. Rooms are nice, clean and aircon is good.

The hotel has a friendly and lively vibe. Food by the pool was good, breakfast very good. Service excellent. Spa was also very good and we used it 3 times on our 5 night stay. Be sure to book ahead though. Wisnu was very accommodating and the staff came in early one morning to fit us in for a massage. This was unexpected and so very nice - thank you!

Pool is georgeous! The only down side is the amount of sun that hits the pool. There were no sunny spots to be had at all in the resort by 3.30pm in the afternoon because of the building design and this situation would improve if you stayed in the months closer to summer. I imagine the closer to the winter solstice the less sun given the northerly aspect of the resort. This was fine for us but a little more sun would be nice and I would look to stay further out from the winter solstice next time. Also I would love to see the floating beanbags back again. They have been removed for some reason.

I did not rate happy hour cocktails. They are very sugary and I wonder if there is actually any alcohol in them. We found this everywhere in Bali where they offer 2 for 1 cocktails. I would prefer to pay full price and get a decent cocktail which I will do I future.

The gym was good but too small - would love to see this made bigger :)

All in all a good stay and will stay again."
1237,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,June 2018,"I booked Marriott without any research, had no expectations whatsoever. We had booked 2 standard rooms.
Upon reaching hotel we were surprised by the hotel security they had scanners for all the guest entering the Marriott building which made us feel very safe.
Upon checkin we were greeted with welcome drinks. Staffs were friendly and check in was quick. We were upgraded to pool view room which was a big plus for us. Hotel‚Äôs usual checkin time was 3pm but upon our request we were allowed to check in at 1pm.
All the essential amenities were provided in the room. Room itself was spacious and modern with balcony.
Breakfast at Marriott was one of the highlight of our stay. I personally loved the scrambled egg and mushrooms and the detox from juice bar.

Hotel provides a free buggy ride to the double six beach where they have a private area with towels, water bottles and wifi.

The pool side bar was my favourite spot at Marriott. They serve drinks and pool side snacks. They also do happy hour during evening.

Overall, we really loved our stay at Marriott and would be choosing this hotel again for our next Bali trip.

Thank you for making our stay awesome!!"
1238,First class hotel,50,May 2018,"We had a 2 week stay in a deluxe pool view room, the room was a good size with a small balcony over looking the pool, bed was extremely comfortable with good air con.The main pool is huge and there is also a pool bar with occasional entertainment and some daily activities. No review of this hotel would be complete without talking about the breakfast buffet which has to be seen to be believed nowhere have we ever seen such a high standard of both western and asian food.The staff are all very pleasant with our thanks to Maria, Dwi and Yoga and a special thanks to Anna for her time and local knowledge.
The hotel have a free shuttle to their private beach and to Seminyak Square area , the location of the hotel is very close to other restaurants ,bars, shops and supermarkets and the restaurant in the hotel ( Seminyak Kitchen have wonderful food ).
The Spa in the hotel is of the same high standard as all other area's with very professional staff and a peaceful atmosphere."
1239,Amazing hotel,50,June 2018,My partner and I stayed here for 6 nights of our Bali trip. The staff where so friendly and accommodating for every need the rooms where nice and spacious and they gave us a free upgrade to a poolside view which was lovely. The pool was nice and big and had heaps of sun beds to share. Breakfast was fantastic.
1240,Good holiday stay,40,May 2018,"Location is away from seminyak square (main shopping cafe area). It's quieter, and you can find plenty of spa, souvenir and similar shops from the seminyak square area. Buggy is available to the road leading to seminyak Square. You can also use the buggy to the beach - the hotel has a small area for hotel guest. We were there off peak so plenty of space for daybed. Beach towel and water available. Sea is perfect for surfing a little rough for young kids. Good breakfast.Especially the egg Benedicts perfectly done. Could do better with the Indonesian food offering. Service is really good with attentive staff. Another perk from the hotel is the list of popular restaurants put together like the potato head, motel mexicola, da maria, la flavela bali. The concierge makes reservations for you and you get free cocktails with every dinner reservation. The only thing that could make the stay even better is if it was located on the beach front. Otherwise this is a hotel is a good one. Perfect for family with plenty of kids activity. And for shopping and massages."
1241,Best Value in Seminyak,50,June 2018,"Just had 5 nights here. All hotels in Seminyak are expensive - you are in the heart of all the nightlife and best restaurants and bars so nowhere that's quality accommodation in Seminyak is cheap - you pay for location. Overall I've stayed at lots of hotels in Seminyak and the Courtyard is the best value for money in the area.

Its quite new, you get a lovely modern room, an exceptionally comfortable King Coil bed, great shower room and it's all rather nice. The staff are lovely. Exceptionally helpful. Everyone smiles and is so friendly. A big thanks to Grant Young the exceptionally friendly Aussie ops manager who went out of his way to talk to guests and again showed that service is everything at this hotel.

There's a good happy hour at the hotel bar, cheap beer and cocktails.
The breakfast is really first class - everything you could possibly want or need, Good coffee too - better than at most hotels - with a barrister making it fresh for everyone.

We has a lovely time, Its not cheap but nothing in Seminyak is! But we thought overall that we got very good value for money and would definitely stay here again,"
1242,Fantastic Resort! Perfect Stay!,50,May 2018,"The moment my boyfriend and I stepped foot onto the property, we were greeted with big smiles and warm welcomes, even though it 10:30pm at night . The security and safety precautions made us feel very safe. Upon checking in, we were given a cold beverage of our own choice and some cold wet towels to freshen up and wipe our hands/face. We were also given a few complimentary vouchers for a two course dinner, a two course lunch, a 60 minute couples massage and a voucher to redeem a free bucket of beer every day. We were extremely impressed and very happy with our service. The staff at reception were so lovely and happy. The bed was honestly the comfiest hotel bed we have EVER slept on! OMG. Like a cloud! And the air conditioning in the room was not musky or smelly like some hotels you stay at, it had really fresh air and made it very comfortable to sleep. I also received a complimentary chocolate mud cake the following day with a hand written note as it was my birthday the previous week (I never mentioned to the hotel that it was my birthday, this honestly came from their own research when I booked the hotel) - the staff always made us feel welcome every time we walked out to breakfast, or even just coming back from a day out and they served us with a smile everywhere in the hotel. The pool is fantastic, the cocktails are awesome and the resorts day spa is incredible - definitely worth a massage there! You will not be disappointed! We will definitely be going back."
1243,Perfect Getaway,50,May 2018,"We stayed last week for 2 nights at Courtyard Seminyak. The Location is nice, close to beach and plenty locals shop and convenience store around. Located in the heart of Seminyak, so you can easily access everywhere.

Check in process was really smooth, thanks to Mr. Ade (If I'm not mistaken) who helped us. We stayed at one bedroom suite which is really spacious and super comfortable!

The room is well maintained and super clean. Nice and smells good as well. The moment we stepped to the room we forgot all of our plans and just thinking about spending our time at the resort. The staffs also really hospitable and helpful, special mention to the front office, concierge, and bell desk team!

Breakfast served broad variations of choices which is pretty nice. Asian food, Indonesian food, Western food. Plenty choices for juice, gluten free item and also dessert. Just love it!

Upon our departure, room attendant Ega left us a note and made us towel art in elephant shape which is really thoughtful. Thanks for that!

Overall, it was a really great stay and sure would not hesitate to comeback in any chance :)"
1244,Family trip to Bali,40,May 2018,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It is very centrally located in Seminyak, with a lot of shopping and restaurants nearby. The buffet breakfast is very good in terms of range and quality. Staff are courteous and helpful and make you feel welcome all the time. The swimming pool is very large and located in the central part of the hotel. Overall, a good option for tourists."
1245,Hidden treasure,50,November 2017,"I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did but it ticked so many boxes from location, to a funked up urban feel. The place was heaving with the uber cool and family minded travellers lounging on colourful bean bags. The rooms were spartan and really quite cutting edge with giant black and white canvas prints that bordered on the erotic. Rooms were bright and clean cut.

Sure you didn't have the ocean view but you got a lot more from being close to everything and having your own private haven in Seminyak.

I'm a fan!"
1246,Lovely Hotel With Wonderful Staff,50,May 2018,"After many trips to Bali over thirty years, this was our first time staying in Seminyak.
From when we arrived at the airport and were picked up by the driver from the hotel our holiday just got better.
Tony at reception checked us in and was very helpful and polite. We had our first meal that evening, which was dinner at the Seminyak Kitchen. Once again the staff were extremely friendly, polite and helpful. We enjoyed eating four out of five evenings in the Seminyak Kitchen. The Seafood Buffet on Saturday evening was delicious, with a great range of seafood to choose from. Then on the Sunday evening, which also happened to be our 51st Wedding Anniversary, we enjoyed a Roast Dinner and a lovely surprise of a cake with candle and Anniversary Wishes written on the plate. We would like to say special thanks to Rai and Maria, but also to all the amazing staff who work in the Seminyak Kitchen. Our breakfasts there in the morning were also something to look forward to. We have never seen such a large range of different foods and drinks to choose from.
We also had an hour long Bali Body massage in Zanti the Retreat, where again the staff were excellent.
Our room was very comfortable and always kept clean, so many thanks to the room attendants who were always friendly and polite..
Thank you to the staff who provided our welcome chocolates and beautiful swans etc. Also the beautiful arrangement of flowers for our anniversary. It was certainly an anniversary to remember!
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would like to return to enjoy again the service and what makes this hotel so special and that is the Staff. This is a credit to the Management. Well done to all of you and if we didn't mention you by name you will know that we enjoyed talking to you. A very big thank you."
1247,Luxury Escapes package - Good choice,40,May 2018,"Booked 7 night package with Luxury Escapes as attended wedding in Seminyak. Hotel is situated close to beach, bars and shopping. Good size room with rainwater shower, clean and very comfortable. Package included free cocktails for an hour each day, massage and a dinner. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Altered the inclusive dinner to meet coeliac requirements without any drama, waiter Donny had chef suggest what could be done. Golf buggy to beach and Eat Street was handy."
1248,Best value,50,May 2018,"Location is good. Front desk staff are efficient. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast place is a bit crowded, but the variety of food offered is good for the price paid. Security is good as well as everyone and every car needs to go through the security scan before entering the hotel. Had a pleasant stay."
1249,Good enough hotel in Seminyak,30,May 2018,"The hotel is located in the heart of Seminyak area and about a few hundred meters from the beach. Rooms are well equipped with very nice feather cushions. Sleeping well was definitely not a problem (accept if you get a room facing the road, so ask for pool view).
Bathroom in our first room did not have proper drainage hence flooding the bathroom floor.

Front office personnel were friendly and very helpful, housekeeping though could be better as we have to ask several times for our water cattle that was not available.

Breakfast was amazing, very wide variety and lots of fresh juices."
1250,Another brilliant stay,50,May 2018,"Thanks CY Marriott for another brilliant stay. Consistently the best service by a hotel and you can tell the staff truly care.

Breakfast as always was delicious and a special mention needs to go to Gita for her impeccable service.

We love the level of security at the hotel, creating a safer atmosphere. Check in and every request we had was met with a smile and quick action.

See you next year!"
1251,Beautiful stay .,50,May 2018,"All positives, beautiful stay, bed, pools, breakfast and staff all amazing. We would definitely recommend this resort and we will be back . The shuttle to Eat St or to the beach where both a bonus and the private area on the beach with complimentary chairs wonderful, even internet st the beach."
1252,Convenient and generous!,50,May 2018,"Located conveniently and centrally. A lot of bars, restaurants, money exchange, and travel agents were closed to the resort. Walk 5 minutes to the beach. The resort has private beach with free water, beach lounges and sun umbrellas provisions. Free shuttle buses run 4 routes. As a Marriott platinum member I got a one bedroom suite and free breakfast buffet. Room was five-star standards. Staffs were accommodating."
1253,Amazing stay thanks to Ramu and wonderful staff,50,May 2018,"We weren't expecting much when we stayed at the Courtyard, from previous experiences at mediocre suburban hotels in the USA, but this place was beautifully appointed. The breakfast buffet was grand, the pool was beautiful, cocktails were fairly priced and made us feel like we never wanted to leave.

What really made the resort stand out though was the incredible service we received. Ramu, the front office manager, greeted us on the first day and made sure to greet us by name every day we were there. Everywhere we went, the staff introduced themselves by name and asked for ours...then continued to remember it. We particularly wanted to watch the European Cup final, which wasn't showing anywhere. Ramu arranged to have a special cable brought to the room so we could watch the game which is just next level service. Arini, who was our server for dinner, again introduced herself, and remembered all our names over dinner...that personal level of service is hard to find in Bali and made us feel so at home.

Couldn't recommend this hotel more. Great service, location and amenities. Thanks Ramu for making this stay awesome."
1254,Great Resort,40,May 2018,The staff were genuinely happy and helpful. The treatments at the spa were tailored to suit personal needs and the staff were very professional. There was a wide variety of delicious dishes/foods available at the buffet breakfast. Security at the resort was very comprehensive.
1255,Bali trip 2018,40,May 2018,"Recently my wife and I had a trip to Bali staying in the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak.
We booked a poolside room on level 1 where we could walk out the back door and hop straight into the pool.
We booked a room with a king sized bed but when we checked in we only had a room with two twins. To compensate we were given a room on our last day for a late checkout which was very helpful.
The breakfasts were wonderful and both of us had numerous massages in the Spa area which was fabulous.
With so many good restaurants in Seminyak we rarely used the hotels lunch or dinner options in their restaurant.
While the pool and grounds were wonderful there was one thing that we really could not deal with.
When you go up the stairs to breakfast there is a smoking area at the top of the stairs and you have to walk through the smoke to go to the restaurant. The same applies leaving the restaurant.
Also the pool bar where food is served throughout the day you can‚Äôt stay there for long as it is all a smoking area and you sit in a haze of smoke. I‚Äôm an ex smoker myself but it was just impossible to enjoy your food with all the smokers around.
If the hotel wants to improve they really have to set up designated smoking areas well away from areas where food is consumed.
Apart from the smoking issue the staff were faultless, the resort was wonderful and it was well situated with only a short taxi ride to all the fabulous restaurants and shops."
1256,Fabulous and enjoyable stay!!,50,May 2018,"This is my 2nd time come to bali. And I feel very lucky for choose stayed in Courtyard by Marriot Seminyak,this hotel make me very comfortable.
I had wonderfull day here,in the morning I come to Seminyak Kitchen for having my breakfast. Everyday the coffee was very amazing and the food of buffet breakfast also.
Very unthinkable is the staff,they're very care with me like family for them,especially for Dwi and Vani everyday they ask me for my plan and give me suggestion for where I should go.
In lunch time I had Nasi Goreng Barak it was so excellent food.
Pool bar was very relaxing place I spend my time until 6hours here.

I will come back!!"
1257,"Exceptional Service Standards, Professional Staff, Quality Resort and Central Location",50,May 2018,"I am a repeat guest to the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort and can highly recommend the Resort. The staff and management are friendly, professional and willing to assist to make your stay very memorable. The rooms are spaciously designed with quality decor and the secure property is centrally located to the beach, shops, restaurants, cafes and bars.The restaurant provides delicious, quality food and the breakfast is amazing. The recreational facilities are great and the pool is large enough to do laps. Exceptional value for money. I would highly recommend staying at this Resort as you will be very impressed."
1258,Nice hotel in seminyak area,40,May 2018,Room is spacious and they have connecting rooms too for family with balcony overlooking the pool area...bfast selections are lots and recommended...pool is of good size...golf cart to take you to beach area..good service too and is highly recommended!!
1259,Best service,50,May 2018,"Made Abit (Ebiet) bar manager was service with a smile the whole time.
Thank you Made for making our day there so memorable.
We had a lovely day drinking cocktails by the pool and eating. So yum
Great location, venue and pool bar.

We will be back soon"
1260,Excellent Service and hospitality,50,February 2018,"We stayed 3 days in seminyak, The service offered by Courtyard is commendable. Good food, good location, nice rooms. Breakfast variety is also good. As we were on our honeymoon, they offered us Hotel credits during our stay which could be used for room service and other services in the hotel."
1261,Smart hotel spoiled by youth hostel vibe,30,May 2018,"The courtyard Marriott Seminyak is a smart hotel with well equipped rooms(comfortable bed and great rainfall shower head) and extensive buffet breakfast but it's atmosphere was unsettling; akin to a youth hostel with people smoking in the pool and scruffy bean bags on the lawns.
I appreciate the modern, casual vibe the hotel seems to encourage but found the atmosphere too much like a youth hostel for my liking."
1262,Beautiful place,50,May 2018,"Amazing and prefect area to be. Perfect location for shopping. Nice food selection. Good breakfast buffet (good job gus dek-our coffee man). The most important of all is the staffing. Amazing people i have met and so helpful and freindly.
Would recommend this hotel anyday."
1263,Amazing service,50,May 2018,"We stayed here with our 2 year old and loved it.The staff were all amazing.Not one staff member walked past without saying hello.

Breakfast buffet is the best we've ever had anywhere in the world!So many choices,we were lucky it was included in our deal.

A lovely thing we saw,was the general manager of the hotel,who not only took time to talk to guests at breakfast,but also helped clear plates,which I'd imagine would also be good for the staff to see.

Lots of other food options in the hotel including special themed evenings.

The kids club was fantastic too,our wonderful nanny was able to go in with our little one at no extra cost,the staff in there were amazing too.

Only downside was not much room around the pool...however,the hotel also has a private section of the beach it will take you to,for some serious sun tanning'!

Will definitely stay here again."
1264,Incredible!,50,May 2018,"Had such a great stay. Staff were lovely, especially at the pool bar. Hendra, Peni, Mob, Dewa, Arca and Hari, we absolutely loved you guys, thanks so much for such a fun time!!

Breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from. Relaxing atmosphere. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
1265,A Step Above,50,May 2018,"The pool is to die for, the breakfast unbeatable, fantastic pool service and the rooms are luxurious. We would not hesitate to return the location is perfect right in the heart of Seminyak near restaurants, the beach, sunset bars and shopping."
1266,Wonderful Stay,50,May 2018,"It was our second stay at the Courtyard and we had a wonderful time.

From security staff to initial check in the staff were great and welcoming.

We had a lovely room and spent 10 nights here and loved every minute.

Coming from the UK it‚Äôs a long way so to be welcomed so nicely was great.

Special mention to John Woolley, Sekartaji, Grant and many staff over the course of the 10 days whose names I mislaid - they all went above and beyond and a big thankyou to all of you. I have also left a review for the Seminyak kitchen thanking certain staff.

Food was excellent and we used the gym for a few days as well with the facilities being really good.

What I liked this time around was that if the sun beds are full, you have extra space on the artificial grass which was great.

Had a lovely time and everything exceeded expectations- thankyou Courtyard Marriott and maybe we will be back for a hat trick ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòä"
1267,You will regret if you don't stay at this hotel when you are in bali!,50,May 2018,I simply love this place. the staff are the most friendliest bunch of people I have met.The food served here are amazing.Perfect gateway for 2 nights!Please try their spa package.so worth it!!!You will feel so refresh coming out of the spa.You will not regret staying here for sure !
1268,Consistently Exceeds Expectations,50,May 2018,"Was overwhelmed by the Balinese hospitality, every staff right down to those working in the kitchen was warm and responsive. Manager was extremely kind on more than one occasion. Well down team!

Location is good, food was great, room was fantastic. Recommended!"
1269,Outstanding Team,50,May 2018,"The Team behind the Courtyard Bali Semanyak Resort go above and beyond to make every day of your stay special. The property is one thing, but it's the people, their professionalism, their willingness to go above and beyond and their nothing is too hard attitude that makes this a wonderful place to spend your holidays. John, Grant and Patrick, to mention just a couple of the team, all made us feel welcome. Thank you and we will definately be back."
1270,Courtyard breakfast buffet,50,May 2018,The staff at this hotel is amazing. I had the breakfast buffet and there are so many food from around the world here. The chef Patrick made us a special creme br√ªl√©e that was not on the menu. He made us feel so special.
1271,Best place for a honeymoon,50,May 2018,"We stayed for 1 night and it was great.
They upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite for our honeymoon! It took 2 hours for the room to be ready, and for the wait they gave us free drinks. They were first class and made sure to keep us happy!

The gym was very nice and the breakfast was out of this world!"
1272,Hit the Jackpot!,50,May 2018,"First time staying in Seminyak, our plans were to focus on the four 'S's!
Sleep - ocean view room with very comfortable king size bed
Shopping - great location to the boutique shops
Swim - refreshing dip with a pool bar
Service - 10/10 ...this was when we new we hit the jackpot! After experiencing issues with airport transfer, this was quickly rectified by desk staff & we were reimbursed for our taxi fare. The staff each morning at Seminyak kitchen welcome with friendly smiles & buffet style breakfast caters for all cuisines. Part of our package included dinner, we were very impressed with the chef & his high standard of food.
Lovely to meet Elizabeth the Finance Diector, we enjoyed your company."
1273,Great atmosphere .. excellent staff and service,50,May 2018,"Great stay, good atmosphere, excellent friendly staff and service. Rudi (pool staff) excellent customer service and advice on where to eat !! He has bubbly personality, and looked after us. Elizabeth, (director of finance) provided excellent customer service too along with Ayu!! Recommend staying at this awesome place !!"
1274,Great hotel,50,May 2018,"Our room was modern and clean - with a good sized bathroom and balcony

The staff were all very friendly - we arrived late and they were more than happy to help us and offer us a cold towel and fresh water

Wonderful breakfast - the best buffet I have ever had!!

The pool area is nice with a good amount of bean bags and sun lounges"
1275,Heaven in a hitel,50,May 2018,"We planned a last minute trip to Bali and decided we would go with a trusted name, the Marriott. We were not disappointed. From the amazing friendly staff, to the delicious breakfast, to the stunning pools. The resort actually looks like the photos. I can not pick one thing to fault at all and we have been here a week so far. Thank you so much Courtyard Marriott"
1276,Wow!!,50,May 2018,"As a Marriott Platinum member, I have stayed at many Marriott properties. This is by far the nicest Courtyard. I would actually classify this property more in the realm of a full service hotel. Everything has been exactly what I would expect. Check in was smooth, room was clean, staff eager to help. The spa was wonderful and although you can definitely get cheaper massages from the local businesses surrounding, you can be sure the quality at Marriott is above average. The breakfast buffet is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen. Apparently they have won some awards from Marriott and I can tell you it is well deserved!

Thanks so much to the management and staff for making my stay in Bali so nice. You made me feel very special and welcome!!"
1277,Another visit to this amazing hotel,50,May 2018,"The management of this hotel are to be congratulated on the training of their staff - It is obvious that Courtyard Marriott care for their staff. The staff make this hotel so welcoming. We returned for another visit in May 2018 - the staff in the restaurants are fantastic - they know your name - my husband has his coffee within minutes of being seated - my iced chocolate the same followed up by a healthy fruit juice. I must mention a few names Sutiarja - Yoga -Gita - Mulliawin - Patrick - trainee Delia in the Juice bar - what an amazing young girl - I hope to see her as permanent staff member next year. Anna another person - so helpful and welcoming . I love The Truck - the rooms are fantastic - the position of the hotel for shopping and dining - close to Eat Street - shuttle to Eat Street and the beach. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. I have mentioned a few names however I would like management to pass on our thanks for another wonderful holiday.

Jeanette & Glynn Schultz"
1278,Why I would stay at the Marriott,50,May 2018,"We have not stayed here yet!
But yesterday evening my husband and I got lost and went to the Marriott‚Äôs valet area and asked them directions back to our villa.
They were amazing - nothing was too much trouble and they even offered to drop us back to our villa!!
They were so,kind and courteous and we were not even staying.
Well done Marriott valet guys for your above and beyond attention.
Marriott you train your staff well and when we return I know were we will head. Thank you so very much."
1279,Amazing hotel,50,May 2018,"Honestly one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Gorgeous grounds and beautiful rooms we don‚Äôt want to go home! The staff are so friendly you never pass 1 person without them saying hello. You could ask for anything and they would try and accommodate you. Located in Seminyak within walking distance to shops and restaurants (although you will need a taxi to get to eat street/Seminyak sq) this hotel is a real gem, wish I could give it 6 stars!"
1280,Perfect stay,50,May 2018,"We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed this stay a lot. Everything was great. Our room was really clean and nicely decorated. The breakfast and restaurant serve delicious food. The staff is so great and the pool is nice and quiet (although I recommend to get a deckchair early in the morning if you want one on the sunny side).
I wish I had planned a longer stay!"
1281,"Aside from the beautiful hotel itself, the staff is what makes the experience unforgettable!",50,April 2018,"The existing reviews say it all. The level of comfort, kindness, and assistance by staff cannot be overstated. Your entire time within the hotel whether it be poolside, in the lobby, or in their wonderful Seminyak Kitchen you are greeted with smiles and excellent service. My friend and I returned to the resort after loving our first few days in Bali there after coming back from the Gili Islands. Whenever I return to Bali next, I would never think about staying anywhere else!"
1282,Best choice I made for family holiday ever!,50,April 2018,"I and my family including 6 yo son stayed at 1 bed room suite of Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort for 4 nights from the end of April. Honestly, it was so good that I even regretted our choice of travel plan to move to another hotel after 4 nights in here. Our stay there was that good to us and I really recommend everyone especially with kids to stay here.

I can even say this hotel was one of best resort hotels among many hotels I'd stayed in the past. I never imagined we could have such happy stay under $200/night in destination like Bali. Building itself was new and well maintained, room had enough space with bright balcony, and pool with bar was very nice. Also, breakfast in Seminyak kitchen with variety of tasty local food choice made us 100% satisfied.

But most amazing thing of this hotel was staffs. Every single staff could have smile on the face and exchange greetings with every customer impartially. Unfortunately, this is not 100% common in our travel experiences. Even at 4 or 5 star hotels, I‚Äôve felt hotel staffs hospitality is not equally provided to us and caucasian look family at the next table. But this hotel is totally different from that. Everyone we saw could show their warm welcome for us every single moment. I was especially impressed many staffs could call my son by his name and talk to him very friendly. It always made his stay there more enjoyable even though he didn't get English. I read one of reviews of Tripadvisor said every Marriott workers should take training in this hotel. I could not agree with him/her more after wonderful experience in here.

One little thing I want the hotel to consider for improvement: the power of fridge. It‚Äôs always nice if you could sip ice-cold drink after coming back from pool. But the fridge there did not help you to do this. It doesn‚Äôt make drinks cold but actually they became warmer in it. I think hotel cares about the motor noise to annoy customers and avoid fridge with motor. But I believe needs for cold drink is quite high among customers staying hotel like this. Recent mini fridge on the market is not that noisy. I really hope the hotel will consider for this improvement.

Even without good fridge, I am 100% sure I'm going to stay with you in our next visit to Bali within this year or at latest on next May. Thank you for every staffs made our stay such an enjoyable and happy one. I am looking forward to see you very soon."
1283,Beautiful Resort Run by an even Better Staff!,50,May 2018,"The courtyard is a beautiful hotel with an amazing courtyard, hence the name, in the middle with a swim up bar and multiple pools to lounge around in. The staff was absolutely amazing the entire time I was there, and went above and beyond to help me with any task or question that I had. Ari, who worked at the front desk, was especially helpful and always greeting me by name anytime I arrive or left the lobby area, he deserves 5 stars!"
1284,Amazing Resort,50,May 2018,"Fantastic staff, so friendly and helpful, could not fault the service. Clean and modern rooms with comfortable beds and great bathrooms. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and the facilities were also great. Could not fault this resort. Great location close to Seminyak Square with plenty of restaurants, bars and shops within walkng distance. They even had a free buggy service to the beach which was only a short 5 minute walk away."
1285,Amazing stay!,50,May 2018,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, as Marriot Gold member, i was upgrade to 1 bedroom suite & was also given free breakfast. Breakfast here is amazing, they provide fresh juice, & breakfast options from all over the world. Staff is very nice, Manager personally greets you @ check-in. Excellent hotel for its value!"
1286,Come back here,50,April 2018,"We stayed at the Courtyard for a week from April 21st and could not have asked for a better place to stay. This is the second time we have stayed here. We were here six months ago. For us, coming back here is an absolute joy and we were surprised to be welcomed back by staff that remembered us.

Whilst our room was not available to go into immediately, we were offered complimentary drinks at the Poolside Bar. It was really nice to have a wonderful lady, Saji, from the poolside bar staff recognise us and welcome us home (nice touch).

The room 258 was in a great location within the resort. Initially we thought it may have been a little noisey as it overlooked the pool but it was amazingly quiet. It was close to everything.

It was a fantastic breakfast every morning and Arja and Maria (the wait staff) we always ready to get us our coffee to start the day. The breakfast was amazing again, and special thanks goes to Minggu (Junior Executive Chef) who went out of his way to ensure my partner had gluten free meals throughout our week there.

The resort is very clean and ideally located, close to the beach and to eat street. There is a free shuttle available and there is beach area exclusively for the Courtyard guests.

All in all, another wonderful week at the Courtyard."
1287,AMAZING STAY,50,April 2018,"Our first time in Bali, and wow, what an amazing hotel to experience Bali from.

Before booking this hotel I‚Äôve read so many wonderful reviews about it, and they really are genuine, the hotel is fantastic!!!!

Arrived here late April with my family. Upon check in we were advised we got complimentary early check in and late check out (an hour for both), which has definitely started the stay on the right foot. The rooms we got were interconnecting, beautifuly set out and spacious. They were thoroughly cleaned every day, and the cleaner even tidied some of my belongings that were scattered around which I thought was a nice touch.

The pool is great, clean, spacious! My biggest concern was the shade I read about on reviews, but there was absolutely no reason for this. The pool gets plenty of sun and shade so don‚Äôt let the reviews deter you - lots of opportunity to sunbake and lots of lounge chairs available. If looking from reception towards the pool, the right hand side of the pool is mostly sunny during the day, and the left one is in the shade! So there is always a choice.

Brekfast was amazing, 10/10 without exaggeration!

We stayed in a few days/nights as they had different evenings with different type of cuisine which we loved.

There were lots of activities so really, once again, no need to leave the hotel at all.

The biggest thing about this hotel though, is the staff and their customer service. Beyond amazing! They are always smiling, polite, courteous, helpful, genuine! They even played with my son while I was in the pool relaxing. Absolutely mind blowing how beautiful these people are. The gentleman in the Seminyak Kitchen who made our coffee each morning came around the counter and hugged my husband as we were leaving- how sweet was that?!

My only little suggestion is, I can‚Äôt remember her name, but she is usually out the front where the barrels with fruit are, (long straight hair, usually in a low pony tail) this lady really needs to learn from her colleagues what customer service is. It was so disappointing to see her serious and unapproachable face compared to the rest of the team. I had 2 dealings with her - both really disappointing. She is the only thing I didn‚Äôt like in the whole 7 days, but the hotel still gets 10/10 as the rest of the team absolutely deserves it.
If we ever go back to Bali, definitely would stay at this hotel again üíñüíñüíñ

Well done Courtyard!!!!"
1288,Excellent hotel in a great Seminyak location!,50,May 2018,"We recently stayed for 4 nights at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak. Very impressed with the hotel - location ideal at 20 minutes from the airport, 5 minute walk to the beach and lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and shops in close proximity. Staff were great too - really helpful and attentive with all round good service. Room was spotlessly clean and furnished to a high standard. Breakfast was also good quality, with lots of choice. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Seminyak!"
1289,An Utterly Positive Surprise,50,May 2018,"If you're trying to make a Bali hotel decision, look no further. As a Platinum member, this hotel respects and goes above and beyond expectations. From check-in, to mid-day activities and requests throughout my stay, the staff treated my wife and I to a pleasant stay. The front desk manager, Ramu, came out himself to greet and attend to my needs along with his staff-Ulis, Priscilla, and Arya who personally escorted my wife and I to our upgraded room. We also had the pleasure of attending a special party held on the rooftop and there we met with Elizabeth, the finance director, who took the time out to get to know us and share travel stories with. The amount of respect shown at this hotel, along with the location and complimentary buggy service to nearby attractions, made me want to extend my stay here. Thank you Courtyard Seminyak for a warm Marriott welcome! You are just the travel escape a rewards member deserves!"
1290,Excellent staff Great Breakfast Clean Modern Rooms,40,October 2017,"It's what you would expect from the Marriott ... Quality.
Great Clean spacious rooms. Fresh breakfast choices . Ranging from healthy choices to Decadent selections. Good clean gym a great sheltered pool area. Free table tennis and shuttle bus to Seminyak Eat street."
1291,Excellent Hotel,50,May 2018,"Just returned from an 8 night stay and I can't recommend this hotel enough.

All staff are so friendly and helpful and they can't do enough for your stay. We had transfers included which made arriving to the hotel seamless, then greeted with a cold towel and drink on arrival.

We stayed on the 6th Floor in a pool facing room - very clean, spacious, well maintained daily and had excellent (free) wi-fi

One of the best breakfasts I've ever had in a hotel, something for everyone - juice station, pastries/cakes/breads, fresh fruit, yoghurt, granolas, eggs (scrambled, omelettes, benedict), usual hot breakfast (sausages, bacon, beans etc)

We had lunch and dinner in the Hotel Restaurant and the food and service was excellent.

Perfect location, lots to explore on foot, or jump on the courtesy shuttle that takes you near Eat Street or to the Beach

Very large pool, plenty of sunbeds and beanbags, very clean and well maintained. Pool side service for drinks/food.

Good gym - good size space to do an interval workout / Crossfit WOD - selection of dumb bells, medicine balls, floor mats. Air conditioned, cold towels, water station. Also has treadmill and exercise bike.

Will definitely return to this hotel!!"
1292,TMI Perth room 540,50,May 2018,We had the most amazing stay at The Courtyard Marrriott hats off to Grant and all the staff for doing a great job looking after their Guests the way you do !! Thanks for the invite to the roof top cocktail gathering the view is awesome from up their and for all the other extras thrown in . Cant wait to come back soon
1293,Almost perfect,40,May 2018,"This is a first class facility with excellent staff! We didn't try the pool but it looks very nice. They provided a shuttle to and from the private beach facility and what a beach and ocean!

If we had to stay in Seminyak again we would choose this place however...don't get a room next to the main street. If you do bring good ear plugs!"
1294,Hotel wonderful,50,September 2017,"Hotel wonderful..,beautiful setting,delicious pools and excellent servicewonderful breakfast everthing beautiful and wonderful this hotel..restaurants lovedy,beach with night shows on the sand..crozy rooms"
1295,Bali Bliss - Amazing Stay,50,May 2018,"Courtyard Marriott... Where do I start, firstly I would like to thank Ramu ‚ÄòFront Desk Manager‚Äô after a brief discussion was able to accommodate some dietary and requirements to make our stay more pleasurable.

Here‚Äôs just a few points of our stay at the Courtyard Marriott;

‚Ä¢ Room was clean, spacious, modern, aircon lovely and cold which was nice to return to upon a day out.
‚Ä¢ Hotel facade, also modern with security which made you feel safe. Upon check-in you‚Äôre welcomed with a refreshment and wet towel.
‚Ä¢ Pool - lower part is where the daybeds are located with a remote to order a beverage or meal/snack. Upper pool have bean bags available with the swim up bar option. Sun - I didn‚Äôt have an issue with this, I would mostly swim in the afternoon and had shaded and direct sun areas around the pool - therefore I had the best of both worlds.
‚Ä¢ Gym - 24/7 access via room key, x3 treadmill, bike, stepper, weights, medicine ball, ropes and yoga mats and more.
‚Ä¢ Breakfast - great coffee, array of options from western cuisine, Asian, speciality, egg station, bacon, beans, mushroom, variety of bread - sourdough,muffins sweets, pancakes waffles, fresh fruit, yoghurt, the granola was Devine! There is also a juice station where you can request a fresh juice of your choice.
‚Ä¢ Zanti Spa - clean, private, professional and relaxing to the point my husband was snoring by the end. Highly recommend the 60 minute massage.
‚Ä¢ Hotel activities, pool bingo, minute to win it, sunset yoga there‚Äôs always something to do!
‚Ä¢ Seminyak Kitchen - we dined at the kitchen a couple of times, great selection and tasty food. On our last day it was made special and would like to mention Dwi who was very helpful, accommodating and polite - we were given a lovely floating mango juice complementary which was just delightful upon our departure.

All in all - is this hotel a great stay yes, value for money yes, have I enjoyed my stay yes! So therefore I recommend the Courtyard Marriott a great place to reside whilst holidaying in Bali.

I would like to thank all the staff, especially the employees of the Seminyak Kitchen who were just a delight!

Regards,
Ghalati‚Äôs Room 260"
1296,This is the place to stay!,50,April 2018,"Can‚Äôt think their are better options in Seminyak than this Marriot.
We had a groundfloor pool room with terrace. Slidingdoors leading onto the pool with sun loungers.
Room is nice size with large shower in private bathroom.
Fantastic pool with poolbar. Quite nice dishes as well.
The breakfast.... oh well, can‚Äôt beat it!!
Not to forget the waffles and ice-cream station!!"
1297,Amazing Hotel,50,April 2018,"We returned back to Sydney yesterday & couldn't stop praising on how beautiful this hotel was. My kids loved the pool, we loved the drinks & we all enjoyed the food & staff. Each morning the staff greeted us with their warm smiles & they were very attentive to our orders. The breakfast & dinners were delicious & each day they had different cuisines to choose from. The hotels was close to shops & the beach & close to other venues. We would definitely stay here again when we return back to Bali."
1298,"Excellent rooms, pool, food and staff!",50,April 2018,"We stayed here for 5 days and don‚Äôt have a bad thing to say! It was perfect!

The rooms are modern and clean and our room walked out onto the pool. The pool is large with plenty of sun and shade (best of both worlds) and a swim up pool bar. The sun beds are very comfy.

The food and drink selection is great! Especially at breakfast. Everything you could think of is there! (My personal favourite was when they had the churros lady there! YUM!)

The staff are very friendly and helpful and it genuinely looks like they enjoy their jobs.

Our room was cleaned every day and we were even surprised with a towel elephant!!

The restaurant has delicious food. We had the Sunday roast and it was to die for!

Plenty of security so you feel safe, free popcorn all day every day, private beach area with wifi

OH AND THE WIFI IS AMAZING! So fast!

Will definitely recommend to everyone!

*one tip: there are only limited sun beds that get direct sunlight so you have to get in early!"
1299,Excellent Hotel,50,April 2018,"Great Hotel. It was recommended to me by a couple of work colleagues who had stayed there previously. We were not disappointed at all.

Rooms were very clean and modern. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff, from the front desk to head chef.

Hotel is within walking distance to beach and main street of Seminyak, felt very safe the whole time we were there.

Hotel has buggies that will take you to the beach or down to Eat Street, staff were more than accommodating. Even when the buggy broke down they provided us with air-conditioned cars to take us there.

Spa staff were fantastic, had two treatments whilst there and couldn't ask for better service or care.

Excellent security as well. Would highly recommend this hotel. Great for all generations and families. Heaps of activities to do at the hotel on a daily basis from Yoga, water aerobics, bingo, and nightly entertainment. Would definitely stay there again."
1300,Definitely lives up to it's name,50,April 2018,"Service was extremely wonderful. Staff was friendly and very attentive. The rooms were spacious, clean and met all the basic requirements. Breakfast was also delicious. Had a wide spread of variety and options to choose from. Lunch and dinner options were okay. I also felt safe staying at this hotel. Security checks were compulsory before entering the hotel premises. This hotel is about 30-40 mins away from the airport depending on traffic."
1301,Excellent hotel,50,April 2018,"I booked this hotel based on the reviews here and I couldn‚Äôt have agreed more with the glowing comments other guests had made. I usually stay with other international hotel chains but Courtyard was convenient to where I wanted to be. And what a superb choice! What set this hotel apart from other chain hotels is the staff. The staff made me feel so welcomed and were happy to be of service to me. I stayed for three days and I have been greeted and chatted to by the General Manager everyday. The few occasions I saw GM of any other hotels was when I had complaints. So this was very nice of the GM taking time to speak to his guests. Highly recommended for family, business or pleasure."
1302,Nice hotel at busy Seminyak,50,April 2018,"Clean and modern hotel located at the busy street of Seminyak. high security provides by the hotel, feel safe staying in. Room is clean, reasonable size and with nice pool view. Good variety of choice on breakfast, and lots of restaurants around the hotel.
Incredible hospitality and services from every staff we met; is a joy to stay in a place where you can feel the welcomeness from every staff."
1303,First Class!,50,April 2018,"Have stayed here in excess of 6 times since the hotel opened as a Courtyard a few years back.

As is covered in most of the reviews:

* Great location
* Modern rooms
* Great pool area
* Solid breakfasts

Everything you‚Äôd expect at a Marriott hotel, plus more, especially given the price paid.

What sets this hotel apart from all others at this price range, is the staff.

Time and time again, they exceed expectations, from Penny at the Pool Bar who remembers me by name and has done for years, to the guys at front desk who are always only too happy to help, prime example:

Tonight on the way to airport, about an hour into the trip (Traffic was very bad), I realised I had left my car keys/house keys in the room safe and forgotten to put them into my bag. I sent a Whatsapp to Selvia (One of the managers) and advised her that I would have a friend in Bali collect them in a few days and bring them back with him.

This wasn‚Äôt good enough for Selvia, she arranged for one of the desk staff to jump on his scooter and deliver them to me at the airport, he even got there in only half an hour!

Time after Time, the staff at Courtyard continue to impress me with their genuine care for guests, nothing is ever too much trouble and for this reason, I will continue to come to Courtyard Seminyak whenever I am in Bali :)"
1304,Counting the days until we can return!,50,April 2018,"This hotel is simply wonderful! Open layout, clean, gorgeous pool and grounds. But you want to know what makes it outstanding? The in-bloody-credible staff! Nothing is too much trouble, the friendliness is genuine and they are just so lovely. An absolute credit to the Marriott chain.

Pool service is great and the cocktails (and mocktails for the kids) are delicious and exceptional value for money.
I would recommend booking a pool view room as we booked a city view room which overlooked a carpark - but it seriously wasn't too big a deal as we spent all our hotel time around the pool area...but if you like to linger on your balcony than the pool view rooms are the way to go.

For a family holiday this place is absolutely spot on."
1305,Best hotel by far in Seminyak clean comfortable and great location. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!,50,April 2018,"My husband and I stayed here early April for 9 nights rm 637 and enjoyed every moment of our stay. Our friends stayed a few doors down from us as we requested close by and they also enjoyed there stay. Cleanliness of the rooms were spotless thanks to Dedy in housekeeping who always made sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast at the Seminyak kitchen was amazing and staff were very attentive especially Sri and Janu and the omelette chefs who always remembered our orders from the day we got there. Hanging out at the pool bar was our highlight. Pool bar staff were very friendly and they would always make our drinks perfect and make sure my TungJung was always in stock thanks to my favourite pool bar staff Narita and Hari both always had a smile on there face even when they were run off their feet. Last of all we had dinner at the meat shop upstairs the I highly recommend the lamb cutlets and the fillet mignon it was the best meat we have ever had and Jul the waiter was a delight. From friendly staff to the comfortable clean facilities and the vibe of the hotel, By far Courtyard is the best hotel I have stayed at in Seminyak I would 100% come back next time with the kids who would love it. I'm already planning to come back in December Can't wait!! Thankyou for a great holiday. Tammy and Marco"
1306,The BEST in Bali,50,April 2018,"My partner and I have just returned from visiting this hotel in the month of April, 2018. As this was our first visit to Bali, like most we were sceptical of how our experience would be. This hotel is the best you could possibly ask for in Bali for many reasons.

The staff at this hotel are absolutely phenomenal, unlike other hospitality staff throughout the world, the staff at the Courtyard by Marriott treat you as a friend, rather than a customer. They will go absolutely above and beyond to give you anything you wish for and make your experience most pleasant. Throughout our stay, we were given complimentary room upgrades, complimentary desserts and memories with some beautiful Balinese people that we will never forget. I‚Äôd like to say a special thank you to Dwi, Maria, Bagus, Widi, Alit and Fesby for making our stay so memorable.

The rooms are absolutely spotless, and cleaned very regularly to ensure your stay is nothing but comfortable. The facilities are absolutely exceptional, and are five star quality for a four star hotel. The breakfast provides anything and everything you can possibly imagine, from western, to Indian, to Asian and even dessert. The food is also nothing short of five star quality.

We loved this hotel so much, that we came back and rebooked for another five nights in the middle of the night after an unpleasant experience in a hotel in Nusa Dua.

Lastly, I would like to mention that this hotel is a great reflection on John‚Äôs management. On multiple occasions we saw John outside, mingling with guests, providing hospitality and ensuring everything was running smoothly. We took the time to talk to John about how happy we were with this hotel and the high level of service. It was very humbling to see John performing the duties listed above, as they are often things that you would not see a General Manager doing.

If you are looking for an outstanding experience in Bali, please look no further than this hotel, you will not regret it and we will definitely be back."
1307,So friendly and helpful.......,40,April 2018,"A very clean and comfortable hotel with extremely friendly and accommodating staff. The restaurant (Seminyak Kitchen) provides a large variety of foods including local, western and Asian. The staff are AMAZING and nothing is a hassle to them!
A personal thank-you to Maria, Adi, Delia (and Alit at the pool bar) for your kind and attentive service. Your exceptional skills and professionalism helped make our stay a very memorable one!

Note to Management...... house keeping staff need to be reminded that guests on holiday are still sleeping at 6:30-7:00am! (refer my room note)"
1308,5 star service at 4 star hotel !,50,April 2018,"The Courtyard`s in Asia are nothing like the Courtyard`s in the USA. They are full service hotels with great facilities but this one in Bali is extra special and it`s all to do with the staff. Grant and his team do a fantastic job throughout the hotel with everyone so happy and helpful......trust me, everyone notices.
The hotel is compact and built around the pool which was well used but offered areas of shade and relaxation. Good bar promotions and special nights for dinner meant you didn`t need to leave. The breakfast has been mentioned in several reviews with good reason. Plenty of choice with local, other Asian and Western dishes and the ever attentive service.
The onsite Zanti spa was also a pleasure and we took the promo of 4 massages which worked out to about SGD 30 per massage. Lovely place, clean and serene and well worth it. Parsini and Nadia did our massage perfectly.
Overall this hotel is fantastic value for money"
1309,Very good,50,April 2018,"This is our third stay @ the Courtyard Marriot Seminyak. Although not on the beach, they provide transport to their designated area on the beach. Rooms are clean, the pool is great.

Staff is friendly and eaer to help. Staff in the restaurant are amazing. They still remember us from our last stay two years ago.
Donni I is the best and always looks after us.
Highly recommended especially for families with children.

1310,Marriott should use this place to train all their staff,50,April 2018,"The staff in this hotel are absolutely exceptional in every aspect, if I was running Marriott I would get some of my lower performing hotels to stay here to see how it can be done.
The programme that has been put in place to train the staff deserves some credit, it's really worked and the guests actually talk to ech other bout how good the staff are.
Point of note
The Seminyak kitchen is simply the best breakfast selection I have ever seen in my hotel anywhere in the world.
The pool area is great but can have quite a lot of shade depending on where you sit.
The whole hotel is kept to a very high standard of cleanliness.
The food in the restaurant and bar are of a very good standard.
The hotel lacks a beach front which is a shoe but is only 5 mins walk away, but the pool is so good we stayed around it most days.
Try the special nights that they put on weekly, the staff telly try hard to make it a good experience nd again the food was excellent.

Overall we stayed for 10 nights and would defiantly recommend."
1311,Great service - great location,50,April 2018,Had a great week - more a family orientated hotel but none the less great spot for a solo traveler. Breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen was sensational - Janu‚Äôs customer service was excellent! As was Jul at the Meatshop restaurant. Rooms large clean and very comfortable
1312,Incredible hospitality!!,50,April 2018,"I have travelled extensively and have stayed in some of the best 5 Star hotels around the world, but the hospitality of this place was one of the best I have ever experienced hands down!! I stayed at this place for 5 nights with my wife and daughter. From the day we checked in until we checked out, they were incredibly accommodating. The reviews are true. The breakfast spread was sensational with some local cuisine to try and they do breakfast until 11!! Recommend buying their breakfast voucher during check in. The pool and kids club was great and my daughter had a fantastic time. Zanti for a nice relaxing massage is a must. The restaurant was great with fantastic staff. Widi, the waiter was so polite and respectful. This place certainly impressed us and will be coming back again. Thank you!!"
1313,"Great service, hospitality and location",40,April 2018,"It is our second time here and we were warmly welcomed back by reception staff who gave us welcome beers and upgraded us to an amazing room overlooking the pool very comfortable bed very clean room big amazing bathroom excellent air conditioning. Buffet breakfast was fresh and tasty great variety. Pool side service Was quick and great for us the 4 times we ordered. Facility‚Äôs clean and well maintained we will be back. The only constructive feedback for the hotel management would be to stop getting staff to tell guests to write reviews on trip advisor it was way over board we were asked by 3 reception staff one of the pool staff and one housekeeper. Then after our stay received two emails from Marriott still asking us to put a review up on trip advisor when we had already given them a fantastic review on Expedia who we booked them through which they already responded to thanking me and we had already given them another fantastic review on trip advisor & Expedia the last time we stayed. There is no need for them to harass guests for reviews, it is desperate, unprofessional and definitely unacceptable people are on holidays. Guests at the Buffett and guests at the pool were also saying they were fed up with the harassment. The resort is well maintained the staff are great so management just leave it at that and if people want to write a review in their own time they will."
1314,Phenominal 5 Star Hotel!!!!!! The best in Seminyak,50,April 2018,"Had the time of a lifetime.
This is our seventh time to Bali, although first time to Seminyak.
Definitely a step up from the rest.
The facilities were first class, the service was the best I have ever experienced anywhere around the world.
Don't waste your time looking anywhere else."
1315,Good hotel good location,50,April 2018,"+ plus : good location at seminyak, amazing pool love it very much with perfect water tempt, very nice staffs, and 5 star breakfast
- minus : a bit far from the beach but they provide shuttle to the beach, pricey"
1316,Amazing first visit to Bali,50,April 2018,"Had an amazing time staying at the courtyard for 4 days. The staff were all kind and hospitable. We were also given complimentary breakfast for two for the duration of our stay. The breakfast at seminyak kitchen is impeccable‚Äî great food and amazing staff. Our waitress, Arini, did an outstanding job every day and made sure we had everything we need. Will definitely return in the future."
1317,Awesome facilities. Extremely helpful staff.,50,April 2018,"From the moment we arrived, free Bintang as welcome drink. We got upgraded to a suite with additional bed for our 5 yrs old. Lots of activities and games for guests to join and they are free. Our daughter love the kids club and the pool. Kids club is free for 2 hrs per day, thereafter has to pay but it‚Äôs affordable price. They even offer babysitting service at a fee. We also enjoyed the Pool bar, great cocktails and awesome staff. Front office staff always checking if our needs are met, very accommodating. There‚Äôs also free popcorn and candy floss for all to enjoy. Great selection of food at buffet breakfast- restaurant staff are extremely friendly. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking at staying in Seminyak."
1318,Holiday,50,April 2018,"Had a wonderful time here at the courtyard Marriott Seminyak. Staff couldn't be anymore helpful, food was great especially the breakfast! Has all the essential things for a family holiday big pool with a swim up bar , gym , live music by the pool side, ping pong table for the kids ! Popcorn and fairy floss machines for the kids also. Massage and spa lounge and close to everything and very secure.
Also lots of cool events within the hotel such as bingo, yoga, water aerobics, fire dancing an that's all weekly. Had such a good time that I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I came back. The staff in the kitchen go above an beyond especially Maria one of my favourites! She was always so happy to see us and did anything we asked! Would rate this hotel and trip 10/10 for everything. I'd suggest this hotel to anyone coming to Bali. From the Georgia narelle and brad xo, Sydney."
1319,Great staff at the Marriott,50,April 2018,"Lovely staff, took the time to chat and made us very comfortable. We were well looked after by Abit, the Assistant Manager of the Pool Side Bar and our waiter Alit. A beautiful place to stay. Good entertainment in the evening, the best buffet breakfast providing beautiful curry, soups, Western food and much much more."
1320,Kids Club,50,April 2018,"Kids club is a very friendly place, my kids love it, when I go to pick them up they want to continue to stay there even if they would miss dinner.
Debby, Komang , Nisa and Dewi are very good with kids."
1321,THE place to stay in Seminyak.....,50,February 2018,"This hotel, like all Marriotts, met my every expectation.

We stayed as a ""jet lag recovery"" before boarding a ship and we were not disappointed

Checkin was warm, friendly and effortless even though security was tight but unobtrusive - sadly a good and welcome feature in this day and age.

We were taken immediately to our poolside suite and all the hotel facilities clearly explained to us by the bell boy.

The room was comfortable and well furnished and immaculately clean!

Breakfast at the hotel was included and absolutely fantastic - a great start to the day with a wide variety to suit every taste - eggs any way to curry and all tastes in between - a feast in its own right! - eggs benedict cooked fresh to order every morning!!!

So good, in fact that we we used the venue to eat every night where again we were always impressed. Hats off to Arini, Rai, Gita and Putri

Exploring the local area, there was always a complimentary shuttle buggy to take us to the beach or to downtown Seminyak, and the concierge was able to organise a car and driver for the day when we went sight seeing in Ubud and finally, as we left, the most luxurious transportation to the cruise port - again hats off!!

Included also were complimentary sessions of a traditional Balinese massage at their Spa, Zanti. Excellent welcome, formalities, cleanliness, and, of course the massage itself!!

All the staff is amazing with a warmth and friendliness that is a great credit to the hotel and its Management staff, Ramu and Grant.

Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and to recommend it to others!"
1322,The BEST in Seminyak,50,April 2018,"What an incredible stay at this hotel.

Everything was just perfect. The check in was very quick and painless. The cold towel and drink was much needed. The lady that took us to our room told us everything about the hotel and couldn‚Äôt do anything more for us! 5 Star service!

The breakfast is one of the best I‚Äôve seen since my time in Bali. Loads of choices and daily specials.

The pool area is lovely. The sun beds are always free and the service poolside was perfect! Food and drinks served so quickly.

Finally the people here is what made the holiday for us. They are great, they go above and beyond all the time. John was so nice coming to say hello to us, gave us some great suggestions for restaurants and bars in the area.

If you‚Äôre looking for luxury in Bali.. this is it!"
1323,"Nice location, lovely staff",40,April 2018,"We had 7 nights here in April 2018 and were very happy. Staff were fantastic and very helpful, room well laid out and clean. We had a pool access room which was fantastic and the pool is clean and has a child pool area."
1324,Fab holiday and fantastic place,50,April 2018,From the moment we arrived we were welcomed. We went to the restaurant to grab a snack and a fine young waiter named Jul went out of his way to explain everything. The cleanliness is A plus and the breakfast was a great vatiety. The pool was very spacious for me to do my laps all from eating too much
1325,"Beautiful Hotel, Superb Ground, Great Staff",50,April 2018,"We chose the hotel because their two-bedroom suite could accommodate the makeup of our group (my wife and I, her mother, and our son), and also because of the kids club. We were not prepared for every other aspect of the stay to be top-notch!

We ate at the Seminyak Kitchen and the Pool Bar, and Food from both was stellar."
1326,"Brilliant resort, will be back!",50,April 2018,"My stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak was absolutely brilliant. The pool was a real highlight, with swim up bar. The staff were really friendly, warm and welcoming. They felt like friends by the end of the trip. I was quite happy to stay at the resort and enjoy all it had to offer but did venture out for a few days of activities too.
The food from the resort was delicious! There was the most amazing array of food for breakfast, it was mind blowing! We had some beautiful dinners in house also. The food, I cannot fault. The cocktails and drinks were brilliant, and it seemed no need to worry about the ice in drinks (Bali Belly water). I‚Äôm pretty sure the water is filtered. We still chose to brush our teeth with bottled water.

The staff were all so helpful and caring it made the trip!"
1327,Highly recommended,50,April 2018,"This hotel has truly great amenities and accommodations, but it‚Äôs the staff that makes it exceptional. Rai and Widi in the restaurant provided some of the best service we‚Äôve ever had, and the food was to die for. Loved the pool area, all the activities‚Äî food truck night and watching the kids paint Easter eggs were particularly great. The room was spotlessly clean, bed was very comfortable and the AC was nice and strong. We will return!!"
1328,"Beautiful, secure hotel with superb staff",50,April 2018,"Myself and my partner stayed at this hotel recently. On arrival we were greated by a security team, which made us feel safe throughout our stay at the hotel, as everyone‚Äôs bags are checked on arrival.

The breakfast was amazing, there were lots of different types of food to choose from.
The hotel is quite if you stay in a room which faces the pool area, if you stay in a room that faces the Main Street it will definitely not be peaceful. So bare that in mind when booking the room.

Overall, 5 stars"
1329,Lovely friendly smaller hotel.,50,February 2018,"Stayed with my 20 yo daughter in feb. weather was fabulous. The security here is the first thing I noticed on our arrival. Incredible with scanning each time you enter the complex. The staff are incredibly friendly. We had a pool view room at end of courtyard away from the bar. It suited us well. Room lovely clean with v comfy bed. Closer to bar could get noisy . I would think the far end would be best for elderly also as pool has shallow easy access.
As a bit of a coffee snob I think it important to rate the coffee as awesome. Best I‚Äôve had in Bali. The food was fabulous. From
Breakfast to the great taco truck.
Tours were organised easily for us from concierge.
Great location with shopping and restaurants and beach all close.
Been to Bali many many times and think the courtyard is a lovely small hotel to stay. It is designed as a courtyard and that‚Äôs what you get.
The spa services were also v much enjoyed. Will definitely be back.
Thanks to all you lovely people who work there."
1330,Nice and strategic hotel but not with pool bar staff,10,February 2018,"I stayed for 3 days 2 nights, very nice hotel and a very comfortable room and a very superb breakfast, but not with the pool bar staff joking and selfie at work hours and I saw the pool bar staff with the name ""JAYA"" (has a wing tattoo on both arms) taking pictures or video to the guest hotel secretly and upload it on social media is not very keep secret guests while doing activities.maybe i will reconsider to stay in this hotel for the time to the future"
1331,Good hotel recommendation,50,April 2018,"Nice hotel
Clean room
Friendly staff
Good breakfast

Walking distance to the beach with live band & food at night
Free shuttle to nearby Seminyak Square
Lots of shops along the street
A mini-mart across the road"
1332,Loved It!,50,April 2018,"We have been to Bali 15 plus times and this is the first time we had stayed at Courtyard by Marriott, the hotel itself is nice and clean, the 3 pools are amazing found it easy to get a couple of sun beds at most times of the day, and the staff are attentive and friendly. We have a 2 1/2 yr old we decided on this hotel for the social aspect, she loved playing in the kids club, although I personally didn‚Äôt leave her on her own with sitters, they were brilliant. The rooms are spacious, breakfast has great variety, location was good a short walk to the beach, would definitely come here again."
1333,Jane C,50,April 2018,Fantastic holiday was had by all. Catered to the needs of both adults and children. Charming and unobtrusive staff who met every request cheerfully. Rooms were clean and spacious. Breakfast abundant and tasty. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more from a resort. Will be staying again.
1334,Amazing Staff Makes This Hotel Great,50,April 2018,"I have visited numerous countries and stayed in numerous hotels over my lifetime. From the finest hotels to the most inexpensive dives - I have seen it all. As a result, I have an expectation and a little knowledge of what to expect from every property that I plan to visit or revisit. Normally a property meets my expectation or if luckily may even exceed my expectation slightly - but in this case this hotel exceeded my expectation greatly.

I thankfully had an opportunity to celebrate a few days of my honeymoon in Bali and had a chance to stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort. From the moment of checking in I was warmly greeted by the Front Desk Agent - I was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant conversation and care taken by him (I regret not getting his name). Not thinking much of this - I continued with checking in and was able to get a room right away. The common area is clean and the layout of the hotel is fantastic - the pool is surrounded by rooms and easily accessible by those staying at the hotel. The room is well appointed and comfortable - it was certainly easy to rest up for the following day.

Later that evening they had the Asian Street Food Festival - basically a plethora of food from Balinese, East Indian, Chinese, and other Asian delicacies at a set price. Typically, we do not stay in our hotel to eat - but in this case, we did - and it was a fantastic decision that made us explore more of our hotel. The overhead lanterns and ambience outside where the food festival was held was just perfect. It was such a nice setting - we shared a table with another couple (with a bit of space between us) - it truly felt like we were at a food festival. The variety of food was nice - we had the chance to try a bit of everything. But what stood out was the service. The staff - both the kitchen staff manning the booths to the wait staff were simply amazing. They were attentive as you expect - but they being another element to their service. They really take an interest in knowing you and making I feel at home. This was certainly how we felt - but as I watched them serve others - they clearly treated every guest this way. I did not get the names of everyone who attended to us - but huge shout outs to Widi, Arja, and Adi for the great job they did that night.

Based on that singular experience - we had breakfast at the hotel (again fantastic) and took in two sessions each of a traditional Balinese massage at their Spa, Zanti (see my separate review).

In all the hotels we have stayed - we have never once enjoyed the facilities more than we have at this one. Quite simply - the staff is amazing and the care they do in their jobs show throughout this hotel. Great job!

We will make a trip back not only to see Bali but to stay at this fantastic hotel once again!"
1335,Great experience and location,50,April 2018,"Courtyard Marriott in Seminak on my last night in Bali. The location couldn't have been more perfect 5 minute walk to the beach, 5 minute walk to main shopping street and 10 minute walk to eat street. As a solo traveler the area felt safe and I walked on my own everywhere. The Courtyard does have a great shuttle if you prefer. Based on how I was eating I needed to walk!

The service was fantastic! Grant, Ramu, Augustin, Muliana, Sapari and all the team were welcoming, helpful, and so friendly.

The accommodations were great. Most importantly the bed was comfortable. Slept well. My room faced the pool and had a separate dining area and sitting room.

Other things that made my stay great:
-Squat rack in the gym!
-location, location, location
-cool towels and tea at check in
-WTT (what the truck) taco stand
-Fabulous breakfast buffet made to order anything. Accommodated all of my funky requests. Egg whites, oatmeal with water and yum Brie cheese.
-responsive room service (I'm ugly without coffee in the morning)
-fast wifi
-welcomed as a Marriott member

Overall great stay and I would stay again."
1336,Customer service,40,April 2018,"Outstanding staff at Courtyard
Special shout out to Bobbi,Gita,Patrick and all the staff at Seminyak Kitchen who made me feel important each time I entered the restaurant.
Your professionalism and smiles made my day.
The security at the hotel was fabulous.
Room was great as was the welcoming drink
Will be back"
1337,Excellent but noisy!,40,April 2018,"Overall this hotel was a great stay, wonderful staff, great facilities, good location, relaxing! However if you enjoy your sleep I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to stay here!! I am usually a very deep sleeper and I was woken up every single night by the noise of traffic outside!"
1338,"Great hotel, superior customer service",50,March 2018,"We stayed here in March of 2018, and I have nothing but positive things to say about both the hotel and its staff. After traveling from the US, I was incredibly appreciative of the early check-in we received (10am), as well as the upgrade to a suite due to Marriott status. The room was spacious, clean, and opened out to the pool, which was a great addition. This was the first stop on a two week trip through Asia, and I can say without hesitation that it was by far the best service we received, even staying at Ritz Carltons at two other locations on the trip. There was such a genuine quality to the way each person on staff (bartenders, spa staff, up through the Operations Director and General Manager) treated all of the guests. I had three spa treatments, all of which were fantastic, and the reception for Marriott rewards members added a nice personal touch to our stay. Great location close to the airport (though this is Bali, so it will take you 2 hours to go pretty much anywhere else). I highly recommend a visit to this great property!"
1339,Superb service and dining,50,April 2018,Greeted by Bobbi who is front of house at the Courtyard Restaurant. What a great start to a dining experience when you are greeted with warmth and professionalism. Bobbi is able to achieve that perfect blend of friendliness combined with attentive service. If only all service was this good!
1340,"Very good package deal , great hotel great location",50,April 2018,"We loved our stay here , all the staff were wonderful , the gym and spa were very good , the rooms and amenities were good as well and getting ice or room service was quick and the quality was high

Very good location and cheap blue bird taxi made it easy to get into shipping areas and restaurants in nearby Legian and Kuta

The breakfast is exceptional , the pool bar food was good , the restaurant staff are very Good The food truck out the front selling tacos was a bit of a let down , no tomatoes or sour cream or lettuce on their tacos but we were not out of pocket much so was no big deal to us , we just didn‚Äôt go there after the first time

The set menu with the package was average , 2 course dinner is a choice of rice dishes or chicken parmigiana which was not that great , we wished we had the breakfast options at dinner , the much was the same 2 course set menu, and our deserts didn‚Äôt arrive but we walked up the road to lucky day and had the best san chow bow ever for $6.50 so we didn‚Äôt complain

Very happy with rooms and staff as well as the modern facilities , would definitely stay again , would just make sure the package included a proper choice of meals next time.

Good location and decent convenience store across the road selling everything you could need and cheap drinks and souvenirs"
1341,Value Packed.... Exellent stay!!!!,50,March 2018,"This is my 5th stay and I keep coming back to this hotel because of the staff, especially Ulis who is a godsend and the quality you get for the price you pay, Its just such great value. The Zanti spa is a must as well but make sure you book ahead because they do book out.
I highly recommend this hotel to family's or couples or friends. I have had my friends and family who have stayed at the courtyard all agree with me on the above."
1342,Simply one of the best Courtyards in the world!,50,April 2018,"One of the most important things that set the standard for a hotel is the staff. From Bagus one of the manager's to Grant the director, the staff here at the courtyard were all fantastic and provided great service to make sure we had a memorable stay.

As a gold elite member we were given a fantastic upgrade to our room and also were given a nice cocktail hour (normally Thursdays) during our stay.

The location of this hotel is also perfect around the Seminyak area. They provide free shuttles to and from certain areas around the hotel and we were given very good recommendations for restaurants around the area.

The spa and pools were all maintained very well and the gym had a wide range of weights (To my liking) :).

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying around the Seminyak area!"
1343,Superb hotel,50,March 2018,"Great location and facilities. The staff were the best I‚Äôd encountered. They were all so polite and helpful from the moment we arrived. The buffet breakfast was amazing. The pools and grounds were immaculate condition. The rooms were great, recommend pool view room. Highly recommend. 10/10"
1344,Uber Vehicle not allowed in Courtyard!,40,March 2018,"Our stay in Courtyard Seminyak was good except that Uber vehicles are not allowed in the hotel driveway. We preferred Uber over taxi as most Taxi drivers over-charges.

We liked our rooms and we find the hotel location as very convenient. So many restaurants and day spa within a short walk from the hotel. The beach is 5 minutes away by"
1345,Perfection... don‚Äôt need more,50,March 2018,"I stayed for 3 nights and 2 days at this hotel. It was perfect, whether you‚Äôre solo or a group or family. Something for everyone. Shuttle to beach too (although the walk is only 5 minutes), friendly staff with personalities that make you want to converse more.
Best part... the ‚Äúwhat the truck‚Äù coffee and food cart outside.
There is a pool bar, a great happy hour, bean bags for a chill, lots of sun loungers (maybe too much shade).
I strongly recommend this place.
The rooms are also quite spacious and you don‚Äôt feel cooped up!"
1346,Nice hotel near the beach,40,March 2018,"The Courtyard Marrott did not disappoint. The rooms were spacious with comfortable beds and pillows and plenty of hot water in the bathroom. The pool area is really nice and has a pool access bar that was very popular. There was a restaurant which served breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff was helpful and friendly. There was free wi-fi. It was within walking distance of numerous stores, restaurants and the beach. Good location"
1347,Great hotel in Seminyak,40,March 2018,"I am currently staying here and supposed to check out today ... Here are the pros and cons IMO:

Pros:
1. Nice and clean hotel, quite tastefully designed ... rooms are spacious and though not expansive ... each and every corner has been efficiently used
2. The general service level of the staff is generally quite good ... barring a few hiccups which I would mention later. I was particularly impressed with the bed that was provided for my daughter (without even requesting)
3. The buffet breakfast is very good. They have a judicious mix of continental and Indonesian Mix (even a few Indian items) ... food quality is very good .. so is the service level of the staff
4. The swimming pool is wonderful with a vibrant pool bar
5. The kid‚Äôs room is outstanding and is one of the best I have seen lately ... the behavior of ghe staff stationed there is impeccable
6. The hotel has buggy service which can take the residents its own private beach and nearby places ... taxis are also available anytime at a pretty cheap rate (bargaining is a must though)
7. The location of the hotel is really nice with restaurants, beach club, eat street and local spas all quite in the vicinity

Cons:
1. The options in the menu at the hotel restaurant is limited and would definitely need some inclusion .. the food quality overall is excellent ... though the I was quite disappointed with the Indian dishes
2. The hotel offers complimentary water to the boarders ... On the very first day, I was told that I can ask for bottles whenever I need and no questions would be asked ... On one of the days on requesting over the phone for water at night .. I was blatantly told by the guy over the phone (Sian or Rian) that no further bottles would be given, though I was later provided with a few ... I later clarified this with the folks at the reception and they were apologetic ... HOWEVER, this incident is unacceptable from a hotel of Courtyard‚Äôs stature ....
3. The room service was not prompt on multiple occasions and needed reminders, something that again was surprising

Overall, a very nice stay. I would have loved to give a perfect rating but those service issues could not be ignored !"
1348,Delicious food!,50,March 2018,I had the pleasure of staying here for a week and I was so impressed with this hotel. From the moment we arrived we were greeted and welcomed an as basic as this is it meant so much to me and my friends because we‚Äôd traveled across the world to be here so little nerve wrecking. We happen to be here during their holiday for the new year so 2 days we spent only at the hotel. The rooms are spacious and had space for everything we had. The bathroom has an overhead shower that made showering so relaxing. Comfortable bed and very clean room. But what really impressed me was the food! Room service and restaurant food was delicious and tasted so good. We ate out as well but was not as impressed as what the Courtyard food selection provided. Easy access to to the beach and the pool was clean an service at pool was just as good as the rest of hotel. I will be staying here once again and thank you Courtyard Bali Seminyak for your amazing hospitality and for making our stay unforgettable!!
1349,Happy holidays,40,March 2018,"We stayed here about 5 nights. Hospitality was amazing. We travelled with 5 mnths and 4yo. Most of the staff was welcoming except reception and restaurant reception (who arrange your table) staff. They need to improve their welcoming skills. Restaurant staff omay, maria, sri, mira, muliana were amazing. They are a great assets. Omay served well with a vegetarian options every day. Kids club is an amazing place for kids. Best care takers nisa, komang, debby, dewi. My girl lived the place. Girls are really efficient. Hard work.. Five stars to them.
Front desk need to improve their selves on customer relations. Left message with Laura that send our baby sitter near pool area. Message did not get passed through. Babysitter was sent back. They need to focus on a little little things more. Pool pillows disappeared after third day. Fairy floss machine was out of order for two days. Little bit lacking in keeping words. They say they ll send or do. Never happens. House keeper Puja was amazing. Expert in keeping rooms tidy. Good communicator as well as high attention to detail. Understands your needs clearly.
Overall. Good place to stay. Good hospitality."
1350,Excellent stay and place to hold a workshop,50,March 2018,"We held a workshop at at the beginning of March. Working with Tiffany and her staff was the best experience I've ever had working with a hotel. They were flexible and the facilities were great. The breaks were amazing. Everyone was so friendly. Anton, Ali, I can't thank you enough for all you did for us. I wish you all just weren't quite so far away and i'd host all my meetings there. The sleeping rooms were also very nice and so was the pool when we had time to enjoy it. The breakfast was also one of the best buffet breakfasts that I've ever been to. I highly recommend this hotel."
1351,Paradise in the middle of Seminyak,50,March 2018,"I stayed at Courtyard by Marriott for 6 nights and wish It was longer. My stay was so good I want to give it more than 5 stars. The hotel is very relaxing to be around and since check in the staff were more than amazing and that is what made our stay.

Special mention to all the wonderful staff Davin, Santi, Fransesca, Adi, Sutiraja, Muliana, and Ari. They were the most pleasant staff at any hotel I've stayed in. Also Grant Young (Director of Operations) went above and beyond when we needed to make a local phone call for business for 45 minutes and instead of being around noise at reception, he set y the business room for us.

Breakfast was exceptional and the variety and structure of meals is very very impressive. I also had Lunch at the restaurant and the Nasi Goreng was the most delicious one I've had in Bali!

Pool is massive and very relaxing. Beds are super comfy. Plenty of free water bottles are provided daily. Check out is late at 12pm.

Do yourself a favour and stay here if you visit Bali."
1352,Amazingly beautiful,50,March 2018,"What an amazing atmosphere with lovely amenities. The rooms were amazingly spacious and the balcony was nice and relaxing
Location was excellent in walking distance to all areas surrounding and the beach was just up the road..

Also lots of shopping in the area if that‚Äôs what you love todo

We had the pleasure of being at this hotel during Neypi day and we were catered for and looked after very well seeing we could not leave the hotel

The Resturant At the hotel was great üëç as well and catered for food allergies and just hint almond milk would be great to have on hand as well breakfast was really lovely as we were served and welcomed by all staff but Walli
Was great and handle what ever we needed.

I also used the day spa at the resort and it was beautiful and staff were so very professional which was great

We also met the general manger and manger of the hotel they were very welcoming and also proud of how all staff preformed,that all makes sense as they were lovely and inviting to speak too...

We had a great stay at the Marriott and I‚Äôm sure we will be back for our next holiday that we are already planning

Thank you for the kind hospitality and 5star service keep up those amazing standards

Thank you"
1353,I love staying here,50,March 2018,"I really enjoy this hotel and have now stayed a number of times. I have always found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The rooms are nice and spacious and I love having a balcony and being able to one the doors. The internet is good too. I really like the pool, great for laps, the only problem can be on busy days it is hard to get a chair. The breakfast buffet is very good and good value if you can get it included in your room package. The pool food is also good, not cheap but not too expensive. The room service is also very good. The gym is well fitted out for a hotel gym so no excuse not to work out. The atmosphere is great here too. Nyepi day was also well catered for and guests were well looked after. The shuttle to the airport is good too, but it does cost extra but a good service. The hotel buggy can drop you off too at a couple of different spots. I will be back!"
1354,Great value,50,March 2018,"Just a short three night stay, but really enjoyed it. Staff were always very friendly and welcoming, especially with our two little ones (3yo & 10mth). One particular staff member (Suti) consistently went above and beyond. Whether he was manning the taco truck in the heat outside or serving us during breakfast, he always did something to make our experience more enjoyable. Also, shout out to our housekeeping guy (Dodi) who did a great job keeping our room tidy, and entertaining the kids with various towel origami creations! My massage therapist (Hari) also did a great job getting the knots out - thank you.

My only piece of feedback is that they should consider refreshing their portacots, as even though the sheets used were clean, the sides of the cot showed stains and signs of wear and tear. You tend to be particularly mindful of cleanliness with babies, so we noticed this straight away.

Overall an enjoyable stay."
1355,10/10 BEST RESORT IN BALI,50,March 2018,"We have just been for our fourth visit to this wonderful resort. All the staff are just top class and make the holiday so special and wanting more. From the time you arrive to when you leave you are spoilt and it is hard to go back to reality.
The rooms are very clean with plenty of space and the pool view is stunning.
Location is perfect, very short stroll to the beach and also to the restaurants and bars.
This is the place to try, if you go once you will go back, we will be back again later in the year.
Cheers to all at the Marriott"
1356,Weekend gateway,50,March 2018,"Nice place for weekend gateway. Everything is ok and perfect. We went to the kids club at the corner of the hotel and they have plenty toys and activity. Breakfast was confusing for too many option. Close to the beach and they had beach club 1km away from the hotel.
My suggestion is maybe they can upgrade the bathroom amenities for it was to regular for star hotel of the famous chains.
Overall we enjoyed our time there and for sure will consider this hotel of our choice in seminyak area."
1357,Another amazing stay,50,March 2018,"This is our hotel of choice in Seminyak. We stayed over the Nyepi Day weekend and the staff went all out to make sure that everyone had a memorable stay. Special thanks to John, Grant and Penny at the pool bar for looking after us. We look forward to our next trip."
1358,Amazingly amazing!,50,March 2018,"I think it's not a new thing to say good things about this hotel. But I just want to say that the most amazing thing about this place for me is the staff!!! Since my arrival at the check in counter until other services staff are just amazing. Very well trained and well educated. They sure really know how to communicate with their guest and how to please us. I've had been stayed in some 5 stars hotel and resorts in Bali, and I got one of the best staff and service here. Come and stay here and you won't regret it. Keep up the good job!"
1359,Wonderful resort and AMAZING staff!,50,February 2018,"We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak in February and recommend it whole heartedly! While we did not love Seminyak, we absolutely loved the Marriott Courtyard there which feels like a luxury hotel from the beautiful rooms to the amazing amenities. From Francesca at the front desk who was lovely and efficient to Widie and Ghita at the morning breakfast buffet who spoiled us daily with genuine affection and incredible service! We love them! We were constantly spoiled by the wonderful staff who always made us feel special. The gigantic pool was fantastic and we spent hours there swimming and sunbathing in the hot Bali sun. The spa was so special and we had incredible massages which left our mind and body relaxed and healed (the welcome and departure teas were soooo good too and such a nice touch). Definitely book the rate that includes the breakfast buffet! It is a feast and everything was so tasty and delicious! Thank you to the entire staff for such an AMAZING stay!"
1360,Highly recommended hotel,50,March 2018,"This hotel is beautiful! We stayed for 2 nights and from the moment we arrived we were impressed, firstly being greeted by the amazing and helpful concierge team who were happy to help with anything throughout the entire stay, then checking in with the lovely Ulis at reception who made sure we got our room almost immediately and had a lot of knowledge about the hotel and local area! Also a big thank you to all the staff who made sure we were aware of road closures on the day of our check out to make sure we had organised transportation at an appropriate time, this was a huge help and was very much appreciated üòÄ the hotel facilities were beautiful and free popcorn and fairy floss is always a bonus üçøthank you again to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful, we can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
1361,Didn't want to leave,50,March 2018,"Checked in and didn't like our ground floor room,not really pool access as sun lounges between you and the pool. Spoke to reception,all fixed,moved a high floor room overlooking the pool, perfect!
A lot of families and they are well catered for.
Location is ideal,walk or free shuttle to beach(private area on beach),quieter than Kuta,livelier than Nusa Dua.The best thing about this hotel is the staff!
Friendly attentive waitstaff,excellent kitchen staff,great food,great service."
1362,FANTASTIC!!!,50,March 2018,"My Husband and I stayed here and had an absolute ball!!! The room was extra clean and modern and our room was cleaned perfectly every time.
The Pool & Bar, heaven!!!
The staff throughout the Hotel were exceptionally friendly and attentive to all our requirements.
Widi & Gita, in particular who serviced the Buffet Restaurant were always welcoming and friendly.
Thank you so much for making our holiday a wonderful experience. Will definitely stay again!!!!"
1363,Great,50,March 2018,We stayed for 7 days and it was great. Even got cake the day of my birthday. The swim up pool var was a hit we used that alot. Wonderful staff nothing was to much toruble. Cant wait to come back again.
1364,2nd time stay at the courtyard but this time with partners family.,50,March 2018,First time I stayed at the courtyard by Marriott May 2017 I made this hotel the place to purpose to my now fianc√© the lovely hotel staff filled the room with rose pedals that day I will never forgot what you guys did for me . So I Came back in March 2018 with partners family to show them what we have experienced. Awesome place later this year I will bring my family. And shout out to WIDI(breakfast staff) always welcomed me with morning breakfast. That man deserves a promotion. He made me and my extended family feel like we had known him for years. Marriott you have won me over again . Thank you so much
1365,Not family friendly,10,March 2018,We arrived to fighting staff waited an hour to check in. Walked around and found it not pusher friendly. Also kids club is only free for 2 hours then you have to pay. Pool beds are all busy impossible to get. We checked in to room and decided to check out immediately. We returned to the Padma and had the best holiday. Would not recommend to family‚Äôs
1366,Amazing staff!,50,January 2018,"Great staff who are extremely accommodating and welcoming. I felt really well looked after, especially when booking day trips and organising various transport around Bali. Highly recommend to all kinds of travellers. For our recent trip we were in a large family group and were well looked after by staff, both individually and as our large group."
1367,Amazing,50,September 2017,"We stayed for Two weeks in the Marriott in Seminyak,Lovely Hotel great pool and pool side bar. Food and cocktails very good also. We really liked the way they don‚Äôt use money or cards around the pool or at the restaurant everyone has to buy credit at reception so no cash or credit cards needed left laying around. Staff where very welcoming and the rooms where very clean and modern would love to visit again."
1368,My fourth stay--and GREAT as usual!,40,February 2018,"The staff is gracious and most accommodating. Rooms are clean and well-priced Breakfast buffet is excellent. Location is convenient to all of my favorite places in Seminyak and it's easy to get around on foot. Hotel has a regular shuttle to the main street and you normally don't have to wait too long for the next one. While breakfast is excellent, dinner meals leave much to be desired, Hotel needs a new chef who can actually sample the food from a guest perspective."
1369,Amazing stay for first time in Bali,50,March 2018,"Seminyak was the first stop my mom and I made on our trip to Bali. I heard of the Courtyard by Marriott through a travel blog and wasn't disappointed. The staff was amazing, rooms were clean and location was perfect(close to the beach, shopping and restaurants). We couldn'tve picked a better spot and can't wait to go back!"
1370,"Two weeks, Fantastic hotel",50,September 2017,"Very enjoyable stay at this amazing hotel by Marriott.

Friendly staff and very helpful with great service throughout.

Hotel was very clean and tidy and reasonably priced.

24hour room service was spot on and the food snd drinks we‚Äôre great.

Would highly recommend."
1371,Cool resort with awesome hospitality,50,March 2018,"Stayed for 1 night, wonderful stay. Hospitality at its best. Access to beach is 5 mins walking.

Great atmosphere. Breakfast was well spread . All rooms are pool facing . Some good eateries locates outside the hotel."
1372,"well-located, comfortable and fun",40,February 2018,"We had a really pleasant stay at the Courtyard Seminyak. Walking distance to most of what you would need in Bali but a hike to Seminyak Square if it's really hot. Equal distance to the main street for shopping and to Seminyak Beach so it was great for what we needed!

Staff were really nice and helpful and the rooms were clean, comfortable and well-equipped. Amenities were good and the pool was great in three sections - swim up bar, lounge area/quieter section and the childrens end.

Happy hour at the pool bar was great at the acoustic live music was a great addition to sunset drinks in the pool.

For the price, this is a great value hotel for couples, friends, family etc - probably wouldn't say it is honeymoon romantic but certainly for pretty much every other type of traveler.

I would stay again!!"
1373,Bali Holiday,50,March 2018,"Awsome place great value for money
great night banquets
poolside bar is awsome
Staff are amazing especially
Widi and Agik they went out of their way
Hotel is in perfect location
greek walk on the beach to Kuta"
1374,Relaxing resort,40,March 2018,"Stayed for a week at this great place. The staff are all friendly, obliging and very helpful which made the stay very comfortable .
The Pool Bar staff such as Ayu and Chinta went out of their way to make our cocktails really nice.
The Zanti spa massage was awesome and I regret not taking up the package deal 4 x 90 mins Balinese massages for Rp 126,000. Breakfast was amazing with so much variety for all tastes and everyday there were different things to eat. Yoga takes his job responsibilities very seriously and his friendly manner is a perfect start to the day.
At the Seminyak Kitchen the ice cream needs to be kept colder as it is soft. The red bean ice cream was yummy.
Hotel is in a good location close to beach,variety of restaurants, shops and the security check makes you feel safe. Keep up the good work Courtyard by Marriott."
1375,Exceptional Location + Friendly Staff + Luxury Pool + Free Shuttle!,50,March 2018,"Courtyard Marriott Seminyak ticks ALL the boxes! The staff were more than happy to assist you in anyway. Their smiles made you feel very welcome and special. The free shuttle to the center of Seminyak and beach was wonderfully convenient especially on those hot and sunny days. I also checked out the fully equipped gym, which was quite impressive. Highly recommend staying here when you're in Seminyak!"
1376,Excellent trip in bali,50,March 2018,"Excellent hotel, with excellent crew/staff.. Arini, narita, dewi and ayu the crew at Seminyak Kitchen are friendly, helpfull, georgeus ladies. Sulis and davin as a front office. Eva as a Security lady. Thank you for the service and nice to know them. Stay excellence. Nothing to corected. 4 thumbs up!!!"
1377,Safe and luxurious stay in Bali,40,February 2018,"I've stayed here in a pool view room during the second week of Feb 2018. Marriott means quality and what comes extra here is the very friendly and ever helpful staffs. What I've enjoyed the most is tasty food and a very comfortable and safe stay. The resort is very close to the beach. Fine shopping streets & the famous Bali night life is not far away from this place and the icing on the cake is they arrange taxi at a very affordable cost.
The pool and amenities are way beyond explanation and bring more swim suits and outfits as you are very likely to spend most of your time by the pool.
Breakfasts will fill you and keep charged with that extra energy required to experience Bali. The resort suits all types, but I recommend it highly for families and the lovebirds."
1378,Good hospitable hotel,40,March 2018,"It was a nice experience staying at the Courtyard by Marriott , Seminyak. The front office, restaurant and housekeeping staff was very friendly and hospitable. The rooms were spacious, and the pools were clean. The coffee shop had a good layout for breakfast? They even had a cocktail hour in the evening for an hour which we were invited to , which was a pleasant surprise. We used the Zanti spa at the hotel ,for a traditional Balinese massage, which was relaxing. The hotel is close to the Seminyak market area to indulge in shopping. Quite a few bars and lounges nearby to enjoy the nightlife too . The beach which was much nicer and cleaner than Kuta , is about 450 meters from the hotel ."
1379,Absolutely the best choice!,50,March 2018,"Absolutely, it was the best & right choice to stay in Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort. Room condition was so clean and great. Great location for water sports activities, shopping, eating out. But i could have great dining room service with pretty much reasonable price.
Super thanks for the all staffs & crews of the hotel. Thank you for Nice & gentle front desk manager(sorry, forgot his name), Mr. Herry, the kind staff in Seminyak kitchen!!
The biggest thanks to Priscillia!! Deeply thanks for your kindness and hospitality!
I used to stay in Conrad Bali as a Hilton Diamond Member but now i can say that i do prefer to staying in Courtyard Marriot!!"
1380,Luxury Stay,40,February 2018,"We stayed at this resort on a luxury escape package for 7 nights in a pool view room.
Our stay was fabulous the rooms are very comfortable, quite roomy with a lovely spacious bathroom. The pool was gorgeous to swim in as well as the pool bar. The staff at this hotel are exceptional always smiling and greeting you with a welcome hello and how are you today. The make the extra effort to know your name so they can welcome you on a more personal level. Security is great with having to scan your bags before entering back into the hotel. Buffet breakfast is plentiful with fresh juices everyday. Hotel is in a great location with mini marts close by to stock up your bar fridge I definitely recommend staying here."
1381,Suprised,40,February 2018,"I had a business meeting so stayed on site. Security is exceptional. Staff are very helpful and seemingly very well trained. Much better than some other places as expected at this chain. Property is huge!

Rooms are a little small, but clean and nice view of the pools."
1382,Visit,40,February 2018,"Good holiday hotel we had a deluxe room which was clean spacious and well appointed. The hotel had 2 good sized pools with plenty of pool side beds available the service was good and food and drinks were not vastly overpri ed. Breakfasts were very good with a wide choice of food available
Staff were pleasant and helpful and booked several restaurants on our behalf. Only downside you have to go through the security scanner each time you leave the hotel. The location was close to the beach and good for other facilities bars and shops."
1383,Amazing hotel with Stunning Staff,50,February 2018,"Few day spend night with courtyard seminyak feel so at home warm and comfort all the staff nailed it ,Security here are super friendly , Sila(hope not wrong spelling) on front desk so much helpfull gaving detail information during check in, as we enter lobby we welcome with grass garden and cozy pool bar area great place to chill out day and night, Hari and team doing very good job on pool bar making me refreshing passion mojito totally recommended, They serve best breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen international and local buffet totally awesome thanks to adel for making me great energizing juice , egg benedict always on my list for breakfast thanks to Dwi ,hery, Vincent and jessica you're so rock . Indah ,saih and Narita always spend time to serve me during my breakfast thank you anton and team for great hospitality. Room are so cozy , very quick respond from AYS housekeeping,, Thank you Courtyard Seminyak team make my holiday most memorable , can't hardly wait for next stay"
1384,Amazing resort,50,February 2018,"Stayed here 4 nights. Wonderful resort! We arrived early in the morning, we decided to snooze by the pool until our room was ready at about 1pm. We had a deluxe room on the 6th floor with pool views. Room was big and modern with a great balcony. The wifi was not the best I've experienced as it was falling in and out all the time and it was slow. But for checking emails and all the basics it was okey. The breakfast was amazing!! Probably the best hotel breakfast I've had in a long time. Big pools, they never felt busy. We mainly used the one closest to the pool-bar. Staff was amazing! Normally we book a villa in Bali, this was our first time booking a hotel and I was so amazed by this resort, we'll for sure be back!"
1385,Awesome pool,40,February 2018,"I first arrived and was told that I got an upgrade from city view to pool view, was extremely stoked about that as there isn't much to look out into the ""city"". However I can't speak for all the rooms but if you're in the courtyard side you will have no peace until about 10pm as there is a live band playing at the pool as well as a bunch of drunk Australians being rowdy. I didn't mind as I was rarely ever in the hotel room and only heard it for one night (I was there for 4 nights).

I only picked this hotel because of the size of the pool and it was awesome to lounge around."
1386,"Great Location, Well Trained Friendly Staff, Stunning Breakfast And A+++ Security",40,February 2018,"As soon as your car arrived , you will noticed that your safety is Marriott top priority, A 100% check on vehicle + a well trained guard dog saying hello.
2. Once in, you will experience friendly well trained staff at check in, welcome drink and popcorn -my girl loves it plus very high level of calm surroundings. From reception area to Pool lounge, staff make you feel at home.
3. Breakfast is certainly out of the ordinary and it is certainly the best I had ever seen so far in this class. Buffet spread caters for all types of meal diet, so many choices raging from asian delights up to european spread and a juicing section where one can pick the fruits of your choice for detox.
4. Room is very clean, nice pool view and quiet.
5. This hotel also provide a buggy ride for guest to the main road where it connects to main Seminyak shopping and dining restaurants. Great hotel location for travellers with children as it is located away from nightlife area / pubs.
6. F&B personnel Rie & Anton and many others which name I cant recalled certainly make my 2 nights stay very enjoyable.
7. What I would like see more on my next trip is more varieties of cooking style in your Sat Seafood BBQ. Perhaps showcase Indonesia cooking style /strength in using spice mix for preparing seafood (prawn, squid n crab) to grill instead of just plain western ""skewers"" and ""slice"" grill. Maybe you can try the banana leaf wrapped with your very own home made paste over charcoal /wood fire using whole fish,squid n crab. Or you can steamed mussels -haisyle, grill bigger prawn with your sambal
8. The Flower Crab that I had at the buffet was prepared in stir fried style/sweet n spicy sauce and the size was certainly not correct for this type of preparation. And to lump in mussels, prawn and crab all together stir fried with one type of sauce mix is certainly a lost.
Overall I will certainly be back again here and certainly will make it my home in Seminyak. Cheers.
Jimmy Khoo"
1387,Stunning luxury hotel,50,February 2018,"This is an amazing hotel. The location is great, close to many restaurants and busy streets. Inside the courtyard it feels like paradise, quiet and relaxing. The pools are large and warm and the poolbar has good drinks and food. The staff is incredibly friendly at all times. The breakfast has something to offer for everyone. The rooms are clean, modern and feel luxurious. I have nothing bad to say, I highly recommend it!"
1388,Penny is awesome,50,February 2018,I recently stayed with my daughter and it was wonderful. The staff are so lovely. We felt very welcomed by all but penny stuck out as extra special she took the time to remember our names. Also Debbie and ayo(?) in the kids club were amazing with the kids. Thanks for a great holiday.
1389,You can do better,30,February 2018,"I think you guys need to fix the floor planner.. The pool is nice, room is nice. But I feel something wrong with the floor planner just a bit messy in my opinion.. and there is still unfinished work around elevator area. There is no light there, look like an abandoned place when the rest of place just look nice. Its hard to find the room, put more sign or put more light in hallway.. I was thinking hotel with such a name would offer better quality for service and facilities.."
1390,Highly Recommended,50,February 2018,"This hotel was amazing and truly exceeded our expectations.

The location was great, breakfast and pool bar amazing, and customer service outstanding.

A special thank you to Ari from the concierge desk for helping my friends and I book our spa days, dinner dates and birthday requests.

Another thank you to Anton who was always a friendly face to see around the hotel.

We will definitely be back."
1391,"Great place, amazing staff!",50,February 2018,"We just spent a week at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak, it was a lovely hotel with large and modern rooms but what made the experience excellent was the friendly and fun pool bar staff.. a big thank you to Penny who looked after us so well. Miss you Penny!"
1392,Staff are absolutely amazing ...,50,February 2018,"This is our 6 th stay at The Marriott Courtyard and I try hard to find a reason to try another resort , however the Courtyard is so perfect we keep coming back .
Your staff especially Ali at the resturant is absolutely amazing . He went out of his way to help us with information . A massive ThankYou to him .
Ayu at breakfast has been consistently awesome for the last couple of years . She is so friendly and helpful it really makes a difference .
The staff at seminyak kitchen in the evening for dinner are exemplary. There was a dish that was served at the pool bar and as it was closed they offered to make it for us even though it wasn‚Äôt on the menu . That‚Äôs service , that‚Äôs the difference between this hotel and others.
We are a frequent traveler around the world and have stayed at the most amazing resorts even at 6 stars . However honestly speaking nothing beats the Marriott Courtyard and that‚Äôs due to your staff .
From speaking to Deby Sethani at booking to speaking to John Wolley the Manager of the hotel . Everything is absolutely perfect .
We have 2 more days here and will no doubt enjoy every minute of it .."
1393,Great accommodation and staff!,50,February 2018,"We recently stayed for a week with children and absolutely loved our stay. The rooms are clean and well presented and the grounds are beautiful. The girls in kids club were all amazing with our 1 year old and 8 year old girls, they will miss them all very much!! All of the staff looked after us so well, all very kind and friendly. Shout out to Penny working the pool bar every day! Penny made our stay that extra bit wonderful and we will miss her. Looking forward to seeing everyone again on our next visit"
1394,Disappointing,20,February 2018,"This Courtyard in Seminyak is a poor choice for travelers. While the location is OK, the ambience is uninspiring, the design is boring, and the style of this Courtyard Hotel is so dull. In fact, there is nothing ‚ÄúBali‚Äù about this 1970‚Äôs style hotel except for the maids and other hotel workers. It feels and looks like a mediocre and ordinary hotel one would find in any town in a mid to small size city around the globe.

There is a glut of available hotel rooms all over Bali. So many hotels are half empty and restaurants are often lonely. There are so many lovely and inspiring hotels in Bali that give you a clear sense of the special Balinese culture and style, why would anyone stay at such boring and ordinary Hotel with poor service.

Surprisingly, smoking is allowed (encouraged) as one finds ash trays all over the hotel. Breakfast buffet is tiresome, staff are unconcerned throughout the hotel, and quick to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to guest requests.

This are so many incredible hotels in Bali, why stay at a less than ordinary hotel."
1395,Amazing!,50,February 2018,"I can't remember how many trips I've made to Bali & stayed in Seminyak. This place is by far the best. Located close to the beach and the most amazing sunsets, close to all sorts of restaurants & bars & close to shopping. Staff are incredibly friendly & helpful. Breakfast is simply amazing. Rooms are very clean. Make sure you opt for pool view. You cannot go wrong @ Courtyard by Marriott!"
1396,Top Class Hotel in Great Location,50,January 2018,"This is a great great hotel. It was relaxing from the moment we pulled up at the lobby. Great check in to get things started. Great rooms with superb bathrooms. Pool facilities are excellent, pool bar is lovely with nice food on offer for bites during day. Breakfast is exceptional. Really liked everything about this hotel from start to finish. Staff could not do enough to help. I would recommend anyone to stay here. Its fantastic value to top it all off."
1397,Amazing Stay,50,February 2018,"From the moment you get out of the car you are welcomed into a big family. The resort is amazing and the staff are so friendly. It's my first time to Bali and I cannot fault this place.
From the Seminyak Kitchen staff to the cleaners to front desk and everyone in between, all have been so welcoming and friendly making sure our stay is perfect. Definitely coming back!"
1398,Fantastic stay,50,February 2018,"This was my 2nd visit to the Marriott, the staff here are absolutely exceptional, they cannot do enough for you, breakfast and dinner was beautiful and the pool area is lovely during the day, location is so central and close to the beach and all the local shops! A must stay!"
1399,Well equipped hotel with everything you need,50,February 2018,"We had an awful experience with a villa in Bali and had to quickly find a hotel. Hotels in Bali can get tired and outdated however this hotel is amazing. Clean, friendly staff and the upkeep of the gardens, rooms and common facilities is incredible.

Would definitely recommend for a family or a couple who just want a quiet place to chill."
1400,Superb hotel,50,September 2017,"This was our first time in Bali and wasnt quite sure what to expect, the hotel its self is lovely,check in was speedy and when we got to our room it was better than we expected with the added bonus of a cake as it was our anniversary.
The room its self was really comfortable and really clean, the housekeeping came daily and also in the evening.
Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they were all really friendly, especially the security who we had a real laugh with.
The breakfast is out of this world, never had so much choice, the only other time we ate at the hotel was at the pool bar a couple of times which was also good quality, my husband loved the what the truck at the main entrance.
It had a great atmosphere in the day and in the evenings, not too noisy either, and they had some really good singers in the evening.
We only had a week as were travelling to Borneo an Kuala Lumpar but will certainly return to Bali and to this hotel.
Thank you Courtyard for a wonderful holiday"
1401,Ideal hotel in Seminyak,30,January 2018,"The hotel is positioned a little out of the 'main' buzz of Seminyak near the square, however close to the beach (not that you can ever swim in the water unless you want to get yourself wrapped in plastic).

Check in was smooth, our room was ready on time. Housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired, with our sheets never changed once in a 5 night stay, toilets not cleaned, and the room being very average for a 5 star hotel.

Having said that, the wifi was reliable, and breakfast was downright superb.

What made our stay, was the staff. The kitchen staff were the most cheerful, upbeat people I have ever met in a hotel, and their cheerfulness really set a lovely pace for our day.

Tony at reception was a pleasure to deal with when we encountered some unrelated problems during our stay. A big thank you to Grant Young too- who showed that management of hotels can still be empathetic and genuine.

I was surprised by my family for my birthday at the pool bar. The entertainer on the night whose name I unfortunately cannot remember was such a talented musician, who sets the scene for the hotels buzzing pool bar to perfection.

I Made Adi Wirawan, the assistant pool bar manager is an absolute asset to the Marriott name, and I hope he is recognized for his exceptional management of the pool bar. He is a perfect example that under the right management, a hotel which is otherwise lackluster can really excel, and leave guests with positive lasting impressions."
1402,Best Hotel Experience by far!!,50,February 2018,"We stayed for 9 nights at the hotel. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were always warmly greeted by wonderful staff. The security coming into the hotel is top notch and made our stay feel very secure and safe.
When entering into the room we were given exactly what we expected from the photos. Our room was just by the poolside which gave us easy acess to their pool facilities.
Their restaurant, Seminyak Kitchen, was great. We had breakfast their every morning. The variety of food was great along with the quality. The staff make a great effort to know your name and ask about your stay which made us feel really welcomed. We also tried their themed dinners which was also high quality.
The crowd we found that stayed here were couples and families, no loud partygoers.

Our plan for our holiday was to be relaxed and we can confidently say this was achieved.

We would highly recommed this place to anyone.

Thank you Courtyard by Marriott!!!"
1403,Fantastic Hotel And Best Choice in Bali,50,February 2018,"Just like the tile I say ""Fantastic Hotel And Best Choice in Bali""
Good location, nice food, gorgeous waterfall pool and pool bar!

Besides those equipment, I have to say I love all of Courtyard Seminyak team.
They act just like family and always offer warm caring.
There is nothing to better than warm greeting and caring while you stay in hotel.
In addition, thanks for room upgraded to one bedroom suite. The room is comfortable and have beautiful pool view.

1404,Fantastic Stay,50,February 2018,"This hotel is one of the very best I have stayed at in Bali.

I can‚Äôt fault a single thing.

Rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.

The swimming pool was very big and had a quieter area and a more atmospheric area near the swim-up bar, depending on what you feel like.

Breakfast was also great, with a great variety of options.

Location is also very convenient. It‚Äôs close to LGBT nightlife and the best restaurants and bars of Seminyak, and also near the beach.

The stand out for me was Zanti the Retreat. This is a spa experience not to be missed. The professionalism and attention to detail is second to none. The aesthetics of the spa are stunning, peaceful and high class.

The staff throughout the hotel are polite, friendly and helpful.

Couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Definitely will be back."
1405,Love this place üòç,50,February 2018,"Second time staying in courtyard Marriott Seminyak.I have recommended to all friends and family. Nothing is too much trouble for staff who are probably the friendliest I have ever encountered.
Pool, Beds,food are wonderful.
Hendra at the pool bar makes a wicked Cosmopolitan and always has a smile. Muliana and Indra in the restaurant were great as was the barista that made a great coffee and handsome boss man that would make a great son in law with my daughter pinky. Unfortunately I have forgotten their names. We used the shuttle up to shopping and restaurants often and to the beach also when the rain stayed away I do wish that would pick up more often from the private beach as it is a very hot walk back to the hotel if you miss the 2 hourly pick up taxis don‚Äôt come along the beach path.
I have reviewed the amazing massage at zanti spa attached to the resort seperatly. Well worth a couple of massages don‚Äôt bother with a cheap sandy one on the beach.
All in all you will not regret staying at courtyard Marriott Seminyak- 5days was not enoughüò©"
1406,Heavenly hotel,50,February 2018,"We stayed here for a week with our 2 kids. This hotel is superb for families! Amazing service, friendliest staff, great facilities and beautiful rooms. The location is perfect and the staff accommodated every request without a hassle. We can‚Äôt rate it highly enough!!!"
1407,Back to Bali,50,January 2018,"Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for the Australia Day long weekend.
The hotel is always consistent with friendly accommodating staff offering good service.
Rates are reasonable and hotel is only a short taxi ride from shopping and restaurants.
Hotel restaurant offers something special every evening with Saturday's Seafood platter and Sunday's roast both very popular for guests.
John and Grant are always found walking around the resort interacting with guests which is unusual in a five star hotel."
1408,Superb Hotel.,50,January 2018,"Visited Bali in January, 2018, and stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak. It is a superb Hotel with superb Rooms and a minutes walk away from the Beach and one of the Best Breakfasts had , the staff is super efficient and helpful, also very close to the shopping square. Would highly recommend it to all travellers, certainly value for the money and extra too and especially the Rooms facing the Pool.
üëåüëç"
1409,Consider this resort for your next holiday,50,August 2017,"We recently stayed at the Marriott and had a terrific holiday, we stayed in a pool access room and whilst this didn't guarantee seating out side our room we didn't get up that early, there was always plenty of poolside access . The swim up bar is fabulous! The rooms are spotless the cleaning staff do a wonderful job in the rooms and around e pool. The staff are really friendly, breakfast is amazing and there is a high level of security when accessing the resort. Terrific location and amazing access to facilities for Aussies taking the late flight home! We had a mix of couples and singles holidaying and had a wonderful time!"
1410,Refreshing stay,50,December 2017,"This is my second visit to this resort, and safe to say won't be my last either. Once again every one delivered the 5 star service that i've always enjoyed at this particular resort. Everyone starting from front desk service - Ulis, Anna, Kesawa and Hendra from pool bar and everyone in the breakfast room did extremely well to make sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Everyone looked for ways to better themselves in their service to their guests, and this was vividly evident in the way they presented it. The place is kids friendly as well as so many activities for all age groups. Room was always clean and presented well. Amenities were always complete and 2 room service everyday was something that we enjoyed tremendously. Grant the manager did well in interacting with guests on a personal level, which made me appreciate staying at the resort even more. All the staff were extremely friendly and always looked for ways to make sure guests' needs were met at all time. Everyone at this resort deserves a good pat on the back for all the hard work they put in. I would strongly recommend to stay at this resort for its many pluses. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the 5 star service in the very near future."
1411,Good service and new facility,40,January 2018,"Was here on a business trip but ended up being the only few in the hotel on such purpose. Most of the guests were tourists, but the good thing is that the facility is new and well kept, quality of food is great and the location couldn't have been better."
1412,"Super stay at Courtyard by Marriott, excellent service.",50,January 2018,"Room - Excellent
service- excellent
general ambiance - very good.
location - very good.
Restaurant/food - excellent, esp breakfast spread was super.

Guest relation officer Prascilla was always there to meet us with a smile, very efficent and took great care of all guest..

Highly recommend for future stay, value for the money charged."
1413,Amazing Services and Friendly Staff,50,January 2018,"This is our 4th visits to Courtyard by Marriott, once again they always delivered. From the day we arrived we were welcomed with smile by the friendly and accommodating front desk staff. And of course head chef Patrick and Mr. Anton from F&B were amazing and friendly staff Dwi, Gita and the staff from dinner service Mr. Sudiartja have made us felt welcomed and also being spoilt with free dessert from the Chef. And finally, many thanks to Grant Young for assisting us with booking and made sure that all of our requests were taken care for. ""This is great hospitality!"""
1414,Beautiful,50,January 2018,"The hotel is situated at hot spot of shopping and near to all go to places

The breakfast spread at this hotel is the finest I have seen ever and their staff at the breakfast area are so so cool and always serving with a smile

Their pool is huge and has bar also in it , their free WiFi is at great speed

They have a food truck at the premise which serves the best tacos

They have their own private beach area marked and a cart leaves you there and picks you up at designated time slots

Simply the best hotel and all vantage point places are just a 10-15 minutes taxi drive away"
1415,Excellent hotel - Super stay in Seminyak!,50,January 2018,"Every once in a while only comes by a hotel stay which is glitch free completely, no complaints at all -perfect hospitality, upkeep,food, attention to guests and details. Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak is one such stay. I‚Äôm a member, but I happened to book via the agent, so could t earn rewards, but even besides that the place gave me nothing to complain or worry about. I was greeted by ever smiling faces everywhere - entrance,reception, restaurants at the buffet breakfasts, during a la carte dinners, the housekeeping staff. Everyone is helpful and always nice to you. The pool is mighty amazing with a pool bar as well. They play lovely live music every evening as well, so do try to stay and watch. They also run a buggy service to two three places, including their private beach, so do make use of the service. They also informed us about the reservation tie ups they have with Motel Mexicola and the very popular Potato Head. Please use their front desk if you‚Äôre planning to go to these places - you can get two free drinks and there is no hassle of the reservation since they will find you a table.

The room service and a la carte menu is also fairly priced and the food is very tasty. The breakfast buffet is extensive, huge selection of fruits, choose your ingredients smoothies, breads, Indian and Indonesian good, continental fare, breads and even ice creams. There‚Äôs also a live counter every day making something new and freshly served every morning. Despite being a vegetarian, I was pretty happy with the food."
1416,Perfectly located,50,January 2018,"At few minutes of the airport, this hotel is perfect after a long flight from Europe. You don't have to across all the island.
Food is amazing (specially the breakfast), the pool is beautiful, and the room are very nice, very clean, thanks to the great housekeeping!"
1417,Highly recommend this hotel !,50,January 2018,"This is our 2nd time out of 3 times to Bali we have stayed at this hotel and will not be out last .
The hotel staff are all very friendly and would do anything to make your stay as enjoyable as possible .
Hendra and others from the bar staff are fantastic and are a credit to Marriott courtyard .i highly recommend you include breakfast in your booking .
The buffet breakfast is delicious with a vast variety of Balinese , western , fruits , bacon and eggs ( omelette and other varieties of eggs cooked as you desire by chefs)
Very clean rooms , pool is great .
Close walking to most parts or cheap taxi rides to main Area (20000 r) don‚Äôt get ripped ask for meter on Taxi or just wave 20000 to take you to the square .
Cannot wait until we return next year ."
1418,Great safe secure hotel,40,January 2018,We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights. The security was great priority with searching dog on the check in. The pool was great. The food at the restaurant was fabulous never disappointed us night after night. The breskfast is so so mostly the same every day. The worker are so friendly and kind. The room service is a bit let down. They never replaced the tea or coffee that had been used. They did not replace the shower cap but they threw away the old one. Location is good with little shops around.i will be back to this hotel.
1419,"Outstanding Courtyard Marriott with Incredible Spa, Gym, and Restaurant",50,January 2018,"This Courtyard Marriott has everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel plus more. I paid around 1,250,000 IDR per night this time around. Last time it was around New Year, a popular time for tourists and cost between 1,300,000 IDR and 1,750,000 IDR.

First the standard stuff: The rooms are great with really comfortable beds, good sized LG flat screen TVs, fridge and complimentary bottled water. the air conditioning works well. I have stayed at this hotel multiple times. I'm a Marriott Rewards member, and every time they have upgraded my room. I've had a deluxe room with pool view balcony, deluxe room with pool access terrace, a king suite, and even though I travel alone, one night they upgraded me to king and double bedroom suite which was amazing and would be great for families. The deluxe room with pool access terrace is my least favorite, as it feels a little less private, it's noisier, and you can't lock the terrace doors from the outside so you can't really use it as the entrance and exit to you room, which would be really convenient. After I checked in, Priscilia took great care of me. She accompanied me to my room and as a returning guest, she wanted to know if it was the best room I had stayed in. I was honest and said well actually last time you were short of rooms so I was lucky and got upgraded to a suite. The next day when I extended my stay by two days online, Priscilia saw my extension and without prompting upgraded me to a suite. That small gesture will make me return again in the future.

What makes this hotel really stand out are the Spa, Gym, and Restaurant.

The Spa: My first ever balinese massage was the best massage I've ever had and was from a masseuse named Ita. When I returned to the hotel for the second time, Ita wasn't available, so I had Hari who was also exceptional. Based on this it appears that the spa are very selective on who they hire. I was made to feel very comfortable, and the treatment lasted the entire 60 / 90 minutes. Marriott Elite Rewards members also receive a discount on massages from the spa (15% for silver, 20% for gold, and 25% for platinum). The spa and the great discount was a major reason for rebooking this hotel).

The Gym: Best hotel gym I have seen in Bali. Equipment seems brand new and it's all quality Life Fitness Equipment. In the pictures all you can see is the CV equipment, but they have free weights, a couple of benches, a Life Fitness cable machine with a variety of attachments, and a Smith machine. It has everything you need to workout your entire body. They should include pictures of this on their website instead of just showing the CV equipment as it could be a real selling point to some customers. The only thing I'd like to see added to the gym is a Concept 2 rower. It's also open 24 hours.

Restaurant: The Seminyak Kitchen is amazing.

Breakfast: The breakfast buffet offers just about everything you could imagine for breakfast. There is a juice squeezing / pressing station, where you can choose what fruit you want and watch them juice it infant of you. After a few experiments, apple, banana, and carrot was my favorite mix. They cook eggs to order (including eggs benedict), they have a wide range of breads, pastries, an alternating station which serves crepes or other daily special, hot food buffet with everything including real baked beans, sausages, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms for a Full English Breakfast, and on the other side a selection of noodles, rice, and other Asian breakfast staples. The breakfast buffet is free for Marriott Rewards members which is a great perk.

Lunch / Dinner: The restaurant has a great menu with a wide variety of options. I've had the nasi goreng, the steak sandwich, and the chicken club sandwich. All three were excellent. The french fries are just okay, I'd recommend substituting for their thick cut chips which even though are more expensive on the menu they substituted for me with no additional charge. As a Gold Marriott Rewards member I received a 20% discount off food. Even without the discount, the price is very reasonable, the discount just gave me the incentive to eat their even more often. The service in the restaurant is great. Two servers in particular provided excellent service, Emile and Widi. Emile gave me some great menu recommendations based on my preferences, all of which I enjoyed. He also took the time to give me some useful tips on what to do and see during my time in Bali. Widi was very attentive as a server in the evenings and made the best juices when it was his turn to man the juicing station in the mornings.

Pool: The pool area is nice however the pool seating is rather limited, and people seem to claim the beds really early. The swim up pool bar is a nice feature and I like it that they actually play music at good volume as this adds to the fun atmosphere. At night they also being in live performers who cover popular songs.

I've stayed at this Courtyard Marriott and the one in Nusa Dua. Both are excellent places to stay. This Courtyard Marriott has the edge in regards to the spa, gym, restaurant, and rooms. Nusa Dua has the edge in terms of the swimming pools, pool seating, private beach (via shuttle), and would be better suited for families or people wanting a more peaceful and relaxing vacation. It's also a little cheaper than the Seminyak Courtyard Marriott. Both Courtyard Marriotts fit in with the vibe of the surrounding area.

I have no hesitation in giving a five star recommendation for the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak Resort."
1420,Holiday,50,January 2018,"We both had a wonderful trip and on arrival at the Marriott we were welcomed by the beautiful staff working there, especially Arini, Gita, Widi Agik, Yoga & all the other people not mentioned.
I would also like to give appreciation to the efficient cleaning staff who looked after our room which we found to be very spacious and comfortable. We loved the design and architecture of the Marriott and we would recommend a stay here to anyone."
1421,Great Hotel,50,January 2018,"Stayed at the Courtyard for two weeks and had a great time there, it was a good base for the area.

Pros - fantastic staff, great breakfast and they allow you to take away Latte's etc, free beach shuttle available, really good walk in showers in rooms, good wifi and free

Cons - could do with more storage space in the rooms - very little wardrobe and drawer space so we couldn't unpack properly."
1422,Awesome hotel with wonderful staff,50,January 2018,"We visited Marriott Seminyak last April, and this was our second visit to this property. One of the most attractive draw of this property was the attentiveness and friendliness of the hotel staff; the check-in process, restaurant service, and cleaning crew were delivered on a 5-star hotel level. Priscillia recognized us immediately and she had our room ready as soon as we arrived. The suite was spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet is one of the best, and the breakfast cook delivered my omlette even though I was forgetful on both mornings. This is a family friendly hotel, but the surroundings are both peaceful and uncrowded. This hotel is staffed with international staff, and we had wonderful conversations with Grant Young from Australia who warmly greeted the hotel guests. The staff thoughtfullness is a great asset and we would definitely come back to this resort on our next visit."
1423,Our Home away from Home in Seminyak ‚ù§Ô∏è,50,December 2017,"We are currently planning our next stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak after having recently returned from out third stay in 3 years.
Each time we arrive at the hotel we have a sense of coming home. Since 1985 we have been regular visitors to Bali & have stayed in many different locations, experiencing varying accommodation types and we are honestly able to say that our experiences at Courtyard Marriott rank right up there with our BEST.
We love everything about the experience, but the most OUTSTANDING aspect has to be the STAFF. On that note many are still working there since our first visit - indicating a very desirable workplace culture which means happy staff & happy guests.
John as Manager heads a wonderful team which leads by example. Section Managers are often seen tending to the day to day work alongside their team members.
We love the food, ambience, pool, rooms and great mix of guests from all over the world. Nothing is too much trouble. The breakfasts are outstanding & the evening meals reasonably priced & delicious with specialty theme nights a highlight.
Amongst the outstanding staff special mention must go to - Grant, Muliana, Ayu, Auli, O'May, Esa, Sutiarja, Antara, Ali, Dwi, Roy, Helmi, Tony.
VERY HAPPY GUESTS ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1424,Awesome ‚ô°,50,January 2018,"I always satisfied Marriott Hotel, But Especially marriott seminak gave us awesome experience. Friendly staff, good location, clean linen bed and room. Even though breakfast taste is really nice.
They offer free shuttle buggy anytime. Nice way to go to seminak center. Thanks Marriott, thanks priscillia ^^
And= Suddenly I had to go to hospital in the midnight. Hospital is located only 200mter from Hotel. Dont worry. And roomservice taste is great too(+reasonable price)"
1425,Modern and Fun,50,December 2017,"This resort was stunning. The pool area was amazing and the atmosphere even more so. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The staff were so friendly and helpful, made you feel at home. The breakfast buffet is delicious. Western foods and Asian cuisine available on either side. The fresh egg station and pancakes and waffle stations were awesome. The whole resort was busy but not overcrowded so there was an atmosphere but it wasn't so noisy. The location was probably a 7/10. A bit too far to walk to the main strip of Seminyak, however a taxi there was a short ride and cheap. In saying that, there were definitely many restaurants and spas and other services like dry cleaning available close by so you could walk there. I wouldn't call this resort romantic though. It is for couples and families who want to be free and loud if they please. It is vibrant and a mix of people of all ages. If it is silence and calm you are after, this is not the place for you. We enjoyed ourselves so much we extended our stay. I would definitely visit this resort again."
1426,Amazing service and great location,50,January 2018,"The service here was incredible. They paid attention to every detail and helped in any way possible. The food was quite good as well and very affordable. It was easy to walk to shopping and dining areas of Seminyak because you are in the heart of it but the hotel also has a shuttle that will take you to the main areas and the privately beach area they have (which was actually very small). The pool was really nice and the rooms are nice as well. Overall, great stay. I‚Äôd go back!"
1427,Xmas Hols,50,December 2017,"Great hotel, good location, nice pool area. Rooms are really nice and clean. Good breakfast and food for lunch & cocktails - complementary buggy handy to get to the main road of restaurants / bars. Lovely staff. Would recommend!"
1428,Luxury escape,40,November 2017,"We were supposed to be there for a week but ended up there for an extra 3 nights due to the volcano erupting.
We were very impressed with their staff. They were wonderful! Our concierge spent hours on the phone to the airline company and would come find us to update us with proceedings. The office staff would offer us ice tea and/or a hot chocolate drink. I noticed the staff going around the pool one day giving away icy poles to the guests. The kitchen staff were wonderful too. Nothing was too much trouble. The complementary breakfast was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the array of foods. There was a great selection of cold pressed exotic fruit juices each morning as well as cereals, hot Asian dishes, eggs, pancakes & waffles and all the usual breads, cakes and pastries. There was ice cream you could help yourself to as well. We would often go to the restaurant for lunch or dinner as they would have specials on from time to time or discount if it was raining.
The hotel did not have a spa bath or jacuzzi and there was a shortage of drawers & cupboards in the bedroom but there was hanging space & shelves in the ensuite."
1429,"Clean, good location, minutes from the beach.",50,January 2018,"Kind staff, comfortable, clean rooms, near the ocean and the alive chaos of touristy Bali.
They have an amazing breakfast buffet that can be included as part of your stay, and the food is very good.
They have a lovely pool area and a nice happy hour/bar venue.
I particularly enjoyed being five minutes from the beach and being able to walk to various shops and restaurants.
The hotel manager, John Woolley, is doing an excellent job with this place.
It‚Äôs not traditionally Balinese, but a good choice, especially for a family."
1430,God location!,40,October 2017,Walking distance to the beach. very clean and lives up to the name. staff is friendly and cooperative. breakfast spread is also good. multiple options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. would not mind staying again.
1431,5 star staff,50,January 2018,"Stayed here with family and loved every minute of it!! Very clean hotel, delicious food and friendliest staff! Especially pool bar staff Hendra and Arca!! They are a credit to your hotel, kids loved them as they are very friendly and entertaining, cannot thank them enough for making pool time fun for kids and relaxing for Mum and dad!! Would highly recommended hotel to everybody! Location is very good for Seminyak area, complimentary buggy service is handy to get you close to all the hotspots!! Will definitely come back!! Thanks Marriott for your warm and wonderful hospitality!!"
1432,best hotel I've ever stayed in Bali.,50,June 2017,"best hotel I've ever stayed in Bali. yes, I mean it.
got the most complete facility, clean & comfortable bed room, tasty foods (God, I wish they could open the breakfast buffet all day hahahahaha), helpful+top hospitality & very well trained staffs."
1433,Good bones needs vibe ..,40,January 2018,"This is classic Marriott..staff well trained and pleasant, good clean no drama hotel. Rooms are good size clean and tidy if a tad Spartan.
The highlights are totally superb breakfast nice decor and if u sit outside away form the kids very pleasant. Nice gym big enough and well fit out. WiFi seem less and excellent. The point's that need work were mainly the lack of a true bar. The pool bar was a bit rough and ready and closed early even though guests were asking. Supposedly the restaurant upstairs had bar access but nobody went. Silly little thing but highly annoying no hooks in the bathroom apart from inside the toilet...very odd.

Lobby needs a vibe."
1434,Return visit,40,January 2018,"Returned here with my kids after a great holiday here last year . The only thing missing was the daily water aerobic class that I enjoyed last year . The massages in the spa were more enjoyable this year as I couldn‚Äôt hear the music from the pool. My 5 year old loves the kids club and happily went daily . Be aware that they charge extra for activities usually 6 aud
Food at breakfast is amazing
I will definitely be back again
Thank you"
1435,Excellent Hotel,50,January 2018,"This was an excellent Hotel, top grade but very relaxed. The staff and facilities were top class and the Restaurant food, especially breakfast was great. Rooms and bathrooms were of good size and well-appointed. Most rooms had a nice balcony or outside sitting area that was comfortable. The Hotel is 5 stories with inward-facing rooms overlooking the Pool and gardens. Inward-facing rooms are good, as aerial views of Denpasar area are not very attractive. The only, slight, downside, for us, was that the Hotel basically shut down from about 9 or 10pm ie there was no entertainment or ""social"" areas, after that time. The Hotel is well located about 400m from Seminyak beach. Everywhere is near shops and Massage Spas in the Denpasar area!"
1436,Absolutely Fantastic,50,January 2018,"My wife and I and our 4 year old son stayed here for 6 nights in Jan18. We absolutely loved it.
When we arrived for check-in we were greeted by an enthusiastic young girl with excellent English. We noticed that most of the staff seemed to be very well educated and were really engaged in their jobs. This added to the overall positive vibe at the hotel. We were offered a beer, tea or water as a welcome drink while we checked in. Our room was not ready when we arrived (about 3.20pm) and before we had time to think, the girl checking us in said she‚Äôd take us to the pool bar, get us a complimentary cocktail each and 2 share plates while we waited ‚Äì I was pretty impressed. Our room was ready about 40 minutes later and when we got in, a complimentary bottle of red wine was waiting for us.
The room was so clean and to a very high standard. So many hotels in Bali seem to have rooms that are a little run down and tired, but not this one. Everything was perfect. Beds were soft with luxury linen, bathroom was quite sizable and the balcony furniture was comfortable and of excellent quality.
The breakfast buffet was excellent. A good selection of Western and Asian foods, cereals, pastries, bagels and breads. Fresh juice and a special food that changed every day. The buffet was really clean and food was to a high standard.
The pool is nice a big, and the service is great. They give you a buzzer so you can call for service and the food and drink is very reasonably priced.
The only downside is that the hotel is a bit further away from Eat St than we would have liked. Its about a 25 minute walk, but they do have a shuttle that takes you part of the way, or a taxi is only $1.50 or so.
We loved it and would definitely stay again."
1437,1st Class,50,January 2018,"What a wonderful Hotel! Our first stay at the Courtyard but certainly will not be our last...
My wife & I along with our 2 kids stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for 10 nights, It was one of our most enjoyable stays to date in Bali, everything from the room, the pool, restaurants, location & staff was simply first class.

Unfortunately as a member of a rival hotel rewards program where I am fast approaching platinum status, I may now never get there- Once you go ""Marriott"" you can't go back.

I have signed up for the Marriott rewards program and look forward to further stays in their establishments where ever i may travel including another stay at the courtyard in the coming months.

Special mention to employee G.Young, an absolute asset to the company and a fine example of how to execute hospitality on such a professional level."
1438,A new Favourite,50,January 2018,"This was our first stay at the Marriott and we were not disappointed! We travelled with our 10 and 13 year old so the location was perfect for all of us. We got interconnecting rooms which was a blessing because girls have/ buy a lot of stuff . So that in its self made my husband and I very happy with our own space.
The staff were amazing the rooms were great and clean, breakfast, pool , fairy floss oh and the coffee and breakfast and the buggy.Oh so many things. It is definitely a great place for families with older kids as well .It has now become our new favourite .We will definitely be back in 2018.
Thank you to all the staff for making it such a great family holiday."
1439,Would be the best stay for family,50,January 2018,"This resort-styled courtyard may satisfy many visitors in Seminyak, especially for family and couples. Buggy car was really helpful for hanging around this area, and signature pool was perfect to enjoy full of time in this resort."

Special thanks to I Made Muliana -Food and Beverage Manager- for his kindness and hospitality. We could passe amazing breakfast time.
I'm planning a bali's trip in March, so will definitely return again soon."
1441,Best experience of my entire life,50,January 2018,"My boyfriend and I just got home from our first ever holiday together and we‚Äôre already planning our return to the Courtyard Seminyak.
Our room was beautiful, staff were extremely helpful and friendly, the food was exquisite and the pool was perfect. This hotel is truly faultless and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with our choice to stay here.
What truly made our trip unforgettable though was the friendships we forged with the pool bartenders, Penny, Hari and Hendra are three of the most wonderful people I have ever met in my life and their kindness never ceased to make my boyfriend and I smile. If you‚Äôre thinking about staying in Seminyak you must stay here and order yourself a ‚ÄúBerrybull‚Äù in the pool bar, you will not regret it."
1442,"Second visit, AAA++ üßöüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüå¥üå¥üå∫",50,January 2018,"The staff at the Courtyard Marriott are always so hospitable in every single way, I can‚Äôt speak highly enough about how they always go above and beyond to cater to your every need. Even when our holiday didn‚Äôt go as planned we still knew that we were in a safe, beautiful place staying in the courtyard Marriott. The restaurant has incredible food and we ate at the meat shop 3 times for dinner in our 8 night stay. The rooms are always clean and housekeeping ensures everyday that it stays sparkling, which we were very appreciative of.

A special mention to some of the beautiful staff who have made our stay special, not only this time but the first time around back in March 2017.
Anna, Penny, Chinta, Hentra, Ayu and Wika thank you for your wonderful service and for making our holiday that extra bit special for us. We look forward to seeing you all soon üôà

Ps any melbournians looking for a wonderful hotel, at a decent price with food that could rival our home town look no further than the Courtyard. They always make you feel like you are home üôèüôèüôèüå∫üå∫üå∫üå¥üå¥üå¥üíñ"
1443,Most Amazing Coutyard we have been to,50,January 2018,From the amazing customer service to the excellent food we were totally impressed and would definetely stay again. The staff and management are to be commended on their professionalism and attention to customer service. Very clean and comfortable accommodation.
1444,Amazing Property,50,December 2017,"In December, I had the pleasure of staying in Bali at the Courtyard Marriott Resort Seminyak for 12 days. From my arrival till my departure, the staff ensured that my holiday would be nothing less than spectacular. This property follows the Marriott essence of hospitality, treat others as you want to be treated. From the welcoming drink, to the upgraded suite (Gold Elite), to the pleasant fruit plate (I fell during my visit and the staff sent me a beautiful fruit plate with condolences), to the grand breakfast buffet, to the very late check out....this property and staff represent the very best of the Marriott brand.

I had the pleasure of meeting the front desk manager Ramu. We had a pleasant conversation that seemed more like someone I had known for a very long time. Uliys was extremely friendly at the front desk. And of course, John who leads the entire staff as GM was engaging and genuine in his approach to guests.

I travel all over the world and this property is perhaps one of the best I've stayed at. I look forward to my stay again in the very near future.

P.S. Location is spot on"
1445,Friendliest staff at a Marriott property. Foerever smiling!,50,January 2018,"I was personally welcomed by Grant Director of Guest Relations; check-in was a breeze. I had a great room facing the pool.
Puji, at the Spa juggled schedules and managed an appointment for me. The two staff at the Beachside club were most accommodative and made the visit there superb..
All staff are so well trained, they greet you at every occasion.
A scrumptious breakfast buffet with staff making custom juices and with great enthusiasm. Just an awesome place for a good break. Great coffe bar at breakfast!"
1446,Well Trained Staff-Personalized Service-Beautiful Resort!,50,January 2018,"I have stayed here many times and the staff is well trained and provides excellent service. I checked in Jan 7th and Duty Manager, Bagus left me a nice card and chocolate/fruit platter in my room. Very Nice personalized service!!!!!!!!!- The bar and restaurant at this hotel are all excellent and I recommend the morning breakfast as it is amazing! The location is very good walking distance to everything you need."
1447,Great location fantastic hotel wonderful staff,50,January 2018,"Having just spent 2 weeks at the hotel with my family there aren‚Äôt enough words to describe just how amazing our time here was ! From the moment we arrived until the time we left our stay was incredible, from the cleanliness of the hotel to the wonderful staff with a huge shout out going to the lovely Dea who made sure all our needs were met and made our stay all the more enjoyable. Also to Ari who also looked after us so well. Would definitely recommend staying at the hotel."
1448,What a piece of paradise,50,January 2018,"Came to this hotel only 4 days ago for a ten day stay with a friend. Was greeted by friendly staff. We were treated like royalty. The food, drinks and staff are all amazing. Especially one waiter called Chinta. She accommodated to all our needs. So friendly and helpful. I recommend anyone to come to this place to stay."
1449,"Amazing service, premises and food",50,January 2018,"The courtyard has been a fantastic place to stay. Its premises are beautiful and clean and the service has been very good. Their attention to detail providing things like complimentary popcorn, fairy floss and ice blocks definitely stood out. A lovely bartender Chinta was also very accommodating and made the effort to get to know us and provided fantastic service. All in all we would definitely stay here again. The only complaint we would have is the prices are quite high and comparative to Australian prices but this is reflected in the quality provided."
1450,AMAZING,50,December 2017,Stayed in Courtyard Seminyak in early December 2017 with hubby and two teenagers. From the time we arrived the staff are the friendliest you will find anywhere. Breakfast is fabulous and has something for everyone. Could not fault this hotel or the staff and would highly recommend. A special thanks to staff Yoga who made our stay extra special. Will definitely return.
1451,"Great Hotel, Lovely Staff",50,January 2018,"We are staying here for 7 days and this is a lovely hotel for couples wanting to still have an upbeat and fun environment for their time in Bali. Room is modern and clean...very nice. From the concierge to the bar staff, everyone has been very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. At the pool bar, Chanti is excellent and super attentive. She has made our stay and poolside experience very special. Would definitely recommend this hotel"
1452,What a place felt like I could stay forever,50,January 2018,We had a ball here treated like kings and queens it is the dedication of the staff that makes it even better. You are in a great street 500 m from the beach and minutes from all the best restaurants and good spas for the everyday massage. But it is John & Grant and their staff that make this place special after the third day ever staff member knew our name. Very special place. Great breakfast and great food. Even the room service is fantastic meals in your room in 15 mins. Great place for a holiday we will be back again and again.
1453,"great location, staff, amazing pool bar and rooms with a view",50,January 2018,"Great hotel in a top location. 10 min walk to beach - la plancha, W hotel. The free buggy covers most areas of interests in Seminyak or atleast gets you close enough to walking distance of some of the best cafes in bali. The rooms are great. The breakfast has a rotating menu everyday and has a great spread. The pool bar is big and the happy hours has some genuine savings. 300mtrs to Bali Spa which was our favorite during this stay. Found some great places to eat a walking distance from the hotel - Gateway of India, Nalu Bowls, Shelter Cafe, Koop Roaster and Cafe."
1454,Good location with a lovely pool,50,January 2018,"Been here twice, last year in May and just last week in January. It was a great way to start my new year. My friends and I love to stay at Courtyard cause they have a nice room, very clean, great location and the pool is lovely. They have a huge parking lot beside the hotel and short cut access to jl kayu aya. We got the same room which facing the parking lot, hopefully one day we can get a room with pool view. Chilling at the pool was my favorite thing to do there, beside sunbathing, i can also order food/snacks or drinks, but last time it didnt go well with my white russian, perhaps it was too much ice, but the 'perkedel jagung' and caesar salad were good. Thank you Chinta from Pool bar and Nyssa from reception for always being nice and helpful during my stay. Will come back again for sure."
1455,Amazing stay,50,January 2018,"Stayed for 3 nights here with my family..
Muliana and Grant made a really nice first impression on our first arrival..
Overall excellent service from excellent staff such as Ayu and Chinta from pool bar. Yeani, Anton (he is even remember i always stay at JW Marriott Surabaya), Indah,Sutiarja, and Ayu from breakfast restaurant. The buffet is excellent, you pretty much got everything you want to start your day (thanks to Chef Patrick).
You really need to consider this hotel for your holiday."
1456,Saying Thank you!,50,January 2018,"My partner Adrian and I spent 10 nights at the Courtyard hotel and we cannot speak highly enough of our stay.
Everything was first rate - the service, the rooms, the amazing food and the facilities.
However, what really made our time at the Courtyard so special was the genuine warmth and kindness of every single person that works at the hotel.
We were both made to feel a million dollars.
Both myself and Adrian would like to give a special thank you to Omay the masterful chef whose delightful treats always put a smile on our face , and Widi and Suiti whose service at breakfast was second to none.
We cannot recommend the Courtyard strongly enough and if you ever go to Seminyak you absolutely must stay in this hotel. You will not be disappointed and you won't want to leave."
1457,Family holiday,50,January 2018,"Such a wondeful stay the facilities are amazing great location, good food and wonderful service. Chinta who was one of the staff members she was very accommodating, much like all the staff.
Really great place for families."
1458,"Modern, clean, friendly",50,November 2017,"Loved this hotel. It was new and clean, with each room either leading out onto the pool or having a balcony overlooking the pool and gardens.

The staff members were amazing - so friendly and helpful! My postcards that I left at the front desk to be posted all arrived at their intended address (thank you concierge) and we were greeted with a smile by cheerful staff members at breakfast every morning. Big kudos to the lady on security who apologised that there were no umbrellas for us to borrow when we were going for a walk, then ran after us down the street to give us one that had just been returned. Security was great - no problems with the metal detector at the entrance, just happy the hotel thinks about safety.

Breakfast was delicious, with a broad selection of Asian and Western options, plus a juice bar, egg station etc.

Overall we had a wonderful trip, couldn't fault it!

Tip: The taco truck out the front (called 'what the truck') is inexpensive and delicious if you are looking for a cheap & quick lunch or dinner."
1459,Incredibly Happy,50,January 2018,"This hotel is simply amazing! The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming and nothing is ever too much trouble. They make you feel like royalty!
The food is to die for, especially the breakfast as the chefs are culinary maestros, the rooms are spotless, spacious and well appointed and the facilities are first rate. They have an outstanding gym and the pool is looks like something out of a Hollywood movie.
I cannot recommend this hotel strongly enough.
It is, by a country mile, the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in."
1460,A great place to relax,50,December 2017,"A resort that ticks all the boxes. The rooms were a good size and well appointed, the breakfast was very good with interesting food for all nationalities. The staff were very friendly and always helpful. The Spa was exceptional and great value."
1461,Lovely hotel but it needs to change a couple of things.,40,January 2018,"This hotel deserves a very detailed review. First of all, it's a lovely place.
1. Go for a half board staying, the food is amazing, the staff members are nice and lovely people. Dui (I hope I am writing his name rightly) is an amazing guy, served us two nights, we liked him very much. There was a miscommunication about our half board but they quickly solved the problem.

2. For our first night, they gave us a room with 2 beds instead of a king size bed, which was not good and only on the second day it was sorted out. Only because I complained at the reception. Not good, but again, amended by the manager.

3. As we had this problem, the manager came to us, gave us a financial compensation, 500.000 IDR to spend at the hotel, plus a ball of tropical fruits, and a sweet letter apologising, which was really thoughtful.

4. Services: amazing service by the poolside, amazing facilities, staff members are quite friendly, courteous, and polite.

5. Uber is allowed to operate in Indonesia. However, the hotel made an official statement about using this service, saying that we should use the blue taxi service. We saw lots of messages advising/ threatening tourists near the hotel made by taxi drivers. It can be very dangerous to call an Uber in Bali. Be aware of it. I think the hotel shouldn't take part of it and advise guests to not take Uber, it shows you chose a side, you shouldn't do this.

I'd like to register the most important thing: the security scrutiny.
I know Mariott has been through a few problems in the past with terrorism, so the hotel had to set the bar high when it comes to keeping the guests safe. However, I believe it has to be done smoothly, it's not an airport, it's not a prison, and coming from a very tiring flight and having to deal with dogs sniffing our suitcases, and x-ray scanners... hell boy! it can be a bit scary. It has to be asked gracefully, in a very gentle way, otherwise, people can feel threatened, and it can be intrusive and invasive. We had to go through the scanner everytime we got in the hotel. Every time!
An advice: Why won't you send an email to guests close to their arrival, saying this so they will be expecting to go through this sort of checking? They would be better prepared. I clap my hands to the female security member who did exactly what I am suggesting here, she was really nice, asking how was our day, what we were up to, so the experience wasn't bad.

Overall, great hotel."
1462,Courtyard stay,50,January 2018,"Great stay. Such a beautiful place with all beautiful people. Amazing staff. They are the nicest people. Always have a smile on their faces. Food and beverages are amazing. Was worth ever bit
Chinta was a beautiful staff member that served us"
1463,One of a kind,50,January 2018,"Awesome resort with amazing state of the art facilities! Most importantly, I cannot speak any higher of the staff - the most welcoming and kind people. They go well and truely out of their way to make you feel right at home.

Shout out to Chinta at the bar; very approachable and went truely above and beyond with her service to keep us all hydrated üëç‚úÖüòä"
1464,Courtyard Marriott Bali,50,January 2018,"Amazing facilities and lovely staff. Be sure to ask for Chinta at the pool bar, she will go above and beyond to make sure you receive first class service. Will definitely return to the Courtyard Marriott on our next trip to Bali."
1465,Second visit to this hotel,50,January 2018,"We stayed at the Marriott in November 2016 for 5 nights and had a great stay here. The resort is lovely and modern, the pool is great and the location is very close to the beach.

We came back to bali in Jan 2018 and even though we decided to try a new hotel this trip we came back to the Marriott for lunch as we had enjoyed it so much last time. The staff were all lovely, Chinta provided especially great service. The food at the pool bar was delicious and I am sure we will come back once again on our next bali trip."
1466,Amazing Dinner,50,January 2018,"We had the best dinner experience here. Our meal was not only wonderful but our waitress ARINI and her friend Widi and Adi W. Made our night amazing with their friendly and wonderful service. Definitely we will be back !!!
Valerie xxx"
1467,AMAZING,50,January 2018,Amazing hotel - really nice staff with excellent food and service. You feel very safe and have all the comforts you need. Best breakfast I‚Äôve seen. We will definitely be back. Special thanks to Chinta for your great service!
1468,"Love this hotel - friendly staff, delicious varied food, great pool and spa",50,January 2018,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our week long stay at Courtyard and were very impressed with the hotel considering its affordable price.

Staff - everyone was so friendly and always said a big hello, even the security guys at the front. There were also plenty of staff members around so service was never far away. Chef Omay in particular was so lovely - he remembered my name each morning at breakfast and my favourite noodle stock! And Dhiya who helped clear dishes at breakfast always had such a nice smile on her face. But everyone was great. We also really appreciated that the management team had a real presence in the hotel and got actively involved. We were served coffee by the GM who I assume was pitching in to help on a busy morning, and I also saw him help a guest carry a peak down some steps. Small touches that go a long way with the guests and staff I‚Äôm sure.

Food - breakfast was always a highlight of the day. From a vegetarian‚Äôs (me!) point of view, I was spoilt for choice. My favourites - fresh tropical fruit and fresh juice in delicious flavours, plus Omay‚Äôs noodles of course (often BOTH noodle stocks on offer were vego). Also loved the hot Asian food section - while dishes rotated, the glass noodles, mushroom in pepper sauce, steamed greens and vegetable fritters were highlights. Egg station, waffles, heaps of vegetable sides like roasted potatoes, baked beans, roasted tomatoes, roasted mushrooms, a big bakery section, yoghurt, cereal... and a rotating special such as churros! We mostly ate dinner out but we did order a couple of snacks off the menu and they were really good - loved the eggplant slider.

Cleanliness - I felt like our room was always cleaned to a high standard and one morning I also found a missing earring on the bedside table which the cleaner must have found and put there!

Amenity - we spent heaps of time by the refreshing pool and loved the different sections including baby pool, relaxed pool, and the top section near the bar and the music. While in peak periods it was impossible to get a lounge or even a beanbag, I saw staff hurriedly fetch additional lounge mattresses for the grass area to ensure everyone had somewhere comfortable to chill. Between us we had four massages at Zanta Spa on-site and they were super relaxing and affordable. Also used the gym a few times to work breakfast off and although it‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs got the basics you need for a holiday workout. We could hear music and noise from the pool area from our room but it was always promptly turned off at a decent time each night. NYE was particularly loud but as soon as it struck midnight, it went quiet which was appreciated.

Location - I personally prefer to stay at this end of Seminyak as it‚Äôs a bit quieter but still with plenty of options if you don‚Äôt want to go far. The hotel buggy will take you to either end of the street, a taxi will cost 30-50,000 rupiah into the main part of Seminyak but to be honest, we always walked it - 15 minutes along the beach and a bit longer weaving along the roads.

I‚Äôd definitely stay here again. And do yourself a favour - when you‚Äôre next in Bali, go visit the dog refuges in Ubud (BAWA and BARC) and cuddles the pups."
1469,Amazing!!!!!!,50,January 2018,"This place has everything for all ages, we took our 8 month old daughter and was so happy. The staff are the friendliest in Bali! Especially Chinta, Dea, Agik, Maria and the rest of the bar staff.

They made our holiday the best ever."
1470,Always an enjoyable stay,50,December 2017,"Service at this hotel is excellent, My one piece of feedback would be to have ice machines available on the floors. Ordering Ice from room service sometimes took up to half an hour and when you're in Bali and in need of a drink.... that's a long time to wait!"
1471,"A nice hotel in Seminyak, Bali",30,December 2017,"We stayed in a two bedroom suite. Great staff, Excellent service. Nice spacious rooms. We reached the hotel around 9 AM and they gave us relaxing room till our suite was ready. Then why I give 3? Well, this is a Marriott Property that prides itself on high standards but the breakfast is a joke. There is absolutely nothing for vegetarians. Even the bagel is horrible. Most items supposedly vegetarian had fish sauce in them. Absolutely nothing so I had to eat outside for even the breakfast, which was included in the package."
1472,Christmas holiday,50,December 2017,"Chef Omay the best üëçüèª we can request menu for breakfast and also Pak Anton, very good service! They also provide good quality of service and room! Very clean, compact and comfortable place to stay.. stayed here everytime I went to Bali üëçüèª"
1473,Good hotel and fine service,40,December 2017,"We where 5 days there in end of December.
- Room are good size, we had 2 rooms connected and could have our youngest one in our room extra room.
- Gym is fine in the hotel is is not everywhere that you can find good gym.
- Breakfast is very good with many chefs and fresh juice. But it is little bit tight room and noisy.
- We tried the restaurant during evening time and it was very good, good service and good food.
- Pool bar is not nice. People smoking there so it is not nice area to have food, then you have to eat the food at your sunbed close to the pool. Same in the evening to have glass of wine I do not like to be sitting between people smoking.
- All service from people was nice there but sometimes order took long time."
1474,The Place Where Everyone Is Welcome,50,January 2018,"Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort is a wonderful hotel which offers the best service quality I have ever experienced in a hotel before. The customer service is spectacular, the friendliness of staff is exceptional and the ambiance is astounding. This hotel is definitely a place you want to look at if you're coming over to Bali."
1475,Great location !,40,December 2017,"I checked into the Courtyard Marriott with a friend for a quick getaway. The hotels exterior looks extremely good and the rooms are excellent for such a price. I must say I was quite surprised that I was getting such reasonable quality for the price point we were paying. The service was also good by the staff. The only thing I can fault is the view of my room was the view of the garbage pile, but otherwise I would highly recommend this place."
1476,Perfect relaxation,50,December 2017,"I had such a great stay at this hotel! It was extremely close to the center, so easy to get around if you don't want to spend the whole day at the hotel itself, which is actually very tempting given that their facilities are top-notch. Everything from the hotel room itself, to the swimming pool and bar, to the wide array of breakfast foods selection, to the gym and spa was just fabulous. This hotel is perfect if you're looking for a place to relax and release some stress, especially as a family since they also have a kid's area."
1477,ALWAYS GOOD TO BE BACK!,50,June 2017,"It's always good to be back to this hotel. The hotel is walking distance to Seminyak beach and all of nice hang out places in Seminyak. The breakfast was excellent! I was so impressed by the juice corner. They offered you so many healthy fresh juices! It was just AMAZING! The room was also good, the staff were friendly. Will definitely stay at this hotel again."
1478,Great stay!!,50,July 2017,"I had the best stay at this hotel! Even by myself there were so many people to make me feel at ease. All the staff were incredible especially Hendra at the Pool Bar, his friendly positive nature made me feel at home!"
1479,The best staff,40,December 2017,"The good

‚Ä¢ Extra friendly and helpful staff.
‚Ä¢ Staff will always go the extra mile for you, no matter the difficulty.
‚Ä¢ Good bed

‚Ä¢ Good water pressure
‚Ä¢ Toilet with bidet seat cover
‚Ä¢ Good internet
‚Ä¢ Good breakfast including Abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables
‚Ä¢ Fresh-Juice bar with the largest variety of fruits and vegetables I ever saw.

The not so good

‚Ä¢ All rooms including suites, have shower only and no bathtub. The exclusion are the 2-befroom suites, but there isn‚Äôt too much of it available.
‚Ä¢ There is no executive lounge.
‚Ä¢ This is not really resort, but not business hotel either."
1480,Amazing Pool Bar Team,50,November 2017,The pool bar team at the Marriot are brilliant! They make the best cocktails which you can even enjoy whilst relaxing in the pool! I would like to mention Hendra as he makes such a good cocktail and creates a great atmosphere for his guests at the bar!
1481,Nowhere better to host an event,50,October 2017,"Working with a local organisation we hosted an event at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak & were so thrilled with teams passion & ability to execute on a brilliant event.

1485,Could be The Best Place to Stay in Bali,50,December 2017,"We recently spent a week at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak, and I must say that rarely have I been as pleased to part with my money. The level of service and detail is truly spectacular. The staff is extremely friendly, professional, and attentive. The room was big enough for 3 of us, me my wife and my 9 months little girl. While the bathroom is really large and nice. The hotel is only a stone's throw away from Seminyak Beach. I for one intend to stay at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort on all future trips to Bali."
1486,Amazing stay,50,December 2017,Everything about our stay here was great. Facilities are awesome and the kitchen/food service spot on. Drinks by the pool were nice and in a great location for Seminyak attractions and bars/restaurants. Would recommend staying here!

1505,Best value for stay in seminyak,50,August 2017,I went there with my family and it was a lovely experience. We wanted a chill stay and that's what we got. The breakfast at the hotel was our favorite. The swimming pools were great especially with the floating beanbags..definitely a good spot to hang out. Cannot wait to come back.
1506,Most Comfortable Stay in Bali,50,August 2017,"I've been to a number of Marriott hotels and courtyard marriott seminyak is one with the most comfortable stay experience.

At the lobby, the atmosphere was breezy and airy, although there were visibly a number to people checking out. The check in process was seamless as they already have previous records of my preferences and in no time I was in my room.

The room was comfortable for a standard room size no thanks to the simplistic and clever design of the room, making it felt roomier and more spacious. The room came with a balcony that face towards the swimming pool, perfect for a quiet night chill out.

Perhaps what makes the stay memorable was the friendly service from the staffs. They were very helpful with the local hideouts as they were within the hotel itself. They go above and beyond when I was rushing my breakfast. They offered to help with some breads for the roads, none of which is ever heard of at any other hotel I have stayed in previously.

All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali."

The pool was great as it was huge and there was a shallow one for children.
The breakfast offer many different varieties of food that was suitable for people every age. The room is was very big and clean, the staff were also very generous. Every time they made up our room, they would give loads of the wonderful smelling soap and refill of water. The in-room dining service was nice with a lot of food selection.

It ticked all of the boxes for great hospitality, friendly friendly staff, family friendly, great buffet breakfast, a big adult pool and a kids pool, wifi and comfortable sized rooms and showers; not to mention all the staff memorized our names and their smile when they greeted you made that little difference.
We loved spending time at the pool bar, Hari at the pool bar and his collegues accommodated us with amazing cocktails and some yummy chocolate milkshakes for my children without even asking them.
I would most definately recommend this place and especially if you want a family friendly and affordable resort.
Thanks guys and will be back again!"

1539,Just like coming home,50,December 2017,"This place is actually amazing. I can not fault it at all this is our third visit we have not been here for twelve months and the staff remembered our names. The pool bar staff are so friendly like Peni, Hendra, Maria and Hari. The manager Grant goes out of his way to look after you... it‚Äôs always a pleasure to stay here so much we hardly ever actually leave the hotel. Thanks again guys xx"
1540,Great place in the crowded Seminyak,40,July 2017,"What a great place and excellent service. Unique atmosphere and I really like the food truck called ""What The Truck"". Just 5 minutes walk to the beach and you can see the sunset over the Seminyak Beach. I would definitely stay there again."
1541,Great hotel and breakfast,50,December 2017,"Room was great and breakfast was nice, will be back to stay again.
i booked conecting room and they gave best view from our room - pool view.
Location near with many shops on camplung tanduk.
all staff was nice and excellent"
1542,Best experience ever,50,December 2017,"One of my best stay ever in Marriott. I felt really special from the check in until the Checkout. Big thanks to Ms. Septai she attended me to the room and explain everything about the hotel and appreciated me as a loyal customer to Marriott chain. Her presence and professionalism a d knowledge were remarkable.
The hotel facilities were amazing and the staff were friendly in all location. Definitely I'll come back and recommend this hotel to other."
1543,Excellent family holiday,50,December 2017,"I came to stay here in December 2017 with some family. Having been to Bali twice already, I can definitely say the Courtyard Seminyak Resort is my favorite hotel here, and my got-to place to stay on future visits. The staff were always warm and friendly, the food was rich and diverse, and the hotel's various facilities lent themselves to having a fun and relaxing family experience."
1544,"A really good value package in a lovely, well-located hotel",50,September 2017,"It's well worth keeping an eye on the Courtyard by Marriott's website for deals. Our stay worked out at approximately $200 AUD/night for 7 nights, including breakfast each morning, dinner one night, a spa treatment and one-way airport transfers. The location of the hotel itself is about a 10-15 minute walk to the beach, though the hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle bus to its own private section of the beach with sun loungers reserved for guests of the hotel. The hotel beach area has the added benefit of being secluded from the people who sell souvenirs to tourists on the beach- these sellers can be quite annoying after a while if you're trying to have a conversation but are constantly being interrupted.

This hotel is well-located within Seminyak itself; a lot of shops, bars and restaurants are within a 20 minute walk of the hotel (I didn't want to walk for much longer in the heat and humidity). For trips further afield there are plenty of taxis passing by the entrance to the hotel.

Our king-sized bed was incredibly comfortable and I had a wonderful night's sleep each night. The room had strong airconditioning too which was a welcome respite from the heat and humidity outside. Daily complimentary bottles of water were delivered to the room which was a nice touch as it's quite easy to become dehydrated out in the sun all day.

The hotel Spa is definitely worth a visit. Although Seminyak is full of Spas you really do get what you pay for and there is a noticeable difference in quality between the Spa at Courtyard and the roadside Spas throughout Seminyak. It's worth getting a massage, facial or body scrub (or a package of all three ifnyoure willing to splurge!) At the hotel Spa to truly unwind into your holiday. Do note that a Balinese full body massage is very much ""full-body"" so ladies expect your chest and bottom to be massaged. At the hotel so a they did ask ahead of time if massaging my chest and stomach was alright, which was a thoughtful touch and something I hadn't ever been asked about when I've had other Balinese massages. The hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating and were so understanding when I made a mistake about the time of my massage and had to rebook.

The hotel breakfast is buffet-style with a mixture of Asian and Western food styles. There is an omelette bar with omelettes made to order. As breakfast came included with our package we ate there most mornings but Seminyak has so many fantastic breakfast and lunch cafes and restaurants I would recommend not eating at the hotel each morning and instead finding a new place in Seminyak each day."
1545,"Spectacular service, can't wait to come back!",50,April 2017,"This hotel is beautifully designed, both inside and out, and what makes it an even better place to stay is it's excellent location and the wonderful staff. Whether it is the waiters, the cleaners, the security, or the receptionists, they all go above and beyond to ensure that every need of yours is met and to make your stay one that you will never forget. I'd like to give a special note of appreciation to Hendra, one of the guys at the pool bar - his customer service skills are absolutely spectacular, he really made my trip to Bali the best it could have been and is the reason I am re-booking with this hotel to come back in Feb. I can't wait to lounge around your gorgeous pool and sip on your delicious cocktails, the frozen daiquiris at happy hour are my personal favourite. You can't beat the Courtyard for it's chilled, modern and friendly atmosphere... I recommend it to all my friends. See you in Feb! :)"
1546,Great Comfortable Family Resort!,50,December 2017,"Nice location, at the end of the shops on Jl Camplung Tanduk so you get the best of the quiet as well as the shops/restaurants.

We had an extremely comfortable 1-bedroom suite overlooking the pool and an adjoining deluxe room for our family of 5. We booked a Garden view deluxe room but the hotel upgraded us to pool view so that we could have a connecting room. Having the small living and dining area made a big different as we took away food and ate in. Apart from 2 days of crappy internet connection due to an upgrade, we had no complaints with the rooms, both of which were well maintained.

The hotel facilities were excellent - huge pool which ran the length of the hotel in the courtyard. The Kids Club was also decent and reasonably priced, as was the Spa. We used all these facilities during our 5 night stay.

Food was decently priced - slightly more expensive from the street as you would expect but you would not think twice eating in after a long day out. The Breakfast buffet was also good - we stayed 5 nights and there were sufficient variations to make each breakfast interesting. Service can be a bit erratic at peak times, but nothing that a little patience can't fix!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would visit again."
1547,Not just a great hotel for holiday but also great for business,50,May 2017,"I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak in May 2017 for a business trip. I was a bit nervous staying in a resort hotel while doing important business since I had a high profile group (with personnel from 11 countries) with me. However, the hotel and its team, with no doubt, delivered an excellent professional service from the beginning until the end of our trip. The General Manager, Mr. John Woolley himself, was present the whole time during check in process to make sure that everything was running smoothly. When there‚Äôs a hiccup regarding the baggage transportation, he and his time had proven their strong problem solving skill by successfully solving the problem.

During our stay in the hotel, they accommodated every request we made with high professional manner. The group was very pleased with everything about the hotel and its excellent staff. The hotel is very well presented and clean. It‚Äôs a lovely place to come to after a hectic working day. I would especially like to thank Mr. Woolley for his time and warm hospitality. He came to join the group in the evening for some drinks and then took us to some great places and everyone really had great fun! It was such a memorable evening and every one of us remember it that way. It‚Äôs definitely an extremely successful official visit which Courtyard Marriott Hotel and its management team played an important role in it."
1548,The perfect stay,50,December 2017,"i loved everyting at the courtyard in seminyak, especially the combination of a casual feeling of the property combined with luxury and class. The breakfast offers such a wide variety of items and all comes with a outstanding quality. The staff is very professional and ever so friendly. Go for the sunrise yoga on the rooftop - its brilliant.
Oh and almost forgot the ""out of this world"" Christmas dinner Buffet. Counting the days until i come back again :o)"
1549,Amazing hotel for kids and friends,50,December 2017,"We went for few days with our 5 years old kids and couple of friends and had an amazing experience. The hotel staff is super friendly, the rooms nice and modern. The pool is the perfect place to enjoy great cocktails and also for the kids to play. They have a great kids club also. First 2 hours are complimentary and the rest super affordable
The location is perfect walking distance from shopping Area and restaurants"
1550,"Amazing vibe, friendly staff",50,December 2017,"The best place to stay in Seminiyak! Kids love the complimentary candy floss, popcorn and kids activities. While adults can chill by the pool, sip cocktails and superb DJ vibes.
Very comfortable rooms, well equipped, WiFi.
The breakfast is the icing on the cake - bagels, hot and cold choices.
My daughter is in love with the floating pool beds and x-box in the kids area. All in all a great stay every time!"
1551,Amazing pool staff,50,December 2017,"Hendra and Agus were amazing and so friendly. They were so accommodating to our needs and happy to help. They were always double checking to see if we needed anything but did not hassle. Also a great place to relax from the busy street life. I would highly recommend this hotel for families, couples and friends. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüç∏üëçüèºüå∏‚òÄÔ∏èüçπ"
1552,AMAZING pool service,50,December 2017,"What an amazing experience!
Pool staff are so friendly and very accommodating, food is served fresh and hot with very little waiting time and the drinks, there is so much variety and are delicious! Shoutout to Hendra and Arta who so far have made our experience amazing !"
1553,Bali holiday,50,December 2017,We stayed with courtyard last year and this is our second time here.. absolutely love it!!! We have recommended this place to several people! Thank you so much to Hendra and Wika.. see you guys in 2018 :)
1554,Holiday in Bali,50,December 2017,Our stay at Courtyard by Marriot has been amazing so far. The hotel rooms and pool is very clean. Staff have been great so far! Hendra and Hari have been the best bar staff we have had so far! They have been so friendly and so helpful with recommendations for places to see! I
1555,"5 star price, 2 star service",20,December 2017,"Although still a good stay, we just found for the price it was lacking some key things. The rooms are smaller than you think, the service is a bit hit and miss (some staff are great, some not so much). The room needed to be cleaned again once we moved in, there were pubic hairs in the bathroom. There was a good variety of breakfast food, the pool bar was good but I felt like I had to beg for service/attention. The hotel is situated in a good location with free shuttles to the beach and Seminyak. The security was a little excessive, they had a bag and body scanner at the door which is fine but the guards actually didn't take it seriously so I thought it was just a waste of time. We had to ask every time to get the room made, it just felt like they were under staffed. They didn't seem to have enough gym equipment either for the capacity they can hold and the gym room was not cool enough. Overall it was the staff/service that lets this place down."
1556,The best resort to spend Christmas,50,December 2017,Just spent the best family Christmas at the Courtyard. This was my second stay and I was delighted to be back. So many of the staff remembered my name and even how I take my coffee! Christmas Eve dinner was sumptuous and I loved the entertainment. Be sure to book a package including breakfast.. the spread is over the top.
1557,Nice place,50,December 2017,The hotel facilities are good. Nice Swimming pool. The staff is friendly especially Feby. He makes good spinach and cucumber juice for us early in the morning. It is also convenient to travel around seminyak from the hotel. We will surely come to seminyak and stay in Marriot.
1558,Christmas dinner with new friends.,50,December 2017,Amazing 5 course dinner. Couldn‚Äôt eat it all and they gave me my leftovers in a takeaway container. I would highly recommend it. Service was excellent! The head chef came out to check that we enjoyed our meals!
1559,Fantastic Family Retreat During Early December '17,50,December 2017,"Highly recommended for families or couples. Courtyard Seminyak was a fantastic retreat for my family (2 adults, 2 kids (3&4 yrs/old)), but it also seems like a great escape for couples looking for a centrally-located, clean and modern hotel.

The staff and management were exceptional - all seemed to enjoy their jobs. Breakfast was especially nice, and the free golf-cart drop-offs in town were a creative idea that my children enjoyed as much as the pool and the beach! Special thanks to GM John and the front-desk staff who made us feel at home and kept their spirits up in spite of the dip from Agung-related flight cancellations.

We look forward to coming back."
1560,Home away from Home,50,December 2017,"We love this resort. We‚Äôve stayed here twice now and it won‚Äôt be the last. The facilities and rooms are excellent, well presented and most importantly, clean. But the best part about this hotel is the people. The staff are amazing. So friendly, always willing to help, great with the kids and a lot of fun. Special mentions for Hendra, Al, Agus and Yoga in the pool bar (and the Oreo Frappes), Arin in the restaurant and Debbie at kids club. Ayu also gave my wife a great massage. The resort is in a great central location and only a 5 minute walk to the beach. They also have a golf buggy that can drop you back off at nearby places. Another great stay. We‚Äôll be back."
1561,Bar,50,September 2017,"Ayu, Alit, Kesawa, Darsana, Daya, Dewa and the team at the bar were brilliant every night huge shoutout to the crew at the bar. They would stay open past the hours shown and could have a really good chat with them to. From Mitch lukas dan Chris ben"
1562,Cool poolside bar,50,December 2017,"Check in at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak was smooth with helpful service, we needed Dr to attend to our daughter, this was quickly arranged by the check in staff - Well done.

Went to the poolside bar for a bite food was well prepared, funky vibe, great music and friendly service by Chinta.

Worth a visit to the Courtyard when in Seminyak."
1563,Best hotel,50,December 2017,"My partner and i had an amazing time here, best hotel ive ever been in! Your made to feel welcome and at home here! The staff are above and beyond when it comes to customer service, my partner asked Dede Yoga where he could buy a pac of smokes around the hotel and Dede just told my partner to wait here and he went out to get the pac of smokes for us because it was raining! That was amazing!! Also the pool bartender Hendra was so kind and very fun to talk to as he knew every good spot in bali to check out, made us feel very happy! We aslo had at the main bar Chinna Maria who was so sweet and held our bag behind the bar to keep it safe while we swam in the most beautiful pool! I will deff be comming back here! Thank you to all the staff for being so amazing!"
1564,Just gets better,50,November 2017,"Returned to Bali in November to visit family and after our last experience at the Courtyard Marriott we would not consider another hotel. Great location,excellent food, friendly efficient Staff, easy walk to the beach, shopping and restaurants. The Hotel is beautifully maintained, rooms are excellent and we will most certainly visit again in the future."
1565,Courtyard Marriott - my choice of stay in Seminyak!,50,December 2017,"Once again, I'm a happy camper having stayed in Courtyard Seminyak. A very special thank you to John Woolley, the GM, for the warm welcome. He's such a down to earth guy and is always seen making sure things are in order. I've never ever seen a bitter staff in this hotel, I now know why! Thank you for the beautiful fruit plate sent to my room Diandini. She's in charge of housekeeping and she's definitely a keeper for the hotel. Thanks to Tony for my easy check in, always a pleasure to meet him. And Wahyu for the rides in the buggy and there was one other sweet guy who gave me a ride to the beach on the buggy, I'm truly sorry I can't remember his name. And to Maria at the pool bar! The Courtyard Seminyak is not just another hotel, it's my home away from home. I've made so many good friends during my stays here, and will always be back to pay you guys a visit. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
1566,Great stay at Courtyard Marriot!,50,December 2017,"I've recently stayed there for 3 days and we had the best time at Courtyard Marriot!
Our room was spacious and very clean with a pool view.
The breakfast at the restaurant is one of the best in Bali and all their staff are Amazing.
We loved chilling by the pool and enjoying all the facilities they provide to their guests such as Gym,table tennis and spa.
The location is perfect and they can take you to the beach which is 3 mins away.
Thanks to all the staff who made our stay so memorable and we hope we come back soon :)"
1567,Once again amazing,50,December 2017,"Our 2nd visit this year and courtyard Marriott didn‚Äôt fail to deliver . Easy checkin and francisca at the front desk remembers my name from the point go and was courteous and helpful with everting that we required. The pool staff were great though due to the volcano the occupancy seamed low the pool bar was always a great place to be , Penni , Chinta and the rest of the team were great and ensured that the drinks and food were flowing . On checkin the rooms we were allocated rooms unfortunately had a smell of damp but on letting the front desk know the immediately without hesitation changed our room and the head of housekeeping ensured that our new rooms were up to scratch ,Dian Putri was was very helpful also sending us fresh fruits to the rooms . The taco truck was shut which I believe was due to low occupancy , this I feel should always be open . The concierge team consisting of Hardi , ari, adi, Ross and the rest of the team were great enduring that the buggy was always available to drop us at the various points and if we ever needed any guidance they were more then willing to help . All in all a great stay at a great hotel. Also I must add that there is visible presence of management all over the hotel who were always asking if we were ok and what they could do to assist . We will be back for sure . Also I must add that the hotel had a great guest and his family by the name of Mateo who was very friendly and livened the place ."
1568,Party of 29 all with amazing memories,50,November 2017,"My wife and I stayed at the Marriott in June to assess whether it would be a suitable Resort for our family and friends to stay at when they came over in November to celebrate my wife's 50th Birthday. In every aspect we were impressed and didn't hesitate to make the Marriott our resort of choice.
The resort has an awesome buffet breakfast, great pool, professional and friendly staff, always very clean through out and is perfectly located in Seminyak.
In our time of need the management went over and above expectations to help make our stay more comfortable.
Our friends and family, many travelling to Bali for the first time, were as equally impressed and thoroughly enjoyed their experience.
Thank you to Grant, John and staff for making this a wonderful experience."
1569,Best trip to Bali,50,December 2017,Had an amazing time at the Courtyard Marriot in Seminyak. Over our 10 day stay here the staff at the pool bar made us feel so welcome and were incredibly accommodating. In particular thank you to Hendra and Chinta for making our holiday so special and full of laughs.
1570,Friendliest staff that leave you smiling.,50,December 2017,"I stayed here for a week and enjoyed every day. I wasn't disappointed with any of the amenities. The gym was better than any hotel gym I've been to, simple but everything you need for an effective workout. The buffet breakfast is above and beyond as far as quality and selection. My friend Widi made a point to ask me how things were going every morning. The cascading pool layout is really cool with attentive staff like Chinta always making sure you have a cold Bintang to drink! Nothing really negitive to add, I had a great stay"
1571,Excellent Marriott hospitality goes above & Beyond,50,November 2017,"I‚Äôm writing as a very satisfied guest at your hotel under difficult circumstances. I would like to comment how pleased I was with the service provided to me and my family by entire hotel staff. Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Bali ! I have to say that we received the most friendly welcome, and that none of your staff could have done any more to make us comfortable - in particular, do please pass on my thanks to your chef for providing us with a anniversary cake.

I wanted to express my appreciation for the superior service I received during my stay at your Hotel. In particular, ""Amy(Guest Relations)"", ""Tony(Front Desk)"" and ""Mira(Breakfast)"" were very helpful and deserve a great deal of praise for their excellent customer service.

Besides the points mentioned above, the hotel has true elegance and class without any ostentation. Service is experienced and deft and always polite. Rooms across all the floors are incredibly quiet. The decor of the hotel has great style. The Breakfast room is a dream--large, comfortable. The breakfast buffet is a concession to international requirements, but is done better than any I have experienced anywhere! I saw the chef several times checking it. The service is out of this world.

I would especially like to thank you for your time and effort leading up to the volcano event occurred during our stay and to ensure all the guest we were able to feel safe and were answered & attended all the time.

I would have no hesitation in using your services again or recommending your hotel. I wish you all the very best for the future.""

Regards,
Umesh & Sanjeevani"
1572,"Great Service, Staff, and Breafast!",40,December 2017,"My girlfriend (30) and I (31) were very impressed with our stay at the hotel because of the thoughtful and friendly staff on our two separate stays at this hotel at the beginning and end of our vacation in Bali. They made us feel special and welcomed from the moment we walked through the door and as we waved goodbye to the airport. And we had many memorable interactions with Priscilla who we felt genuinely cared about how we were doing and that we enjoyed every minute of our time in the hotel and in Bali.

The facility are clean, modern, and top notch. They may not position itself as a luxury resort but it does feel like that when you're there.

The buffet breakfast in the morning is AMAZING. Probably my favorite thing just because I""m such a breakfast person. Options from around the world are offered and you can have pretty much anything made-to-order like it was your own kitchen. I was surprised at how inexpensive the breakfast was too which means it's a better value than you're going to get anywhere else in my opinion. It's pretty clear that the hotel understands how important it is for you to fuel-up for your Bali adventures and they want to make sure you are full of good energy to start your day.

The only reason I'm giving the hotel a 4 instead of a 5 is because the high prices of some of core services offered such as the shuttle to the airport (7x the price of what we could get in Grab mobile app) and massages in the spa (4-5x the price of what we could get walking 1-2 blocks down the street). I would have gladly paid 2-3x above market price through the hotel just for the convenience but the 5-7x mark-ups forced me to look elsewhere which was disappointing."
1573,Great stay!!! Will be back 100%!!!,50,December 2017,"We had a lovely stay here and couldn‚Äôt speak more highly of the place. The buffet breakfast is great and has everything you need. We opted to not include it as part of our room as we wanted to dine out some mornings. On that note; the golf buggy can take you up to eat street in Seminyak or up to the corner of Legian St. this is quite handy and the staff are more than happy to do this for you. We stayed in the poolside room which was easier to get access to the pool chairs. On that subject, we were really happy to see that the staff actually remove people‚Äôs belongings that have been there too long (usually 30min limit left un attended). Finally a hotel in Bali that makes It fair for all people to get pool chairs. We really dislike all the typical types who claim the deck chairs and don‚Äôt come back till after lunch or later sometimes. Great work team!!!!! Keep doing this as it makes it fair for all people to enjoy the hotel and the pool. Especially in high season.
The rooms are perfect for Bali. We have stayed at many different hotels in Bali and the rooms are great at Marriott. Has everything you need. Could maybe add some more hanging rails in the bathroom area for clothes or wet gear during wet season.
All the staff were lovely. Some stand outs that we dealt with were Agus, Widya, Budi among many others and the GM John was a really nice guy and cares about the quality provided by the hotel.
Hopefully see you again next year."
1574,Great Hotel and Service,50,November 2017,"Recently enjoyed a week long stay at this hotel. Our room was very comfortable and everything we needed was supplied including a view over the pool which added to the relaxing atmosphere.
We were greeted at breakfast every morning by friendly staff who ensured we had coffee served to the table and offered friendly conversation as well. We were certainly spoiled by the many choices of dishes on offer.
Location is great and within walking distance of many shops, restauants, cafes and its only a short walk to the beach.
I had a couple of sessions in the Zanti Spa which is a beautiful indulgent experience at a reasonable price.
The pool bar provides tasty snacks and has a good vibe."
1575,Ordinary Staff Doing Extraordinary Work.,50,December 2017,"ORDINARILY staff, doing EXTRAORDINARILY work. We couldn‚Äôt fault about Marriott Courtyard. From the time we check in everything was just excellent. Everyone in the hotel, security,concierge, front reception, kitchen staff, housekeeping,FnB staff,Lounge staff, Pool staff, Zanti staff they were all amazing. Friendly, respectful most of all genuine. They went beyond their normal duties to make sure I had comfortable stay. I highly recommend everyone to stay and support Marriott and their staff because they deserved it. Money spend well. We are definitely coming back. Grant- operation manager. Thanks for checking up on us from time to time. Thanks to all the staff Marriott for a job well done. Too many names to mention. . Karen and Michael."
1576,Loving Bali,50,December 2017,"The Courtyard Marriott Bali Seminyak has the best staff I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with! 5 stars all day!!!! Chinta is an amazing hostess, so sweet :). This is my 16th country and counting, so far this is the best service I've ever had!!"
1577,Luxury resort and amazing service,50,December 2017,"Staying at this resort for 10 days is like staying in paradise!! The rooms were amazing, location was great and the buffet breakfast was to die for. But my favourite part would have to be the amazing customer services. Bayu, Hari and Ayu catered to my every need by the pool and were helpful with tips and tricks to Bali.
Hendra‚Äôs cocktails and conversation by the bar are unbeatable, giving fantastic advice on the nightlife of Bali. Would definitely recommend staying here and chatting to the amazing staff."
1578,Cozy Hotel,50,December 2017,"Everything about my stay was perfect. The room, the service, food at seminyak kitchen was good,but the room service food need more attention :(

Location was great. Walking distance to town. This is place to relax and chill.
love the music during happy hour, his voice so amazing ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Thanks to Tiko and front desk team, well organized updating us about airport status , we were stranded in Bali about 4 days and staying in this hotel makes me felt homey!!
thanks to Ari bellman he is friendly and smile everyday :) , thanks to Ogi antara made our room fresh and clean everyday .

we will be back xx"
1579,Best service in Bali,50,December 2017,"Of all my three trips to Bali the Marriott courtyard is by far the best in every aspect of the resort. The ambience is a perfect balance of peace and luxury, going above and beyond for its guests. In particular the staff have made this stay so great. Thank you to Hendra for his amazing bartending skills and Jaya and Hari for attending to everything we needed!"
1580,great place to stay and enjoy the vacation,50,November 2017,"Initially I was little hesitant to book this hotel as it is 0.5 kms (.3 miles) from the Beach, but I am glad I did book my stay here.
The staff is very courteous and are willing to accommodate every request you make.
The Spa is nice, the pool and pool bar is nice place to spend after long flights to Bali."
1581,Five star recommendation,50,December 2017,"Overall outstanding customer service by Ulis! After coming to this country for leisure I was certainly impressed by the Marriots customer service skills, they certainly know how to welcome there guest."
1582,Lady travelling alone wonderful experience,50,November 2017,Recently stayed here for third time. Friendly staff. Management Grant and John looked after me well. Lovely relaxing vibe. Will definitely go again. Love that beautiful pool. Constantly asking me if f there was anything I need. Beautiful smiles greeted me at breakfast. Was a wonderful mini break. Sue
1583,Wonderful time!,50,December 2017,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the courtyard, very clean and tidy, excellent service and wonderfully friendly staff especially Chinta and Penny! Wonderful pool and swim up bar and close to many good restaurants."
1584,Excellent luxurious,50,December 2017,"This is one of the best i have seen. The staff are so helpfull the whole package is unbelievable. From first entering the staff are so friendly especially Darren & Simon & Pricilla 5+
The rooms are absolutely beautiful with a view overlooking the three tiered pools.and ours was looking at the pool bar
Bar service was quick and always cold which is important. Great beanbags for floating round the pools. Quick service by waiters to were you are sitting for coctails or food menu. Delightful Manager was even their for our check out"
1585,Fantastic Hotel,50,November 2017,We've just spent 8 nights at the Courtyard Marriott Hitel Seminyak. Everything was outstanding. Our room was spotless abd very comfortable. The buffett breakfast had a good combination of Asian and western food and all tastes would have well and truly been catered for. The seafood specialty dinner was well worth attending and we would recommend going if you can. Transport to Seminyak Square and Eat Street was provided by the hotel's golf buggy but is a nice walk if you feel like it. Staff were so nice; remembering my name and breakfast coffee. I couldn't select one staff member in particular as every person who looked after us was worthy of a mention. Great pool and afternoon happy hour. All in all a memorable holiday and we will definitely be back.
1586,bali with the volcanic ash cloud,50,November 2017,"We had a lovely time at the resort. the rooms were first class, clean and modern and well air conditioned. We had a pool terrace room and you could out of your room straight into the pool. All the staff from the top right down to the very bottom were always welcoming and friendly and courteous. Management were also very helpful when the ash cloud from the volcano closed down the airport. Luckily for us cloud lifted by our departure time. They also helped with a late check out time enabling us to swim on our last day right till we had to leave for the airport. Another plus was a scales in the ensuite which made sure I did not put on too much weight. Would stay with them again."
1587,Fantastic staff and facilities make a great hotel,50,December 2017,"We were stranded in bali as a result of the volcano and moved from a very expensive villa to the Marriott. We actually preferred our time in the Marriott, the staff were very attentive and always went above and beyond, I could see that they were genuinely helpful as they were often surprised when I gave them a tip.

The reception staff were very helpful in extending my room on a day by day basis as my flights were rescheduled twice, they also cancelled my final days booking without charging me a cancellation fee. There were lots of small touches throughout the hotel that improved our stay, for example the flight information desk.

The breakfast buffet was also excellent.

The hotel location is great, 5mins walk from double six beach.

The hotel security was excellent.

We also needed the doctor while we were there and the hotel arranged a visit from their doctor within the hour. She was very helpful, providing treatment and medication for the infamous 'Bali Belly'. The doctors charge was c¬£200. The staff checked that the doctors visit went well and the kitchen made customised bland dishes on request. We were also sent a 'get well soon' fruit platter which was appreciated.

A couple of areas of suggested improvement:
1. Our room (227) smelt a bit of damp, not sure if this is also an issue with other rooms.
2. The soundproofing could be better for rooms overlooking the pool area, although we did enjoy the acoustic guitar in the evenings.

Next time I'm on holiday I'll be sure to consider the Marriott brand for my accommodation."
1588,Couldn‚Äôt fault it!,50,December 2017,"Where do I start?

My partner and I got ‚Äòstuck‚Äô here in Bali due to the volcano (not a bad place to be stuck so we aren‚Äôt complaining)!

We had initially booked 6 nights at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough (I am currently still here, grazing on the breakfast buffet and enjoying the sunshine on the deck)! Our trip was unexpectedly extended another 6 days and we jumped at the chance to book the remaining nights at this hotel.

Each and every aspect of this place is awesome. From the ease of check in, beautiful staff who make a fuss over you as soon as you walk in, to the bar staff (Penny is amazing and makes a mean cocktail and Agus is lovely and so helpful)! To the security staff who look stern when you walk in but beam a happy smile and give a warm welcome (Agus at the security belt was lovely - I wish I could name them all)!

Breakfast is great. They have such a wide selection of food to choose from. The egg station is great! Feby and Sutiarja are super attentive and preempt what you need, bringing us a second cup of yummy coffee in the morning without even having to ask. They even bother to have a chat and ask you about your day and recommend things to see and do.

The location is perfect for exploring Seminyak, and the free hotel shuttle takes you wherever you need to go around the area (Seminyak Square, Eat Street etc).

The rooms are beautiful. The whole place is kept immaculately clean. The beds are so comfortable and again, the staff jump at the chance to help you in any way they can. I wish I knew the names of those who did our housekeeping (if management is reading this, we were in room 521 so please pass on our thanks to them for doing an amazing job)!

After 10 days here so far, I am struggling to find anything I don‚Äôt like about this place. We will definitely be back and this is our hotel of choice!"
1589,"Great staff, great hotel!!",50,December 2017,"I stayed at the courtyard hotel. The staff are fantastic. They are genuinely kind people who go out of their way to make your holiday unforgettable. I want to say a special thank you to:

Penny at the pool bar who was really great and made some excellent cocktails.

Agus at the pool;

Feby and sutiarja who served breakfast.

Although, all the staff were very kind and polite.

Before I booked this hotel, i always check on TripAdvisor to see other people‚Äôs experiences. I looked at the negative reviews of this hotel and I cant believe how wrong they were. The room and hotel were spotless and the pool was super clean.

I would not hesitate staying here again."
1590,Great hotel when i visited to bali,50,December 2017,Im so glad when i stayed at this hotel because i feel so comfortable.. i can enjoy the food as well and this hotel gives me a beautiful panorama which is related with my favorite types of hotel..and this hotel has located in the centre of the city üòä
1591,Fantastic Stay,50,November 2017,"Family of seven. Had a wonderfull time. Always ensured that our stay was smooth and the room/environment was always well maintained. Security was excellent.
The staff form the moment we arrived was very welcoming and friendly.
The food was very tasty from their traditional cuisine to westernised food.
I would highly recommend Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak. Special mention Ketut Ramudayana (FDM) thank you for making our stay so memorable."
1592,Amazing Stay,50,December 2017,"Last week My family and I stayed in Courtyard, Seminyak. I found this hotel was so amazing because of the great staff and excellent customer provision.The frontliners: reception staff, bell boys, securities, room service waiters, roomboys, and Seminyak Kitchen Staff are all beyond expectation: quick response and eager to help. Especially I was amazed with Priciscilla( the guest relation) for she has got very nice personality and good guest engangement. Something else that made me so in awe was The breakfast. The foods were incredible with a wide range of food varieties.
AMAZING COURTYARD, SEMINYAK.."
1593,Great Service,50,November 2017,Thankyou so much to all the staff at the Courtyard Marriot for making our stay so comfortable. We have been stranded for 5 extra days in Bali bringing our stay at the hotel to 11 nights. The pool access suite we had was very nice and clean with really comfortable beds. We would like to especially thank Alit and Chinta from the Pool Bar who were always so accommodating arranging our cocktails and canapes - always polite and happy. We wished we could've thanked everyone in person but we found out early this morning were on a rescue flight so we had to leave straight away without saying goodbye so thanks everyone-well done. We will be back. John & Katherine
1594,Great service,50,November 2017,Chinta and the team in the poolbar were friendly and gave great service on our recent trip to bali. Highly recommended to family's or couples. Great way to escape the heat or rain. On those bali evenings.
1595,Great Stay at The Marriott,50,November 2017,Thank you to John Woolley and Chinta for making my stay at the Marriott Seminyak so comfortable. Really great hotel and facilities. All staff were so friendly and helpful and the food and beverages were also fantastic. I would certainly come back!
1596,Best place to stay in Bali,50,November 2017,"This is the second time we have stayed here and we can not fault it at all, excellent rooms, friendly staff that go way beyond, superb food and great cocktails. Highly recommend to anyone couples and families and close to beach and water is in Seminyak."
1597,Awesome Resort,50,November 2017,"We were here for the first time in Bali and the Courtyard Marriott and the staff was really awesome here. Amy, Anton and Chinta were really great with their service. All staff is actually really good here. Resort is very clean and nice. Will definitely be back with family."
1598,Relaxing Accomdation,50,November 2017,"Looking for a place to relax after bouncing around; this place is it. Overall staff is both friendly and accommodating. House Keeping is courteous - pretty much caught me off guard. Quite possibly the friendliest Marriott I've met.
Special thanks to:
Chinta: exceptional [friendly] service and recommendations.
Ayu: engaging and friendly with a smile.
Esa: table service and waiting on us was pleasant.

While my fourth stay in Bali, this is my first stay at a hotel [I am a Marriott member]. On my next visit - this resort is on my list!

Thank you All,
R/Alex"
1599,Mr,50,November 2017,"First time in Bali and really think I made the right choice. Hotel is clean and modern with all the facilities including a pool bar. Staff are all amazingly friendly with a special mention to Chinta, Mang Roy -pool bar."
1600,Great location & comfy stay,50,November 2017,"I stayed 8 nights here with friends. An easy 10min walk into downtown Seminyak & a comfy spot to settle each night or laze the days away. Efficient aircon, comfy bed & pillows, large bathroom & the balcony was roomy enough for 3 people. Resort facilities were great - pool was fantastic, gym is modern & clean & spa was incredible. Lots of breaky food choices & fast room service for those quiet nights in."
1601,Company Outing,20,November 2017,"We come as a group consist of around 30 people. Dissapointed check in process, since many of the front staffs asking the same question ‚Äúwhat is our last name‚Äù. It took around 1,5 hrs to get the room and finally I got my room and asked them to stop asking my last name and find the room for me. Finally check in to my room and wait for the luggage, and they send the wrong luggage to my room.
They apologize and finally send the correct one.

Another mistake, while I was waiting for my room to be ready, I ask the front staff to send another luggage that I also bring to our boss‚Äôs room. He then confirm the luggage is already kept at my boss room. What happened then was, my boss check in at around 6:30pm and cannot find the luggage while I was outside for dinner. I called the hotel and was handled by the staff name Jordy and ask him to find the luggage and deliver to my boss room. Got piss off for all the experience above.

While the hotel have amazing location and very good in breakfast variety yet they need to improve their service."
1602,Our stay at Courtyard couldn‚Äôt get better - Flawless and simply amazing!!,50,November 2017,"I am quite picky when it comes to selecting hotels during our travel but I can happily say that it was the best decision to stay at courtyard in Seminyak and would suggest every person visiting Seminyak to stay here atleast for a night to witness the craziness.

The vibe of the hotel is amazing with buzzing music, a bar by their large pool, awesome cocktails, engaging staff, the really cool food truck and centric location. The hotel is walking distance from Seminyak square and also offers shuttle service for its guests. So if you chose to get out, you can get anywhere in the city pretty quickly. Moreover, the beach is also just 2 mins away.

We stayed in a pool facing room which had a cute balcony whereby we could chill in the night with our drinks.

What I also loved about the hotel was the warm service of the staff. They helped us in every manner in terms of recommending good restaurants or pubs and helping us get reservations there.

I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Bali. Simply loved the property!!!"
1603,THE NOISIEST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED AT.,30,November 2017,"In general the hotel was clean and well staffed. Breakfast fine and rooms /balconies a good size. In a great position location wise.Unfortunately due to the room configurations all room balconies overlooked the center of the complex including pool, bar etc. This means you can view anyone on their balconies at any time of day and all noise from these areas travels to the rooms. Pretty sure the glass doors on balconies are not glazed as every noise including the evening entertainment at the pool bar travels and can be heard in the rooms.We were not that interested in seeing people in their skimpies either when they were hanging their clothes on the balconies.Not their fault, its just that privacy is almost impossible."
1604,Fantastic Resort,50,November 2017,"This place is above and beyond. The staff, food, rooms and facility were fantastic. Cannot fault this resort, Great location and value for money we booked through luxury escape. It is very close to all great eating areas and beach."
1605,Amazing resort,50,November 2017,"We just had our second stay at Courtyard by Marriott and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. Amazing people who go above and beyond to make your stay one you won‚Äôt forget. We also stayed here last year and we will most definitely will be back. Resort is also in such a great location, nothing to fault. Our son loves the kids club :)"
1606,You should choose others Hotel for this price,30,November 2017,"I booked this hotel from Booking.com , this is just sudden plan, so i booked around 11pm and checkin right away.
The price not so cheap for 2 night stay.
I remember the hotel not too crowded, and they have a lot room.
They put my room just very far, have no view, even for first entrace to the room the key is not works at all. But the staff help me. And coz its already late, i change my key in the morning.
The first morning I wake up, nothing happen and all day im outside, when i come already clean and good.
But the next morning i wake up the floor is wet, i almost fell. And the floor still wet and the water keep coming from floor until i‚Äôm check out around 12pm.

There are a lot hotel and property in Bali seminyak, for this price just try another hotel."
1607,Holiday,50,November 2017,"We had 12 days at the Courtyard Marriott such a sensational place to stay. Location excellent, room spotless and clean, buffet breakfast great quality with fresh and wide selection aplenty. Pool area lovely everything was just fabulous. The thing that just makes this hotel amazing is the wonderful staff, from John and all the team you truly make each and every guest feel special, nothing is a problem and it‚Äôs a great place to be. Highly recommend this place for a great Bali getaway. See you next year, thanks üòé"
1608,Fantastic hotel with superb staff,50,November 2017,"I had stayed early for two consecutive nights then another night in early November 2017. Entering the hotel was beyond secure. The vehicle was checked in and out and entering the hotel premises was like going through security at an airport. At check in, the staff greeted me with a refreshing beverage. The check in staff also personally walked me to my room which was upgraded to a suite on both occasions. Though a key card was required to power on the electricity, the room was already air conditioned as it seemed it wasn't connected to the key card power initiator. The room was very clean spacious with a nice view of the pool. Had a quick dinner there and service staff was quite attentive. The options for dinner was pretty good as it contained both local and Western choices. The breakfast option was quite vast. There was plenty local and Western options to choose from. The egg station was quite attentive and designed whatever egg dish you wanted with ease. The 3 pools was nice with 1 shallow pool for children. There's a bar at one of the pools that always seemed busy. Many eating options within the area and a few bars and nightclubs on the same road. The hotel provides a shuttle to a somewhat private beach area, pending weather. All in all, a great place to stay with the services of a full service hotel. I definitely would stay here again being its attentive service and great location."
1609,Great hotel with fantastic staff,50,July 2017,"This is my first review online but I simply feel I need to write something about our wonderful stay at the Courtyard Bali in Seminyak.
My wife and I travelled from the UK with our 2 year old son Harry and 5 month old baby daughter Ottie (we must be mad!!)

We were visiting Indonesia due to two family weddings which spanned across a two month period and chose the hotel for our first stop on our tour. The Courtyard hotel was also chosen due to its location to the beach and a good review from a family member who had visited previously. As soon as we arrived the checking in team made us feel very welcome and whisked our bags away to our room. The high level of service continued throughout our stay from the pool side staff, the children‚Äôs kids club, the breakfast and restaurant staff and even the buggy drivers through to the private beach area team.

At every breakfast (which is by far the best in Bali) or evening meal you are greeted with a warm smile and looked after attentively and on first name basis after just a few days. Our toddler Harry and baby Ottie were always made comfortable with high chairs and made to feel like part of the Courtyard family which helped us with our crazy and hectic meal times.

‚Ä¢ 2 pools with a good depth kiddies pool.
‚Ä¢ fantastic kids club with a great team.
‚Ä¢ great food throughout the day & night
‚Ä¢ small private beach area (10min walk) or you can use the hotels buggy.

Having found such a great hotel we actually stayed for 3 weeks in total and explored the local area and further field.

I would like to thank Grant Young and his team for making our stay in Bali even more special and we will be back!

A few special people we would also like to mention;

Agus
Juli
kardana
Sutiarja
Yeani
Anton
Ayo
Arista
Narita
Gus dek
Gita

Digo
Widi

Santi
Komang
Debby
Nisa
Ayu

My only advice for families with young children, is book or ask for a room near the kids pool which is away from the main pool bar as it can get a little loud in the evenings. (But the singing is great!)

Thanks again John, Lorna, Harry & Ottie x"
1610,Best Hotel,50,November 2017,"Had such an amazing experience during my stay, always felt very welcomed and had the best time at the pool bar with Hendra and Darsana. Tried the Oreo mockrail today as per recommendation, thanks boys!"
1611,10/10!,50,November 2017,Best customer service at the pool bar!!! Very accomodating and friendly and love to encourage us to try their big range of drinks ‚ù§Ô∏è love this hotel and will definitely be coming back here next time! Big shoutout to Hendra and Ebit!
1612,"""Royal Welcome"" Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak",50,November 2017,"I was there with my wife and 12 year old daughter for five days, I was extremely impressed with the hotel,facilities,location and most important the staffs.

Besides the hotel facilities the staff at the courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali are truly amazing!

We were given a warm welcome with Bintang Beer and lemon tea for my family.

Our room was ready before we reached, I hardly spent less then a minute in the reception for check in.

As a platinum member we were upgraded into a higher category room, I dont remember the staff names but I really thank them all from my heart for their service with smiling face, especially restaurant, house keeping, security and front office persons. Special thanks to General Manager Mr.John Woolley who takes special care and attention of all guests.

Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak Bali made our holiday memorable. My family want to stay again."
1613,Beyond The Wow That I Expected,50,November 2017,"When I come to a place that people talk well about, naturally my expectations are always high. Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort for one, if we diligently read reviews, guests fancy about the breakfast being amazing and service is rated excellent!

I did not fall short of experiencing that. Infact I had so much more that nudged me to share here. On my first day before breakfast, I hit my pearl ring on something hard and the pearl fell off. I asked for an envelope from the Seminyak Kitchen staff (I wish I got her name) so I can put my ring in it. She politely asked me what happened to my ring so I obliged to tell her quickly my ring story. After a few minutes she approached me and told me someone from Engineering is here to fix my ring. Wow! I did not expect that. To cut the story short she came back with my ring fixed and the pearl beautifully in place. Talk about the fluffy heart I had with that level of attention and care I got from them.

I spent my days noting that this resort is made up of happy souls! Their staff work and serve happily.

Great start, homey stay and I ended my last night with one of the most wonderful three hour treatment I had at their Spa. Professionally done yet I felt how she loved what she was doing. The Spa staff - Ayu (whose name by the way mean‚Äôs good from the country I come from), deserved not only a tip but a sincere hug from a very delighted customer like me. I definitely can‚Äôt wait to visit the Resort again."
1614,Amazing,50,September 2017,A friend and I recently stayed here. I honestly can not fault the hotel. All the staff were very friendly. The food and drinks were amazing. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I cannot recommend this place enough. We will be back.
1615,Absolutely brilliant,50,October 2017,"We stayed in the Courtyard Seminyak. Hotel and rooms were clean, Staff were so polite and attentive. Cannot fault service and hotel.
The pool area seems small if hotel is near full as sun beds will be short supply but otherwise had a really good time.

The beach is a 10 min walk from hotel and you could ask for the hotel buggy to take to you to their beach area before 5.00pm.

Breakfast was just awesome as well. The manager and chef were so welcoming. Marriott do this well and truly hospitable.

Only qualm I had was the beers and booze were exorbitantly priced."
1616,Resort Getaway,50,November 2017,"Hi

My wife and I just stayed here and could not fault anything it was amazing fro the minute we arrived at the airport we were picked up and taken to the hotel where we requested late checkout for our last day our trip in advance and it was no issue.
Our first brekky was the best we had eaten and we have travelled quite a bit
Room was quiet and service was amazing especially is Seminyak kitchen where we were addressed by name every time.
Pool and pool bar were superb and location is spot on and easy to hail and blue bird taxi to anywhere you need to go
Only issue at times there were people smoking where they shouldn‚Äôt on the lower pool area and it stunk but most times pool staff were quick to tell the person off.
We will be back for sure next year to lay and soak up the sun.
Thanks to all at the hotel for a brilliant holiday and relax
Simon and Katie Hobart"
1617,Wonderful place to stay.,50,November 2017,"My husband and I recently had ten days at the Courtyard by Marriott and it was more than we could have expected.
The staff were wonderful, very friendly, helpful and only too willing to make our stay the best it could be.
Our room, beds and pillows were comfortable.
The breakfasts had the largest selection of choices of food and juices we have ever had, we even had a freshly made 'detox' juice every morning.
There were so many extras on offer. The shuttle service to the private beach or shops or restaurants was very welcome.
We were very happy to have chosen the Courtyard and, hopefully, will return."
1618,Fantastic holiday and beautiful hotel!,50,November 2017,"We booked in here for six nights and found it to be perfect for our stay. The room was on the 5th floor, maintained well and exceptionally clean. Breakfast was plentiful with food for all tastes including a fantastic fresh juice bar. All staff were so pleasant and helpful with a warm welcome from all staff.

A special thank you to ‚ÄòI Made Muliana‚Äô who went the extra mile for us and found a video we requested. He is a fantastic professional and an asset to the Marriott Brand in our opinion.

We will definitely be recommending this hotel as it is definitely 5 star and helped us to feel safe and welcome, we look forward to returning!"
1619,Highly recommended,50,November 2017,"Courtyard marriott is a fantastic hotel for a family holiday. Staff are amazing and willing to do anything to make your stay as easy as possible.
Cinta in the pool bar was incredible, her service was great. She is just another fine example of the wonderful friendly atmosphere at this great hotel! Highly recommended üòä"
1620,best hotel,50,November 2017,"It was a really enjoyable trip.
It was a trip with my young daughter and above all the staff was very kind.

Especially Priscilla who guided us to the room was kind and friendly.
She took good care of my 20 month old daughter. Your friendly guide is very grateful.

All the guests we met at the hotel(especially at the pool) were smiley on the face, all the places were clean and well managed.
During our stay we were the only Korean. (just I thought)

I stayed for a week but I was not boring. The hotel is located to go to the beach and the city.

The waiter Widi who met at the Meat shop on the last evening was also kind. He always cared about what we needed.

In fact, all the employees I met at this place were very friendly. It was a happy week. It is hotel which we want to recommend to all."
1621,"Terrific Hotel, terrific staff, best buffet breakfast, ever !!!!!!!",50,October 2017,"My wife and I stayed there for 10 nights, we would highly recommend this hotel. We regularly travel to Bali, this breakfast is the best we have tasted. my thanks to head chef Auli and his assistant Omay, both have a hands on approach to their kitchen. Could not fault any meals, I ate only Indonesian breakfast, Auli was only too happy to explain what ingredients, went with others and made my breakfast pleasurable. Room was both spacious and clean, our room 610 overlooked the pool and gardens. What can I say about the staff, they were excellent, could not do enough to help and assist, they were genuinely happy to help and offer advise. Manager Grant Young, was in the breakfast room most mornings, inquiring about our stay, and if he could help in anyway to make our stay better. I had a problem with the alarm clock, trivial, but a nuisance, I mentioned it to Grant at breakfast. Problem fixed by the time we had returned to our room. Cannot find anything negative to point out. We will be back next year for our annual holiday, might even try to slip in a short stay before then, Thank you for a great stay. Sampai jumpa tahun depan"
1622,Totally Amazing,50,November 2017,"We stayed in Bali for 9 nights and spent the first 5 nights in a private Villa before arriving at The Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort to spend our final 4 nights.
As soon as we checked in we were disappointed that we did not stay at the Courtyard Bali for longer. This place is amazing and has everything to offer you. The location is great with shopping on your doorstep. The rooms were very clean and tidy. We had a daily breakfast included with our stay. The breakfast options were exceptional.
We enjoyed the pool bar and daily entertainment.
All staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
We will definitely be coming back to The Courtyard Bali Seminyak and will be staying must longer. 4 nights just not enough !!!!!
Thank you for our amazing stay"
1623,Super helpful staff made,50,November 2017,just returned from 2nd stay at Courtyard. My friend had an issue with luggage and front desk staff went out of their way to resolve the problem (even though not theirs). A member of the breakfast staff took pride in remembering our 3 separate room numbers when we forgot and even the buggy drivers were super obliging. Could not fault the service or the breakfast. Great location. Cant wait to return.
1624,The best hotel we've had,50,November 2017,"We would highly recommended this hotel to whoever want to visit and stay in Seminyak-Bali! They have the best buffet breakfast, best bartenders, especially name is Harry Susanto and all the staff are very professional and friendly too. Our 5th floor room was facing to the road side but we had no any problem with all noise outside like what some people saying and this hotel is only 5 minutes walking distance to the beach.
We no doubt and we aready booked to stay at CYMarriott again after done with our Lombok trip in a few more days but this time we will stay at the Nusa Dua one! We are coming soon, CYMarriott Nusa Dua!!"
1625,Cozy stay,50,November 2017,"Thank you Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak. I had a wonderful stay. My room was spacious enough during my short stay. Your staff at the breakfast room were kind and made my dining with my best friend memorable. Will come back surely when I'm in town :) Once again, thank you!"
1626,"Classy, Luxurious & simply amazing!",50,November 2017,"We've just come home from our 3rd stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak & it certainly won't be the last. All the staff are fabulous, so very professional, attentive & friendly. The rooms are clean & comfortable and the pool is lovely. The Seminyak kitchen restaurant is top class & oh the spa...how I miss it already! I honestly do not have one negative thing to say about the hotel & its amazing super friendly staff & looking forward to the next time we stay."
1627,Above expectations,50,November 2017,"Exceptional breakfast *****, caring concierge, five minutes walk to seminyak beach with excellent night life, star mart just opposite the main gate, shopping of souvenirs and small items in abundance, hotel cab service is good for tours. And now drawbacks.... my room was at sixth floor towrds road side but was quite noisy especially because of motor bikes . So always opt towards swimmingpool view rooms. Ohhh i forgot the gym it was also ****"
1628,HENDRA AND ARCA WOOOO,50,November 2017,"Stunning hotel literally best one we‚Äôve stayed at on our trips to Bali. The place has awesome little events on, the pool bar is vibing and awesome for young people. The bartenders are super fun and my friend spilt her entire daiquiri while trying to get a pic and they remade it free of charge which was awesome. The room is really clean and modern would highly recommend and the buffet breakfast is the best we‚Äôve had aswell"
1629,Best hotel to stay in,50,November 2017,"Beautiful hotel, lots of events in the evening inside the hotel which we enjoyed during the stay. Clean pools, music n pool bar much enjoyable.

Jojo & sutiarja the waiters looked after my husband and I very well,thanks to all the staff. Best hospitality:)"
1630,Poolbar,50,November 2017,"Bayu, Hendra and all the staff at the poolside bar were fantastic. Great and friendly service. I would highly recommend this to everyone to try when visiting. The best cold drinks in Seminyak! Cant wait to visit again. Keep up the good work guys!"

the extra details are the plusses, the cotton candy and popcorn bar, pool bar bingo and the cocktails. we enjoyed our ice coffee and tacos from the food truck
this hotel is compact but cater for all your needs and then some!!"
1632,Another perfect stay,50,October 2017,"Thank you to Courtyard Marriot Seminyak for a wonderful week. This was my 5th visit in 15 months which says it all.
From your arrival you are greeted by such friendly Front Desk staff such as Davin, Tiko, Hardi and Laura who are always there with a smile to assist
Hendra at the Pool Bar will look after your Cocktail needs after Agus has taken you through a fun Water Aerobics session.
I highly recommend Zanti Spa for its excellent ambience, treatments and therapists.
Ayu will greet you each morning for Courtyards amazing buffet breakfast. I honestly miss that.
You cannot go past this hotel for security, location and most importantly their fantastic staff.
Thanks again for making our birthday celebrations special üôÇ"
1633,Great Bartenders,50,November 2017,"I met this bloke named Hendra who worked behind the poolbar. He couldn't do any bar tricks but he was good company and mixed a good long island iced tea!

Hendra, I reckon a couple of big Tv's with fox sports wouldn't go astray above your bar. Hit up your boss so it's ready for my next visit!

Next up we moved to the bar where the Tv's were situated. I befriended a nice lady named Chinta, she went on to serve our next long island iced teas and had exemplary service skills.

Cheers guys!"
1634,Bartenders,50,November 2017,"Awesome bartenders. Me mates Hendra and arca legends flipping bottle and mixing mean drinks.

Best drinks and atmosphere in Seminyak, highly recommend the pool bar for a good time and a good drink. Long Island ice tea all the way"
1635,Great hotel - pity about the smokers,40,November 2017,"What a great hotel. Nice rooms, good bathrooms, fantastic pool - probably the best in Bali and the staff were amazing. John, the boss of the hotel is super nice and provided us with a late checkout. And he wandered around all day to make sure everyone was having a good time. The staff love working there and it shows... always smiling and providing great service.

The downside was that it was a smokers' paradise. You can smoke in all the bars and don't the smokers take all the good spots. You can even smoke at the pool bar where people are eating and drinking! So if I could make one change it would be smoking restrictions. Australians forget how bad it was before our smoking laws came in.

One great feature is that they move your gear off the pool lounges if you are not there for a while to ensure others can get a spot. So you never had to wait for a lounge.

But, if you can escape the smoke you will have a great experience."
1636,Absolutely stunning! Best hotel and staff,50,November 2017,This is our 2nd trip to this hotel and it is absolutely amazing! The hotel itself has everything you need- amazing pool and staff! Maria and Widya from the pool bar are just the sweetest and with the best customer service! Anna the dining supervisor is also amazing and welcoming. We will definitely be coming back!
1637,One of The Best Hotel in Seminyak,40,August 2017,"I really love to stay here, eventough it's located in a hip area such as seminyak I still can relax and enjoy the hotel. They serve a wide variety meal for breakfast from indonesian, east asian and western foods. The other point that I like is that they have foodtruck near the lobby which serve good buritos."
1638,Faultless,50,November 2017,"We had the most amazing three nights staying here. It was close to everything and had plenty of spas, a mini mart, and plenty of market stalls all within a couple minutes walk. The beach was 5 minutes down the road.
The resort itself was spotless and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was amazing and the drinks and food options from What The Truck were a bonus and really well priced.
After our stay in Seminyak we transferred to a highly awarded and expensive resort and Spa in Nusa Dua, and whilst it was amazing, we found ourselves wishing we were back at the Courtyard by Marriott.
If you are after a well appointed resort that's close to everything you can't go passed this place. We will be recommending to everyone and will stay here again."
1639,Terrific Stay in Bali,50,November 2017,"Staying at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak was an outstanding experience. I arrived and was personally greeted by Priscilla who seemed to find me all over the property and made conversation throughout my short stay. The service from all of the staff was impeccable and made my first time in Bali one to remember. The property is beautiful and is an oasis in the middle of the busy city. The Beach is just a short ride or walk away and there is always something going on property. Food service on property was exceptional thanks to people like Widi and Dwi. The entire hotel was clean and well maintained and the rooms spacious and well appointed. All in all, it was a trip to remember and I look forward to coming back as soon as possible. This was one of the most comfortable and now one of my favorite hotels I‚Äôve stayed in."
1640,Amazing Hotel,50,November 2017,"This is up there with the best I‚Äôve stayed in, staff are great, food is good, bar service to sun beds around pool (prices are very reasonable) rooms are also amazing and the little touches that the staff do really make you feel at home."
1641,Lovely Hotel,50,April 2017,"‚Ä¢ Amazing hotel, with free shuttle to the beach and back.
‚Ä¢ Delicious breakfast
‚Ä¢ Rooms are spacious
‚Ä¢ Service is exceptional, although food and drinks can be expensive.
‚Ä¢ They are tight on security so expect airport kind of security.
‚Ä¢ Big swimming pool"
1642,Best resort visit - staff is great!,50,November 2017,"I wish I had more time to stay at this Marriott. It was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had! The service is impeccable. When I got to my room, Priscilla (guest relations) called me and welcomed me to the room. She saw that I didn‚Äôt purchase breakfast and offered complimentary breakfast and invitation to a cocktail party for Marriott members. I got to meet her and other staff. John and Hardi were also very nice. After I mentioned that I had a very late flight and did not know where to go, they allowed me to have a late check out! Room service prices are reasonable and tasty. The seminyak kitchen breakfast buffet was awesome and had western and Indonesian food. The room was spacious, very clean, and had all the amenities you could think of. I got a very reasonable massage where the masseuse customized the areas of focus. As for the extra special items, they offered free popcorn/cotton candy and had different activities for families throughout the day. If I ever go back to Seminyak, I am definitely coming back to this resort. The staff is the best!"
1643,Miss,50,November 2017,"The hotel staff, especially at the pool bar, made me feel so welcome. They went above and beyond for me and i can't thank them anymore. Chinta, maria, kesawe, hari, and rudi were fsntastic. They made my visit better than any I've ever had. Please go and visit them!!"
1644,Amazing service,50,November 2017,"This is our second time staying at the courtyard Marriott and both times we have flawed by the incredible service we have received. In particular Hendra who has to be one of the greatest customer service advocates Bali has to offer. Special mention also to Penny, Ruben and Alit. Will recommend to all our friends"
1645,Poor cleanliness,20,November 2017,"What a dissapoint stay at Courtyard property, i woke up with redish spot along my hand. I was here a week ago for holiday at Bali, the pool is very nice. The food was standard , the breakfast presentation is very nice. The staff is helpful and good personal approaching. Unfortunately the cleanliness that very bad made me moved to another hotel. The room with wooden interior is full of dusty and made some itches allergy even i ve consumed methyl prednisolone already based on doctor suggestion."
1646,Wonderful Hotel,50,November 2017,"Smack bang in the middle of Seminyak. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The pool area is amazing. We were upgraded to a pool access room which wasn‚Äôt the largest room in the world but to be next to the pool made up for it. The beach is a 7min walk away and I believe the hotel has a beach club with a shuttle service between hotel and beach.

Some of our Australian cousins can be a bit boisterous and noisy around the bar area but we tended to ignore them üòâ"
1647,Amazing!!,50,November 2017,"Love this hotel. It has everything you could ever want and more. Amazing rooms, events, pool and the most lovely people, especially Hendra, makes you feel right at home!! Will be back as soon as possible! We were only meant to be here one night but extended because of how amazing it is!!! Welcome to paradise!!/üòçüòçüòç"

Such a lovely stay staff are friendly, rooms are lovely and well kept, excellent facilities and even all the guest were great!! Can recommend this hotel enough it was my third stay and will be staying again in March."
1649,Amazing,50,November 2017,"We are supposed to stay here for one night but changed our reservation to stay the remainder of our stay. The facilities and services are great. Pool bar and staff are incredible, especially hendra! Can't wait to come back. Absoluletly no complaints."
1650,Great location in the heart of Seminyak,50,December 2016,I stayed here for a week alone and it was in a great location just a small walk to the main street of Seminyak. The security was great and as a single traveller I felt safe. The room was comfortable and the service was great.
1651,Amazing staff,50,November 2017,"So often reviews rate staff on individual and personal interactions, but in this hotel we've found every team member works as a whole to promote the Marriott brand and guest experience. Well done everyone.
Special thanks to Head of food and beverages , I MADE MULIANA for ginger and honey tea for poorly wife's throat , and Chinta in Pool Bar, for my drink requirements !
We will recommend . x"
1652,Wonderful Stay,50,November 2017,"We stayed here for 4 nights and we got the connecting door room as we have 5 guys in total. The room is very big and clean. The tidy service is the best.
We really enjoy out stay at this hotel. It is very comfortable as supermarket just in front of the hotel and restaurants, spas along the street. The food truck also in front of the hotel and the beach is only 5-10 mins walk from the hotel.
The swimming pool is perfect as there are 3 pools; kid pool, the lower pool and the pool bar. There is live music by the pool. I really enjoyed and relaxed in the afternoon by the pool.
I will definitely stay here again if I have a chance to......"
1653,Exceptional service and hospitality,50,November 2017,"Courtyard by Marriot offers a home away from home experience. Nothing is too much trouble. The staff are exceptional on all fronts, efficient, courteous and truly hospitable.
The location is central to eat Street with a free buggy service from the hotel foyer. The pool is large with a a shallow area for younger children, a middle section large enough to do laps in and a seperate swim up bar area if you are inclined. Evenings can be spent in the outdoor guest lounge and bar with happy hour cocktails and musical entertainment. Rooms are exceptionally cleaned, tidy and functional with all amenities provided, bottled water, toiletries, hairdryer, iron and ironing board etc. The Spa treatments are world class and very affordable. There are so many things to love about this hotel but its the staff that truly make your stay a memorable one here."
1654,Amazing staff..,50,November 2017,"Stayed with my wife and two kids 5,7 yrs old. Found that the best part of this hotel is the people that work there. They are all so lovely and genuinely nice to the guests every time you see them.
Special mention to Penny, Hari and Bayu at the pool bar for wonderful service and great advice and Teguh(fairy man) for the kids daily treat. Esa at the breakfast buffet thank you also.
Agus from ""What the truck"" and Yoga whose tacos and cheap Bintang I lived off, thanks so much for your advice and making our family so welcome in Bali and really making our holiday what it was."
1655,A wonderful experience,50,November 2017,"From arrival to departure our five days were met with all the hospitality one could ever wish for.
All the staff made the visit a warm experience, they are friendly and happy to help with anything you may need.
The breakfast' had a great variety of items to choose from so we never had to have the same thing over and over. The dinner menu was also great, I highly recommend the chicken stroganoff. In room dinning was available at any time you wished also.
Whether sitting on the lawn with a bottle of wine in the afternoon or getting a bite to eat and a few happy hour drinks in at the pool bar whilst listening to a little live music, everything here made it easy to relax.
The hotel is in a great location, close to restaurants, the beach and getting anywhere else is very easy thanks to a hotel shuttle.

A big thankyou to John and to all the staff who made the stay a unique and unforgettable experience. We are very much looking forward to our next return."
1656,Courtyard by Marriott,50,November 2017,"Fantastic service by Chinta at the pool bar....very accomodating üëçüëç
Hotel very clean and check in was great....great location and great atmosphere....totally recommend this hotel next time you come to Bali"
1657,Best of the best,50,November 2017,Will definitely be coming back and staying at the Courtyard. Beautiful staff who made our stay welcoming and wonderful. Special mention to Bayu who was very attentive and helpful and had some fabulous cocktail recommendations! Best hotel I have stayed at by far
1658,Fab hotel!,50,November 2017,"As a first time traveller to Bali this hotel has been amazing! All the staff have been wonderful especially Bayu, so attentive and willing to help! Great cocktails and the rooms are beautiful. Great place to stay will definitely be back."
1659,Perfect,50,November 2017,"Everything was Perfect. The room was incredible and I enjoyed every second here.
Special Thanks to Chinta from the Poolbar, she was so friendly and courteous. And the Drinks are Perfect.
I defintly coming back.
Mona"
1660,A Birthday Treat,50,October 2017,"My husband treated us both to a week at The Courtyard By Marriott Seminyak for my 65th Birthday.

What a fantastic hotel with a beautiful room & spacious bathroom, we had a pool access room with plenty of storage space.

The staff of the hotel are so friendly, I was even given a Birthday cake which was one of the best mud cakes I have tasted.

The breakfast had a good choice for all tastes, complimentary shuttles to the beach & Seminyak square are provided in the golf buggy. We will be staying at this hotel again when next in Bali"
1661,Perfect holiday,50,November 2017,"First time in Courtyard Bali and it was such a great experience. Chinta, Widi and Arieni have made our stay very comfortable with their beautiful and big smile.
Wish to come back very soon to see these friendly faces and enjoy the good service.."
1662,Superb hotel,50,November 2017,"This hotel is surely one of the best places in Seminyak. The hotel is on a busy street but as soon as you walk through reception, you will find an oasis. During my stay, I spent one whole day in the hotel and enjoying the pool and cocktails from the poolbar, and the lovely Chinta, and Maria who were always checking up on us to make sure we are ok. There is always a staff member helping you with anything you need. Had dinner in the hotel restaurant, and got to enjoy some very delicious balinese food thanks to recommendation from our waiter and now friend Widi. (Easy to spot him, he has the world's biggest smile üòÜ) one of the best thing about the hotel is the massive variety of food for breakfast which is on until 11am. The open kitchen allows you to watch the chefs working hard at their masterpiece. The gorgeous Anna, came to us every morning and would check to see how she could make our stay more comfortable, and also helped us with recommended things to do and visit in Bali.
The Spa retreat is to die for, with great therapists and reasonable prices for teatments and massages, considering it's in a hotel.
Saving the best for last, the acoustic duet, Husband Ray and his wife that have a musical session between 6pm and 9pm in the evening during happy hour. Soothing guitar and voice, so much talent.they also take on requests.

As I am writing this review, I realise how many new friends I have made here, and will hopefully be back in the next six months. Thank you all for a great 8 days in paradise"
1663,High recommended for stay in seminyak area,50,November 2017,"Was really great experience, we stay for 5 Days and was so fantastic , especially the staff are really friendly and helpful, food sooo good , the location are in the center of seminyak and for sure we will be back for next our holiday ."
1664,Great 10 night stay,50,May 2017,We had adjoining rooms which was really useful for our 2 kids. We had one room with a queen bed and one room with 2 single beds. Both rooms had balconies with a great view down to the pool. The way the hotel wraps around itself with a pool at its centre means the pool benefits from shade at various times of the day which is useful. The kids pool down one end was great for our kids. The kids club and staff were great and gave us flexibility throughout our stay. We had breakfasts included which were always amazing. We would definitely recommend this hotel.
1665,30th Wedding Anniversary,40,October 2017,"Lots of children although just out of school holidays for Aust. Air conditioner in the room leaked condensation all the time we were there. It was in the main walk area to the bathroom and door so we had to put a towel on the floor to stop us slipping in thongs.
in saying that, we had a great time and the food was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful."
1666,Nice resort but noisy,30,September 2017,"Nice resort in Seminyak only a short taxi ride to thw main strip. Rooms were big and clean, good food and drink prices. The staff were fantastic and really helpful and friendly. The only issue was that the daily music from 11am to 9pm was so loud you had to shout to talk at the pool bar and even back in our room with the sliding door to the balcony closed it was over powering. The windows and door rattled from the base it was like living in a nightclub. Not the relaxing paradise we expected after a day out in the choas that is Seminyak."
1667,Pool bar service,50,November 2017,"Cinta at the pool bar at the courtyard provides an absolutely wonderful service! She is extremely lovely, happy to assist in anyway and the food and drink here is delicious. Thank you cinta for making our time here much more enjoyable!"
1668,Great stay,50,November 2017,Highly recommend this hotel great service very clean and could not be any more helpful on our stay would defintely stay here again special mention to Hendra and Alit in the swim up bar cheers. Drinks are absolutely delicious try the happy ending. All night room service is the best thing ever.
1669,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Staff",50,October 2017,Another great holiday staying in Seminyak. The Courtyard Hotel as always was great. Clean and tidy with staff that are fantastic. Great selection for Breakfast to start the day. Pool bar is awesome. Rooms clean and spacious. We will be back again.
1670,Not worth the extra money.,30,October 2017,"We stayed for 7 nights for $1600 AUD including breakfast each morning. We were allocated a TINY little room at the back of the resort. From our room we could hear kids screaming in the pool all day, people above us walking around and the buzz of Seminyak at all hours. Firstly, I was really disappointed at the room we were given. I booked the trip and paid 5 months prior. House keeping missed our room on several occasions and when we'd return to the room of a late afternoon and flagged this - house keeping had gone home for the day. This happened 2 days in a row, no towels, toilet paper or drinking water. Honestly, I wouldn't return to the resort. It's very nice on the eye but not worth the extra money. You can get the exact same quality for half the price. Breakfast was also the same as any other resort. Nice enough. The pool is beautiful also."
1671,Royal treatment,50,November 2017,"Anna of F&B sales looked after us during our stay. Giving advice on local events and food outlets.
Happy to stay again as we both felt comfortable and welcomed not felt at other hotels this trip.
The hotel was clean and well serviced.
Location of this hotel for us was optimal as it was close to our favorite bars and shopping district."
1672,good food and even better dessert,40,October 2017,"the food was very good but the desserts that we ordered were even better. and the breakfast buffet spread is huge, with quite a few options for vegetarians. besides, the staff is very friendly and helpful. they also have a pool bar with bar stools placed in the swimming pool which makes it even more relaxing. but one area that needs improvement is the garden to be made free of mosquitoes"
1673,"Really friendly staff, good service, nice pool and good location",50,October 2017,"Staff at the hotel was really friendly and service was just excellent. Best part was morning Breakfast, one of the best in 5 star hotels. Earlier our room was on level three with partial pool view, we requested, and they moved us to level six with full view very next day. Room service, food, pool drinks were good though pool drinks had bit less alcohol in them.

One thing we regret was not to take taxi service from hotel, we took from outside travel agent, he was very rude and didn't gave us good service. If I can go back and change will definitely book from the hotel as service is guaranteed. As first day we stayed in the partial view room, thus hotel gave us a complimentary taxi service to hotel, that was really good. Would definitely love to stay again with Marriott.

Other facilities included Gym and Spa was excellent."
1674,Extraordinary service,50,October 2017,"Every time I'm at Courtyard Marriotts, Anna would greet me without fail and remind me of their latest menu offering from the Meat/ Steak House.

At breakfast time, despite her busy hectic schedule, she would inevitably check on my satisfaction and happiness level on all aspects of my stay! Simply brilliant! I feel at home each and every time. She does this to almost every guest! Excellent!

Thank you Anna. You are the service excellence that Courtyard Marriott's is all about. Keep up the great work."
1675,Best holiday destination and accommodatio,50,October 2017,"We have stayed at the Marriot before and it was fabulous. I‚Äôm happy to say that this time or also did not disappoint. The staff here are amazing, so lovely and fabulous service. In particular Hendra and Maria. My friend and I spent a lot of time at the bar and poolside and their service was second to none. Will definitely come back!"
1676,Great Resort,50,October 2017,"Beautiful resort, the pool is a huge.The breakfast is amazing the best in bali! Such great customer service. A great place to bring families caters for everyone.i think I will have two sad girls when our holiday comes to an end Thanks Hendra!"
1677,Amazing and well worth it,50,October 2017,"Such an amazing and friendly hotel. The staff are great and very helpful. Would thoroughly recommend this beautiful modern hotel.
Thank you Widi for looking after us at dinner üëåüòÄ‚ô•Ô∏è
The pool and swim up bar are a must, lived entertainment at night during happy hour. Located near the beach and close to everything that you want to see and so in Seminyak"
1678,Very good service,50,October 2017,"Very nice environment, very good staff. The hotel has the frequently shuttle bus to go the center and beach. Very convenient. Breakfast buffet has very delicious food, different kinds of foods, fresh juice, fruits and very friendly staff, Widi. Enjoyed a lot :)"
1679,'Exceptional staff',50,October 2017,"Besides the exceptional hotel facilities and wonderful food, the staff at the courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali are truly amazing! From the time we arrived, we have been looked after from restaurants to bars, room service , chefs, laundry, cleaning, security, retreat staff; everyone is so friendly and go out of there way to help and has made our holiday one of the most enjoyable time we have had.. including Widi one of one the exceptional restaurant staff greeting us at breakfast with our usual morning coffee with a smile and beautiful greeting. Thank u to the Marriott management for providing us with true 5 star service!

A wedding anniversary we will remember always."
1680,LOVED Courtyard! will be back!,50,October 2017,"Beautiful 5 star accommodation, great service, friendly staff who would do anything for you if you are as polite to them as they are to you! extremely clean grounds, fantastic location in Seminyak opposite The Breezes Resort, surrounded by shops, restaurants, markets, cafes & a 10 min walk from Seminyak Beach. The taco truck out the front is so cool, buy one get one free taco's & so delicious. Rooms were spacious enough, we had the pool view room which was nice with a balcony & a big comfy bed. Not a cheap hotel, you get what you pay for though. Decent breaky - lots of choice. Will be back!"
1681,Seminyak Kitchen,50,October 2017,"Hi just wanted to thank Omay for making me feel important at breakfast every morning. Your beautiful smile and professionalism is what makes people wanting to come back to visit. The food you offer is so delicious and a huge variety for all travellers, you never miss out on trying something.
Thankyou."
1682,Another wonderful stay with the Courtyard,50,October 2017,"This is the second stay this year with the Courtyard Marriott. The first was was with family and my recent visit was with a group of friends. I was again extremely impressed with the hotel - the facilities, location and most importantly the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and they are very accomodating. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Bali. I will definitely be back again. Thank you Courtyard Marriott for another great stay with you."
1683,Courtyard well worth it,50,October 2017,"We are coming up to our last day at Courtyard and have nothing but praise for the staff and management regarding our stay. The staff are friendly without being over the top and the pool bar staff are very consistent and competent at making yummy drinks. Special mention to Hendra and Santoso for some professional service and good cocktails and Anton and Omay for the best Buffet breakfast we have had the menu is value for money and nothing's too much trouble. Location of the hotel is also convenient with the golf buggy taking you to the beach. I would not recommend the beach at Seminyak as it is very dirty lots of rubbish and hawkers are very pushy and annoying even swear at you if you say no. Despite this we Would stay here
Again"
1684,New Hotel with Modern Style,50,October 2017,"New and modern hotel (opened 3 years ago). Check in is very simple and fast. We got welcome drink during check in process. Our room is pool view, thanks to ms Fransisca. She is very polite and helpful. Free pop corn in the lobby. The room is very modern style with balcony. Toilet seat and shower room in the separate space. House keeping provide us adaptor for mobile charging and engineering solve our shrink water flow problem. They are very responsive and helpful. Very nice pool with bean bag and pool bar. Outstanding for taste and variants of breakfast. Good combination western and local foods. Vallet parking provided."
1685,Fabulous hotel,50,October 2017,"Everything about this hotel was great! We had a friendly speedy check in and got a free upgrade! The room is really nice and super clean, and the AC is perfect! The free breakfast is so good! So many different options and the lunch and dinner menu is great too! We actually opted to eat here a few times instead of other places because we knew the food would be awesome! The staff is so nice, friendly and helpful! Arta (Taguh trainee) at the bell desk helped us throughout the hotel and is a super nice guy, along with Alfi (Bell desk). Penny, and Hendra and the rest of the pool bar staff were awesome, the pool is great and the entertainment at the pool bar is really good too! The washrooms throughout the hotel are super clean always, including the pool one.. the front desk staff was great, especially the manager Ketut Ramu. I appreciate the security check that you have to go through everytime you enter the hotel.. the wait staff at the restaurant is great, Narita was our favourite, remembered our names and our morning coffee order every day! The prices are very reasonable and the drinks and food prices are good also. The location is good, a free shuttle to the beach takes only a few minutes, and the shops and restaurants in the area are very good.. the transport service is friendly and always available also, Ketut was great, we hired him for personal daily tours a few times. You get unlimited water bottles just by asking and the front desk always has chilled bottles stocked available on request.. everyone is very accommodating at the hotel and made our stay better than expected. I cannot say anything but raving reviews for this Hotel a true gem in the heart of Seminyak. We loved it so much we came to stay a second time after we went to Ubud for a few days. Thank you for such an amazing stay!!!!"
1686,Best RESORT in Seminyak with EXCEPTIONAL service!!,50,October 2017,"We are family of 4, recently stayed for 5 nights (2 rooms) with Marriott rewards points. Being a Platinum member, we got upgraded to Suite rooms overlooking the pool, really nice & spacious suites. The resort location is great, the private beach club is only few mins away.
It was hands down the best services from Resort Staff that we've got from Marriott/SPG chain hotels. The resort staff would go above and beyond their duties to make sure we are always taken care of. Priscilla & all staff makes our vacation a memorable one.
The buffet breakfast was fantastic, lots of great choices, my kids love the table tennis, and hotel facilities are in immaculate conditions.
This is the best RESORT in Seminyak area and we will definitely coming back here. in fact, when we stayed in Ubud after leaving Courtyard resort, we came back to this Resort for another night prior going back home, it was very easy decision."
1687,Wonderful Stay,50,October 2017,"This is our second time staying at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. We love staying here and enjoyed everything that the hotel has to offer. We really like the morning yoga at the rooftop, the fire dance and the Balinese dance. Excellent buffet breakfast and Pool Bar.

Mr. John Woolley, you have a great team. They work very hard and will go all the way to please the hotel guest. We feel lucky to have met them.
Pak Ramu from Front Desk.

Terima kasih kerana melayan kami dengan baik. Thank you for making us feel special. We will definitely come back again. You made us feel welcome with your great service and excellent hospitality.

From: Salina & Saim."
1688,An lovely hotel with wonderful staff.,50,October 2017,"We spent a week at Courtyard before going on to Nusa Dua and we were very happy with our decision. The hotel is a lively, attractive place in a good area. The rooms are modern if a little short on storage, room cleanliness very good. It can be a little difficult to find a settee by the pool but we always managed with a little wait. We appreciated the enforcement of the half hour limit on reserving pool lounges, the bars are perfectly adequate and the restaurant is fine. The breakfast is the match of anything we have had in all our travels, basically all tastes are covered however, the thing that we want to highlight is the quality and training of the staff. Everybody went out of their way to learn your name and then they remembered it. This indicates good training and good staff. Our thanks to Omay, Anton, Wida and Gita for their care and service and to John and Grant who oversaw things capably. We will be back.
Dawn and Merv. D. Geelong.Australia"
1689,Blissful stay,50,October 2017,"Bali has become a second home and staying at the courtyard Marriott was like staying with good friends , in a great location.All staff from management ( special mention to Anton) to the breakfast crew , housekeeping and pool staff personified the very
best in customer service.
Check in was a breeze and our room was available for an early check in. With a 7 pm flight we were also provided with a 4pm checkout allowing us to make the most of every final holiday hour.
The room was comfortable and housekeeping took pride in their efforts .
We have experienced breakfast at many Bali hotels including a number of 5 star establishments. Breakfast at the Marriott is a leisurely experience and available until 11. The juice station excels and I will miss my daily detox juice. Every food taste is catered for and the array of tropical fruits on offer is the best I've had anywhere in Bali.
The poolside menu was well priced and food delicious. Staff were attentive and responsive . Icy poles mid-morning were a treat. The acqua aerobics daily session was also great fun.
An invitation to the management cocktail evening was a highlight and made us feel like VIP 's for an evening. We are Marriott members however travelled on a luxury Escapes package which allowed us to sample a wonderful spa massage and many cocktails.
Our stay was faultless and makes it very difficult to return to the real world!"
1690,WOW!,50,October 2017,"We recently spent one night (wish it could have been more!) at this lovely resort and it was amazing! The property is in a great location with very comfortable and clean rooms. The staff did so much to care for us. Grant (manager), Priscillia (guest relations), Wahyu (concierge) and Auli (chef) we among those who insured we were well taken care of in ways that we did not expect. The breakfast was among the best I have ever seen. The shuttle to the private section of the beach was a wonderful benefit. The concierge was quick to help with transportation and other needs. They staff even worked with us to accommodate being picked up at a movie theater, with our luggage pre-loaded, to go to the airport. Wow, wow, wow!!!"
1691,Hayden & Kate Stanton.,50,October 2017,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a week in a deluxe pool view room and highly recommend anyone looking for a lovely place to stay where the room, resort and most importantly the staff are amazing üëå"
1692,Excellent hotel in a great location,50,October 2017,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 3 nights here and really enjoyed our time at the hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful (a particular shout out to Widi) and make you feel right at home. Breakfast is excellent; there's an amazing selection, everything is fresh and the coffee is decent as well. The pool at the hotel is really well laid out and the service for food/drinks from the pool bar is excellent also.
Our room was great - we were upgraded to a pool view and couldn't fault the room at all.
The location is also good for exploring Seminyak and getting down to the beach."
1693,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,50,October 2017,"We stayed in a Deluxe Pool View room for 11 nights. Our room was lovely - clean, comfortable with a large overhead shower. The buffet breakfast was amazing with so much choice. The pool area was also a great place to relax and our son enjoyed the kids club and free popcorn and candy floss. The hotel is well located in Seminyak - within close walking distance to the beach, shops and many restaurants. The hotel also provides a free golf cart to the beach and Eat Street - which is convenient.

Thank you to John and Grant and all the lovely staff at the Courtyard for making us feel welcome during our stay. We will definitely recommend your hotel to friends and family."
1694,Miss,50,October 2017,"Fantastic resort with fantastic Service!! Would highly recommend this hotel .. great atmosphere and facilities. Especially staff, service amazing as you can see here by our Pool BarTender Hendra!!

Great location !! Rooms are great, Spa is amazing and staff so professional. Will definetly be staying here again."
1695,Girls trip!,50,October 2017,Totally in love with this place! The rooms are fantastic. All the staff are beautiful and the service is out of this world. I‚Äôll definitely be back to enjoy a cocktail at the pool bar with our super bartender Hendra.
1696,Omay at breakfast a true gentleman,50,October 2017,"We had 7 nights here and each morning over our stay we developed a friendship with the breakfast chef Omay. He was extremely personable & every morning treated us with plates of cake and friend
Thank you Omay. From Roberto family"
1697,Marriott perfect as always,50,October 2017,"The Courtyard Bali Seminyak was a perfect stay as always through the Marriott group. Great service, great pool, great drinks. Great first time experience to Bali üëåüèº will definitely love stay here again"
1698,"Amazing hotel, friendly and helpful staff",50,October 2017,"Stayed 8 nights at this hotel. We had a room overlooking the pool, which was nice as we could check out if there were empty deck chairs before going down! Was quite busy in general but the pool and pool bar were amazing, the spa was excellent (we had a 60min massage each courtesy of a voucher), very good internet and the staff were amazing. On the last day, my bag was snatched by a guy on a motorbike in broad daylight (lucky it was our last day, we didn't have our passports in there and only a small amount of cash). We ran back to the hotel and they were very helpful with calling the police, driving us all the way to the police station, translating where necessary and then driving us back to the hotel. We spent the rest of the afternoon at the hotel lobby using their internet to cancel credit cards and the staff kept checking up on us and assured us they would let us know when our airport transport arrived. They made the experience so much less scary and much easier to deal with :)"
1699,Excellent Service and Day Trips,50,October 2017,"Aside from the excellent service provided from the front counter staff (Ms. Ulis) or kitchen staff (Ms. Mega), this hotel location provided a great home base for daily trips/excursions to both the north, east or south of the island.

My girlfriend and I were here for a friend‚Äôs destination wedding. The hotel is central to almost everything you will need. We spent several days here before heading to the Bukit peninsula and it was perfect! A good balance to the more rustic accommodations you may experience elsewhere around the island.

Also - It was also a joy to see the kitchen staff smiling, laughing with one another, as they went about their work, all the while providing good service. We guests can be such a pain and so demanding while on holiday. But they seemed to take it all in stride and genuinely enjoy the employment environment at this hotel. Therefore kudos to the management for cultivating such a good work place for their employees!!

We would certainly return to this hotel again!!!"
1700,Value for money and large clean rooms!,40,October 2017,"My partner and I had a 3 night stay at the Marriott in Seminyak recently and thoroughly enjoyed it.
We were warmly welcomed at reception, escorted to our lovely large and very clean room.
Bedding was comfy... balcony is a little small but has a nice couch and small table.
Bathroom was sensational, so spacious and everything you needed.
The hotel offered some great value deals if you purchase upfront credit to use throughout your stay and the pricing on food and beverage for a hotel is more than reasonable.
I will say though... because of the price to stay at this hotel you do get a bit of a mixed crowd... some groups and loud bogans, that is the only thing we disliked.
I had the pleasure of a 90min spa treatment at their in house day spa and that was incredible. Best day spa i have been to in some time and the value for money is fantastic.
All in all for a short stay it was a lovely hotel. Location is also good... short few minute walk to the beach, and its also on a road filled with shops and restaurants.
We had a pleasant stay."
1701,Awesome Hotel and Great Services,50,October 2017,"Our room was excellent and was maintained by the hotel very well. The services and staff in the hotel were brilliant and they often went out of their way to assist us. The driving services was brilliant and we had an excellent time.

I would highly recommend this hotel for any stay in Bali."
1702,Busy modern hotel,40,October 2017,"On first arrival we were pleased with our choice, only a 5 minute walk to the beach and short walk to restaurants, bars and shops. Rooms small but comfortable, pool nice but be prepared to sit extremely close to other guests!!! We found sitting on the grassed area more spacious. Drinks and snacks available to buy but we noticed a lot were using the food truck located at the front of the hotel and also the supermarket over the road. Beds by the pool are on decking boards which can be very noisy and shake your bed when the children are constantly running up and down!!! Breakfast is very good, lots of choice and freshly cooked/refilled constantly. Only snag we had was the room wasn‚Äôt cleaned on a few occasions whilst we were out during the day so had to ring reception then sit on the balcony and wait for it to be done!"
1703,7 night honeymoon,50,October 2017,"What a great hotel! We got upgraded to a pool view room because it was our honeymoon and although we didn‚Äôt book for it, they set up towel swans and chocolates and a nice note. I‚Äôd only vaguely mentioned it when organising a transfer. The staff there are all so attentive and friendly though, after staying I‚Äôm not surprised they picked up on it. The bed and room are very comfortable and clean. The resort facilities are fantastic too. I love the free popcorn and fairyfloss and of course the swim up bar. Only thing I‚Äôd say is be careful if parking your scooter in the parking there as we thought it was secure, but someone took our helmet as the camera doesn‚Äôt face the right way, but hey, it doesn‚Äôt ruins how good it was there."
1704,Great stay!,50,October 2017,Spent one week here with family. Great location (close to beach and shopping). Hotel is clean and is nicely laid out. We enjoyed a great breakfast each morning and spent many days by the pool. Poolside service is fabulous!
1705,Excellent Resort and Staff,50,October 2017,"Top quality resort all round, our 2nd time staying there.
Great for kids, families, couples young and older.
Close to beach, shopping, dining.
Excellent service and staff, particular mentions to :
Suriya
Antara
Sutiarja
Narita
Saith
Will be back again..."
1706,Johan,50,October 2017,"Had a wonderful stay at the Courtyard Marriott. A large family group 10 adults 4 children and nothing was too much trouble from the staff at the hotel for special requests. Can highly recommend this resort.
Johan"
1707,Very well located in Seminyak,40,October 2017,This property is very well located in Seminyak. In close proximity to some of the most happening restaurants and clubs in Bali this resort is a good option in the Seminyak area for those holidaying in Bali. I was on a business trip and as such had limited time to enjoy the property and its amenities/ offerings.
1708,"Comfortable stay, courteous staff",50,October 2017,"Location: 4* - close to many shops and eateries, a bit far from the beach but shuttle is provided

Staff: 5* - courteous and amiable; efficient and eager to please

Room comfort and cleanliness: 5* - very comfortable beds; spacious bathroom with separate shower and toilet enclosures; spacious room with balcony

Breakfast: 5* - varied selection of western and local dishes

Will I return? - Definitely!"
1709,"Excellent Service, Very Clean, and Accommodating Staff",50,October 2017,"Arrived at the hotel after a 22hr flight from New York City and was greeted with some of the best lemon tea EVER! Swift check in and up to the room we headed to find that it was very clean and well kept. Soft beds, plenty clean towels and A/C temperature set at a cozy degree. Because I am a Marriott Rewards member, breakfast was included in my hotel package at no additional cost and I found breakfast to be very tasteful over our 6 day stay at the property. The green detox juice is a must try.

During the day time if you wish to visit the pool, the staff is very helpful in providing towels and making sure you are provided with a menu in case you desire a refreshing cocktail or food. What I found most exceptional about the property was there shuttle service. While there is a cost, I found it more than reasonable and felt more at ease riding with a member of the hotel when being dropped off at the Rock Bar, Potato Head, W Hotel, Airport, etc.

Lastly, the hotel was so accommodating as it relates to our return flight. Being that our return flight didn‚Äôt leave until 7pm, the hotel allowed for a 4pm late check out. Awesome sauce!

Thanks Courtyard Marriott Seminyak! I definitely recommend this property as a place to stay when in Bali."
1710,Friendly and lovely hotel,50,October 2017,"The Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak is a great hotel in a top notch location. The hotel has an amazing pool bar and lounge bar with the friendliest staff. The food, drinks and selection of menu caters for everyone and the buffet breakfast extensive. Chill out on the bean bags or artificial grass area.

There is a mix of guests from toung to old, mainly Australians there. The rooms facing the pool have good balconies and rooms are of a high standard. Bed, pillows were comfortable and bathroom has separate toilet and shower. Very clean!

For kids there‚Äôs free stuff like candy floss and popcorn machine. Heaps of activities and live music with in-house events. The hotel is near beach, shops and a five minute ride to Seminyak Square and awesome restaurants.

For party goers it‚Äôs near a few clubs and walking distance to Bintang Supermarket etc. But you don‚Äôt even have to leave the area it‚Äôs all there. Ketut Ramudayana was the manager on and such a cool guy.

The staff all speak great English and security is great. No one can enter hotel without having bags checked etc.

If you have to check out but fly out at night you can hang around pool and use spa shower etc before you leave for airport.

There‚Äôs also a Gym and spa onsite but other massage places beside the hotel.

Happy hours on offer etc as most hotels do.

A great option for hotel üòä"
1711,One of the best hotel,50,October 2017,"You wouldn't regret to stay in this hotel. Worth all the penny you paid , especially the services and the super friendly staff will guide you thru any of your issue.

The best hotel I ever stayed and would want to give my deepest thanks the front office and housekeeping team that has make my honeymoons so lovely and memorable. Many thanks!"
1712,Amazing restaurant,50,September 2017,"This hotel is amazing from every aspect of it. It‚Äôs very clean, the garden and pool area are very beautiful, the staff are extremely nice and helpful and their breakfast buffet is huge, with unimaginable variety of foods and drinks.
I highly recommend it."
1713,Great hotel in a great location,40,October 2017,"Stayed here in October it was mine and my husband's first time in Bali. Seminyak was recommended as it was busy and up and coming with plenty to do. We then went to Nusa Dua to stay there also to have the best of both worlds.

This was definitely the case and I would highly recommend.

The Courtyard by Marriott was a great hotel, exceptionally clean and had everything you need.

Pros:
Easily accessible to everything in Seminyak but not too much in the thick of it.
Excellent breakfast and so many options. Probably best I have ever seen.
Rooms are clean modern and have everything.
Private beach area reserved for hotel guests only - serve water and towels etc
Free shuttle available to beach and square
Lots going on in the hotel ex October fest.
Hotel takes security very seriously. Scanning bags on every entrance to the hotel.

Cons:
Rooms can be loud if close to the main road with scooters going all night. We asked to move it was fine.

Pool area sheltered by sun in certain spots and not really many beds for a large hotel. However the hotel operate a policy where if you reserve beds and don't sit there for 30 mins they will remove the towels.

One last thing I will say is if your planning on visiting places in Seminyak like restaurants or beach clubs then book through the hotel as you'll get free welcome drinks."
1714,Lovely resort/good location/fun aqua aerobics!,50,October 2017,"Stunning resort and friendly staff! The daily aqua aerobics by Surya is great fun! His enthusiasm is infectious and my partner and I loved his Zumba inspired routine.

(The massages are amazing too)
We'll definitely be returning!"
1715,Outstanding family hotel,50,October 2017,Very warm and courteous. We had booked 3 rooms and the hotel was outstanding....Good food in seminyak kitchen though the vegetarian spread is limited. Well managed pool and good gym. The spa is sophisticated and outstanding too. Very friendly staff and prompt service. A must visit for any family...
1716,Extremely enjoyable stay,50,December 2016,"Very friendly & polite staff, particularly Sai & Chintha who went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. The General Manager was extremely amiable, helpful. Great stay indeed. Highly recommended."
1717,Fantastic Customer Service,40,October 2017,"The Staff are customer focused, very attentive to our requests and friendly. John Wooley is very much hands on. I would like to thank the Seminyak Kitchen Crew especially Arini, Narita, Mira, Vincent, Ayu Puspa Dewi, Rai, and Adi Wibasa. The beach club attendant Surya and Widy are very welcoming. Security at the hotel is very good. I felt safe all the time. Rooms and all the facilities are all tidy."
1718,Great hotel with amazing buffet breakfast!!,50,October 2017,"From check in to check out the service and staff were amazing, happy to help and friendly! The breakfast was by far the best I have seen with a huge selection of basically everything and a fresh juice bar. A big thanks Ayu for the amazing service and friendly smile at the juice bar each morning."
1719,"Awesome hotel, amazing food and location!!!",50,October 2017,I've never felt so safe on a vacation! Staff is great...shout out to John the GM and Pricilla! You're treated with respect and kindness all the time. Security is top notch! Location is amazing with easy access to everything. What a spread for breakfast!!!! Yummy yummy! A 5+ star resort! Highly recommended. Don't miss the beach which is some steps away and the hotel shuttle. I'd an amazing stay! I'll be back!!üå¥‚ù§Ô∏è
1720,Good breakfast,40,October 2017,"Hubby and I just had a week here ,smooth checkin,but the room opposite the pool bar so so noisy from 9am until 9or 10 pm,,housekeeping was average,one day no, toiletries,no towels,we were for ever ringing up housekeeping ,couldn‚Äôt get a sun lounger around the pool towels were on them but nobody on them,we were lucky on our second to last day to get one,but was told by the towel guy we can only leave the towel there for 20 minutes while we had breakfast,yet empty seats were there all day with towels on them ,very annoying,breakfast fantastic,we ate at the hotel twice for dinner and it was reasonably priced and most enjoyable,and the service was very good ,"
1721,Great Hotel! Recommended!,40,October 2017,"The hotel has great buffet breakfast! The staff are very friendly and the rooms are big and very clean! All the rooms face the pool. They have a live band at night by the pool bar, which is relaxing! It's close to some good semniyak shopping and you can also hit kuta beach where the hotel has a tiny secluded area of beach chairs for free of charge. Highly recommended !"
1722,Great Breakfast & Strategic location!,50,September 2017,"The breakfast is great, there are a lot of choices of western & asian foods. The location is very strategic in the heart of Seminyak where the beach & shops is within walking distance. The staff is very friendly and they remember your face, even your name!. You can start your day with free yoga 3 times a week at the rooftop with a view! The room is nice and comfortable,big pool area and live music at the pool lounge in the evening. This is my second time staying at this hotel and happy to be back again! :)"
1723,"Beautiful Resort, Great Location, Amazing Staff",50,October 2017,"We (Wife and I) are at the end of a wonderful 8 day stay at this lovely resort. We have stayed a a few other resorts in Bali and elsewhere over the years but this one is now firmly our Bali favourite. We had a pool view room on the 3rd floor and it was delightful, modern and ooohh so comfortable. I have slept beautifully in the comfy beds. Seperate bathroom, large shower and well appointed. Tea/Coffee/Fridge/TV and Safe in the room together with a desk and WiFi access. Only thing missing was pay-for-view movies. The restaurant is delightful and breakfast one of the most amazing buffets we have experienced. They even have a speciality steak restaurant in the evenings. Excellent air-conditioned Gym adjacent to the Spa. Our massages were very, very good and the therapists were of a very high standard and delivered highly professional and wonderful treatments. Ambiance in the Spa was just beautiful. There is a free shuttle which takes you to various locations around the area including Eat Street and the dedicated beach area for Resort patrons. The pool is something special with three differing areas in the long cascading design complete with fountains and beautiful gardens. And, big plus, there are ample numbers of lounges, umbrellas and bean bags to relax on. Swim-up bar and aqua aerobic classes if you wish to participate. One end of the pool is shallower for the little ones and room for parents to relax and oversight. It's away from the bar area and a bit quite'r. Outside the Hotel there are shops, restaurants, bars, legitimate and honest money exchanges, supermarkets and a short stroll to the beach. And as always, all the facilities in the world don't achieve much without the input of the people who make up the staff. They are just incredible. The most beautiful, friendly and professional staff ever. Always smiling, nothing is too much trouble, and they are clearly happy in their work. Thank you to John and Grant and all the wonderful Staff at the Courtyard for a lovely vacation, we had a wonderful stay and hope to be back again in the not to distant future."
1724,Amazing,50,October 2017,"What a great surprise from a Courtyard Marriott. The rooms are big, new and clean. The service from every single employee at this resort is absolutely wonderful. The resort is beautiful with a great big pool and a perfect buffet breakfast. The location is great as well. 5 minutes walk from the beach, or they will take you in a buggy to their small beach club for free. I‚Äôve stayed in many areas in Bali from Canggu or Seminyak, to Medewi, or Ubud. This place is the best. You can have a big villa with a private little pool for the same price, but you risk spending your holiday in a moldy place (speaking from experience). This was such a great experience! We spent 10 days with two kids and we all loved every minute!"
1725,Another fabulous holiday,50,September 2017,"This was my second stay at The Courtyard. Rooms are very clean and serviced daily. Staff are very friendly and helpful, always got greeted in corridors and asked if everything was ok with my room or did I need anything. I attended free yoga classes a few days a week, a nice surprise is that they take you to the rooftop if the weather allows. Such a great way to start the day. I loved hanging out by the pool and having cocktails from the bar in the pool, great variety and reasonable prices. Good security within the hotel as well, always felt safe and never had any problems. Will happily stay here again! I was on my own but couldn't help notice how family friendly the hotel is and the great options they have for kids!"
1726,Fabulous!!,50,October 2017,"We stayed at this resort for 9days and it was amazing.
The location was good. Beach, restaurants and shops are close. The room was nice, food was excellent and all staff members were friendly and helpful. Anton who is F&B manager was really friendly and suggested many attractions of Bali. He made our holiday better and easier.
I highly recommend this resort, if you plan to stay at Seminyak."
1727,holiday stay,50,October 2017,"Greatest experience of all time. Fantastic staff, management can't do enough and are the most hands on and approcable I have experienced in a holiday. The breakfast is the best in Bali. The restaurant is open all day with a different theme most nights. Transport is right at the door and world class shopping and restaurants are an easy cart ride minutes away. The beach is a short stroll or ride away. The hotel has a private area on the beach where the sellers are not allowed."
1728,Holiday & a Wedding,50,October 2017,"We were over for a wedding a Canggu & wanted to stay close to shops, beach and good food. Not disappointed at all. Beautiful, clean and comfortable def recommend for family or couples (stay higher up)"
1729,Heaven in Bali,50,October 2017,"From the moment we arrived for our honeymoon until the second we left, we loved it! The staff were so lovely (especially Maga, she was always so friendly) and rooms were really nice. We loved the pool, the bar atmosphere and also enjoyed lounging in the park area on bean bags whilst listening to the live music. The resort is conveniently located central to everything and the staff were helpful in directing us to where we wanted to go. We ate at the restaurant (breakfast was incredible) and used the retreat. Both were fantastic! Even though we were there on our honeymoon, we noticed that the resort was also very family friendly. We will definitely be bringing our two young girls back. Absolutely loved our relaxing time away... thank you!"
1730,If In Seminyak stay at the Courtyard,50,October 2017,"We stayed at the Courtyard in Seminyak Bali it is a first class hotel breakfast‚Äôs are amazing
John the general manager went out of his way to look after us
It is within walking distance of lots of shops and spas and it‚Äôs a very interesting area of Bali
The beach is fantastic and Highly recommend it"
1731,Bali heaven,50,October 2017,"Located 5 minutes walk from Seminyak beach, this is our third visit to the hotel .With each visit we love the staff, the facilities and the royal treatment we receive.
What a pleasure to walk into each area of the hotel and be greeted by first name. Breakfast buffet superb.
Rooms spotless, comfortable beds, balcony overlooking the pool.
The pool itself offers shaded areas , plenty of lounges, a great bar, live music and accommodating staff to wait on you hand and foot.
We will be back, having been looked after by Grant Young and his exceptional staff"
1732,everything at your fingertips,50,October 2017,"From the moment you arrive ( amazing security) till the time you leave ,everything is at your fingertips. best location , great pool vibe with swim up bar, lovely spa, private beach with towels and lounges only a shuttle bus away.
room modern and comfortable ( i did get a pillow topper because i like a soft bed)
breakfast was the best i had had anywhere in the world. taco food truck yum and the steak restaurant offered great food ( would have liked sav blanc by the glass other than plega)
local beach ,shopping , restaurants, and seminyak road ( my fav shops) all in walking distance or by shuttle .
i had an accident while i was in bali this time and the marriott went out of there way to make my life better. provided wheelchair and car for hospital pick up and airport. visited me in hospital with flowers fruit and food. ketut ramudayana the office manager organised everything and is an asset to the marriott!!!!
third visit to bali and best hotel, we will be back!!!!"
1733,Amazing breakfast!,50,October 2017,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night and were really impressed!

The complex was clean and tidy and very modern. We were also impressed by the facilities within the room.

Breakfast was fantastic! I‚Äôve never seen such a large choice before. Everything was covered."
1734,Bali Visit,50,October 2017,"All staff are really professional and amazing one among them is Pricilla.

food is really good .Courtyard by Marriot is a wonderful resort that is very much clean, offering a very nice fit-out and facilities. over all excellent and planning to bring my family for holidays."
1735,"Fantastic Holiday, wonderful staff in a great location",50,August 2017,"Hotel: Courtyard by Marriot is a wonderful resort that is exceptionally clean & tidy, offering a very nice fit-out and facilities. We stayed with our 2 small children (2.5 & 8mths) for 8 nights.
Room: The room was good size without being big, featuring nice finishes and bathroom. It was comfortable through a little cramped when we added the baby cot. Next stay I would potentially look at a 1 bedroom suite.
Our room was ground level (Deluxe Pool Terrace) and we could not ask for more ‚Äì the back door opened within 3m of the pool (kids pool end which was perfect for our family).
Location: The location is great. Not far from the beach or bars and restaurants. You can walk or get a taxi.
Note - The hotel offers a shuttle service to both the beach (where they have a small private area with sun beds) and eat street which is a nice bonus.
Staff: Brilliant staff all round. I have stayed in many resorts and the staff here would be the best, particularly in there interaction with my children.
Restaurant: Breakfast was very good with plenty of options with both western and local options.
We had two dinners at the resort during their theme nights (Indonesian Market & Seafood). The market night was great, it was outside in the open air with many difference food stations setup like a night food market. The seafood night was just ok without being great.
Facilities: The pool was large and split into 3 sections & levels (bar, main section, small shallow children‚Äôs pool). The gym was well fitted out. The onsite spa was also very nice.

We are looking at booking again for next year."
1736,Not much to complain about.,40,September 2017,"everything about this hotel was great. location even though it was not on the beach, it was only a short walk to it. breakfast was great with plenty of choices each morning. pool was good sometimes hard to get a deck chair. but the outstanding thing about this hotel was its staff. I found that they bent over backwards to help you with anything you wanted or needed help with."
1737,Great hotel property great location,50,October 2017,"Very friendly, accommodating staff. Rooms are spacious and super clean. Marriott rewards members get free breakfast daily before 11am, so that was awesome. The restaurant that is inside, Seminyak Kitchen, is good for daily bites on the go and the room service (pic included) was good and fast. The spicy veggie bowl was so tasty! Cabs are always lined up waiting in front of the hotel. Tourist friendly! The pool and outside bar is a great relaxing space as well to get some rays and drinks."
1738,Amazing!!,50,October 2017,"Amazing place! Beautiful, friendly staff and brilliant customer service. We have two young children and the staff were wonderful with them and so accommodating to us and our whole family. The rooms were cleaned beautifully everyday and nothing was ever too much trouble. The pool was lovely and food and drink service while laying on the sun beds was fantastic! Loved this place!!"
1739,What more could you need???,50,September 2017,"I checked in at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort September 18 2017 and stayed for 7 days. I wish I had stayed a little longer because it exceeded all expectation. It is a hotel for all - families, a young couple, an elderly couple, hens, bucks or just a quick getaway for a few friends. I stayed in a room on level two over looking the pool with my boyfriend. It was spacious, very modern and clean. The buffet breakfast at the Seminyak Kitchen was gourmet. There wasn't anything they didn't offer when it comes to breakfast. Obviously I felt sick of eating by the end of 7 days, but the food range was fantastic. The staff were amazing. I didn't think people could be so helpful and kind. Any time I needed a restaurant or Beach Bar reservation, they had it covered. Also in a lot of great places in Seminyak, if you mentioned you are a Courtyard Marriott guest they give you a free cocktail with dinner! My favourite thing about the hotel would be the pool and pool bar - for several reasons. The bar staff were fun and a pleasure to be served by, the pool menu was so good, the cocktails were tasty and the music made the atmosphere great fun. My first day here I spent 7 hours in the pool! Anyway - I can say much more but you would be silly not to stay here. What more could you need???"
1740,Good enough hotel with strategic location,40,September 2017,"""A hotel that caters for everyone"", this is how the hotel markets themselves. Judging from the crowded pool and the age spectrum of the guests (from families with little kids to 60+ couples), this hotel is a favorite for many people, most of them seem to be Aussies. But for me such a busy hotel meant late check-in time (almost 4 pm) and a feeling that you're anonymous.

The room had a standard design and standard size (i.e. not that big). Amenities were OK, however the clock/iPod dock/radio in my room didn't work. I had no problem with outside noises, perhaps because the room was on the 3rd floor and facing the courtyard, not the street. Facility-wise, the hotel has it all (pools, gym, spa, kids' club) and there are regular events like BBQ party and yoga session to make your stay more interesting.

Special mention for the lavish breakfast, with a great selection of food that covers Indonesian, Western, Indian, and Chinese dishes, a juice station, and a dessert counter complete with ice cream. It could get quite hectic in the morning, yet the service was timely and attentive."
1741,Good for Short Stays and adults,40,October 2017,"Courtyard is a great hotel in Seminyak. Great for exploring the beach and local eat street near Seminyak square. There's buggy rides to these places. We did enjoy the buggy ride service to the private beach which is a setting of about 30-40 beach chairs near hotel Indigo beachfront.

The room can sleep 2 adults and 2 kids however the room design means the light shines bright through the glass bathroom door making it hard for kids to sleep and there's no way to hang anything to block it out. Rooms are definitely smaller than other ones I have stayed in for families but make do when most time is spent out doors.

2 international powerpoints.

Breakfast is nice.

Free popcorn and candy floss is also a good spinner with the kids.

Kids club is rudimentary and this hotel is more for adults than families. That said it's a decent hangout for a while before heading elsewhere in Bali.

Adults frequent the Bar and there's a big population of Aussies there from as far as bundaberg."
1742,Anniversary Holiday,50,September 2017,"Great hotel. Beautiful rooms. The staff & management could not be friendlier. Great location. At the end of the street is the beach & the other direction is shopping.
We mentioned it was our anniversary on booking and they had a beautiful flower presentation and cake on arrival. Fantastic restaurants in the area too. Would highly recommend Courtyard Seminyak for their daily activities, happy hour, water aerobics, free flowing popcorn & fairy floss and the buffet breakfast was absolutely amazing. Everything you could want for breakfast! Everything!! There was seafood market night on Saturday nights and local Balinese food by the pool on Thursday night which made it convenient if you just wanted to hang around the resort.
We actually lost our phone whilst enjoying the live music one evening and all ground staff went into immediate search mode. The phone was found and brought to our room within 10minutes."
1743,Only problem was the noise,40,October 2017,We had to move room the first night because the noise of people waking up he first flight of stairs was too loud. The top floor was better but the. Kids yelling at 5am in the morning woke us. We really enjoyed the hotel and there service was great. The location superb and the room service was so tasty. Only let down was the noise and the pool bar never got our cocktail orders right. We ordered lots but never got a round completely right.
1744,June 2017 visit to Seminyak,50,June 2017,"Stayed at the Courtyard Bali Resort in June 2017 with my sister and had a great time. The rooms were lovely and very clean. The staff were always friendly and accommodating. The location was very convenient to the beach, and there was daily transportation to and from the beach and never had an issue with waiting for them. We had ordered room service a few times and the food and promptness met expectations. We had a room on the ground floor by the pool and I was surprised at how quiet it was in our room with everything that was happening at the pool. I would definitely stay there again."
1745,Courtyard by marriot seminyak,50,October 2017,"Its not like the pictures on the internet, but its really good , the hotel has on big pool with a bar .. you can drink and smoke in the pool..great staff, service is great and very fast. The room is not big, but very clean bathrooms are clean .. I didnt go to another hotel in seminyak but I would go there again"
1746,Could have been better,30,September 2017,"We stayed at this hotel for the last three days of our trip to Bali. I had high expectations based on all the good reviews I had read. When we arrived we were given a small soft drink/shot and a refreshing towel, which was a nice touch. However the next two guests that arrived to check in, were offered an alcoholic drink! Surely you should treat all your guests the same? This treatment seemed to continue throughout our stay, we went to get lunch and they had complimentary nibbles being handed out, and these were offered to everyone other than us. Seemed strange but perhaps just a coincidence.

The pool is good, although due to the height of the building it does lose the sun early in the day. Breakfast is AMAZING, definitely 5 stars. The hotel is very clean and has great security so we always felt safe. Our room was facing the road which meant it was very loud at night time, so try and get a room facing the pool if you stay here.

What has really dissapointed me is that the hotel took a deposit in case we charged food/beverages to our room and on check out we were told that this would be refunded in 2 days, almost a week later and I am still waiting for them to refund us.

Our stay seemed to be lacking the 5* service."
1747,Me and my son,50,October 2017,This is delightful... as soon as we walked into the foyer my son was impressed. The staff are courteous and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. We had a twin room over looking the pool. The pool is great with great poolside service. Breakfast is great! Plenty to choose from. I have absolutely no complaints. I would stay here again. I am coming back in April and will be staying here!
1748,Excellent resort,50,July 2017,"My wife and I spent 8 nights there, it s a relaxing resort, has access to the beach with access on WiFi, plenty of activities in the hotel: special dinners and shows.. good gym and spa center, relaxing pool area..
There is just one thing I didn't like that almost everynight at 9 pm, everything will be closed in the hotel,
I would like to review the waiter in the breakfast area: SUTI , ask for this man, he s the best"
1749,"Amazing hotel, service & staff",50,July 2017,"We normally stay in the cheaper hotels of Legian, This trip was a celebration of my wife 60th birthday so decided to select a more upmarket hotel. Wow! very impressed with Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. We are now spoiled and can not wait to come back here next year. Great rooms and in a great location for good restaurants and the beach.
Most of all the staff make this hotel the best place to stay in Seminyak. Highly professional and always always smiling.
Highly recommend this hotel"
1750,Courtyard Marriott Seminyak,40,September 2017,"Courtyard Marriott

1751,Stay here !,50,September 2017,"The hotel is in a good location. Only 500 metres to the beach and the wonderful sunset bars along the beach. The resort offered transport to their own private beach with lounges, cold water and even icy poles. It was located more towards the Double Six Beach only a 5 minute ride. The resort also offered transport to Eat Street. I found that the resort had everything you needed - fantastic breakfast - cool bar - great pool - and even a taco VW van located near the enterance. We stayed in room 230 which is right above the pool bar area and at times it could get a little noisey with the music turned up, but in reality you don't stay in your room anyway. A Luxury Escapes deal included unlimited drinks between 4 - 5pm and the staff were really obliging and didn't skimp on making sure you had adequate drinks. My partner loved her massages at the Spa (better than any on the beach or other day spa centres). The traffic is thick through all areas of Seminyak and Kuta, that's the way it is...but the taxi fares are so cheap it's not worth complaining about. At times it's quicker to walk. This resort had great friendly staff and I compliment management for having such a good team."
1752,Top Class Resort,50,September 2017,"I was looking for a change of venue for my trip to Bali this time around. So glad I did. From the moment I arrived at this very popular resort, I knew I was going to like it. The staff were exceptionally friendly and not one thing was too much trouble for them. My room, a one bedroom suite was immaculate with a TV in the living area and bedroom. Plenty of room in the bathroom and the bed was perfect. The Seminyak Kitchen restaurant is great for a snack or main meal. They specialise in a ""Meat Shop"". Two nights that I ate there, the steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potato was to die for. The pool bar is also good value with two Happy Hours per day and really friendly staff. Top Margaritas. The front of the hotel has a quirky and hip Taco Wagon and the security is also top notch with every person being required to go through a metal detector and x-ray machine for their bags, each time they enter. It is not a cheap getaway hotel, however, if you want true value for money and the feeling that you are in fact the customer, this resort is the way to go."
1753,Very good,40,September 2017,"Courtyard Marriott was a great hotel, reception on our arrival was very good, staff are very friendly, the breakfast was very good also, catering for many nationalities.
We had a pool access room which I recommend it was great..
The hotel is very child friendly, my 4yr old granddaughter loved the kids club, and my 14month old grandson, the staff are wonderful to the children in there.
However it's such a shame that I didn't like the location, trying to get to Seminyak shopping strip is a nightmare!! What should be a 5 to 10 min taxi ride is 30 mins with the traffic, I haven't been to Bali for 3 years, and I really noticed the traffic chaos around Seminyak ,I won't be staying there again ....
3yrs ago I stayed at The Stones Marriott in Kuta, a much better location, and the hotel was amazing."
1754,The best staff ever,40,September 2017,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms are well appointed. The location is great, about 500 meters from the beach, with a shuttle service to the hotels beach site. There is also a shuttle to the central eat street. The highlight of our stay were the wonderful and helpful staff throughout the hotel, especially those on Reception. It was my wife's birthday while we were there and Reception arranged for a cake to be sent to our room.
The food was fantastic, a breakfast that wanted for nothing and a great steak at the Seminyak Meat Shop.
Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable."
1755,Best Hotel & Great Staff,50,September 2017,"this place is amazing, i had such a good time there. my stay was wonderful since when we arrived, our room was clean and tidy, good wi-fi connection and the food in the restaurant it's really good as well and also i'm so in love the swimming pool! the location is excellent, many stores around and a short walk to a very happening beach for sunset happy hour. staff was friendly and helpful. gonna come back soon!"
1756,Amazing!!!,50,September 2017,"We stayed at the courtyard Marriott for 4 nights as part of our travels around Bali and I can't explain how amazing the hotel and its staff are!!!
The breakfasts are incredible, the staff can't do enough to help you and the vibe is so nice and chilling.
They provide a free shuttle to the beach where there are sun beds and water available. Nice gym, great activities in the day and shows each evening. This is a hotel you have to stay in. We stayed at the Melia in nusa dua after our stay at the courtyard and that was supposed to be 5*... it doesn't even compare to the courtyard Marriott, the courtyard was far better. Would love to return. Thank you courtyard seminyak for an amazing stay!"
1757,Relax and restore,50,September 2017,"I first stayed at this hotel with my family when it had just opened in 2014. We found it to be superb. Three years later and I have just enjoyed another stay here, this time while traveling solo. This hotel is run by a first class management team and charming staff whom make every effort to create a wonderfully relaxing and welcoming experience to their guests. The hotel is stylish and nicely appointed, has a great dining facility, and a fine location by which to explore the area."
1758,2017 summer holiday,50,September 2017,"This was my second 15 night stay at the property, and it feels like arriving home the minute I step in the lobby.

The Reception staff are always friendly, welcoming and ensuring you have the most pleasant stay

Love the good variety breakfast options with fresh juice bar at your request, served by the smiling team, who are happy to chat and offer local insight about places, shops and restaurants to go to.

The swimming pool is a popular spot to relax during the day, and has a cool atmosphere. The pool bar is first class along with the staff.

I had a medical incident during my visit which required a hospital stay, this was all arranged by the duty manager the staff even accompanied me and collected me after my stay. they ensured i was not left alone in a strange surroundings. For this I can not thank everyone involved.

Courtyard Marriott Seminyak is my favourite and preferred place to stay when I am in Bali, and the staff consistently deliver exceptional service. Definitely looking forward for my next stay"
1759,Great place to stay,50,September 2017,This hotel is in a great position just a short walk to the beach. In the middle of the shops and surrounded by restaurants. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. They keep everything so clean and keep maintenance up to date. What a fantastic breakfast every morning and great restaurant and poolside bar. Fully recommend.
1760,Simply amazing in every way,50,September 2017,"This is truly an amazing resort, our family had the best time. It is the staff that make it 5 star. Nothing is ever a problem, going beyond every time. Both of our sons got quite sick ( viruses from outside of hotel ), weneeded to call the doctor who was here in literally minutes. They even called 20 minutes after the visit to see how treatment was going. The staff even sent fresh fruit and a letter for our children. The pool is great and the service manager Abbit has the best team. Always so happy and a real reflection on how happy they all are here. The final night we had dinner in the steak house restaurant and this was without doubt the best steak me and my wife had. Jul our waiter was brilliant. The resort is central to everything really and they have a little private spot on the beach too for the hotel guests only. You will not go wrong at this place. It's simply a great experience. Thank you to all staff for everything."
1761,"Fantastic hotel! Friendly staff, great location and superb facilities!",50,September 2017,"I recently stayed at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort having just arrived in Bali. I was so impressed I decided to return for a few nights at the end of my trip!

I am fortunate enough to regularly stay in nice hotels (mainly due to my job), but it has resulted in me being an extremely fussy customer, who pays great attention to the finer details!

I was a girl travelling alone and I could not have felt safer and been made to feel more welcome! On my first stay I arrived in the evening, there was live music in the bar and a really good/ relaxed atmosphere! I was welcomed by the team, and given ice tea (I could have had a beer or water either) while they were organising my stay! The team took my bags to the room for me, the room was spacious, fresh and very clean!

On my first morning in Bali, I enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the hotel, there was such a great choice! They had various difference cuisines, local and Western which was nice as they catered for all their guests, they had a wide selection of juices (I loved the detox juice and they added ginger for me), they made coffees to order (I had a perfect flat white)! I was so delighted to see they had Nutella and Bonne Maman raspberry jam, it‚Äôs the little things that count when you‚Äôre travelling, right?

After breakfast I went to the concierge who were more than willing to help book trips, taxi‚Äôs and boats, for pick-up from other locations I was staying during my time in Bali, this was very valuable as when I arrived I had little planned for my 10 nights in Bali!

On my return to the hotel at the end of my trip, I was very unfortunate to be quite sick. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to the staff who were absolutely amazing in caring for me. The hotel staff had an in house doctor and nurse who they arranged to come to my room. They both stayed a couple of hours and treated/ monitored my condition, they provided all the drugs I needed and returned the next morning to check-up on me! Thankfully, once I was on the mend, I was able to enjoy all that the hotel had to offer again.

I did yoga on the rooftop at 7am which was really enjoyable and after breakfast I took a buggy to the local private beach and shops (thanks to Hardi, he was fantastic in getting me around)!

Other Good Points:

- The hotel was super clean and the rooms were a great size, very spacious and a nice selection of body wash etc.)
- They do yoga a couple of mornings a week
- They have buggy‚Äôs to take you around the shops and restaurants in the local area and to the beach
- They have taxi‚Äôs on call which you can get anywhere you want to go at reasonable rates (traveling alone this was important as I wanted to know that who I got in a car with was reputable)
- Their lunch menu is great and food was really nice
- The pool area is really fun and is located in the centre of the development

The only fault I found (so minor) was the mini bar in the hotel room was not stocked! I could have asked for this and I know it would have been seen to immediately, but I think it‚Äôs good to have some wine in the room and snacks that you can have on the spot (they do have complimentary water)! However, I appreciate other people like to have the fridge empty so they can chill their own purchases so this is prob. more of a personal preference! Maybe it's an idea to ask guests on arrival if they would like the mini bar stocked?

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, and I will most definitely return on my next trip to Bali!

Thank you to everyone who made my stay extra special! :-)"
1762,"Best hotel, excellent staff",50,September 2017,"Was in Bali for 5 days for strategic meeting and our team stayed in Courtyard Marriott Seminyak.

The rooms are well appointed, staff are friendly and very professional. Food? It was amazing and very generous in its serving size.

Kudos to Tiffany, Ayu, Ingan for making sure that meeting arrangement are met. Heartfelt thanks also to staff of Seminyak Kitchen. They always made sure that they take care of your need during breakfast.

Also, General Manager, John Wooley was there to make sure that guest are enjoying their stay.

For those Trip Advisors follower, if you‚Äôre in Bali, this is the hotel for you. Value for money, beach is within walking distance and there‚Äôs a lot of stores to cater to your need. Please come and enjoy their hospitality.

Thank you Courtyard Marriott for a wonderful stay and see you soon."
1763,One of the best in Seminyak,50,August 2017,"Everything about this hotel is really nice. I expect less and yet I got much much more than I thought, especially with the rate lower than other hotel with the same class. Fully satisfied with the service, staffs, cleanliness and bedding quality. My favorite is the breakfast. If you stay there, I would suggest to it a try. They serve a lot of variety, good quality foods.
The pool site has a big area to chill out, get some tans, and there's an open bar next to it.
Will definitely go back to this hotel on my next stay."
1764,"Friendly staff, good location to town & beachs",50,August 2017,"One of the most friendly hotel in Bali. Choose between Relaxing pool or simply walk 5mins to Seminyak Beach side. The breakfast selection was amazing, you will be spoilt for choices. Most importantly they tasted good as well. The hotel also provided buggy services to their own beach area or other junctions so that you can save 10-15 mins walk."
1765,Feels like HOME,50,September 2017,"It was my fourth stay at the property this year, and it feels like arriving home the minute I step in the lobby.

The Reception staff are always friendly, welcoming and ensuring you have the most pleasant stay

Love the good variety breakfast options with fresh juice bar at your request, served by the smiling team, who are happy to chat and offer local insight about places, shops and restaurants to go to.

The swimming pool is a popular spot to relax during the day, and has a cool atmosphere. The management has really improved this area by offering bean bags around the upper pool and the lawn.

Courtyard Marriott Seminyak is my favourite and preferred place to stay when I am in Bali, and the staff consistently deliver exceptional service. Definitely looking forward for my next stay

Thank you for pak Ramu for the upgrade and the treats, and also Ibu Augustine for organising the late check out seamlessly."
1766,Great hotel,50,September 2017,"This hotel is a few blocks away from the beach and minutes away from all of the Seminyak shopping.

Highly recommend this hotel for adults. Super clean, beautiful and has high security (you have to walk through a medal detector every time you come back to the hotel)."
1767,Best Hotel in Bali,50,September 2017,"I recently stayed at the courtyard Marriott in Seminyak with my daughter for 7 nights. We have stayed before and were definitely more than happy to stay again at this great hotel. Again the hotel exceeded our expectations. The minute you walk in you are greeted by lovely staff and they are willing to go over and beyond to assist you.
We were met by Priscilla at reception who showed us personally to our room and pointed out all the room amenities and what the hotel had to offer. All the staff are so helpful and always wanted to please the guest. John the General Manager is amazing. You see him walking around the property all the time talking to guests and helping staff by picking up plates in the Seminyak Kitchen at breakfast to helping out at the pool area. Nothing is too much trouble. I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. Thank you Courtyard for another wonderful holiday. We will be back hopefully soon."
1768,Nice nice nice!,50,September 2017,"We booked Courtyard in Seminyak for four days, it was really nice. Food is really good, tip: bintang chicken bites! Lovely pool and WiFi is very good. 2 minutes walk to the beach and very close to shops and restaurant. Really nice location. Rooms are really clean! In the end of our trip we booked another 3 night here because we loved it.
Special Thanks to Astiti, really friendly, very dedicated and a great personality!"
1769,Retired,50,September 2017,It is the best courtyard we have ever been. All the staffs are friendly and courteous. The room is spacious for both of us and full of amenities that we needed. I would greatly recommend to my families and friends. Thanks to Sutiarjan and Juliartawan who served us well at breakfast.
1770,9 Days of Smiles & Bliss,50,September 2017,"Recently my Mum and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak Bali. We had a nice long stint of 9 days...which was brilliant. Room was lovely...mum particularly loved how the clothes cupboards were in the bathroom....so it was a one stop shop to get ready each day... especially when sharing. Lovely comfy king single beds
Our own balcony overlooking the pool.
Amazing choices for breakfast that went until 11 am...so no rushing...and something different everyday...always greeted with wonderful smiles and visited by chefs with little treats to try...you could even have icecream for breakfast...grab a takeaway coffee on the way out. 1 long pool divided into 2 sections...one with a pool bar , fun music , beanbags , water aerobics at 11 am everyday...a great grassed area with umbrellas and beanbags. A great outdoors bar area for light lunches and 2 happy hours every night with live music...great for a nightcap and wind down after dinner. Fun food truck to grab a light lunch and take back to the pool. I joined in a painting activity that was for kids !! I joined in a meditation session on the hotel roof on the night of a full moon...we also enjoyed an Indonesian banquet under the stars. They have a golf cart that drives you go a small private beach area...with cold water , towels & wifi..with daybeds and umbrellas and a place you were left alone to relax. The golf cart also dropped you to other places like the top of Eat Street. Day spa was amazing. Popcorn & Fairy floss available when ever you wanted it. Always service with smiles... everyone so helpful with booking restaurants for us... helping to open my suitcase I had accidentally altered the code for...I needed a wheelchair at one stage... nothing was too much trouble. The whole place is just , happy , relaxing really well located , fun and welcoming. We had a most wonderful holiday and we will be going back 100%"
1771,Exceptional service at Courtyard by Marriott,50,September 2017,"A year ago, we enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Resort so much that we decided to go back with our friends. The welcome that we received was again exceptional. The service of top standard. After talking the resort up to our friends, we were not disappointed as they were all in agreance that our stay was amazing. Every morning for breakfast we would be greeted not only by huge smiles, but also by name., and have our table prepared for our group. The management team, starting from John Woolley to Grant Young and Made have done an amazing job to create such a fine tuned resort of this high level. A special mention must go out to Widi for making the best juices at breakfast. Will be be back? Deinately! A big Thank You to the whole team who really looked after us.........Anna, Nick, Nathan"
1772,Beautiful Hotel,50,September 2017,"We (family of 5, kids aged 13, 12 & 7) spent 7 days at The Courtyard Marriott Hotel in Seminyak. Lovely appointed hotel with great facilities, rooms beautiful and clean. We had 2 interconnecting pool view rooms on first level. The pool access rooms look great but were not available. The Wifi always strong.

Kids club great for Miss 7 but Mr 12 & Mr 13 not really impressed... teen activities could be better.

Security at hotel was tight which I loved. Always felt safe. Hotel is in busy area, close to shops and only 5 min walk to beach. Hotel has buggy that will chauffeur you down to beach & private beach area.

Pool bar was lovely with live music into the evening. Astiti is an amazing staff member, as are all the lovely staff. Astiti talked with my husband and I, telling us about her life and family which was really interesting. The Marriott staff always take the time to assist you, great people!!

The breakfast buffet is amazing and we loved The Indonesian Cuisine in the garden on Thursday night!! Delicious and great value!!

Thank you Courtyard Marriott, we will return!!"
1773,5* Service and facilities,50,February 2017,"Amazing staff, breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff always there to help (despite some rude guests). My son loved the pool bar and keeps asking me to go back to Bali just so we can stay at that hotel! Would definitely return"
1774,Birthday surprise,50,September 2017,"Wife and I plus a few friends spent a week here in early september. We have all been to bali numerous times prior, but i personally liked this stay at the Courtyard Marriot. Staff were excellent from check in to check out, breakfast was devine, and the kombi at the front is an eye opener. Rooms were great, clean and tidy. The pool bar is a must, either in the pool or just sitting in the undercover area. Management were visible at all times walking around the complex greeting guests and chatting. Close access to shops and beach, if you dont feel like walking you can use the complimentary buggy at the front of reception and they will take you there. A very big special thankyou to Chinta, who was working at the pool bar that week, very pleasant and professional, always smiling and helpful if you needed to know something. Highly reccommended by me and my wife. Cheers"
1775,"Lovely hotel, Lovely staf",50,September 2017,"Had a really nice stay. WiFi was really good, Lovely pool (only one side sun, one side shadow. The room was really clean and also the fitness (with airco). Good place to stay, cause it is like 2 minutes to the beach and in a busy streets with shops and restaurant. Only thing, we had a room with view on the busy street, we heard a lot of horn (toot)"
1776,Was the best honeymoon,50,September 2017,"We stayed at Courtyard. Our stay was absolutely perfect. The best decision we made was to select this hotel for our honeymoon. The staff were amazing. The facilities were great. The best feature was how close the beach was to us. Had a great great time. Definitely coming back for more!
Cheers to bali!"
1777,Excellent--but,50,August 2017,"We stayed here recently in a group of 8 celebrating a friend's 80th birthday.
The staff were just amazing, just so friendly and obliging.
Our poolside room was great, always clean and well maintained.
Pool bar was excellent, even though music always seemed to be too loud.
.
Breakfast was amazing, with just so much choice.
Only negative was it has taken 3 weeks to get our security bond refunded involving our Bank"
1778,Well worth the money,50,September 2017,The resort was chosen for family and friends who were attending a wedding. It was excellent with staff attentive and amenities spot on. Food was great and breakfast amazing. Nothing too much trouble and staff try to speak English in helping. A close walk to the beach and feeling quite relaxed. Would return again and recommend the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak.
1779,10/10 resort - home away from home,50,August 2017,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriot in the last week of August, for a total of 7 nights. It was our first time in Bali and from the minute we stepped off the plane, everything was absolutely amazing.
What makes this resort particularly great is the staff. They are so friendly and helpful, constantly greeting you and making sure your stay is one to remember.
The rooms are perfect, the bed is very comfortable and the air con worked fantastic. Not to mention the huge shower!
The layout of the pool area is great with the swim up bar, beanbags around the edge and an abundance of staff to cater for all your needs. Happy hour was particularly enjoyable with an acoustic duo that were not only great singers but were very entertaining.
The food was great, breakfast every day was always packed but there was never a short of food.
I would highly recommend this resort to anyone travelling to Bali - the location is great, close to everything. We will 100% be returning to stay at Courtyard Marriot on our next visit!"
1780,Hard to find fault,50,September 2017,"This resort would be hard to find fault with. Amazing breakfasts, lovely friendly staff throughout the resort ,great pool, awesome facilities, fantastic location - just a short walk to the double six beach, Eat Street and many shops. Would not hesitate to stay again"
1781,As usual top notch,50,September 2017,Not long back home after another holiday at the courtyard Marriott in Seminyak . Hotel ammenities excellent though I think personally the bar area could do with a makeover it's now looking a bit tired now . Food as you expect was excellent breakfast amazing . Staff were fantastic especially Rudi Ayu and laugh a minute Aggi hope I spelled it right as she really was so happy to see us again they remembered us from our stay over Xmas and New Year just past this hotel is must stay in Seminyak we have stayed in a lot in Bali but this is our favourite thank you all every one of you for making our stay special cheers
1782,Wonderful Stay,40,September 2017,"Just returned from 3 weeks at the Marriott. Found the staff to be very accomodating and friendly. John (General Manager) interacted well with all guests. The resort was very modern but we missed the traditional Balinese style. The only negatives we thought were the limited amount of sun lounges around the pool that we understand is a result of the size of the property and the accessibility around the property if you had a pram.
Whilst children were made welcome we felt the hotel was more targeted to a party atmosphere and if you are looking for a family resort perhaps look at a hotel with larger garden area.
We appreciated the security and felt safe in the hotel at all times. The kids loved the free popcorn and fairy floss!"
1783,Loved our first trip to Courtyard Marriott,50,September 2017,"My partner and I went to Seminyak for a wedding but besides the wedding we knew we would spend most of our time in the hotel so we wanted a hotel where we didn't have to leave and we made the right choice.

Walking in I loved the added security before entering the hotel and checking you each time you return it wasn't annoying at all it made me feel safe, inside the lobby is nice and open and you can immediately see the lovely view of the garden and pools.

We stayed in the 1 bedroom Deluxe Pool Room which I was worried would not be big enough for an 8 night stay but it was a decent size and very clean. The bathroom was very modern with huge rain shower which I loved! Plenty of space for luggage and clothes too. The balcony looks directly over the pool and nice space to sit out at night.

The main reason I booked the hotel was the reviews here boasted the Best Buffet Breakfast in Bali and we were not disappointed.. such a large selection, never ate the same thing each day as there was so much to try and loved having fresh juice each morning.

The Restaurant, pools, pool bar, Zanti spa is everything you need in one hotel and of course amazing service at each and the staff are so friendly and quick to help with anything you need.

If you do need to leave the hotel the beach is 5 mins away and if you ask the Marriott have a reserved spot on the beach for hotel guests which we didn't get to check out but would come in handy. They also have a shuttle service to take you there. Shops and other restaurants also nice and close.

Would definitely stay here again if we come back to Bali!"
1784,Excellent stay,50,September 2017,"My husband and I have just spent 2 weeks at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak and overall had a wonderful time.
The staff are warm, friendly and helpful.
The food is delicious, especially the amazing breakfast. 10/10.
Everything is so fresh and tasty. Room service, pool side dining and Steak house; all great and very reasonably priced.
Our room was a good size, huge, powerful shower and comfortable bed.
I do agree with others, the towels could do with replacing, getting a bit old and thin and the sheets were a bit rough and sometimes too small for the bed.
It would also be useful to have a drying rack on the balcony.
House keeping did a good job everyday, cleaning our room. Thank you.
The pool is lovely, a bit 'fresh' the first week, but warmer the second.
It is hard to find a spot in the sun on a lounge, with the pool in the middle of the buildings, but did not spoil our enjoyment.
It did get a bit noisy at times, kids yelling and sometimes screaming at the pool, which could also be heard from our room as it echoed. But did not last all day thank goodness.
I enjoyed the Aqua stretching class each morning at 11am, just needs to go for a bit longer!
Security was excellent, bell desk had a golf buggy to take you to nearby places such as beach and restaurants if you didn't want to walk.
Heaps of restaurants, salons, laundry, money change, markets and convenience stores next to hotel. Very convenient.
'What the Truck' taco truck out the front was great, very nice tacos for a few dollars.
Free fairy floss and popcorn in foyer of hotel.
Kids club looked fun and lots of other activities to join if you want to, such as bingo.
Suggest a small area for people to leave books and magazines for others to enjoy while at the resort.....I didn't see one, if there already is.
Wifi was faultless and free everywhere at the resort. TV had a decent selection of channels.
Fridge is empty for you to fill with what you like which is great.
Tea/coffee making in room, bottled water free daily.
Power points by bed for charging phones etc.
Bluebird taxis are the best, $2-5 to Legian/Kuta, on the meter, depending on traffic.
I think there is enough positives about this resort for anyone to have a great time and I would not hesitate to return.
Thank you to everyone there for a memorable holiday!"
1785,Loved this resort,50,September 2017,"We really loved this resort, the location was excellent, the pools were great, the breakfast was the best we have had anywhere, and the service was outstanding, the staff are a credit to this resort & what make this hotel what it is, the General Manager John is always around chatting to guests to make sure they are ok & have everything they need.
A special thank you to Simon from front desk who always greeted us with a smile & a chat and Emile at breakfast who looked after us most mornings, you two lovely young men will go a long way in your careers.
We are already planning our next visit to Bali and will be staying here again."
1786,5 day Seminyak escape,50,September 2017,"Everything was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
I traveled with a girlfriend for a short 5 night girly relax/pamper/shopping escape and the Marriott Courtyard met & surpassed every expectation!
* The rooms were beautiful and super comfortable we actually couldn't wait to jump in at night!
* Service from all hotel staff was a pleasure, one can feel the warmth from management trickles down to very satisfied staff. WELL DONE JOHN (GM)!!!
* The buffet breakfast was AMAZING.
* Pool and atmosphere around the pool/hotel was very comfortable.
* It's definitley more relaxed and quiet within the resort but everything you need at your finger tips. More for couples and families so as singles it was quiet for us, but that was totally fine.
Would most certainly stay again (and bring my two children) feeling very safe and well looked after.
Even considering running a work convention at this hotel (Melbourne to Seminyak) as I know all aspects will be well looked after and John the GM is caring, considerate and very easy to speak with.
It really was the perfect holiday and the hotel was a HUGE part of that."
1787,RELAX...RELAX...RELAX....,50,September 2017,"1st Visit to Bali ....Courtyard Seminyak was everything and more than expected. Staff were so very friendly and always smiling. The staff in the ""Kitchen"" are absolutely beautiful and very very obliging. It upset me to see some guests treating staff as if they were only there for their needs. Grrr. Location was perfect too. The Day Spa staff were just beautiful too. I would definitely pick Marriott Courtyard Seminyak again if the opportunity came around again. Great value also. Thank-you to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful. :)"
1788,Safe hotel with excellent staff,50,September 2017,"Have stayed at the Marriott a number of times and we are never disappointed. From airport pickup through to check in at hotel everything is done with professional staff ready to assist you in every way.

Location is also good with 5 minute walk to the beach and 5 minute walk to the shops. Lots of good well priced cafes are close by with the hotel itself having a good restaurant.
We like the fact that security screening occurs for everyone entering or re-entering the hotel. Can recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a well priced, clean, comfortable hotel with the best staff in Bali."
1789,Amazing hotel experience and awesome location,50,September 2017,"Wow, where do we start! This place is amazing. This has been the second time for my partner and I. We would definitely stay there again!! As we have had such a great experience! All the staff has made our stay so pleasant and welcoming. A big shout out to the bar staff, especially Hendra, from our last trip to this time again he has definitely made us feel so welcomed and he is so attentive towards all the guests. His knowledge and quick service are flawless. Such asset to the Hotel and should be rewarded for the great work he does. Also Peni, who is so lovely and entertaining and makes us feel so elated. She is always there to help us. The head chef Ollie who we met over the few events that the hotel had. He informed us of a seafood night they had on and it was amazing! Every time after that Ollie went out of his way to say hello and chat to us. They just made our stay a wonderful experience. So many cool activities on offer which kept us busy by the pool. The Music in the afternoon is always nice after a big day out. Pool food is incredible but the in room dining could need a bit of a lift. The rooms are excellent and clean. House keeping is amazing as they always surprised us with some sort of towel animal. Which at the end we looked foreword to see what we got each day. Overall we couldn't complain about anything. The only thing I would suggest for Courtyard Marriott would be for the Bar staff to have better uniform as most of the shirts have holes under the arms or look really old and dirty. But you can't beat the Balinese smile that all the staff has and how nice they all are towards us. We hope to be returning soon!"
1790,Best holiday ever thanks to the staff!,50,September 2017,"I recently stayed at your hotel with my sisters, it was my first time visiting Bali and being overseas so I was a little nervous. The second we arrived at the hotel your staff made me feel so welcome and helpful.
I wish I could remember every single staff members names because there was so many that stood out and went above and beyond to make our stay the best.
The staff who's names I do have and would like to thank and show appreciation too are:
Hendra
Peni
Anna
Darsano
Dewa
Jaya
Ayu
Maria
Kejawg
Wika
Alit
Arta

I apologise if I have the spelling wrong on any of the names and also for the staff who's names I never got.

I'll definitely be coming back and recommending to all my friends and family.

Thanks so much

Jess"
1791,Lovely clean and friendly hotel,50,September 2017,Had a lovely room overlooking the central courtyard. Clean and fresh rooms. We used the restaurant for dinner a few nights while there which was lovely food and breakfast had so many choices. Staff are really friendly and helpful. Only downside was the lack of sunbaeda round the pool unless you got up early.
1792,Amazing experience and the best location,50,September 2017,"Where do I start?
This has been the best experience from start to finish.
Best family holiday we've ever had in Bali. From the wonderful managers and staff (especially Ulis and Made) and all the wait staff, even the friendly Chefs who asked about our stay and cooked the most tasty and fresh food. So attentive and polite and went above and beyond to make our holiday a wonderful experience. The staff really made our holiday great.
The wonderful food, delicious drinks and awesome pool. Not to mention the best location. Walking distance to numerous restaurants, bars, beach and of course shopping. We can't wait to come back to this amazing hotel next year. Thanks again for making it such a wonderful first time in Bali.
See you all again next year üôèüèΩüíô"
1793,Best breakfast!,50,September 2017,"Vast buffet includes wide range of juices and pastries, crepes pancakes and waffles well as Indonesian and Western options for hot foods.

Omelettes and Eggs Benedict can be made to order.

Ice cream cones and coffee are also prepared."
1794,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HOTEL,50,September 2017,"Just returned home today from an amazing holiday with friends staying at the Marriott.
Have been to Bali many times but will definitely be returning to this amazing hotel.
Clean....wide range of breakfast catering for all nationalities....Great menu if dining in. All staff extremely kind and welcoming and always assisted with a smile.....
Will continue to go back to the Marriott for sure!
Thanks Hendra for you amazing cocktails at pool bar üëçüèº
Thanks Made Muliana for our chats at breakfast and cocktail party.
Thank you Grant and John for looking after us and our friends.

1795,Best stay ever,50,July 2017,"This was my 3rd visit to Courtyard Seminyak. I have never been disappointed staying here, each visit has been even better than the last !!
The location is great, the service is amazing, rooms are clean, lots of themed events, kids club go above and beyond !
The food is very diverse and you can always find something for the fussy eating kids !
I can't praise the staff enough - I'd like to make special mention of Dedhe and Hendra in the pool bar, they were very accomodating and friendly. Also Pipen, Ayra, Maharani and Leak went out of their way to make us comfortable ! Debbie in the kids club needs a special award for entertaining the kids, she is amazing !!
Tiana in food and beverage was super friendly and always catered for our needs. Ul is in reception was always making our stay comfortable. A big big mention to Pipen in the pool area, she is very polite and helpful, even going out of her way to help with first aide after my daughter hurt herself and on another Occassion helping us understand balaniese language and wanting to learn English - very pleasant young lady !

I will forever be thankful to the courtyard Marriott Seminyak for making our stay perfect !!!"
1796,"Amazing hotel, highly recommend !",50,September 2017,"My self and my partner booked this hotel for 9 nights during our time travelling through Bali. And from the get go we immediately felt like we made the right choice. Upon arriving in the hotel the taxi was searched with a sniffer dog and they also searched the underneath, while going into the lobby area we then had to go through as what is an airport security of bag screening and metal detectors, this had a real feel of security to the complex. When we were checking in we got a welcome drink which was a nice touch. The general manager of the hotel (John) who is an English man seen we were new guests and as we finalised the details at reception and he came over to introduce himself and told us if we needed any recommendations for restaurants etc. they would be more then happy to help. The experience was very professional.
When we got up to the room it was great, room was modern, clean and had air conditioning and comes with two 500ml bottles of water daily. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was fantastic, it was a walk in shower and the shower its self took up half the bathroom it was huge which was nice.... going through previous reviews I seen size was an issue for the room but been honest the room size is quite suitable and standard. The wardrobe space however is on the small side which in it there is a safe and a facility to iron your clothes.
The Hotels facilities, the pools are big and the top one has a pool bar which was nice to sit in the heat and have a drink, throughout the day there is a good atmosphere at he pool with music been played throughout. The pool bar also provides seating outside the pool and serves food which is handy for lunch and is quite reasonably priced. One of the only overall thinks I can bring up is the pool on one side only gets soon in the morning then is shadowed by the hotel.
It's worth to mention that the hotel even though not on the beach they still have a section of the beach reserved for the Marriott that has beds and free wifi, there is also a golf cart which will bring you to and from the beach on a daily bases.
The hotel staff are really pleasant and are always willing to help, from serving food and drink, playing with kids they really do it all."
1797,I have had the most rewarding visit to the Marriott.,50,September 2017,"I have had the most rewarding visit to the Marriott. The Staff have made my holiday extremely welcoming & comfortable especially as I was travelling on my own. I have experienced excellent service in the Zanti Spa with Hari, great service at the Pool Bar, but especially at breakfast & in the evening in the Seminyak Kitchen with Made & his very caring & efficient staff.
Also I cannot fault the variety in the menu, totally satisfied!"
1798,Memorable Visit,50,September 2017,"Booked in here for just over a week and wish we could stay longer. The hotel seems quite new and I think it is only three years old. From the moment we arrived to check in, and were greeted with welcome drinks, the staff have been friendly and helpful. The rooms are kept in spotless condition as is the common areas. Everything in the resort seems to be well organised with many staff about to help or direct you when needed. Can't really find a fault with this resort."
1799,Summer holiday,50,September 2017,"Best hotel experience we've ever had by far. Everything was perfect the hotel was unbelievable in every way you can imagine, beautiful, spotless, spacious and decadent. The pool was enormous, the amenities numerous (spa and 24 hour gym) and the staff simply couldn't be lovelier or more helpful.
The food was amazing, buffet breakfast with a variety to satisfy
even the pickiest of eaters and it was all 5 star quality. The hotel also has its own pool side bar with a range of cocktails and delicious foods to keep you occupied while you soak up the sun or just want to chill out, it's manager Chinta likes to personally make sure everyone is being taken care of and that you want for nothing. We'll be back as soon as I can get more time off work!!"
1800,Great Location and Fun Hotel,40,August 2017,"Really enjoyed staying here as the location was fantastic for shopping, dining and beaching. Room a little on the small side and storage spaces limited. One side of the pool area was often shaded - so it was always a challenge to secure a lounge in the sun. Besides that the staff sensational and food very good. Special thanks to the kitchen staff especially Omay for his chilly omelettes. ‚ò∫‚ò∫"
1801,FABULOUS RESORT,50,August 2017,"My work colleague and I spend 6 nights at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort at the end of August '17. We realised it was a fab choice upon arrival, with excellent friendly security (like airport security everytime you enter - made us feel safe) and a large ultra modern complex with such friendly staff.

The wonderful staff, each and everyone we met - Reception, Bell Boys, all Restaurant staff, Poolside, Aqua exercise, Housekeeping, Spa
would have to say - are the Resort's biggest asset! Had such help and advice from many. Nothing was a problem.

Absolutely enjoyed every breakfast - you name it, it was there from hot Asian dishes to many many kinds of fruit, along with everything in between like eggs bacon etc. Have to give a special thanks to Jessica and the boys who made yummy omelettes in a minute. Dinner menu also first class.

Rooms are spacious with high ceiling and lots of shelves to store your belongings. Excellent aircon and as for the bathroom,
Wow! Is what I said to the largest shower ever. The frosted exterior strip window for outdoor light, was a credit to the architect! Space for personal items on large vanity. (Missing the bidet toilet now home)

We enjoyed swims everyday in the large pools and just relaxing on the loungers after busy times exploring Bali.
Really appreciated staying 'onsite' at no extra charge, after noon check-out to
relax swimming etc and using Spa
Bathroom before leaving for airport.

All in all everything was just 100%
A massive Thank You to everyone of our friends at Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort
See you all again one day!"
1802,great stay,50,September 2017,"Hotel superb, food absolutely delicious and staff are wonderful. Special mention to Hadi for his generous help also to Ana Ari Rai and Dewi for their excellent service. Hotel is located close to beach either by shuttle or walking. Lots of restaurants nearby."
1803,Best stay!,50,September 2017,"I recently stayed here for the second time and both stays could not have been better! All the staff are so accomodating and friendly. The room, food and all the facilities are perfect! Thanks so much to all the staff, especially Hendra, Penny and Anna, and Ayu and Widi in the restaurant.
Couldn't recommend it more highly, thanks again Courtyard!"
1804,"Best hotel, best staff!",50,August 2017,"I recently stayed at the courtyard for 9 nights and can't thank the staff enough for their hospitality and friendly service.
The facilities are great, rooms clean and comfortable, plenty of activities for all.
Thank you so much to Hendra, Penny, Anna and all the pool bar and restaurant staff for making our stay so great.
Each and every staff member there were fantastic and deserve all the praise they get. Would highly recommend the Courtyard to anyone travelling to Bali. You won't be disappointed."
1805,Amazing Holiday,50,September 2017,My family of 5 (3 girls under 12) just spent 9 nights at the hotel and had an absolutely fantastic stay. From the minute we arrived until the time we checked out the service and the staff were brilliant. A special thank you to Anna (F&B Manager) and to her team and Ari at front of house. My girls were so sad when our stay ended. It was truly a memorable holiday. We are already planning our next stay at the hotel. Highly recommended.
1806,Excellent - A must!,50,August 2017,My husband and I have just enjoyed a very relaxing holiday at the Courtyard by Marriott. Our room was on the 5th level and had an amazing view of the gardens and pool area. The pool bar was a particular favourite of ours each evening with very attentive staff - we would particularly like to thank them all (Cinta and co) and for the extra attention they bestowed on us - very much appreciated. Also highly recommend the very extensive breakfast - it is fit for a king.
1807,If I could give 6 stars I would !!,50,September 2017,"My wife and I recently stopped in to the Courtyard for one night on our way to Ubud. I've stayed at many Courtyard hotels around the world and was expecting something similar.
What surprised us was just how great the hotel facilities are, including the super comfortable rooms and amazing pool and bar area.

However what made our short stay so memorable was the 5 star+ service from every single staff member including the General Manager.

Wonderful and really appreciated. We will absolutely stay again!!"
1808,relaxing holiday,40,August 2017,"Best breakfast and the staff are fantastic and friendly. The room was comfortable however for a 5 star hotel the pillows were flat and the towels/robes threadbare. they could do with an upgrade.
Otherwise a lovely stay."
1809,Excellence,50,September 2017,"You will want for nothing at this hotel. The hotel itself, the facilities, the staff are all amazing. There is security, including a sniffer dog and bag scanner. There is also a food truck, just inside the grounds serving the best coffee and tacos. As I said, you won't have to ask for a thing. This hotel is also well known for its breakfasts, everything you may have heard it is true. Words can't describe how excellent it is. Will definitely be returning ASAP."
1810,Absolutely loved it!,50,August 2017,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this resort for ten nights in August for our first overseas trip together and we had the best time. On arrival our room wasn't ready so we were offered complimentary food and drinks while we waited which was great service. Rooms were always clean and made up, great bathroom and clean towels every day. Free bottles of water everyday and cold bottles brought to your room on request.

Breakfast was great! Really good variety and it was always full so there was plenty to choose from.

Finally the staff were amazing and couldn't do enough to help you! I can't wait to go back and stay at this hotel ü§ó"
1811,Fantastic Hotel,50,September 2017,"This was our first hotel out of 4 in Bali to celebrate our honeymoon. We had chocolates on arrival to the room. Very clean and contemporary room with plenty of space. The only downside was that we were given a room with a balcony over looking the street. This was very noisy as the cars/scooters constantly beep their horns. We did mention this to the hotel and at the time there was not another room available until the following day. In the meantime, I bought some ear plugs which suppressed the sound and we were happy to stay in the room.

Pool area was again, contemporary and very clean. Loved the big pool pillows!! Great pool food throughout the day and the breakfast is amazing! So much variety!

Would definitely recommend this hotel and we would be sure to return if we came back to Seminyak."
1812,Genuinely caring staff,50,August 2017,"This was our first visit to Bali in almost 20 years and the first time we stayed in Seminyak. The rooms and amenities were excellent but what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. Unfortunately both my husband and I came down sick, my husband seriously so, and the staff from reception, kitchen and right through to cleaning team were all genuinely caring and interested in our welfare. A particular mention to Narita and Omay at Seminyak Kitchen who sent food to our room and to Priscilla in reception who organised medical treatment for us as well as Tiko who followed through on our checkout to ensure we had all we needed."
1813,Great stay,50,September 2017,"We're love this hotel, good location and close to seminyak beach, restaurants and shopping, good to recommended at stay here in Seminyak. We are always spend many time in that hotel when come to Bali. All staffs are friendly. Breakfast so fantastic, food is delicious, and also many thanks to Mr Anton, assistant f n b manager, he is always welcome, friendly and helpful to us, also staffs like Agus, Emile, Arista and many more.
Also not to forget, housekeeping that always keep our room clean.
We will come back soon againüòç"
1814,Lovely hotel great service just a few improvements needed,40,September 2017,"We have been here for 7 nights leaving tomorrow. First the positives. Staff all amazing helpful and very polite.
Security fantastic people that complain about having to be scanned on the way in perhaps should rethink there stupid comments its for our safety.
Food from breakfast to pool food to seminyak kitchen was amazing the food prices for a hotel are very reasonable and all thr food we had wsz tasty and fresh. We had dinner ome night and had there steak menu. Wow price was great and our rib eye and eye fillet was as good as the top steak restraunts in melbourne highly recommend to try this one night.
The only disappointing meal we had was the seafood banquet night we both didnt think the seafood and variety was that great have had alot better at other resorts but thats the only negative review we have regarding the food here.
Rooms nice and clean spacious enough for 2 people wouldnt want anymore in room as its not a huge room but comfortable. Bathroom lovely and spacious. Perhaps a little more room for clothes would be better but not a big issue. One negative i do have is no where to hang your wet bathers we had a pool access room and there's a little rail in the outside area but only big enough for one pair of bordies or bikinis. Need to have even a drying rack of some sort.
Pool lovely but one whole side does not get sun so its like musical chairs trying to get sun. Staff do keep an eye on people that try to reserve lounges and not using them so that was great to see.
One last point check in was smooth but we arrived at hotel at 2.45pm and our room was still not ready till 4.30pm yes they dud give us lunch while waiting which was a nice gesture but for families that have children would need to check in to rooms once they arrive after many have been flying for over 6 hours.
Overall great resort would recommend it to our family and friends if they were going to bali.
One last thing and not the marriots fault at all but as an Australian and used to beautiful beaches dont expect nice beaches near by we had a private driver whom took us to all the so called best beaches and we were very disappointed."
1815,Perfect hotel for families!,50,August 2017,"I always stay in Marriot Hotel wherever i go vacation.. because im member of Marriot..

1816,Not what you expect ! üòÄ,50,August 2017,"Wow, as Marriott platinum elite members and having stayed at countless Marriott hotels and brands across the world, this literally was one of the best. Not what you expect from a courtyard, superb facilities, super friendly and courteous staff. Wonderful restaurant , where we had some great steaks and where every morning breakfast was a joy on the terrace with a huge variety of food to select from . Spotlessly clean, great pool and lounge area, what else could you ask for ! We will be back , of that there is no doubt."
1817,What an amazing place to stay!!!!!!!,50,September 2017,"This is our first stay at the Marriott during 30 years of travel.

We were overwhelmed by the exceptional service, attention and care that was shown by all staff.

This is truly a wonderful place to holiday in with beautiful grounds, entertainment areas and organised activities (if you care to participate)

All age groups were catered for and the courtyard was a relaxing space to chill in.

The room was very nice and we cannot fault the 10 days that we enjoyed. We felt like VIPs and we very much enjoyed the experience.

Thanks to all the staff and managers here.

Chris Bahrend"
1818,Excellent hotel in a great position with an almighty buffet!,40,August 2017,"It was a pleasure to stay at The Courtyard Marriott. The highlight would have to be the terrific open space with a pool on two levels, bean bag area, and comfortable poolside bar with couches and warm tentative staff. It was always nice to return to this point after a long day or before venturing out at night especially travelling in a large group. The balcony room is a must. The poolside rooms seemed at the back end of the hotel and more for families. Our balcony room was very roomy and comfortable with large overhead shower and bathroom, table, chairs, ironing board and an iron! The balcony itself was large, with a nice view of the pool and had a comforter. The Kingsize bed seemed like a queen but we really didn't care, close enough. The Wifi was always strong and fast anywhere in the hotel. Really can't fault the experience from the moment we walked through the clean modern entrance and friendly security. We bought a package in the newspaper which included vouchers for free tacos, coffee, cocktails, a free meal in their nice restaurant and also two 60minute Balinese massages in their very good day spa. It was well thought out and a great value add-on for guests, also, the tacos from the Taco Truck were particularly delicious. Situated just five-minutes walk from the beach, the hotel also provides a free golf buggy to ""eat street"" and further down the beach. After we got our bearings we utilised it to great effect as taking taxis all the time can get a little bothersome. Make sure you hail Blue Bird Taxis. We found the twenty-minute walk back from ""eat street"", even late at night, very pleasant. Would just like to point out how wonderful and welcoming all the Balinese staff were in the hotel. It seemed very genuine and they often took extra care and interest in your life which was warmly reciprocated. Also, special mention to the wonderful hotel staff at the truly extravagant breakfast buffet.
Of note was a large mini mart across the road, also a Combank ATM and plenty of shops around. Also, if you want a good massage, Spa Bali just around the corner from the hotel was our favourite. Enjoy!"
1819,"Beautiful stay, great staff",50,July 2017,"We have been at the courtyard Marriott for the past 8 nights in a poolside studio room. We bought a ""luxury escapes"" package which was generously loaded with extras.

We used the fitness centre nearly every day. It's very clean and well equipped. Complimentary water & towels etc.

We had 2 couples treatments at the Zanti day spa which were a real highlight. The decor and ambience of the spa is next level beautiful. The staff had great massage skills and everything was so relaxing and professional. Their attention to detail was extraordinary.

We had the regular Saturday night ""fish market"" dinner which was gorgeous. Our table was waited by Gita who was also often our waitress at breakfast. She was so lovely and friendly. Also very helpful regarding some places to visit and Balinese life in general.

The daily breakfast was another huge highlight. Every ethnicity was catered for and the range in each section was extensive. Most offerings varied from day to day which is great when you have a week long - or longer - stay. I can't say enough about the breakfasts. They really were quite spectacular.

Apart from front desk and bell hop assistance, there's usually some managerial-type staff wandering around the hotel complex who were extremely helpful with various issues, eg we were going to post some things home and needed advice on where to go, whether it's worth doing that versus taking them as extra baggage etc. These staff were easy to identify by their white shirt & brown trouser uniform.

There was only one criticism we had. The toilet in our room had an extremely bad smell. A maintenance man came and attended to it but the issue was never resolved. Aside from that, the room itself was very good. Loads of power points where you'd want them and an awesome bathroom. The kind I'd like to have at home!

Staying at this hotel was such a great decision. Security was high but not over-bearing or inconvenient. Just an all round great vibe and good time.

Thanks Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak. We would love to come back some time :-)."
1820,Good value for money,40,August 2017,"Overall it was a good value for money
10 minutes walk to the beach and a bit further to the area dedicated to the hotel by the beach
The breakfast buffet is great with lots of options especially healthy ones
The staff is very helpful and cheerful and always adds a smile to your morning
Location is good, close to restaurants, supermarkets and the beach
Two points were not the best, some of the days the housekeeping team didn't do a good job as expected, and the rooms are not always quite as you either can get a room by the street or by the pool and both had some noise at a point in time during the night or the day"
1821,Beyond Five Star,50,August 2017,"This is my Third year that I stayed at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort , as a Platinum Elite member I have stayed at many Hotels around the world , but never have a experienced such customers service as I have at this hotel . John the General Manager and Grant the assistant manger have trained their staff to treat each and every guest like family . There are so many wonderful employees at this Resort from the moment you drive up the bellman Yogi , Parwana ,Krishna and Digo with their happy faces are ready to assist in any way possible . Security guards are the friendliest I have ever met , Juli , Sariani Iva and of course PT Atlawiar . Tony at the front desk will make sure to provide you with the best room possible . The staff at the restaurant headed by Chef Ali is the best Breakfast buffet i have ever had , what a selection of food . Anton is the restaurant manager He will take care of every Culinary need you have and make you feel like you are the only guest there , when he has many guest to attend too . I highly recommend this Hotel to everyone that is looking for a relaxing wonderful experience."
1822,First visit amazing!,50,August 2017,"The moment I arrived I have felt welcome. Yansu and his security staff have helped me accross the street stopping traffic for me. During my 3 week stay the girls at Seminyak kitchen front desk always greeted me by name even bringing fresh ginger tea with honey and lemon when I had a sore throat: Yeani, Ayu, Indah and Dewi J to name a few.

The waiters and waitresses: Mira, Adel and even Agus A and Doni helped me get detox drink at breakfast because I was afraid to drop the glass.

Anton , head of food and beverage has been so accomidating for all my special needs. The food feels healthy and is fresh.

I feel better now than when I arrived from going to gym because Kadek Suyadnya helped me stretch

Housekeeping ,too, is excellent but I only wrote down Darwin's name , unfortunately.

As a handicapped person it truly has been an amazing experience here. The politeness and caring attitude of all the staff is reflected in their smiles!"
1823,Courtyard came highly recommended and we weren't disappointed...,50,August 2017,"My partner and myself stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 7 nights and it is highly recommended. Starting with the positives - the staff are lovely, the rooms are beautiful and we had a pool view room so it was really nice to sit out in the sun on the balcony, as well as enjoy the air conditioning in the room! The pool is fantastic ‚Äì it has a swim up bar and is split into two different sections so it never feels crowded. The breakfast is absolutely amazing, best I‚Äôve ever seen at a hotel before. The location of the hotel is great ‚Äì easy walking distance to the beach but also close to plenty of shopping and restaurants.

Negatives ‚Äì Our inconsiderate neighbours came home at 4am 5 nights out of the 7 and the adjoining door is in a position that if you open the cupboard to access the safe too vigorously, it will bang the door. We did call reception on the first night but I don‚Äôt think they spoke to them as nothing happened. I‚Äôm not sure if they exist, but request a room with NO adjoining door.

Also, despite us hanging the towels up as the ‚Äòstay green‚Äô sign suggested to reuse, housekeeping kept taking our towels daily and forgot to replace them on two nights, we had to call reception. I even put the sign over the towels and they still didn‚Äôt get it."
1824,Best Hotel,50,August 2017,"Room
The room was spotless on the day of entry, and on the days of room service.
All amenities were replenished on quite well and any thing such as water or toiletries ordered on phone to the reception were deoivered very quick. We booked with luxury Escapes and got access to wifi for 8 nights which was super faaaaassssst with Dspeed of 5 mbps.

Pool
The pool is beautiful and cleaned daily. we were told not to jump from the top pool to bottom pool but i did it anyway (secretly). Towels, water and other amenities will be provided easily on call. All in all, I had a great dip in the water.

Staff
All staff was very nice and always calling me by my name which brings the feeling of speciality. although on the room phone they would refer to me by my mums name (can u blame them?) as soon as they picked up the phone.

Spa
I got 2 60 minute balinese massages and they were all very great that relaxed me very well( I timed it and they massaged for about 56 mins both times, just saying. ) They had welcome and exit drinks that were delicious.

Rewards
Ketut the manager also played table tennis with me (he is so f...g good, dont bet money on urself) and said the winner would get a free beer. eventhough I lost he gave me a beer anyway. There is unlimited popcorn and candy floss aswell.

I truly recommend this hotel and hope you all can make memories here"
1825,"Outstanding hotel, with excellent facilities",50,August 2017,"Outstanding hotel. Clean, modern and spacious rooms. Fantastic facilities, including very good restaurant, amazing pool and a full spa.

Stayed for 3 days - wish we stayed longer!

Many hours spent lounging by the pool, with waiter-service (including a call bell from your sun lounger!).

Really impressed - and was sad to leave! Was pure luxury. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again."
1826,The Best,50,August 2017,"The Courtyard Marriott is the perfect choice for your stay in Seminayk.
Location is superb being close to the beach, shopping & restaurants.
The hotel is brilliant in every way and the staff are excellent. The hotel is well planned out and the pools with the pool bar are great fun.
The rooms are very comfortable with quality furnishings and very clean throughout.
The breakfast is amazing with so much choice and speedy service.
Staff at the Courtyard Marriott are first class and I cannot fault the hotel or its staff in anyway.
Would I highly recommend? Yes definitely"
1827,Excellent hotel,50,August 2017,"Location:
Great spot on a mostly quiet street. There is a large grocery store across the road which is very convenient for bottled water, toothpaste etc. There is a Commbank ATM across the road also which will dispense up to 1.5Million IDR. less than a 10 minute walk to the beach. plenty of shopping and casual bars within very easy walking distance (1-15minutes). No sounds of traffic can be heard within the hotel.

Staff:
Very friendly and most speak english very well. always smiling and happy to help.
They came to learn our names and even our breakfast coffee orders!!

Facilities:
The gym is pretty basic but, if your wanting to get into your happy place within the gym it is more than suitable for that. treadmills and cross trainer, some free weights.
The massage and relaxing area is amazing. the staff there are very friendly and great at what they do. I had 4 traditional balinese massages by 3 different women and their techniques were pretty similar with the same high standard of massage.
the pool and pool side bars are great. very accomodating for singles, couples or larger groups. The furniture could be easily rearranged to suit our groups (10 people) needs.
Free wifi for guests. this was very fast and we ended up streaming a few things on netflix one night. no issues with the wifi at all.

Food:
The breakfast was buffet style and a fantastic combination of western and Indonesian food. fresh fruit and freshly made to order juices. oh and that free coffee service with breakfast was pretty good.
The dinner set up of the restaurant was pretty good. The package we bought came with a free dinner. This free dinner was from a smaller, seperate menu but, everything on the smaller menu was great and the portion sizing was great. We left dinner satisfied and some of our group went back on a second night (and paid for a meal).
*I definitely recommend the Bintang Crispy Chicken from the pool side bar. if you like anything chicken and anything crispy, you will love this. If you like a spicy mayo...you will become addicted to this! haha.

Rooms:
The rooms are designed for couples with a king bed. some of our group (me included) were singles sharing. We had the king bed and the additional of a single bed in the room. There was still plenty of space to be comfortable. We really only slept in the rooms though due to plenty of day trips and relaxing pool side. The rooms have a bathroom with a the shower and toilet, both with glass doors though so minimal privacy if you want to use both the shower and toilet at the same time.
TV with foxtel, and a mini fridge."
1828,AMAZING RESORT,50,August 2017,"What an amazing hotel, this was out 4th stay at this resort & it just keeps getting better.

We are regulars to Bali & this will definitely be our preferred place to stay. We keep trying to find faults but we just cant.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite on the ground floor it was so spacious, comfortable & clean. Housekeeping were great. I would highly recommend the suite as they are so much bigger & being on the ground floor we had direct access to the pool.

The breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen was the best breakfast in Bali (& we have stayed in many other hotels & nothing comes close to this place) everything you can think of they have & if they don't just ask as they probably will be able to get what your after.

They have high security at the hotel when entering which made us feel extremely safe staying there.

There reception staff were all very friendly & very professional which made check in & check out a breeze.

The pool area & the pool bar & staff were also of a high standard, very friendly & a few even recognised us from our previous visits which made us feel very special.

A very special mention & a big thank you to Grant Young, Operations Manager, the communication with you prior to coming & helping us with our preferred room was over & beyond what we expected, you made everything even better than what we imagined. You are an asset to the Courtyard Marriott.

I very big thank you to you & we look forward in seeing you again on our next visit to Bali in March"
1829,Simon,50,August 2017,"Thanks to everyone at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak, the staff are very friendly and offer amazing service when needed. Beautiful pool, nice rooms great vibe!! A big shout out to Anton the food and beverage supervisor - It's great to see someone so passionate about their job and making their guests, like us, feel very welcome."
1830,Right in the heart of Semyinyak,40,November 2016,"A great hotel to stay while in Seminyak, close to the shops, beach, restaurants and pubs. Breakfast in the dining room is a delicious way to start your day. Pool and bar are both large enough to accommodate all."
1831,Birthday,50,August 2017,"Absolutely loved staying in this hotel! There were 8 of us to celebrate my husbands birthday. The room was beautifully appointed, and we were lucky enough to be on the ground floor, poolside. Love the staff, all so friendly. A very special thank you to Grant Young, Operations Manager, I think, who looked after me when I suffered a case of Bali Belly. A delightful young man, and an Aussie!"
1832,Excelent service,50,August 2017,"Was very amazing service, meet the Finance Director Mrs Elisabeth, I cant believe she is Finance people. She must be a marketing or sales director.

She was a very customer centric...

Other staff was excelent"
1833,First time to Bali,40,August 2017,"We booked this hotel from booking.com and great feedback found on TripAdvisor. I can confirm the great feedback of this hotel. Room is what we expected from the photos - spacious, modern and clean. We booked a city view room which was a little noisy with traffic so those that want less sound I would reccommend a resort view. The resort staff are very friendly. Resort facilities - Pool, bar, resturant were 10/10. Our rate included the breakfast which I would also recommend as there is a massive selection of Asian and western foods getting you started for the day. Had a massage onsite which was slightly more expensive then what you can find off site but a relaxing luxary and professional experience. Used The gym also which was extremely well equipped. The Resort is located 2mins to beach or the hotel can drive you down in their cart to their designated area. The guys at the tour desk are helpful - can arrange tours, transport which great for us first timers. Will return to this property next time."
1834,Disappointment,30,August 2017,"The marriot courtyard seminyak is a very poor designed hotel
The noise level is hight in and out of the room ,wooden floor slats around the pool children running pass on the boards .The noise with kids playing and music echoes around the building as the pool and bar are built into the 4 walls of the reluctantly designed hotel dont even think about getting a ground level pool room ! The access in and out of the pool is hopeless especially if you are elderly and iam in my early fifty's and fit will go as far as to say dangerous ,Only 1 side of the pool gets sun and its a fight to get space and a sun lounge its hard to get around the place ,The rooms are very clean very nice and modern the food is especially good very good indeed . The staff were great and helpful ..
üòîüòûüòØ"
1835,Amazing!,50,August 2017,"So impressed with the service and facilities! Breakfast was amazing, the best I have ever had at a hotel. Great for families, the complimentary popcorn and fairy floss was great! Can not say enough wonderful things about this hotel, will definitely be staying here next time we are in Bali. Well done to Grant & the wonderful team!"
1836,What a breakfast!,40,August 2017,"We spent our first night at this Hotel after arriving at Bali and it was a great experience. The room was clean and the service exceptionally friendly and assertive. I had birthday that day and they brought me a little cake! Thanks again for that little treat. :) But the absolute topping for me was the Breakfast. Lots of tasty food to choose from at high quality and Delicious (freshly made) juice. We'd come back for another morning treat. Tip: If you want to dine outside, go to Mama San."
1837,Top Bali Hotel,50,August 2017,This hotel has everything you need and is reasonably priced as well. The staff are friendly and there is a relaxed vibe. Its probably more of a family hotel but we still enjoyed staying there on a boys trip. The included breakfast is huge and the room service is tasty. I would highly recommend staying here when in Seminyak.
1838,Courtyard by Marriot review,30,August 2017,The service of the hotel was decent but had a few flaws! First of all the house keeping was not the best since they didn‚Äôt clean properly and we had to call them a few times for problems with the cleaning and the stains on the bed sheets when we arrived. But generally the hotel is a nice place to be and gives you a really chill vibe!
1839,Harry Potter room under the stairs (and pool),50,August 2017,"First impression, not good. Our Pool Access Room, No 161 was not actually an access room unless you could climb the almost 2 metre high wall at the side of the pool. It was not even a Pool View Room, it should be called a Pool Wall View Room. Bean Bags are placed on top of the wall and on our first day we had people sitting on top looking down on us in our little outdoor area. When they started drinking, smoking and swearing we had to leave.

Things improved from there, we got a couple of bean bags to sit outside of our room and most people sitting on the wall faced into the pool and were considerate of other guests. I initially wanted to rate the hotel lower because of our early experience. However, the staff are amazing and the rooms are comfortable, well layed out & clean. Seminyak Kitchen serves the best breakfast in Bali and a special thankyou to Nara who cooks the perfect fried egg and Widi at the Juice Bar. Also, What the Truck is well worth a visit for a great Taco.

We tried the Meat Shop on our last night and we were not disappointed. Great service from Arin, the meat and chicken is very tasty and tender, well presented and highly recommended. There is also a top class Fitness Centre, with plenty of room and a good variety of equipment and free weights.

We had requested a room on the sunny side of the building away from the poolbar. Well we got the sunny side but we were right next to the poolbar. It was noisy, music starting at about 10.00am but a positive from a negative we got to see a lot of the poolbar staff. Pipin was amazing, always smiling and always asking how we were even though she was flat out busy most of the time. She is a real credit to the Courtyard Marriot.

Also, a special thankyou to Adiey who is one of the hotel's taxi driver's. I had a few trips to the dentist while there and Adiey provided a great drop off & pickup service even though I could not give him a set pickup time. Very patient!

In the end we were sad to leave because everyone you come into contact with at the Courtyard Marriott are so nice and make you feel very special.

Highly recommended but avoid room 161 unless you get a great deal."
1840,"Its always great, friendly, reliable and consistent",50,August 2017,"There are 5 of us we always get interconnecting rooms and the hotel always come through with these. Breakfast buffet huge improvement on last time in taste and spread, the staff a super friendly and the overall hotel is clean and relaxing....... always plenty of kids to mix with our kids....... We love staying here and positioned well for the beach."
1841,Felt like we very special people at this hotel,50,August 2017,"This was a very upmarket hotel to those I've previously stayed in previously. I found it similar to the Starwood Four Points in Penang in 2014. They made you feel an especial person from the time you crossed their doorway.

There is high security to access there premises from when we arrived in a car through a barrier gateway. They had security going over the car and checking underneath with mirrors and then any luggage or bags brought into the hotel had to go through the security x-ray machine and people through the scanner doorway. This seemed like overkill initially but in today's climate I did feel protected while in the hotel.

The reception desk person also gave me a personal touch by walking me to the room after confirming my luggage would be brought up too. The staff were happy, friendly and solicitous throughout our time at the hotel. We booked the room for my Mum, who is in a wheelchair, so we requested a twin room, a walk-in shower and lift access to the room. Everything was as we requested.

The US' and Asia's major hotel chains the Marriott and Starwood have amalgamated so we had the best of both of their servicing.

The breakfast was an amazement for me after staying in other hotels with a basic buffet brekkie this was like being in a European high end cafe. (See the pics). They catered for multiple nationalities and it was fabulous to behold and taste :)

I loved the personal touch by the staff there and they made us feel like we were very important people.

We didn't get to experience the pool but there were lots of areas to enjoy including a pool with a bar, kiddies pool area and a main pool with chairs all around. There was a grassed area where you could sun-bake and could create a picnic area with the family and one evening they had fire dancer entertainment there too. They have a kiddies entertainment area within the hotel too.

Highly recommend this place. Family and couples friendly."
1842,lovely staff and great hotel,50,August 2017,"Fantastic atmosphere, very warm and friendly staff, exceeded our expectations, beautiful pool area great live music and beautiful clean room. Nothing too much trouble, good food. We had the most delicious steak and ribs at the Seminyak meat shop restaurant at the hotel. Special thankyou to "" Gita "" for her very professional and friendly service. Beautiful young lady who we think will go along way with your company. many thanks from Michael and Jenny (Perth)"
1843,Really good hotel,50,August 2017,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Marriott.
Everything about it such as the breakfasts, service round the pool, gym, massages etc were excellent.
Only issue we had was the temperature of the pool, It just wasn't warm enough especially if it was a slightly cloudy day."
1844,Fantastic resort,50,August 2017,"Amazing facilities, great food but the most impressive was the staff. Welcoming, funny, energetic and very informative of local area. A big thank you to the beautiful poolside waitress named Penny who made our stay a lot more enjoyable, and made the best cocktails in the resort."
1845,Perfect!,50,August 2017,"Currently staying at the Courtyard and it has met our expectations. The staff are friendly and the facilities are well maintained. The hotel manager is very polite.

Rooms have an open and airy feel to them that you sometimes don't get in Bali.

The air conditioning is excellent and we'll regulated without any stale smell.

The rooms are clean, spacious and thoughtfully laid out. Large shower and with good water pressure and the room has 5 universal power outlets.

There is a huge variety to choose from for breakfast, pool area and grounds are well maintained and again thoughtfully laid out.

Highly recommend.

Tip - best view choose the tower at the opposite end of the reception. Level 6 fantastic view and lighting."
1846,"Comfortable,Clean and Friendly staff",50,August 2017,Courtyard by Marriott Hotel in Seminyak had the most comfortable beds cleaned your room every day with all necessities replenished from towels to drink bottles nothing was too much for the friendly staff who treated us like Royalty the best hotel in Bali.
1847,Exceptional service and accommodation,50,August 2017,"This Marriott hotel is the best we have visited so far (from approximately 10 in Europe and Asia). The staff are friendly, polite and helpful. We didn't encounter a single staff member who wasn't happy and enthusiastic in their work. The rooms are clean, well maintained and well serviced. The restaurants provide a choice of acceptable western and Balinese dishes, but the filet mignon in the Seminyak meat shop was superb and highly recommended."
1848,Good place to stay!!,50,August 2017,"We booked in this hotel for 2 nights in Deluxe Rooms. When we arrived at check in counter we were greeted nicely. The lady behind the desk was very helpful, she didn't have Kings Bed Room as Hotel was full occupied. As a good gesture she offered us room credit to be settled at the time of checkout. Pool side restaurant was good and so is Seminyak Kitchen. Although in our room Electric Kettle with English Tea Bags were missing but Housekeeping immediately got it for us when I pointed that out.
The only recommendation is to open Seminyak Kitchen beyond 11 PM. There is no 24 hours coffee shop in this hotel which forces people to use room in dining service."
1849,Feels Like Home,50,August 2017,"Great hotel, Terrific service, very friendly and professional staff.
Loved the room and breakfast.
Allways entertainment happening somewhere in the hotel.
Seminyak Kitchen great steaks and ribs.
Special thanks to'"" Gita '"" for her great service and Professionalism."
1850,Nice hotel with great breakfast.,30,August 2017,"We stayed for some nights at Marrtiott Seminyak at the end of our Bali trip.
The hotel is nice and clean, has very friendly Staff and good service. Thumbs up for the shuttle buggy and the private area at the beach.

The breakfast was really good, but rather crowded.
But- be aware, if you dont like the charter trip kind of feeling- dont go here. If we would have known that this hotel is one of those where the sun beds by the pool are fully occupied by people at 07.00- UK charter-style, while no one is using those until 10.00, we would have considered something else. Also, if you pick one of those rooms with ""pool access"" be aware its just a 1st floor room.

All together, as a couple, we would have picked something else next time. But if you are a big family its probably ok. If you are from UK, you will feel like home, 95% of the other guests are from UK as well."
1851,Best Holiday ever,50,August 2017,Had the most amazing holiday we stayed 6 nights at The Courtyard Marriott. The hotel is fabulous the staff are all so friendly and helpful. I was unfortunate to fall whilst on holiday and break my wrist the hotel staff couldn't do enough for me and made sure that we were fully looked after for the remainder of are stay. Can't forget to mention the fabulous breakfast everyday day. Already looking at are return trip to Bali we will most definitely be staying at the courtyard when we return next year üòä
1852,"HONEYMOON, and we loved it!",50,July 2017,"I would totally recommend Courtyard by Marriot hotel to anyone visiting Bali! We were there for our honeymoon two weeks ago and we loved it! The location was great, close to the beach and to the city center. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a large variety in the breakfast buffet and it was delicious! The room was super clean, super modern and stylish. Everything was just perfect..."
1853,Best hotel I've stayed in,50,August 2017,"I absolutely cannot fault this hotel at all, everything about it was amazing. But let's try and go into a bit of detail here.

The facilities were top notch. Our rooms were lovely with a comfortable and welcoming style and were spotless everytime they were cleaned. The swimming pool was wonderful. The restaurant food was great and the breakfast was just brilliant, best breakfast I've had in a hotel, the buffet was full of all kind of things and all of it was cooked and prepared perfectly. Also the money changing service, the free shuttle bus and the driver service were extremely helpful and reliable.

The staff were so friendly and made us feel comfortable in our hotel and even when out for the day, I felt like if I got into a spot of bother, the staff at the hotel would be able advise and make me feel at ease.

I have to make a special mention here to one member of staff in particular called Hardi who absolutely went out of his way to help us out of really tough situation, I would go as far as saying that had he not helped us how he did, our holiday could have been ruined, but luckily he was on hand to help, so my partner and I were incredibly grateful to him.

I would not hesitate to stay here again and thank everyone at the hotel for their hospitality."
1854,Great place to stay,50,July 2017,"Great personnel, great food and infrastructure, everything is on top level. I stayed at this hotel during my honeymoon. Me and my wife were very happy with our choice. Thanks to all personnel their, especially Prescillia, guest relationships (hope I spelled it correctly)"
1855,Amazing and very central,50,August 2017,"We have had a brilliant time at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort. The staff are so friendly and very helpful. We have been here for a 60th Birthday and a great place around the pool to meet people. There is also a lovely lawn area where you can sit and chill. The area is so central, handy to beach, handy to shopping."
1856,Beautiful employees,50,August 2017,"My husband, nearly 2 year old daughter and I are staying here as our first family trip to Bali (my husband and I have been to Bali many times and stayed at other accommodation). We are very pleased with the facilities, cleanliness and atmosphere of the hotel. Most importantly, the staff are exceptionally friendly. However, a special mention needs to be made in relation to two very accomodating ladies that looked after this evening. After a lengthy delay waiting for our food by the pool this evening (these things happen!) - Cinta and Pipin looked after my family and showed so much empathy. They were genuinely apologetic for the delay in our order (particularly for our daughter), explained what had happened and gave us the most amazing service. Our daughter has special needs and relates to few people in such a short space of time - but she instantly related to both of these beautiful women, whom are a true asset to the Courtyard Marriott! We will definitely be back again üòä"
1857,Fantastic hotel staff is great.,50,August 2017,I have just completed a very enjoyable 10 day stay at the Marriott courtyard In seminyak. This hotel met or exceeded all of our considerable expectations from the comfort of the rooms to the friendliness and professionalism of the staff with particular Pipin who always had a friendly smile for us. I look forward to future stays at the Marriott.
1858,"""Thank you for a great holiday""",50,August 2017,"Hi we stayed in Bali a few weeks ago and loved every minute, and the courtyard Marriott was delightful very friendly and great staff, in particular Kesawa Hzx and Ayu Lestari they made us feel extra welcome, highly recommend this lovely place.
Great location short walk to beaches,Seminyak, and most importantly close to lots of shops for lots of shopping.Breakfast was also great plenty to choose from.

Darren P"
1859,"Great hotel, great staff",50,August 2017,"Stayed recently as family with one toddler. Stayed in 1 bedroom suite which was great as separate sitting area when child asleep. Rooms furnished and styled beautifully. Nice balcony over looking pool. Our room a little noisy as near the bar but it was fine as it quietened down by 9 pm. Great aircon. Handy buggy service to beach and Seminyak square. Amazing choice of goods at breakfast. Staff go above and beyond, are exceptionally friendly and helpful and love kids. Enjoyed all the added extras like welcome drinks, popcorn And fairy floss for kids. Would stay again. Some cool lounges and floating bags in pool to relax on. didn't think that much of Seminyak in general, more expensive and less cheap shopping around but this is unrelated to hotel."
1860,Thank you so much,50,August 2017,"I was in Bali last week and have to so Thank you so much to this Hotel.
I was staying next door at this hotel and 2 of my friends was staying at the Courtyard. I had lost my bank card and my hotel would not help me.

So I went over to the Courtyard and asked if they would Help me by using their phone system to call my bank on a reverse charge number. the Hotel was more than happy to help. and I have to say thank you so much.

I wish I chose this hotel over the one I stayed at. I definitely will stay at this hotel on my next trip to Bali over where I stayed on my last trip.

Thaks to the staff."
1861,Great location and Accommodation in Seminyak,50,August 2017,"Great location, handy to shops, beach, good cafes and good restaurants. They have a courtesy buggy that will drop you off if you don't feel like walking, staff are very friendly and accommodating, would recommend upgrading to a pool view room so you don't get road noise. Breakfast is also amazing."
1862,Excellent hotel,50,August 2017,"Really fantastic service. It's not my normal type of hotel. I knew what to expect and it was booked for the last part of our trip. There are a lot of people here, but again I expected that. The breakfast buffet is amazing."
1863,What a place!!,50,July 2017,"This resort is amazing!! Can't give enough credit to the staff, friendly, helpful and courteous. 10/10 for the food, didn't want to eat anywhere else. A huge shout out to the chefand with the extra security i felt very safe. Will definately stay there again."
1864,Best service and best staff,50,August 2017,"I stayed here from the 5-13th of August. The staff are so friendly. Rai and the waiters from the hotel were always punctual. ""What the truck"" employee ""Ardana Bracuk"" made the best tacos and always made sure that I was satisfied! Which I was. Definitely would rate this hotel and business 10/10! Can't wait to come back one day üòÑ"
1865,3rd Visit to the Courtyard,40,August 2017,"Top marks for effort, the staff at this hotel do the utmost best to satisfy the customer, a success in this instance.

I arrived there on 2nd August 2017 and was unhappy to be given the allocated room somewhere at the back of the hotel I had never been. When I complained and suggested (to cut to the chase) that I should upgrade myself to a suite I had before, I was told the hotel was totally full. I was moved to another unsatisfactory location, being promised that come the next day, I could move to another room more to my liking. Indeed this happened late the next day with profuse apologies for my inconvenience. Everything from then on was good!

I would like to commend Fransiska (front desk staff) for all her efforts to placate me. She was most resourceful and kept me updated, despite having to deal with a full house. She even personally helped me to move. Thank you Fransiska!

I would also like to praise Dewi, bar staff at Seminyak Kitchen. Having dinner there one evening, she must have noticed I was coughing and offered me a cup of black tea with ginger and lemon to make me feel better. She followed this up at breakfast time and practically whenever she saw me. You were a big help, thank you Dewi!

I was at the tail end of my Sydney flu and it took this holiday of no stress, doing nothing, taking in some sun and accepting some TLC to get me over the 'wrongly timed' illness.

I like visiting Bali where I always choose to stay at the Courtyard for its location - I like walking to 66 Beach and onward to Kuta - the security like no other and the friendly, effective service.

Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen certainly offers a wide variety of choice. I personally like the gluten free section with the bagels and salmon and the little sweet.

Talking about sweets, I liked the Bali sticky rice cake which wasn't repeated the next day. Chef Ramon told me the name of it, he said they do sweets on rotation. I wish I had written the name down - and would love to have the recipe!

See you next year!"
1866,Superb,50,August 2017,"Fabulous location, walking distance to the beach and great eating venues. Also walking distance to best spa in Bali (Home Base Spa). Staff are lovely and cannot do enough for you, big shout out to Hendra at the pool bar who knows how to look after guests üòÄ Breakfast had lots of options, especially liked the juice bar with fresh juices made to order. Would recommend high floor rooms facing pool (at end of pool area away from bar if you go to bed early). Buggy will take you down to beach if you don't fancy walking but it's really not that far. Will definitely be back."
1867,Best Hotel to Stay in Bali Seminyak,50,July 2017,"For first time traveller I would highly recommend staying at Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort. Excellent service, excellent location, great people very friendly and very helpful. I had the pleasure of meeting Chinta who worked in the pool Bar facility. Her assistance and helpfulness during my stay was excellent. Provided over the top assistance in every way. She was always approachable and provided excellent customer service. I will always be grateful for her friendly manner and assistance during my stay.
Thank you so much Chinta for all your support you made my first holiday the best and I know I will see you again soon.

No regrets you will love this hotel."
1868,Incredible Hotel If You Understand the Courtyard Brand,50,August 2017,"If this hotel were located directly on a beach (though they have a little beach access area a 10 min walk away) it would easily be a regular Marriott. Yes, the size of the hotel is compact, and yes the pool in the middle can create noise if you have a pool facing room (hope that you do), but the rest of the facilities and staff more than make up for any architectural shortcomings.

I'm a Marriott Platinum member and I come because I'm treated like a king. Suite upgrade, 20% off food and drink, 20% off the spa (which was perfect, a 2.5 hour men's treatment for $50US), and free breakfast at the previously mentioned INCREDIBLE breakfast buffet. The rooms are immaculate and well designed in my opinion. I mainly choose this hotel because I like to be in Seminyak where you can explore local restaurants easily and not be locked in to your resort (like in Nusa Dua). My favorite part, though, is the swim up pool bar where I basically spend all day.

Lastly, its been highlighted but the service here is like none I've experienced, and its the same everytime I come. Honestly the hotel benefits from the basic kindness and hospitality of the Balinese people, but this hotel has managed to channel that into a second to none level of service. Every single person greets you with the biggest smile, and after a few hours, they have your name memorized. Special shout out to Priscilla at reception who took great care of all of my high maintenance requests, and Ayu at the pool bar.

If you've ever stayed at a Courtyard in the US, you might think you're in for a regular business hotel experience. I can assure you, this one is different and elevates the Courtyard brand immensely."
1869,FABULOUS EXPERIENCE,50,July 2017,"Stayed for 4 nights. Staff very pleasant. Felt very safe with the security.
The musician (solo) at night was amazing.
Biggest praise should be for the F&B staff in the morning. Especially Ayu.
Highly recommended."
1870,Okay resort,30,July 2017,"I dont really know why this resort gets such great reviews! My family and I stayed there a couple of weeks ago and normally when i leave a resort in bali i am incredibly sad but after 7 nights of staying here i had had enough..... Staff were friendly enough, breakfast was good (great variety as everyone mentions) but the hotel is noisy compared to other places we have stayed at in Seminyak. Unfortunately we were there when the hotel was holding a pool party which featured VERY loud music and ended with a guy drunk yelling while walking around the resort. My kids also found the pool way too cold!! It is not heated and as some others have mentioned it is shaded most of the day because of the high buildings surrounding it. There were some good aspects - popcorn and fairy floss in the foyer for kids and table tennis table. I tried on a couple of occassions to make an appointment at the spa but they were busy. Could easily be improved. Overall i was disappointed. Good location though."
1871,Great stay in great location,50,August 2017,Had a great time staying at the Marriott for five nights. The breakfast is amazing and the staff are very attentive. Had a lovely dinner and great service from Widi. Rooms are really clean and it's in a great location.
1872,Nice safe hotel with excellent food and close to all the seminyak action.,50,August 2017,"We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights, (from July 28 to August 5, 2017) to relax and celebrate our weeding anniversary.
The good: Hotel is very clean and every employee is friendly and willing to help.
The girls at reception did a fantastic job getting the right flowers and present for my wife.
The highlight of our stay was, without doubt, getting to meet Patrick David Ramon (hotel Chef), Patrick was always attentive to us, and he cooks the best ""Lamb Rack"" for us on our anniversary day.
The No so Bad: I am one of those person that likes to make my reviews honest, and hence, although I am a Marriott member I was disappointed to found out that on our anniversary night dinner, they can only offer me 3 type of red wine. We finish having white, as none of the red was my liking. This is not a big deal, but for a 5 star Marriott hotel, wine selection was very poor.
In Summary: This hotel is good value for the money (particularly if you get a ""Luxury Escape deal)"
1873,Awesome stay,40,July 2017,"Best breakfast in Bali
Kids club is fantastic. My 7 year old daughter raved about it and was so excited to go there each morning and I had to drag her away at the end of the day ..., happy kids , happy holidays.
Highly recommend"
1874,Noisy Resort,30,August 2017,"While the Courtyard (formerly part of the Marriott chain of hotels) ticks many of the boxes necessary for an idilic tropical getaway, it has some not so good flaws that detract from the whole experience. The resort is clean, well maintained, the staff are friendly and efficient, the buffet breakfast is outstanding, and despite the rooms being on the small side they are quite well appointed. On arrival we were allocated a room on the main street side of the complex, within minutes we were aware of the street noise (no double glazing in Bali), despite being on the third floor, we asked to relocate. The street noise includes taxis honking (all night) to procure a fare from the guests at the entrance of the resort. The noise continues within the resort, a variety of music is played over the speakers within the pool area, including rap, pop and techno. Now having been moved to a room on the inside of the resort complex we were now subjected to music for the day, even while inside our room. It was very difficult to be away from noise and people. The pool area, mostly in shade due to the design of the building (somewhat like a block of flats), is too small for the number of rooms (guests) in the complex. The same can be said for the breakfast area/restaurant, as it was manic with people and kids, and the in-house spa, as it couldn't accommodated me with an appointment any time during our stay. The other thing that was quite annoying was that the bar fridges in the rooms were completely empty. Which meant there was no milk for the cup of tea you might make yourself in your own room. Bar fridges are usually about spontaneous convenience, particularly water while in Bali. Keep in mind when booking accommodation in Bali the street noise issue is not necessarily unique to this resort. In built up areas the traffic is getting worse, and some hotels on busy streets have bars and discos that play music long into the night. If you want a quiet, relaxing holiday choose accommodation that's more isolated, away from the main roads."
1875,Fourth perfect stay,50,August 2017,"Thank you again to Courtyard Marriot Seminyak for another wonderful stay. We could not fault our experience and we find it hard to go past this hotel for security, value and consistent excellence. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by such great staff such as Hardi on Reception who recognised me and greeted me with a warm hug. We utilised the fun daily water aerobics with Rayan leading us through our moves. A lot of laughs and a great way to work off the awesome breakfast buffet!!! The staff and management (John, Anton, Ramu) are definitely what sets this hotel apart from the rest. All the staff are happy to be there and take care of your every need.
Zanti Spa is well worth a visit and has been much improved by the sound proofing since my last visit. It was great to see that guest comments in regards to that one issue had been promptly rectified.
Looking forward to seeing you all soon for another relaxing break. üòÄ"
1876,Affordable luxury at a great location,50,July 2017,"Fantastic breakfast buffet, beautiful grounds and awesome pools. Great location in Seminyak to shop around and dine. Affordable but lush Resort. We have been to Courtyard Nusa Dua as well but this one probably is better for going around."
1877,saved the best till last,50,August 2017,"After a little trouble of a missed booking, and having to change rooms the next day the rest of the stay was great. After returning to the front desk and trying to find out our new room several time, and them keep saying it should be ready in a couple of hours, we demanded to see there manager. He arrived heard our story and had us in a poolside room in 15 minutes. The service in bars and restaurant great, all meals were good. Saturday night is The fish market in the main dinning room fantastic prawns, like mortan bay bugs, and lots of BBQ fish etc etc. This was free in our deal, Anna who we see around the pool every day help you out no end with information on where there were places to eat, things to see, and fixed booking for the restaurant and massages for you. There transport gave you a lift to the main eating street, but there was plenty of restaurants in the street the the Courtyard Mrriott was in. All over we would return it was great."
1878,Best food in town,50,August 2017,"After 3 weeks of lovely -and sometimes a little less lovely- is was so nice to eat at this beautiful hotel in Seminyak. I can recommend the spaghetti Bolognese, the Bloody Mary Burger and the Steak sandwich. All dishes are outstanding. Our very polite waiter Widi made our stay extra pleasant. We most definately will be back here in the future."
1879,"Could have been brilliant, but a couple of flaws",40,August 2017,"On the positive:
Generally an extremely well run, very clean and nicely set up hotel.
Lovely, lovely staff! Everyone was smiling and friendly.
Nice gym area.
The breakfast buffet was really good especially Nara at the egg station (excellent poached eggs) and loved the daily changing booth with special offerings. Plus the table clearing of used dishes was very efficient.
The all-day golf-cart buggy drop off into the heart of Seminyak is super!
We didn't try the food truck, but it was a nice innovation and well patronised by others during happy hour particularly.

On the negative:
The hot water in the rooms was luke-warm to cool in the afternoons and evenings, really not good enough at a resort like this.
Having booked their top-priced pool access room, and having stayed here before, I emailed the hotel well in advance and requested a room in a particular location. So, I was pretty unhappy about being placed in a room opening onto the very shallow end of the pool. Pretty obviously, this is where all the families with babies and little children settle themselves for the day, with the accompanying noise and disruption. As we were a mature couple it was just inappropriate to place us there, plus I can't understand why they ignored my request.
As always, it amazes me that a Balinese luxury hotel prices its spa treatments so high when there is so much competition nearby! I would happily have gone for a more luxurious spa experience within the hotel if the price was a bit better. Swiss Marriot should recognise that its hotels in Bali can't follow the same pricing as hotels in different locations.
We ate at the restaurant in the evening once - it was okay, but not brilliant and all the dishes were barely warm, not hot. It all tasted a bit tired, and the lighting at outside table was far too dim.
I feel the restaurant and bar should also provide mosquito repellant in the evening given the health risks posed by mosquitoes in Bali."
1880,Loved everything about the hotel,50,August 2017,"They have everything you would want in a hotel. Absolutely loved the place - right when you enter the hotel the staff ensures they make your stay as comfortable as possible.
Greeted with a welcome drink, we headed straight out for a visit around the city. They picked up that it is my wife's birthday from the passport we gave during check-in. On coming back, they had upgraded me to a suite (because I am a Marriott Gold member and I checked in the morning whether an upgrade is possible).
The biggest surprise was the lovely gesture by the staff - a note for my wife, with a cake and some dessert. She was so happy with the surprise. That actually made our first day so lovely and yes her day special.

Being close to a lot of lovely places and ensuring that the hotel is a safe place to stay - this hotel is a must visit. The rooms are modern with all the facilities. The ever smiling staff and the great breakfast spread in the morning. I am definitely staying here again for my next visit as well.

One thing to remember though - Uber usually does not ply around seminyak but it is fine if you get your uber inside the hotel and if a driver accepts your ride, ask him to come inside rather than taking it from outside the hotel. The local taxi union can be a little messy affair at times."
1881,"An outstanding, quality hotel in a great location",50,June 2017,"I stayed for a week in June 2017 and I can only say how wonderful the hotel and staff where. It starts with the location, which is smack, bang in the middle of everything and walking distance to the beach. It continues with superbly trained staff and excellent food from the amazing breakfast buffet, through to happy hour at the pool side bar. I was upgraded to a pool view suite which just added to experience. The hotel gym was small, but very clean and functional. As a member of Marriott Rewards, the General Manager, John Woolley hosted an enjoyable welcome function and allowed me to meet the thank the amazing staff trained by John and his management team. A great value hotel, with friendly and efficient staff, in the perfect location. Well done."
1882,Great again,50,August 2017,"This is a fabulous hotel. This is my fourth visit since it opened in 2014. I love staying here because of the great room amazing pool and excellent staff. All,of the staff at the Seminyak Kitchen at breakfast always remember me and my name. Indah and Ayu make me feel special when I arrive every morning for a coffee before a walk along the beach. This afternoon I am sitting at the Pool Bar having a late lunch and its the same here. Chinta is looking after me so well, engaging in conversation, advising on drinks and food - exceptional service Chinta. I really appreciate it."
1883,"Nice property,very nice people",40,August 2017,"We had a group stay prior to a Balinese wedding.
The property is well located with hotel buggy services to the beach and eat street-- very handy.
Nice and affordable restaurant with a very good breakfast
Rooms are well maintained and the whole property seems in as new condition."
1884,Amazing service,50,August 2017,"In brief, service beyond my expectations was the experience I recently received. I needed to find top quality cracks for an event and I had no idea where to start.........
Fortunately for me I asked the manger ""Grant"" to point me in the right direction which he did so kindly . Not only did he recommend 3 stores he also arranged the hotel driver to drive me around to purchase the crackers. Marriott Courtyard congratulation a credit to the management team.....I will be back, fantastic breakfast by the way."
1885,Great hotel,50,August 2017,Loved staying in this hotel great location if u want a place far a little bit from the fuzz I stayed in pool view room it was so nice friendly staff amazing breakfast buffet and room service and a nice cool gym
1886,Surfing great waves warm.,50,August 2017,"Great nice relaxing. Staff very great funny. Best ever. Very cold beer. Wish is a winner,very friendly and beautiful especially Chinta.ayu,Alit.rudi.very helpfull. Overall very good. Security is very good. Got a fate Labrador out front who sniffs nothing. Other than that everyday walk through buzzer.

No fridge only problem."
1887,"Good location, good food, amazing staff",50,July 2017,"We stayed six days at Courtyard Bali Seminyak and it was just great! Rooms are very well equiped and clean. We tried the breakfast and the Meat shop restaurant and we were impressed by the choice and que quality of the food.

The swimming pool looked nice (however we did not try it) and the hotel has a private space close to the sea that guests could use for free. By scooter it took us 5 minutes to go there, and I guess 10-15 minutes by walk.

The staff were very helpful for booking nice excursions. They even managed to find us a great photograph for the next day. Also, back home we noticed that the DVD with the diving pictures did not work, and they helped us contacting the diving company to get the pictures.

We were only a bit disappointed with the SPA. We tried to book 2-3 times for the same day and each time they were already fully booked... As we don't like to plan in advance when we are on holidays, we decided to go to the SPA BALI (5 minutes walk from the hotel) and it was nice. Probably not as nice as the hotel SPA, but 2 times cheaper.

We warmly recommend Courtyard Bali Seminyak to anyone and the next time we visit Bali, we will most probably stay there as well."
1888,Great service but full of Bogan's,30,August 2017,Courtyard is a good hotel close to everything the staff are fantastic. The facilities are a 4 out of 5 compared to other places in Bali. There were a lot of Bogan's (Australian slang for Hick) getting pissed by the pool to the point of almost drowning everyday. Is also a bit of a children's resort so not good if your looking for any sort of relaxation. All in all a 3 out of 5
1889,"A secure, fun and friendly hotel for the whole family",50,July 2017,"We just returned from a fantastic family holiday at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. All of the staff were amazing but I have to call out Nisa and Santi in the Kids Club. They made our stay so easy when they looked after our son. He loved going to play in the ball pit or on the games consoles. The variety of pool depths was very helpful too as he's not a confident swimmer. Breakfast was sensational, great tasting, plentiful, food and juice to suit all needs and very attentive staff. The pool bar was fantastic, the food truck was great, Seminyak Meat Shop had amazing meals and happy hour was worthwhile. We had room service a few times after long days out and each time it arrived quickly and tasted great. If you ever have the opportunity to stay, I highly recommend that you do."
1890,Best experience!,50,July 2017,"We stayed five days at courtyard, we enjoyed our stay.
Hotel staff is amazing, everyone is smiling and welcome you each time they see you.
Rooms are clean, the maintenance is great.
One of the best restaurants in seminyak is at this hotel
Everyday there is something special happening by the pool (special dinner, games...)
I recomend this hotel!"
1891,Ideally located very good hotel,40,July 2017,"We stayed there for 4 nights along with another couple friend. Although our check Inn experience was not very good as they almost 2 hrs to give us 2 rooms on the same floor close to one another, but apart from that our experience was just great. The Breakfast was one of the best we have experienced which is actually Marriott's specialty. The staff was extra courteous right from the security staff to the restaurant and reception and concierge, travel desk etc. The pool was huge and great. The best thing is the location. Beach is 5 min walk and nearby you can find good eating and drinking joints and lots of spas."
1892,"Simply perfect, no other words to describe it",50,July 2017,"Amazing location, superb room, impeccable service, fantastic breakfast and food.

We got the pool access suite, room size is big enough, the pool access is really handy from the room. But aside from all the adjectives above; this is a really lively hotel and the streets and area around are also the same. There's a great feeling of fun filling the atmosphere. It's not a very large hotel but just about perfect. Getting to the beach is like a 2 min ride on their golf buggy.

Oh and the service is simply superb; not over the top where it starts feeling fake and annoying but just extremely friendly.

If I ever go back to Seminyak I won't stay anywhere else but here."
1893,Friendly staff & Good breakfast Buffet,40,June 2017,"Friendly staff, good location, great breakfast buffet. Spa is always fully booked, so it is better to book prior to your arrival. There are a few nice spa shops nearby if you don't mind having one outside of the hotel."
1894,A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location,50,July 2017,"We checked in around 10pm and were warmly greeted with a cool towel and a yummy drink. Our room was lovely and cool with a nice bathroom (really want one of the big showers at home). Most rooms seem to overlook the gorgeous courtyard pool area which gave us a tropical feel.

The breakfast buffet was amazing with western and Indonesian options, the coffee was great, and the staff were so helpful and accommodating of my dietary needs.

I really liked the security aspect of this hotel, for my first overseas trip it made me feel really safe and secure. Others appear to have found this annoying but the process of going through the scanners took only minutes and the security team were always friendly.

The proximity to shopping and great restaurants was wonderful. So easy to pop out and get anything you need or want.

They run a shuttle to their private beach and though we didn't use the shuttle, it was nice having a spot on the beach we could use at any time, having cold water and icy sweet treats was a nice touch.

Overall we enjoyed our stay here very much and would stay again. Thank you!"
1895,Long overdue Holiday,40,July 2017,"What a fantastic Hotel. Great central location in the heart of vibrant Seminyak., facilities are clean and very well presented. The service is exceptional from start to finish of each day. The Breakfast is one of the best Bali cam offer. The rooms are large and clean. We would recommend this hotel to all our friends. Rob."
1896,Exceptional Service and Strategic Location,50,July 2017,"The moment I stepped down from the car, I was greeted and offered assistance by Alfi. I was staying for 2 nights here and thank you for the upgraded room to the pool view. Hotel location is very strategic in Seminyak area where restaurants are nearby and walking distance. I also would like to thank Fransiska and Laura at Reception for their assistance during my stay. Haven't get a chance to try the restaurant. However, I did try their Watermelon with Feta Cheese in pool bar and it was simple yet tasty. Again, the people are one of the reason that guest will feel special. Definitely will be back staying here for future visit. Thank you for all the people mentioned. Keep up the good work"
1897,Amazing 8 night stay,50,July 2017,"We had never been to Bali before or stayed at one of the Marriott hotels but loved both so much, we are going to book another trip next year.

The service was impeccable and the staff were always helpful and friendly. Our Deluxe Pool View Room was spacious, clean and had a great view of the resort.

We loved the location of the hotel; tucked away at the end of a quiet street but only minutes away from the beach and Eat Street.

Really couldn't fault this resort and would highly recommend."
1898,"Marriott at its best - Highly recommended! ""Bali""",50,July 2017,"The only reason I can think of why one should NOT stay at this property would be that it would tempt you to stay in the hotel as opposed to exploring Bali. Seriously it is the first hotel I think that looks better than the pictures.

We were warmly greeted by Marriott associates and recognized for our loyalty to the brand. Being a Platinum elite Comes with set of benefits and I find recognition to be one of the best benefit. We were attended by Mr. ketut Ramu the Front office manager who knew we had travelled with a 4 year old and need to be escorted to our room promptly. We were very fortunate that we were upgraded to a suite for our 9 days stay. We were escorted to our room and were impressed to see the room and compliments including some drinks and a cheese platter.

Hotel has a beautiful pool and poolside bar that caters to the hotel crowd (the chairs were full). The garden area with beanbags just changes the whole look of the lobby and brings out the best of the guests. I would hope that the staff at the pool side are a little more attentive and take a few rounds even without been called. No points taken from you on this one since I know it was a really busy period.

There is a popcorn and candy floss section in the lobby which is offered on a complimentary basis to kids and adults too. What a brilliant idea I must say. My 4 year old was hooked onto the popcorns while I got a candy floss under her name ;)

Kids room - 2 hours complimentary baby sitting Amazing. All the ladies were simply amazing and took care of our daughter with so much love and care. I only feel the kids room should be kept open to kids beyond 2 hrs if accompanied by an adult who can watch them. There might be some logic behind why you don't do it and I would like to hear from you.
Laundry services - excellent
Room Service - excellent
Housekeeping - excellent
Seminyak Kitchen - good ( we had two very unfortunate incidents where in we found hair in our dish and once with a fish smelling glass of water) I would let it pass but being Marriott one cannot afford these issues to reoccur.
Having said that the staff does work very very hard to attend to everyone during breakfast which is the peak period for them. I have even seen the front office manager, guest relations manager, duty Manager and even the General Manager John clearing tables with a Smile. That's definitely the Marriott way. The breakfast spread is huge and we thoroughly enjoyed every day we had breakfast.

Bell desk Good job
Spa - Excellent 5 star service and technique. Pls do experience it at least once.

Star Players
Pricillia (for taking care of us and specially our daughter when she wasn't feeling too well)
Ulis (for being persistent in getting my pizza, it was a task :) )
Parmi (for going out of your way to get my sport shoes cleaned and dried - I know this sounds weird and I know not many would have found a solution)
Mega (for standing out from the crowd and showing that you are super woman at F&B
Ari (for running around to get the small requests done)
Popcorn Lady as my daughter lovingly called her - Ms. Lili (we truly appreciate the sincerity and hard work you put in keeping everyone at the lobby happy)
Executive Chef ( my apologies for not getting your name) thank you for being considerate towards my wife's vegetarian requirement.
Also special thanks to the guest relations and duty Manager.

If we come back to Bali we will definitely stay with you guys. All your activities and services are truly 5 Star. Keep it up guys.

Thank you for connecting the dots to make our stay such a beautiful one. I personally know how difficult it is to create so many positive memories and you guys did an excellent job.

Dear John,

I would request you to personally congratulate the star players as this would go a long way for them as you might concur. Thank you for inviting us to the cocktail party and speaking to us. I am sure the team does so well because of your able leadership.

Regards
Prathamesh Kamath"
1899,"Nice service, good location",40,July 2017,"Stayed here for 4 nights in late July. The first room we checked into was facing the main road and was very noisy even at night. We asked to be moved to a more quiet room and it was arranged for us promptly and efficiently.

The rooms are nice, the staff are great and the buffet breakfast is huge.

The guests can get rowdy sometimes in and around the pool, so if you want to relax and chill by the pool, I would look for another hotel.

Due to the layout, even the banging of a door can echo, so not a real quiet hotel.

If you are a sound sleeper, and don't mind a rowdy group, then it is OK."
1900,Always 5 star service with plenty of smiles,50,July 2017,"We always stay here when coming to bali very frequently . No issues , nice and central to all the actual if needed and beach access very near . Staff and food is outstanding and good value for money especially the VW truck food which is cool and junky . Great for families and always a pleasure to stay and sad to leave .
Thanks"
1901,Class and comfort,50,July 2017,"We were impressed with the service of staff going above and beyond and catering to the needs of the individual. The atmosphere was welcoming, attentive and high quality. All staff were respectful, friendly and accomodating. Would definitely recommend for families, couples or singles. The resort made our first experience of Bali a memorable one and we would defiantly like to return."
1902,Excellent! Highly recommended!,50,July 2017,"Close to beach and shops. Rooms were modern, GREAT water pressure, clean, very friendly service, great for kids, breakfast buffet was the best! Kids club was entertaining, had soft shell tacos from taco truck everyday - yummy! Security was tight so always felt safe and secure. Only small gripe would have been pool temp....slightly chilly in July, but probably prefect for warmer months, although kids didn't seem to mind! Got a great deal with Luxury escapes, will definitely return!"
1903,Super!,50,July 2017,"We stayed for 10 days. Hotel is very good, beautiful room, with everything you need but what makes the difference with other hotels is the service! All staff are so helpfull, kind,... They will ask you constantly if they can do something for you with a smile on the face!
Food is very good,...Also the wellness in the hotel is super! Can't say anything negative about it!
We are already almost 2 weeks home and still have contact with several people who are working there, they are friends! We will come back to Courtyard!"
1904,Excellent hotel.. Loved our time here!,50,July 2017,"We stayed for 7 nights in the Courtyard by Marriott and absolutely loved it. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly from the moment you enter the hotel. The rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable.
The breakfast buffet is full of variety, they have everything from pancakes to bacon to noodles and prawn crackers!!!

The hotel also provides a free shutlle to seminyak square until 8pm and to seminyak beach. The hotel has a private area on the beach which the shuttle will bring you to. This area is free and offers free wi-fi, water and towels. The only thing Id say about this is you need to get down early enough to get a bed.

I would definitely stay here again when I return to seminyak."
1905,Best hotel experience! Total package!,50,July 2017,"My friend and I stayed at this resort for just over a week. We were greeted with warm smiles and received impeccable service throughout our stay. The rooms are well kept and comfortable. Every staff member we met was friendly and asked if we needed anything. One employee even said ""we want this to be your second home""- and honestly it felt like that. The breakfast buffet was out of this world with a huge selection of both Asian and western options. The pool menu always hit the spot and dinner was also delicious. There are three pools, one that seems more for fun with a pool bar and music, another that is longer for swimming and a smaller one at the back that seems appropriate for kids. Great setup! There was also a beautiful spa( great packages!) and 24 hr gym. My friend and I loved the resort so much we often stayed in rather than walk around Semiyak. However, when we did, we noticed how close it was to shops and Eat Street, which is full of wonderful dinning choices. The resort offers buggee( golf cart like car) services to Eat Street. The resort also has a private area on Semiyak beach. While there we were given free water bottles and mango icees! As someone who enjoys traveling, this was the best hotel experience I've ever had. I highly recommend to singles, couples and families. You will not be disappointed!"
1906,Great Service despite hectic crowd,40,July 2017,Grant and Anna handle the throngs of crowds during brekky like true professionals that they are. Brilliantly managed and yet friendly and classy to people of all ages and nationalities. Well done guys. Always a joy to be back at this hotel again!
1907,Wonderful experience,50,July 2017,"6 of us stayed 10 nights at the courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak for a family holiday.
We normally rent a pool villa but thought we would try something different. We got 3 x scooters for transport and found easy access to hotel and parking. The staff go above and beyond with exception service. We could not fault one thing regarding the staff.
We travelled in July which is peak season and although the hotel was busy there was plenty of day beds by the pool and always seating available for breakfast. The pool was slightly cool as it doesn't get afternoon sun but once you get in and have a swim it doesn't take long to get used to. I'd suggest to go to breakfast earlier around 8am rather than later as it does get really busy around the buffet. My dad found the tea was not really hot enough but that may be a safety restriction regarding the water temperature? I had coffee and found it a good temperature. The location is perfect 5 mins from the beach and close to restaurants and market shopping. I'd highly recommend this hotel to families and friends."
1908,Outstanding service and excellent location,50,July 2017,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel we could not fault the service given by the staff. You are made to feel like family here!
Breakfast offers a wide variety of well prepared and delicious options. The hospitality staff are so attentive to our every need.
Highly suggest a massage in house.
Special mention must be made of Auli, Adi, I Made, John and Gita for all their care."
1909,Luxury escape package,40,July 2017,"We are into our 5the day at the hotel. It's located in a good part of Seminyak, with a few good shops and Mozzarella Restaurant on the same street, (opposite The Breezes Hotel).
It's a 5-10 minute walk to the beach or you can take the golf buggy if available. A hotel courtesy transport. It's only a 5 minute taxi ride to Eat Street, which cost between $3-$5 or again if available , you can take the golf buggy.
The room is cleaned daily to a high level. We have a room on the 6th floor facing the reception and pool. It's a quieter part of the hotel, but quite a walk in and out. The room is not huge but well maintained and has everything you need. The balcony is quite small though.
The breakfast is fantastic with a huge selection. There should be something for everyone. The pool bar is nice and offers a good choice.
Our package included massages (which were wonderful. We had a 1 hour couples massage). The spa is really nice. Also included is a daily cocktail each, daily tacos (really light and tasty), breakfasts and a dinner each.
The pool lounges are always quite busy, especially one side of the pool, which catches the sun. There are signs on the tables saying that they will move your belongings if you leave them unattended for more than 30 minutes, which should stop people from putting a towel down early and not coming back for hours. Unfortunately this does not happen. We have tried a couple of times to get a Lounge in the sun, (successfully sometimes), and found the lounge next to us unused for 1-2 hours, but someone had put towels and books down. It would help other guest if this was monitored more or larger signs erected. If your plan is to use the pool and you can't there are no other options in the hotel. This would be our only complaint with the hotel.
All in all a good choice of hotel."
1910,Best Marriott Around,50,July 2017,"We're checking out today after 4 nights and we don't want to leave!

#1 - the breakfast spread is exceptional. Everything from bacon and eggs, to bagels, curries, a noodle bar, fresh fruit and the freshly squeezed juices that are not watered down. Basically any breakfast food you can imagine, and on top of that the food quality is excellent.

#2 - pool area is great and very well maintained and landscaped. I see staff collecting all the deck chair cushions in the evening, presumably for cleaning. Poolside service is excellent and there are staff ""call"" buttons at each deck chair along the pool.

#3 - there is a little private beach area with towel service and complimentary cold water. There is a hotel golf cart shuttle to and from the beach and also to other nearby areas around the hotel. The general beach and water is very clean well maintained - great for swimming.

#4 - the spa was also top notch. Relaxing atmosphere, highly professional, pre- and post-massage drinks, and an amazing Balinese massage!

#5 - the rooms are very modern with quality finishing and furniture. Standard Marriott branded beddings, universal power outlets, bath amenities, and a spacious balcony.

#6 - every single one of the staff here are brilliant. Front desk, concierge, guest relations, housekeeping, spa, dining - every single encounter with the staff was excellent. Friendly, polite, professional, highly attentive, and very warm and welcoming - always a smile on their faces.

#7 - security on the property is almost airport like. Entrance is barricaded and all Vehicles are checked from hood to trunk, bottom to top, then circled by a bomb sniffing dog. Anyone entering on foot passes through a metal detector and all bags x-ray screened. Safety first! Good job Marriott!

The staff also asked for feedback on a couple of occasions, but I'm not sure how much more they can improve - excellent rating overall."
1911,"Lovey staff, hotel, location superb",40,July 2017,"Hotel is very clean
Pool is lovely with bean bags in the pool water kinda cold but u get used to it once u get in
Kids club is great u get 2 free hours daily per child has ball pool, building block and Psp for older kids and tv with cartoons
Hotel location is great ! Shuttle to beach and 3 other spots
Staff are smiley and go out of their way to help u
Breakfast is good to meet all tastes with ice cream everyday which ofcoarse my kids loved!

I highly recommend the hotel !
Happy hour is good too !
Enjoy !
Lots to do in seminyak !"
1912,"Safe, clean but noisy",40,July 2017,"This is a great hotel for business and it has wonderful safety screenings and precautions.
It's very noisy around the pool area and over crowded. You struggle to get a poolside bed or chair. This hotel sells a lot of cheap Scoopon packages and you can clearly tell by the type of people around the pool, at the bar and their behaviour. It's not a resort, even though it's marketed as one. I can not relax at this place as the people are disruptive, drunk, noisy and rude. I've stayed 5 times for business and it's never changed. When I want to relax, I stay a little further down the road at the royal beach which I believe is much better for a relaxation resort style holiday that does not offer cheap packages so tend not to get your anti social drunks and bogans.
However, the courtyard Marriott definitely had the best buffet breakfast in Bali. It's great value for money and it's in the best location in Seminyak close to the beach, close to Kuta but in a quiet enough location where you are just outside the hustle and bustle."
1913,Nice hotel but watch the hotel credit deal rip off deal at check in !!!!!!,30,June 2017,"Our family (5 rooms - 12 people) from Perth stayed here for a 70th birthday in June 2017.

We arrived at check in @ 12:30am after a delayed flight and where exhausted. As part of the check in process the hotel offer you a pre-purchase non-refundable credit in advance discount. Basically buy some credit at 20% off and use at the hotel ... the more you buy the cheaper it gets.

Was told I had to make my mind up now (12:30am) and that the offer could be used during our stay. So I bought $300AU worth .... sounded good, I knew we would be having a few Bintangs at the bar, so why not.

Fast forward to check out and I discover that there are all of a sudden a number of exclusions to this deal ...... happy hour at the bar etc !!!!! Of course this was never mentioned at check in !

So at check out, not only did I have a big bar bill BUT I still had $300 in credit which I couldnt get back as a refund !

Had a big heated discussion with the staff and was eventually given the credit towards the bill. Just wish I had been told this when we checked in !

So BEWARE of this offer ,,, it aint as good as it seems and left a nasty taste after what was a good few days.

Also the airport transfer offered by the hotel was quoted at 600,000 ($60AU) one way. Much cheaper to get a private van which we paid 200,000."
1914,Great staff and good location.,50,July 2017,"It really makes a difference when the staff at a hotel are so happy and friendly. The rooms are well appointed and very well maintained, the areas devoted to kids are fantastic, this is a very kid friendly space. The creche alone makes this hotel worth the price for parents who want a little free time,
The location is great, lots of shopping very close by and with a bit of aggressive bargaining you might find a deal, though the supermarket across the road ended up having a better price for a bag than the street vendors, so beware, walk away if they won't budge and offer only 40% of the original offered price!
Beach area is great though very small so get in early, and the buggy is very handy so take advantage. The Taco bus is super cool, simple but good food, and the bar is very cool though like all hotel bars the ""real"" cocktails will cost.
The real standout for me though was how the staff treated the kids, which was like Prince and Princesses, they really loved that so hats off to staff like Sutiarja and Andre (though too many others to mention)!"
1915,Amazing location & wonderful staff,50,July 2017,We stayed in this hotel for 2 days and it was absolutely blissful. The swimming pool was the highlight of the hotel. There is a bar inside the pool and good music keeps playing in the entire pool area. The beach is walking distance (300 mtrs) from the hotel. Very friendly staff and decent rooms. The street on which the hotel is located has amazing cafes and pubs. The very famous legian street is 3 kms away.
1916,Feedback on staff member,50,July 2017,"Dede is absolutely amazing. He has made our stay here exceptional. He works in the bar area and always goes out of his way to make sure that you're okay. We've met many staff here who are all lovely, but Dede goes that extra mile. We can't praise and thank him enough."
1917,Courtyard Bali Seminyak - Exceptional,40,July 2017,"I get to Bali every year. Usually I'm a little more organised with flights and accommodation at a Villa, always in Seminyak.

This year a mate and I booked five weeks out on Expedia. $2000 for the both of us, flights and accomodation, a four night stay.

From the options given we chose Courtyard Bali Seminyak purely on the positivity on TripAdvisor.

We were not disappointed.

A Delux Room Pool View, large and spacious. Well kept, not 'tired', exceptionally comfortable bed, large bathroom, stylish. It was lovely to sit on the balcony and listen to the water, overlooking the pool.

The pool. So large and blue with many lounges around the perimeter. Beautiful to swim in. Great service with a Bintang or cocktail never far away. Hours spent relaxing an reading.

We had breakfast daily included and it was without fault. The service and food outstanding . It was also changed up a little every day. Something different to explore if you wanted to venture away from the standard egg station, juice bar, fresh bagels! We looked forward to waking up and breakfast.

You can always tell how good a hotel is by how happy the staff are. Beautiful Balinese smiles everywhere, and what we found most touching was how much they adored children, especially babies. Staff thrilled to nurse a child while a mother and father got organised.

The location - fantastic. Close to the beach, great food and the gay bars. (LBGTI most welcome and adding to a great mix of guests).

Well done Courtyard Bali Seminyak. Nailing it. A great place to stay in Bali, and great value."
1918,Family reunion July 2017,50,July 2017,"We highly recommend this 5* Hotel.

Majority of the rooms have a pool view - whilst we were there we had a beautiful breeze blowing through our deck. Great place to sit and enjoy the view or a quiet nook to read our books. The room was spacious and provided all that we needed to enjoy our time at the hotel.

The position of the hotel is perfect - close to the beach - The hotel has a buggy to drop off and pick up at their Beach area in front of Double Six. Beach Towels provided - cold water - beach shower within the location and plenty of beach umbrellas.

At the front of the hotel they have a Taco truck """"What the Truck"""" selling reasonably priced beer and great taco's of course staffed by the most amazing people - ask for the fantastic YOGA .

The breakfast has to be one of the best in BALI - served with a great variety of foods and of course the amazing staff - it doesn't matter which staff member looks after you they are all so professional and friendly. Our young grandson 18months didn't want us to look after him he put his arms up to SUTIARJA and he willingly carried him around whilst serving and making coffees. Thankyou to all staff for the way they interacted with our grandchildren from Lyon France Mai-Anh & Ayden. The holiday was very special for our family as it was a family catch up and the staff really helped us make this visit perfect.

The front desk - once again professional very helpful staff - nothing is too much trouble. They genuinely care about making each guests visit very special. Plus each time we walked through reception we were acknowledged by name. Thankyou Tony for your special help provided to Glynn.

They have a popcorn machine in the reception area which keeps big and little people happy.

The poolside bar is fantastic - great music - lovely area by the pool and a relaxed deck nearby. You can also sit around the grassed area on bean bags or just laze in the sun.

The pool is fantastic - one end has the children's pool - the depth perfect for little ones - and right next door to the kids club. Our grandchildren loved their special couple of hours in the club - and mum and dad were able to enjoy a couple of hours shopping. There were plenty of chairs and umbrellas around the pool .

What an amazing area for shopping - markets to upmarket shopping. Plenty of restaurants providing a variety of food and entertainment. This hotel is situated in such a great position for all that Seminyak has to offer.

They have a buggy that is available to take guests to Seminyak Village or the beach. Another fantastic service.

The hotel has really thought about their guests - even the fridges - they are empty on arrival for your to fill with your own drinks etc or the hotel will provide drinks that you request. They have a list of offers .

Across the road from the hotel are money changers and supermarkets.

On arrival and each time you arrive back you are scanned and so are your bags. All cars including the hotels cars are also checked on entry . It is a very secure hotel.

I cannot thank the staff enough for our amazing holiday. We have already booked again for next year.

The management of all areas of this hotel are to be praised for their management of guests and staff - you can see the staff are looked after by the hotel and it reflects in the way they interact with the guests. Many thanks to Andre for all the help and his friendly interaction with our family.

Thankyou again CourtYard Marriott management and staff for a memorable family reunion."
1919,A Step Above the Rest ‚ú®,50,July 2017,"Where do I begin! From the moment we arrived we were so pleased we chose this hotel. From the atmosphere to the food and friendly staff it was exactly what we wanted in a hotel! The staff are so genuinely lovely, not once we did walk passed someone who didn't greet us with a smile and say hello. The room was perfect, cleaned every single day with out fail. And the pool, WOW! We thoroughly enjoyed the events the hotel put on within the hotel and we definitely will be coming back here when we return to Bali next! Thank you so much for making our stay so amazing!"
1920,Great stay!,50,July 2017,"What stood out for me during our short stay was the fantastic customer service and an amazing breakfast buffet.
The pool area is quite large. It's worth getting a room with pool access! Nice added touches are the hang out area between pool and lobby (with bean bags etc.) and things like a pingpong table.
Location is great as well, and lots of good places are in walking distance."
1921,Holiday,50,December 2016,"We stayed at marriot for 5 days and everything was wonderful, the breakfast was good, the pool bar staff very friendly they know every guest name and very good acoustic music every evening. Love to come back here again and definitely recomend this hotel to our relatives and friends. Cheers"
1922,Another fantastic stay....,50,July 2017,"This July was our 3rd stay in 3 years at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak and once again, it was fabulous! The hotel is in an ideal location - close to the Seminyak nightlife/restaurants etc and also close to the beach which enables you to have the best of both worlds. Legian is within walking distance too if you want to head that way and we walked along the beach down there many times. We also hired the bicycles and rode to Kuta and back. The hotel is modern and lovely. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was an ideal size for our daughter and my husband and I. I actually think it would still be a perfect size for a family of 4 too. In fact two lots of friends popped in while we were staying at CM Seminyak and both families said that the room was much bigger than the rooms they had at their hotels and they were very impressed. They have a great gym which my husband used everyday and we also used the day spa which was lovely. The breakfasts are amazing and the breakfast staff (including the chefs who can't do enough for you) are the best in the business. Never have I seen so many people work so hard (especially during rush hour) and all with a smile on their face. We went to one of the theme dinners one night (beer, wine and food festival) and we would highly recommend it (just make sure you're hungry). What The Truck is a great little food truck that CM has out the front with the yummiest tacos (Babi Guling was divine) and the coffee is good too. For such a popular hotel, I had forgotten how quiet the hotel was at night. The live music finishes at just the right time and there was no door slamming or loud guests coming home at all hours of the morning (a definite bonus for me). I think what makes this hotel so great is the management has a great presence around the place (special thanks to John, Grant, Made and Anton) and the staff in the restaurant/pool/cleaners/front desk are a reflection of the management.
Thanks again to the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for another terrific stay."
1923,Marvellous Marriott,50,June 2017,"This was our first visit to The Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak , and it certainly will not be our last.
From out airport pick up to check in at the hotel, it all went extremely smoothly.
Reception staff were very warm and welcoming.
Our room on the 5th floor had a view of the pool, great size, with a very comfortable bed with great pillows, and nice smelling toiletries.
Breakfast served a great selection of food, and there were plenty of tables both in and outside.
The atmosphere reminded me of a trendy Melbourne Cafe, and the coffee was fantastic!
It's not a huge hotel, more boutique, which I quite liked.
Great atmosphere around the pool, and the pool bar, acoustics in the background added a good vibe.
The spa was absolutely fabulous, but expensive, the gym was well equipped.
The location of the hotel was great. Walking distance to the beach, and bars and shops.
I've just booked again for next year, so that sums it up really.
We will be back."
1924,Fantastic stay,50,July 2017,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved our stay. Service is exceptional and security is excellent. The seminyak kitchen has amazing breakfast every morning. The dinner with the steak options is superb. I would pay $150/meal for the quality of the food but this is easily a quarter of that.

If i come back to Bali, I will make sure to stay here again. Highly recommended"
1925,Short but lovely stay,50,July 2017,"I stayed her with my mum and sister in July for 3 nights, the staff were friendly and helped us book a few activities. We wanted to use the hotel spa but as it was booked up, I called the reception and they arranged us massages at the Spa Bali a short walk from the hotel. They also organised our boat ride to Gili T, going with a reliable company.

The buffet breakfast was lovely. As vegans we weren't expecting much from the buffet but they had a good selection of fruits, juices, breads, mushrooms, beans, potatoes etc. which filled us up for a while! Also location is very close to Tasty Vegan, a cute vegan cafe we checked out. The starters were amazing!

The location was good, being close to the beach and offering free one-way buggy services. The rooms were modern and clean too. The pool was nice although we didn't get a chance to make the most of it. Overall a lovely place to stay!"
1926,Awesome Experience,50,June 2017,"Our first time in Bali and 10 nights at this magnificent hotel ensured our stay was truly memorable.

The staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel offers free shuttle service to Eat Street and the private beach club and is located perfectly near bars, restaurants, shops, money exchange and across the road from a large convenience store.

The Seminyak Kitchen offers a truly spectacular breakfast and we also enjoyed lunch and dinner during our stay.

This, along with the magnificent pool bar, well equipped gym and the awesome massages at ""Zanti The Retreat"" makes for a truly wonderful hotel.

The swimming pool was fantastic, whether it be for a swim, a rest on the sun lounge, a drink at the swim up bar or just to listen to the nightly live band.

We found the security to be very reassuring and never an inconvenience.

Thoroughly recommend this hotel."
1927,Our Stay at this resort,40,July 2017,"Let us say that you cannot go past this resort if you intend to stay at Seminyak. It was our first time in Bali and as we are a couple in our late fifties and being our first visit to Bali we were looking for a place that we felt comfortable and safe. This resort ticked all the boxes for us. Their security going into the resort is top notch. It may piss some people off but in the end of the day it wasn't a big issue for us. They will check you every time you walk back into the resort with your bags and you have to walk thru a scanner yourself. EXCELLENT! Breakfast, AMAZING spoilt for choice. Rudi the pool supervisor was amazing after I took some skin off my arm getting out of the pool and even asked me how I was a few days later. I'm lost for words with this resort! Staff, warm friendly cannot do enough for you, room made up every day to perfection. They had things going on each day to keep guests involved if you wanted too. Put it this way, maybe due to our age we have a different perspective than younger people but honestly if we travel to Bali again, would we stay there. HELL YES! The only negative we would say that is do not get a room on the road side. We had some friends that had a room on the road side and they said it was noisy. We were fortunate enough to avoid this but apart from that no issues A big thank you to this resort for their kindness, their service and their security! Thank you to everyone who looked after us during our stay. Top notch a credit to you all! PS: And free popcorn when you want it! LOL!"
1928,Beautiful Seminyak stay,50,July 2017,What a great base for a stay in Seminyak. Resort was awesome with an amazing pool and great facilities. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever experienced. We had a pool access suite which was perfect. A great resort close to the beach and right amongst everything that Seminyak has to offer.
1929,Amazing hotel!!,50,July 2017,"We knew driving in it would be super. Tight security and you are xrayed everytime you come into the hotel. The staff are brilliant (this is a given in bali), we asked for adjoining rooms which we got, the rooms were fabulous and they hotel is always buzzing and has a great atmosphere about the place! The breakfast is outstanding the choice is huge and the tea was lovely!!! Would def come back üòä"
1930,Incredible hospitality,50,June 2017,"The tight security here is a terrible inconvenience but I understand the necessity. After the terror attacks and frequent bomb threats, they take no chances. Upon arrival, my taxi driver was searched and every nook and cranny inside and underneath his taxi cab was inspected. Heavy security gates surround the property and there are guards posted around it all times. The hotel grounds are covered by fencing and wire to ensure that the heavily guarded front gate is the only way in or out. Every guest that leaves or enters the property must pass through a metal detector and be searched for weapons.
I'd like to thank Priscilla, our receptionist for the incredible level of hospitality we were given. The first day I arrived, Priscilla helped us with our bags, offered my wife and I a cup of delicious iced tea and a cool wet towel. She checked us in quickly and talked us through the neighborhood. She gave us great advice about where to eat and what to do. The next morning at breakfast, Priscilla came to our table to ask my wife and I how we were doing and if she could help us in any way. She remembered and addressed me by my name!
The breakfast was one of the best meals I had during my entire trip in Indonesia. There were Chinese, Indonesian and Western breakfast items. I especially enjoyed the Chinese congee and fresh squeezed juices.
Our room was spotless and well appointed. The pool area was lots of fun. I loved the swim up bar and the cascading waterfalls. The gym had everything a triathlete needs to maintain his workout schedule.
My stay at this Courtyard Marriott was perfect. My wife and I had a wonderful time here."
1931,Bali bliss,50,July 2017,"I don't want to leave this hotel. From the moment we walked in the service was great. The staff went out of their way to make my birthday really special. They surprised me with a big slice of a really yummy cake at their beer wine and food festival. All the food was amazing, especially the breakfast buffet (the range and quality of food was terrific!). The pool terrace studio room was clean, quiet, really spacious and the bed was so comfy. All the staff were great, especially Arini, Widi and Rai. Really close to everything - 5 min walk to the beach, big star mart across the street, and we walked to the Seminyak Main Street to go shopping. A fabulous hotel in all ways. You will be so happy if you book this hotel! I can't fault it. Lots of security at the entrance to keep everyone safe.

We're about to enjoy the cocktail pool party the Marriot is throwing."
1932,LOVELY HOTEL AND GREAT SERVICE,50,July 2017,"This property is absolutely amazing!!!
When i write this review im still lying on my sunbed, and you know what??? There is nothing that u should dissapointed about. All the component of this hotel is extreamly faboulos!!! Starting from the security check when u arrived, they were checked whole of the car with the lovely smile. And then the front desk were friendly, and you know what that make me very happy is the staff from the all dinning restaurant, all of them are extreamly friendly and super cheerfull, but there is a lovely girl who always serve me with the genuine smile and her name is NARITA, she is so attentive, always offering me an assistant, she just wonderfull. Then i met the manager ANDRE who always give smile to everyone and greet us in the morning, always check guests expectation and so friendly with the kiddos. How lucky this property to having both of them.they also have a kids club and the staff there so cheerfull. the last but not least the food that they serve here are amazing, mouth watering and will makes u cant stop for eat. i was met the chef his name is Patrick. He and his team are definetly awesome, you should try the rib eye steak, it was perfecto, serve with many choises of potatoes and sauce that u never expected before!!! The point is THIS HOTEL IS AMAZING!!! I WILL BE BACK ABSOLUTELY!!!"
1933,Good but not Great,40,June 2017,"We are just back from the courtyard by Marriott resort and had mixed feelings about it, not in a bad location with the beach and shops both in walking distance, we had a nice enough room but it wasn't that big really, the breakfast is ok but not the best, the European choices left a bit to be desired, we had mainly eggs every day because they didn't have much else that we liked, there is a handy shuttle buggy to take you to the beach or shops running all day which we used a lot mainly because we hated the pool area, it's surrounded on all sides by the multi story hotel which means that you don't get any Sun in a lot of places and none after 3-30 ish, it did not matter where we tried to sit we were never in the sun very long, when you live in a hot climate it's not a big deal but we are from cloudy UK and really enjoy sunbathing so we had to go to beach every day after that, another thing that we found a bit annoying was that the bar closed at 10 pm every right so if you fancied a night cap you had to be back before then as they don't serve a minute after, one evenning we got back at 9-50 and the barmaid had put everything away and was most put out when we wanted a drink, we are on holiday to chill out and found this a silly rule, we found that at times that hotel was as much a business conference hotel as a holiday hotel , on a few occasions the bar in the day time was swamped by people with lanyards and paperwork making small talk, bit uncomfortable if your in your swim wear trying to get a beer at the bar, cannot fault the staff at all, very nice and pleasant and always ready to help you, security is very evident at the hotel with X-ray machines at the front door and cars checked with guards holding mirrors at the rear entrance, suppose it's a good thing but it spooked us a bit the first time, we where between the marriott or the Breezes Resort across the road when we were picking our hotel and in hindsight we would have much preferred the Breezes, it's much more like a holiday resort hotel in our opinion with a very large lagoon like pool area with a man made beach , super sun beds with unobstructed sun all day long and a 11pm bar for a relaxing nightcap , I think we would have has a very different and better for us experience if we had stopped in the Breezes resort"
1934,Another excellent holiday,50,July 2017,"We stayed for our 3rd time in July 2017 and again had a wonderful holiday. The combination of location, ammenities, food, rooms, pool and amazing staff made the holiday great. This time we bought our friends along and they too had a great time.

What was particularly impressive was the welcome back we got from several of the Seminyak Kitchen staff plus the warm welcome from the General Manager and Operations Manager.

Thanks again team for another great stay."
1935,Highly recommended hotel,50,July 2017,"We have just returned from an eight day stay in Bali at the Marriott. Clean and well configured rooms, a great pool and very friendly staff. It was a great family holiday! I have a work trip planned to Bali in October and will be organising to stay at this great hotel again. Well done Marriott!"
1936,Bali Favorite,50,June 2017,"We stayed at the Courtyard for 10 nights in July with 2 young children and had an absolutely fantastic time. From the pick up from the airport, the staff were warm and friendly and provided outstanding service for the duration of our stay.

The resort is very modern and once inside, you could be almost anywhere. The ‚Äòcourtyard‚Äô layout which focuses on the pool, bar and grassed area sweeps you away from the hassle and bustle of the outside world where you can easily spend your days relaxing by the pool.

Rooms are quite comfortable with quality free WiFi throughout the resort. The single studio type layout works well with minibar and all the usual inclusions. Aircon works well but this time of year we didn‚Äôt seem to need it much especially at night. With the two kids we had an adjoining room which was a must to give us some space to breath after a long day! I would highly recommend the pool view rooms which overlook the interior courtyard.

For the kids there is a kids club (2hrs/ day included for free) and reasonably priced baby sitters available. If our kids had it their way, we would never have seen them for the duration of our stay! There is daily activities for them and what I assumed was for school holidays, an endless supply of popcorn near reception. A big shot out to Debbie from the Kids Club who was also our baby sitter, she did a fantastic job, our kids were sad to leave and look forward to coming back again soon!

The resort offers a number of food options at either the pool bar, restaurant (Seminyak Kitchen) or 'What the Truck' food truck. Breakfast is buffet style with a large offering. Being school holidays it was very busy in the mornings but there was never any shortages of choices. What the Truck specialises in tacos and drinks for a lighter lunch or dinner option. The pool bar also has some good options for either lunch or dinner and of course a well stocked bar! We only dined at the restaurant twice for dinner which has a la carte menu and buffet options on some nights.

The pool has a vibrant atmosphere with tunes played most of the day and a live band performing most evenings. There's two pools, an upper one with a pool bar that overflows to a lower pool surrounded by deck chairs and a shallower kids pool. In fine weather you could easily spend the day here but our young kids did find the water a bit cold.

The resort is within easy walking distance to the beach, otherwise there's a free shuttle. There‚Äôs a reserved resort area at the beach with deckchairs once you get there which provides towels and has a stash of kids toys for digging in the sand. This area does seem to get quite full so we usually just went down to the public beach area most of the time.

Finally the day spa. Wow. I could easily spend all my time here. Although not the cheapest in the Seminyak area, they certainly make up in refinement and quality. I highly recommend the hot stone massage!"
1937,Lisa and James Marriott,50,July 2017,The Marriott beds are sooo comfortable the rooms are immaculate the breakfast is the best in Bali friendly staff treat you like family Love this place cocktail mixers secure and always feel safe A trip to Bali is not the same without a stay at the Marriott I always feel like I'm coming home
1938,Fell in love with the staff,50,July 2017,"Amazing place, great variety of food, cocktails and daily entertainment. They also have a kids club for those who need a time out and traveling with kids! The staff knows each guest name which is amazing and I easily fell in love with them because they are very interactive with each guest. The ressort is also very well located to the seminyak beach and other restaurants and shops. It's like south beach only in Asia!"
1939,FABULOUS = LOVE ‚ô•Ô∏è,50,December 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay at Courtyard Resort Seminyak ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Our room (pool access) was very comfy üòç
The cleanliness, bed, foods, and pool are amazing. The staff is very friendly. Easy check-in process. Love the food truck üëçüèªFour thumbs up üòÉ"
1940,The Courtyard Seminyak Resort is the place to go,50,May 2017,"This was our 3rd trip to this Resort. Why do we keep going to the same Resort? This is a great place to stay when holidaying in Bali. The Courtyard is centrally placed with a Buggy at hand that will happily take you to the beach where lounges, umbrellas, towels'and cold bottled water is supplied at no extra cost. They even supplied icy poles. They also supply a buggy to return you to the the Resort. We found the beach attendant very attentive. The Buggy drivers were all great and couldn't do enough to help you enjoy your trip. This hotel has a first class breakfast, that gets better every time we stay, and the Food Truck at the front of the Courtyard where you can get Tacos and Coffee is certainly a hit. Security is great, and the security staff are always happy and helpful. Poolside staff are happy, mix great cocktails, and the staff make your holiday, a holiday to remember. We bought a deal that was super value. Poolside facing rooms, that leave nothing to be desired. Management of the Marriott Courtyard is first class, we really can't fault this hotel."
1941,First time visiting Bali and felt 100% safe. Will be returning no doubt.,40,July 2017,"Courtyard Seminyak takes the stress of safety, Bali belly, and uncertainty out of your mind so you can enjoy your holiday to its maximum.

We travelled as a group of 11, that alone is the stress in itself.

Courtyard Marriot service is nothing short of fantastic. The staff remember your faces, and ensure your greeted at every corner of the hotel.

Safety and security is at its maximum, with every vehicle and person obtaining a detailed bag, car, and personal search.

Not only is the buff a breakfast and kitchen and room service fantastic and trustworthy right outside the reception is a food truck that has the friendliest staff and best tasting tacos and burritos I've had in my life. Not to mention their only five dollars.
""What the truck"" we are hosting a block party at the time we were holidaying in Bali, my brother is a DJ and they gladly and persistently invited us to party with them and enjoy the experience, they invited my brother to DJ and allowed him on deck. Moments like these and people friendly as they were create the memories that last a lifetime.

Then across the road is a hyped pizza restaurant. Once again trustworthy and cheap. Party every night at that restaurant.

The staff helped us book all our day tours and activities. They arranged transport lunches the activity and insured each company we used were trusted, reliable, and was covered by insurance.

Only reason I missing a star to make this a five star resort is the minimum seating area around the pool. As the afternoon sun is covered by one side of the building the pool does not stay warm all day. Being the person that loves to swim and 10 that was the only downfall of the resort, to the management team I would recommend pool heating.

Thank you to the team at courtyard marriot for providing myself and my family with a great first experience of Bali!"
1942,"Lovely staff, clean hotel and very good entertainment",40,July 2017,"Room was clean, modern and on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool. The staff were so friendly from the check in, the porters, the cleaning staff and the bar staff and Seminyak Kitchen staff. It is the staff who made the difference ensuring they took time out to enquire about our comfort, and our satisfaction with services provided. The executive chef was so friendly and interested in our enjoyment as was the hostess of the Seminyak Kitchen Ayu (I may not have that spelling correct). She always remembered our names as did other staff in the restaurant. The manager Grant ??
(a young Aussie man) also spent time with us filling us in on various areas that we questioned him on.
Security is amazing with scans of bags and body and cars every time you enter the premises.
Thanks again for a very enjoyable week. Good value for money spent."
1943,Perfect,50,July 2017,"Staff so so friendly. Even some western staff üëårooms brilliant. Great kids entertainment. Not stingey. You could tell the customer actually is really important to these guys.
Close to beach and best parts of seminyak/legian. Food truck out front great idea"
1944,Honeymoon stay,50,June 2017,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon tour of Bali, and could not recommend this hotel enough! They were quick to recognize my platinum status and invited us to a cocktail party that evening where we were able to meet some of the hotel staff and management who were all beyond friendly. Pool is great, breakfast was some of the best we had the whole trip. This is truly a 5-star hotel. Special thanks for Anton who remembered our names throughout the stay and who showed us pictures of his hometown in Indonesia and may have convinced us to take another trip out to other parts of Indonesia!"
1945,"A nice hotel close to the beach, shops and restaurants",40,July 2017,"Spent 4 nice days at the Courtyard. Enjoyed the closeness to the beach, shops and restaurants. Service was great as expected from a Marriott hotel. Did not appreciate the pool being in the middle of the buildings and the general design of the hotel."
1946,Amazing Hotel,50,June 2017,"Friendly staff, safe and secure, comfortable beds that are hard to get out of, lovely pool bar and great location! My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and it is the best place we have stayed for a reasonable price! We will definitely be back!!"
1947,Fantastic Relaxing Holiday,50,June 2017,"We had a wonderful 10 night stay at the Courtyard Seminyak. Great facilities, friendly and attentive staff and management as well as a fantastic day spa where we had the best relaxation massages. Fantastic location with a short stroll to Seminyak Beach or in the opposite direction to Legian Rd Shopping. The hotel also offer a shuttle service that will take you to the Beach, Legian Rd or Eat St.
Surrounded by quality Restaurants its certainly a great resort.
Thank you to all staff and management for your hospitality."
1948,An excellent stay,50,July 2017,"Decided to take a break from the hustle and bustle and found the hotel a great place to relax - with lots of dining and shops on the hotels doorstep too. Staff are welcoming, friendly and professional. Spent a few lazy hours at the pool bar - a really nice space. Close walk to the beach with regular golf cart shuttle if you can't even make it that far. Recommend to all types of travelers."
1949,4 years in a row ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,50,July 2017,"This is my 4th visit in under 4 years and will be back again. First class service, facilities, food and position.
The staff are some of the friendliest around and remember you from year to year (Anton, Prisi, Alit and Wikka) nothing is ever too much trouble for them. It's things that they do that make your time here more pleasurable.
No complaints from a very happy guest, keep up the excellent work."
1950,Fantastic Management and Staff,50,July 2017,We spent three weeks here in June/July 2017. Friendliness of the staff is absolutely amazing and the service is terrific. We were in a suite overlooking the pool which is very nice. The location is super if you like being close to the beach and to the action on Jl. Dhyana Pura. Highly recommend.
1951,Conference in Bali,40,July 2017,"About 30 of us attended a conference here. Conference room was decent, but kudos to hotel for effort for their teabreaks. Good food but excellent decor and ambience. Wifi was also excellent.

Breakfast location was not big, crowded with holiday guests but well run and managed.

Our private garden dinner was also well organised.

Strongly recommend this hotel for personal trip or biz conference. Nice rooms with pool view."
1952,JUST PERFECT STAY !! AS ALWAYS,50,July 2017,"Seminyak courtyard is our favorite destination. Its always fun to stay here , Francesca at the front office is quick in check in .

Rooms overlooking the 2 set of pool is quite pleasant and fun specially when u have aqua Zumba , it just makes you feel energized.

Seminyak kitchens breakfast is buzzing and replenished with fresh food at all time.

Server Gita and all FB team members are friendly and quick in their task.

A la carte food like Coconut Ayam Curry , Nasi goreng ,schnitzel burger , Bread butter pudding and list is long are just yum and certainly would be back for this sumptuous meal for sure ."
1953,Great hotel and nice staff.,50,July 2017,"Everytime I visited Bali, I always stay in this hotel because the location is great, and all the staff are very friendly. It's easy to get around and only 5 minutes to walk to the beach, and a lot of nice restaurants around."
1954,"Enjoyed and Loved our stay there, unbeatable & unforgettable experience.",50,March 2017,"When i first arrived, i got annoyed and not impressed with the un-readiness of the baby cot despite confirming re the cot a week earlier. Upon arrival the check in lady also mentioned that our room is booked with baby cot. We arrived at night and way passed my bub's bed time only to find the cot was not in the room. Called the housekeeping twice and almost an hour later before the cost was finally set, by this time i already gave up and put my baby to sleep on my lap (after the first call). 6 hrs flight and different time zone really made everything seemed worse at first night/day. But after staying in this hotel for 4 nights.. i totally forgot that ever happened, it was all clouded by the services and the experiences we had in this hotel. The staff here are just amazingly friendly, polite, helpful and accommodating. We came with another family during our stay and moved to 5 star hotel in Jimbaran after this hotel but anonymously we all thought this hotel gave us a lasting impression and best breakfast experience. All of us LOVED, i mean really really LOVED the Juice section which does not exist at any other hotel. We could custom made our daily smoothie, juices etc. Staff even grabbed turmeric from kitchen to make accommodate our custom traditional medicinal juice for my baby. We just surprised and appreciate the extra length the staff go to. We also loved the daily special by the gerobak (it's just vintage and kampung feel remind us of home and our childhood time. Staffs are in relax mode while working but working productively and efficiently. They are in for a quick (or long! ) chit chat with the guests during breakfast time. Mr Anton was really nice and cared enough to share some stories with us during our stay. The hotel is within short walking distance to the beach (great sunset there), close to shops and convenience store is just accross the road. I would totally recommend this place for those whose staying in Seminyak area and would definitely go back."
1955,"Nice hotel, great location",50,July 2017,"I stayed here for several nights recently and really enjoyed my time. The location is great - a ten minute walk to the beach in Seminyak as well as minutes away from restaurants, bars and shops. Check in was efficient, staff was always super friendly and helpful and the room was adequate. It faced the street but it wasn't too noisy. It was great having a west facing balcony. The bathroom had nice toiletries and the shower's water pressure was fantastic, as was the rainforest shower head itself. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping was timely. I didn't eat in the main restaurant, just at the pool bar and loved my sandwich. It was particularly nice served with a cold Bintang Radler while I was sitting in a beanbag on the grassy knoll near the pool. Pool was also very nice, tons of seating, great towels. Only complaint is that the pool only gets sun for a short period of the day given the layout but then you just go to the beach.

The Courtyard has its own private beach area with lounge chair, towels, water and a shower. It's great because the staff will mind your belongings while you are in the water enjoying the surf. It's about a 20 minute walk from the hotel but there's also a shuttle (golf cart) that goes back and forth. I didn't have any food, but it appears that you can order from a nearby restaurant.

Easy to get transport such as taxis here as well. And if you want to rent a motorbike, there's a little shop across the street that is super cheap and easy to manage.

We weren't able to get a late check out but they stored our bags and I was able to shower in the gym before our evening flight which was a nice bonus.

Highly recommend this place."
1956,Awesome family holiday,50,July 2017,"Fantastic resort for the family! The staff are very friendly and helpful. We booked 2 connecting rooms which were modern and clean.
The pool is fantastic. Kids pool section is perfect and adult pool is also great. The food and drinks were fresh and tasty. The breakfast options were endless and a great start to the day.
Would recommend for anyone to come here. We'll definitely be back!"
1957,Peaceful stay,50,June 2017,"We've lived in Indonesia now for 2 years and to come to Bali and stay at the Courtyard was a real treat. I've stayed in many Courtyard hotels and you know what you get when you stay in a Marriott property. The rooms had all the amenities you would expect. They were quite and relaxing.
The reason I actually booked our vacation stay their was because of all the wonderful breakfast reviews. The breakfast was wonderful and full of options but the real surprise was the dinner we had there. I can honestly say that my steak was the best steak, hands down, that I've had over the last two years.
John and the Courtyard staff were extremely helpful and attentive. We will most definitely stay here again and would recommend this property to anyone. Great place!"
1958,as good as always,40,June 2017,"I always stay at this hotel in Bali, whether as a couple or with a mate. The good thing is that rooms get quieter as you get farther from the bar and sound system. Service is excellent, with infinite patience from staff and real helpfulness when you have an issue / question / request, not hollow sentences and posturing.

The main thing is now that Marriott have taken over Starwood, their marketing efforts have stepped up several notches and the hotel seems always full. It used to be that if you came during Australian school terms, it was less full but now it's always full; basically Australians during Australian holidays, Europeans during European holidays and Asians the rest of the time.

Other changes: the kitchen is not as good as before (the new chef wasn't trained abroad and he hasn't been replaced despite not really understanding foreign food) and traffic is getting worse by the month, with locals upgrading from mopeds to real motorcyles that make even more noise."
1959,Brilliant stay,50,July 2017,"BRILLIANT HOTEL    1st stay in this particular resort    From the minute we arrive the service was exceptional   Helpful friendly staff everywhere , surroundings beautiful and very clean  Fabulous pool area and great bar areas     RGreat location and close to fabulous beach Have stayed in Seminyak before and in Nusa Dua and this hotel surpass everything    Value for money    CANT FIND BETTER"
1960,"Amazing hotel, great experience!",50,June 2017,"My partner and I stayed here with a luxury escapes voucher. We were blown away with hotel facilities and grounds. The buffet breakfast was outstanding, my partner has been to Bali over a dozen times and he quoted that this is the best one he's ever been to- lots of local cuisine, eggs and hot food, fresh fruit and juice bar, granola and other healthy mixes, pancakes, waffles and even ice cream if you desire. The room was on the smaller side compared to other hotels but is still very comfortable, the bathroom was lovely and spacious. All of the staff were lovely and always greeted us even when walking through the hall ways. Our room cleaner Buda was lovely, we sat out on our balcony a few times while he fixed up our room, we returned to find nice little notes on our bed saying 'enjoy your stay' etc, which was very humbling and put a smile on our face!!! We used the gym a few times which has a good selection of cardio, free weight and machines. The pool and pool bar were great with amazing service, just make sure you get there early if you want a bed in the sun, as the sun only hits one side!

Overall our stay was very much enjoyed and would recommend Courtyard Bali to everyone. Compared to a lot of other hotels that are roughly the same price, the attention to detail and quality of service is unparalleled!"
1961,Five star treatment,50,July 2017,"The Seminyak Courtyard Marriott is a wonderful choice for families and couples heading to Bali's resort town of Seminyak. The long pool in the center of the hotel anchors this resort and serves as the gathering place for guests as well as a much needed shelter from the bustle outside.
You're only blocks from the beach where Marriott has their own section.
The rooms are Marriott gorgeous: comfy beds, well designed etc. Everything you would expect.
What makes this hotel stand out is it's staff which, even by Bali's over-the-top standard, is incredibly friendly and helpful.
Having just spent 3 weeks at a detox I eyed the breakfast buffet with alarm - bacon, eggs, milk, gluten - all off the diet.
Patrick, their exuberant chef swooped in and made me steamed veggies, found gluten free bread, made me a coconut milk cappuccino! What's not to love.

Thanks!!!!!"
1962,First Class without a Huge Price Tag,40,June 2017,"Spent 5 nights at the Courtyard Marriott with a direct pool access room and it was difficult to find fault with this hotel. The staff (nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they were always smiling), service and room service was extremely efficient and prompt, and the overall cleanliness and room spaciousness was a very pleasant surprise. There are two pool areas with a large swim up bar. Would definitely stay there again because of the above plus their attention to detail on many small things. Thank you Courtyard!"
1963,Pool Bar,50,May 2017,"We stayed at Courtyard Marriet for 10 days recently, during those 10 days we meet so many friendly and welcoming staff that made our stay much more enjoyable. The pool bar staff were amazing always happy and would interact with you and talk to you each day,and every morning they would greet you which made us happy and smile. The service was very good and quick , we wouldn't wait for ages to get served and get our drinks and the drinks were amazing nothing wrong with them! I loved my stay there and would definitely go back and visit the lovely staff that i meet and keep in touch with them!"
1964,Really nice affordable hotel,50,June 2017,"We stayed at the hotel recently for four nights when in Seminyak. The hotel is very nice and clean. Rooms and especially the bathrooms are very spacious. We had to request an extra bed as there were 3 of us but they can do this at a nominal cost.

The breakfast buffets are the best I've ever experienced. Huge variety of food and table service. Special thanks to Gita who served us every morning with a smile on her face. The hotel also have a really good happy hour early evening where drinks are discounted.

The only negative is that there are not enough sun loungers facing the sun but that's minor as they are the only hotel who has these on the beach a 5 min walk away.

Overall, great hotel and very reasonable for Seminyak!"
1965,Excellent Stay with Amazing & Friendly Staff,50,June 2017,"We stayed in June 17 and had an amazing stay at Courtyard. Our room was very large, with a pool view and immaculately cleaned everyday. The facilities are very well maintained and easily accessible. The breakfast had a huge range of options - cereal, healthy food, eggs, cooked food both western and asian and baked goods. The pool bar and staff at the pool bar were excellent, and I met a friendly staff member called Arta(?) who was a lovely young guy. Suti on the Taco Truck was a great person who was great to talk to whilst getting tacos and coffee each day! We were also lucky enough to be staying when they held their Chef cook off - the Iron Chef. The food was delicious! I couldn't recommend the Courtyard more highly."
1966,"Great stay, great service!",40,June 2017,"We stayed 8 nights late June through a Luxury Escapes package. We checked in around 2.30pm, our room was not ready so we were offered drinks and snacks in the pool bar which was lovely.
Our room was good, very clean but on the small side, we had an interconnecting room with our young children. We were on the top floor (level 6), we had a small balcony overlooking the pool.
Our children 6 and 3 spent some time in the kids club, this was good, but not a lot of interesting activities organised, up to two hours is enough time for them to spend there without getting too bored.
The pool area was nice, a bit tricky to manoeuvre a pram around. It was always busy, but we always seem to find a couple of lounges to sit on.
Breakfast was a highlight! A great range and all lovely and fresh and well presented. The icecream was a hit with the kids!
Through the Luxury Escapes package we received a massage voucher at the Zanti onsite day spa, this was amazing.
If you have a family and need laundry done, do not go to the small laundry next to Spa Bali, it is a ripoff! Walk a bit further and you will find Family Laundry near Wacko Burger. Family Laundry is amazing, great service, super cheap prices.
We also did two onsite dinners which were great, good value for money and very convenient with kids.
Lastly the real highlight was the staff, lovely friendly smiling faces, always greeting you, nothing was ever too much trouble.
Thank you Courtyard Bali for a great holiday!"
1967,Excellent Service at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak,50,June 2017,"My Wife and I went for a short holiday spending our Wedding Anniversary in Bali and the last time we were here was 25 yrs ago spending our honeymoon in the island of cultural, sun, delicious cuisine and beautiful places to visit.

We decided to stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak and so pleased with reception Ms Nyssa excellent service extended to during check in and check out.

Wow we were surprise by an anniversary cake. Excellent room facing Courtyard Marriott landmark amazing pool view. Amenities and mineral water provided daily as well as nice spacious room.

All the staff had made our stay the most enjoyable and wonderful gateway for us. Need we mention Mr John Wooly and his team of excellent staff Mr Made Muliana , Ms Narita, Mr Agus among the friendly and smiling staff we met at the hotel most wonderful buffet breakfast with excellent spread of local and international selections. Loving the fresh juice bar and smoothies bowl self mixture of dragon fruit yoghurt with fresh fruits n nuts and muesli. Always enjoyed the atmosphere here.

There's lots of activities provided by the hotel which guests can join complimentary and one of it is the yoga class which was conducted on the hotel roof top by Mr Agus that we found very rejuvenated and refreshing under the morning sun and view of the mountains.

It was nice to be back here for holiday and it will never be the last. Definitely will make Courtyard Marriott Seminyak our preferred hotel due to its excellent location and nearby amenities as well as friendly staff that makes it memorable."
1968,High recommend,50,May 2017,"I've been in Bali on holidays and we stay for 10 nights on Courtyard Marriott and we just love every single day there.

There is some negatives points special the shadow in swimming pool and doesn't allow us to have sun all day there. Also no
Much spaces to stay around of swimming pool.
Other thing is not a negative point but something at times make myself feel uncomfortable and was the check security all the time we get in hotel. Is good for one side we do feel safe but in other way was something we had to be checked every time like we are dangerous persons. But I do understand and makes everyone feel secure and safe.

Apart of that I don't have issues regarding this hotel. Rooms are fantastic, great size and clean. All rooms has a balcony where we can spent some time and rest. Rooms are cleaned daily and towels changed.
Staff are fantastic and hard workers and always with smile on face. All of them has good level of English.
Hotel provided different activities through days I've been there.
Restaurant of hotel is good and food is delicious. The days I've been there the had different style of dinner we could book and enjoy. We did join the festival wine, beer and food. The food truck just on entrance was spot on, cheap and delicious;)

Beach near 5 min walking or hotel provides transport few times during day of you want to spend day in the beach just get transport or just walk.

High recommend to everyone to stay on courtyard"
1969,"Surprising Gem: Good Location, Lovely Room & Great Breakfast",50,June 2017,"Stayed 2 nights at Courtyard before moving to Jimbaran. Very happy with stay. Generally central location with easy access to the restaurants, shopping areas and amenities. Easy to get taxis at entrance. Security into the hotel was tight - which was reassuring. Room was v v comfortable - well designed and had super generous pillows - slept really well. Breakfast was very very good. Wide variety to choose from and excellent quality. The food truck at the hotel entrance is a nice touch and the rendang taco I ordered was great. Only issue was that my room was above the main road and it was a little noisy at times. Overall, an excellent hotel. I actually missed it when I moved to the Jimbaran hotel even though it was supposedly a more luxurious hotel."
1970,"A Gem in Seminyak, Nice Hotel with good food",50,June 2017,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights,

love this hotel, the Room is Big & modern, have terrace, beds are very comfy,
Big swimming pools
Hotel staffs are well trained, the hotel is well manage...
Breakfast is really good quality & taste
actually, the hotel restaurant food is much better quality & taste compared with nearby restaurants..."
1971,Pool bar,50,June 2017,"Perfect for family's and couples, great service from all staff. Very friendly, all staff interacted very well with our kids, especially Astiti. Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak. Pool bar and cocktail menu fantastic."
1972,Cute service from the staff,40,June 2017,"Enjoy the stay here, book 2 room for 3 nights . One with pool access and the other is standard room. Unluckily the pool access that we've got is in the corner and the access to kids pool. Location is strategist in the seminyak where you can find a lot of restaurants, that finding food is easy. Club and shops are around. The staff rizky and rai also give some sweet service for us. Thank you"
1973,Fantastic Stay,40,June 2017,"This was our 2nd time to Courtyard by Marriott. We loved in so much last year we didn't even think of staying somewhere else. Great to see they retain their staff as well. Many familiar faces from last year. A great sign that they are happy workers. Very friendly, genuine & attentive service. We experienced a small air conditioning problem with our room & they corrected this immediately. Then they even touched based with us over the next 2 days to make sure we were ok. What Fantastic follow-up ! Really great service !!! Great Breakfasts too ! Very good location in Seminyak."
1974,Loved it... üíôüíôüíô,50,June 2017,"Perfect location, really nice hotel and atmosphere, excellent comfortable bed, yummy selections of breakfast and free yoga class.
Stayed here for 5 night and really enjoyed our vacay... tried out yoga class, excellent coach Pak Merta üëçand posed for acro yoga for 1st time... click... thanks for your all your staff hospitality... Keep it up..."
1975,Nice resort,40,June 2017,"This was my second time staying here and I was a little disappointed this time unfortunately.

Check in- we arrived at about 5.30 and where told our room type was not available. I have made direct contact with the hotel prior as we where travelling with our 2 year old daughter. I requested a king bed room with a crib or roll out bed provided for her. They only had twin rooms available. I know the twin rooms are to small to fit a crib in since I have previously stayed in one so we had to all squeeze into the twin beds which ruined our sleeps. I know this is not the hotels fault but it really did ruin our experience here a bit. They did offer us a small resort credit which was good of them but maybe that's only because I was really upset!

Kids club- amazing! Our daughter went in with our nanny as she was to young. She had the best time and the staff where all great. They moved around the resort for some of the activities which was nice for the kids.

Rooms- we had a pool terrace twin room on the side of the resort (these get more sun than the ones down the very end so are a bit nicer and brighter). It was nice and a good one to stay in if you have kids. If you don't have kids and don't need to access the room often I would recommend a pool view room on a high floor at the reception end of the hotel. I stayed in this one last time and it was so much lighter and brighter with a great view looking down the resort. Much nicer than the pool terrace rooms and cheaper. It also had a way better layout and seemed bigger because of that.

Breakfast- is good, lots of fruit flies around the food which put me off a bit but over all great selection and beautifully set out.

Pool bar area- this is a awesome area to chill out, they have a nice little seating area, great menu and cocktail list and music playing. We spent a bit of time here while our daughter was at kids club.

Overall I would might stay here again as It's good value but there are a few things that put me off this time. Staff are all very friendly and rooms are clean. It's in an ok location but I think I prefer the end of Seminyak up by Potato Head where the restaurant and shops are a bit better which is fine if you have a scooter."
1976,First Bali Trip,50,June 2017,"This was our first trip to Bali, the Courtyard was recommended to me by multiple people, so it made our decision to stay there a confident one.

The service was great, the staff are super friendly and always happy to accommodate with any request and the rooms are spacious, clean and serviced daily.
Two out of the six travelers had nut allergies, which we thought would be a little difficult to deal with, but the staff at the Courtyard were very understanding and once again, happy to do whatever they had to, to ensure everybody was safe.
The Buffet Breakfast is a must, with a huge selection of fresh food and drinks.

Thank You to the Marriot for making our stay extremely comfortable. I would definitely stay at the Courtyard again."
1977,Loved it here!,40,July 2016,"We stayed here for 8 nights and loved it. I've been to Bali 4 times now and really enjoyed the location in Seminyak. I'd definitely come again, management and staff were friendly and helpful, even shouted us a cold beer whilst we were waiting for our restaurant tour to pick us up. We had a room on the 2nd floor, it was quiet, clean and nicely set out. Breakfasts were fantastic, everything was cooked fresh and was delicious as were lunch and dinner on the couple of night we are here. So close the the beach too, the hotel has its own private beach area for you to relax in which was fantastic and they have a shuttle drop off and pick up too. Highly recommended."
1978,Nice hotel with great breakfast,50,June 2017,"1) Hotel is well maintained and bedroom is nice with big bathroom.
2) Location is 10 minutes walk to the beach and there are quite a number of restaurants (along Jalan Double Six) which are good spot for watching sunset. Many outlets place bean bags on the sandy beach for guests to sit on.
3) Breakfast spread is good catering to those who like western breakfast. Especially for the heath conscious who like to have lots of fresh fruit juices and fruits.
4) Location wise : there are restaurants and classy and ordinary looking spas within 300m walk from the hotel. So you're spoiled for choice."
1979,"Location, location, location",50,June 2017,"This was our second stay at the Marriott thru Luxury Escapes and again we were not disappointed. Its location is central to everything. As with all building structures in Bali it doesn't take long for the elements to take their toll and the exterior surfaces need some facelift. The rooms, albeit on the smaller size, were totally adequate, clean and well maintained.
The staff were amazing, never failing to go the extra mile to make sure all your concerns were addressed and rectified. In particular thank you to Wahyu, the lobby Concierge who went out of his way on a number of occasions to help us. As far as the grounds and overall complex,aesthetically it is not the ""Mulia"" but the staff and overall experience definitely are. Will definitely be back."
1980,Honeymoon stay,50,June 2017,"Fantastic hotel. My wife and I stayed here for a week as part of our honeymoon and were greeted with complimentary cake and rose petals in our room on arrival. Staff could not be more helpful. Food is great, 5 mins max walk to the beach. Lots of shops locally too"
1981,One of the best Marriott hotels we had ever stayed,50,May 2017,"A Marriott elite member, Tanoto.

We have been traveling more than 50 countries and most of the time have stayed at the Marriott hotels. But this Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak has been our favourite place to stay when we are visiting Bali since its opening in July/ August 2014. Our entire family stayed in August about 2 - 3 weeks after grand opening celebrating our 46 years wedding anniversary. And since that time we have always stayed at this nice hotel every time we visit Bali.
This is an amazing resort, and last May was the fifth time staying here. And, amazingly they still remember our anniversary and we got a very special welcome in our room and we have a special Marriott staff accompanying us to our room. Our room was decorated with a special wedding anniversary welcome. Thank you for this special attention. And, that's why after our trip to Flores we came back to stay at this hotel and brought our other friends to stay here too. This place is almost like our home while travelling. The staff are absolutely wonderful, very happy, friendly and very attentive to us. What amazed us that staff remembered our names from previous visits. We noticed a big difference with the kitchen, there was a larger variety of food compared to our previous visits especially at grand opening time. The quality of the food was excellent and well presented. Finally i must compliment the management, especially the front office manager and the director of operation who made time to meet us during our stay. And, also all there staff they were amazing and a credit to the resort. We are certainly going to return back in next year when we will have our 50th anniversary.."
1982,"Great Location, Nice Pool",50,June 2017,"We booked a deluxe terrace room, with two twin beds. It was a spacious room and was enough space for two people travelling together. There was plenty of closet and drawer space. The bathroom was spacious and had plenty of counter space for two women with lots of accessories.

Our room had access to the pool and it was very convenient to pop in and out. We don't mind the noise, and if you like it to be very quiet, this might not be a good choice for you. It seems that all rooms face into the pool, but being on the first floor, there is a bit more noise from the fun taking place at the pool.

When we arrived, they offered us a deal on resort credit - basically about a 80% rate. We took it and used up 2million rupiah during our five day stay - mostly on drinks and the occasional room service. We didn't pay in advance for the breakfast. I know that their breakfast buffet has received great reviews. I only ate there once and preferred to go to nearby restaurants for my meals. The selection was really good, but I'm not a big breakfast person, so the buffet is a bit wasted on me. The best part of the buffet were the smoothies and fresh juice.

The staff were very helpful. They organized a tour for us and our driver was really good. If they offer to arrange for other transport to various Seminyak location, the cost is significantly higher than if you took a taxi. For example, they charged us 100,000 rupiah for a trip to the Potato Head Beach Club. We took another transport back and they only charged us 60,000. After a few days, I figured that it would've likely cost us 30,000 to take a Blue Bird taxi.

The beach was also nice. There was a shuttle that took us there. The space was set back from the water, but it offered a nice sanctuary from all the sales people on the beach. On one of the days, we decided to rent chairs closer to the water -- this cost 200,000 for the day. We were definitely approached more often at this location. It's really a personal choice.

Overall, our stay was very good. The location was excellent for walking to everything - shopping, food, and beach. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were modern and clean. I would return in a heartbeat."
1983,Bali vacation,50,June 2017,"Loved your hotel! Staff very friendly, food yummy, close to beach and shopping, clean good size rooms, highly recommended hotel . Thankyou to all your helpfull staff, nothing is a problem !
We will definatley stay here again next time we are in Bali."
1984,"'A wonderful experience, an amazing resort.",50,May 2017,"This is an amazing resort, this was the third occasion that we have been there. The staff are absolutely wonderful, very happy, friendly and cant do enough for you. What amazed us that staff remembered our names from previous visits. We noticed a big difference with the kitchen, there was a larger variety of food compared to our previous visit. The quality of the food was excellent and well presented. The truck at the front of the premises was also a great idea. Our room was great and very comfortable and clean. I want to make mention to a particular staff member who works at the pool bar, her name is Cinta who went above the call of duty to assist my wife who recently had two serious back operations, she was wonderful with the care and help she provided. Finally i must compliment the management on all there staff they were amazing and a credit to the resort. We are certainly going to return back in the future."
1985,Dissapointed. Freezing cold gloomy Pool.,30,June 2017,"Great room, once it was changed, first room was dark , and gloomy, tucked away behind a concrete fountain, hardly a pool view room, which incidentally we did pay a lot extra for. However that was rectified, thanks very much to helpful staff. However the fact that the sun hardly hits the pool area made the water freezing cold, glad everybody loved the pool side bar in other reviews but truly there was hardly anybody in it. those other folks must have been wearing thermal swimwear. I'm sorry I know that the hotel can't do anything bout the total gloom over the rooms over one side of the hotel, but lazing in the sun is what its all about for my husband and me, swimming up to bar , cocktails in the water the great Bali experience and it was just not there.
On the other hand food was great and staff were fantastic.
But sorry won't be staying there again."
1986,"Great location, great pool and awesome breakfast",50,May 2017,"On our 9th trip to Bali, the Courtyard Marriott was an excellent place to stay. From check-in to the unfortunate time that we had to check-out, this hotel exceeded all expectations. The central point of the pool was excellent; a well serviced bar with a great poolside menu with fast and friendly service was exceptional. We paid additional to get a pool terrace room which gave us easy access to the pool and other facilities within the hotel. There were occasions when the pool was busy and many of the loungers were taken, but there wasn't a day where we couldn't source a lounger. The breakfast was excellent, with such a magnificent variety of food and staff always so friendly on arrival. We stayed with 4 adults and 3 children a across 2 rooms and the experience was great, whilst the kids were initially apprehensive about the kids club, the super friendly staff made the experience a great one and the kids wanted to keep going back. They loved the variety of activities and the special greeting and smile they recieved each time they went. We dined at the Seminyak kitchen which was a great experience, it was made even more special when 2 of the chefs came to say hello and talk to us about our experience and the great food we had just experienced. The Taco truck is an excellent addition with the staff being so welcoming and friendly, the trademark Marriott security as experienced at other hotels in Indonesia was very welcomed, always greeting you with a smile. The location of this hotel is Seminyak is ideal, so close to the beach, excellent dining and great shopping but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Eat street in the heart of Seminyak. I highly recommend this hotel as a great option in Seminyak for families, couple and single travellers. Can't wait to come back."
1987,Holday in Bali,40,June 2017,Our first visit to the Courtyard and it was lovely. Helpful smiley staff all the time. The hotel is lovely and clean and the rooms a great size. Breakfast is very nice with super staff. Highly recommend this hotel.
1988,"Great Experience , wonderful breakfast amazing staff",50,May 2017,"I stayed at the Courtyard Seminyak resort, what a wonderful surprise, the staff is vey amazing helpful and attends to all the needs of the clients.
One of the best breakfasts I ever had, even though the resort is not at the beach the ambiance around the pool is very relaxing , and pleasant ."
1989,Beautiful and relaxing!,50,June 2017,"Amazing place to stay. Great service, amazing food, extremely friendly staff and a great place to relax. Second time coming back to Courtyard and will come again for our next trip. Such a beautiful place, highly recommend!"
1990,Thank you Anton and Grant,50,June 2017,"This is my our second visit to the courtyard Marriott for the second year in a row. We were pleasantly welcomed again by staff that recognised us, in particular Anton the restaurant manager. Last year he organised a surprise cake for my birthday !!!! This year house keeping left me a cake for my birthday. At no stage did we mention it was my birthday. Last year we celebrated our wedding anniversary ( no children), this year with our children.
The staff will do anything to ensure you are comfortable and that all your expectations are met. They are ABOVE AND BEYOND. Thank you to everyone. From Grant the manager who ensures your stay is comfortable, greeting you . To check in staff, restaurant staff, house keeping, the great pool and amenities. Even the little touches for kids like free pop corn. A great family destination, and great for couples. We will be back? AGAIN AND AGAIN. Thank you to Anton for giving me photos from my last visit !!!!!!!"
1991,Loved it,50,June 2017,"Our first trip to Bali and we really enjoyed our time at the Courtyard. Rooms were nice, clean, modern. Bathroom could have use a few more towel hooks but that was the only annoying thing. Pool was a little on the cold side for my liking but loved the day beds and floating beanbags. Cocktails were amazing (passionfruit mojito and island ice tea were my favs) and food was great, breakfast variety was great. Coffee ok but not the best I've had. Staff were friendly and helpful. Location great, away from the main strips but within walking distance or quick taxi. We loved it and will be back for sure!"
1992,Relaxing week,40,April 2017,"We absolutely loved our time at the Courtyard. Such a stylish hotel. The rooms are a good size, extremely clean and comfortable! All the amenities you would require with a large balcony and sofa.... great for chilling before you head to bed. The breakfast was delicious! The range and amount of food and juices was amazing!! You could eat anything from fruit, pastries, local cuisine to a full monty fry up!! Love it!! The location was excellent and the staff incredibly friendly and very helpful! We were about 400m from the beach, where there were of plenty of bars and restaurant where you could view the sunset! However, there is a pool and pool bar! The only issue is the hotel building blocks the sun around 4pm. Seminyak town centre and main shopping mall is around a 20 minute walk, however, the hotel is on a shopping strip with plenty bars, restaurants, shops and spa's. Highly recommend."
1993,Excellent Service,50,June 2017,"Everything about our stay was great, the buffet breakfasts, 24 hour room service ,pool bar,it was all fantastic.We booked in for the beer wine food festival with 2 vegetarians in our group and the staff could not have been more helpful in providing meals for them that were seperate to the menu and it was most appreciated.
Also , as we had a 10:30pm flight , the hotel gave us a 7:00pm check out at no extra cost which we were willing to pay for but the hotel would not hear of it.
All in all we all had a wonderful experience,but if I did have a complaint it would be that the pool was little cold (boo hoo)"
1994,"Courtyard by Marriott, Family for The Win",50,June 2017,"I travelled for the first time ever to Bali (an indo but yes... Quite embarrassing) with my family & our friends with their 1 yo baby. We picked Marriott Seminyak, mainly because the good price that was offered & looking at some of the photos we were quite pleased. Upon arriving, we were impressed. The facilities are great, the room is clean, & most of all what a friendly place to call home away from home! All the staff, & i mean ALL always greet us with sincere smiles on their faces, pleasant to talk to & with, never seem to ever have a bad day. Ps. Thank you for whoever prepared my morning coffee ready on my breakfast table, without me asking for it...what a sweet gesture & nice surprise! üòÑ

One of the outstanding factors is their security procedure: they always check every single car in & security scan for every person going in, making our stay feel safer & comfortable.

Thank you Marriott, from the bottom of our hearts for an unforgettable experience of a true Indonesian sincerity & hospitality. Hope to see you again on our next adventure in the haven that is Bali xx"
1995,Amazing service!,50,June 2017,"I can highly recommend this place!!!! The kidsclub and the lady Nisa is amazing. She kept sending me pictures of my kids there and what they did of activities.
My daughter tripped down a step near the pool and she had to get 2 stitches in the forehead. The doctor team at the hotel was great and in no time they had her all stitched up again. So no need for me to find a hospital or to leave the hotel. She was offered ice-cream and in the evening a ""Get well"" basket arrived in our room with a greeting card. That is what I call good service! I will return."
1996,Friendly and Relaxing,50,June 2017,"Thanks to Anton and his staff.
Beautiful and friendly people, relaxing, felt like royalty. Activities for all ages. If you require anything they're happy to assist with a smile. I would definately go there again.

Natalie"
1997,Exceptional!,50,June 2017,"Such a wonderful stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. Will always remember my 50th birthday celebration at this fabulous resort! The extra special and amazing service by pool bar, cleaning and restaurant staff is first class. The relaxing atmosphere and the wonderful General Manager (Mr Woolley) and his commitment to ensuring his guests are enjoying their stay is the sign of excellent management!"
1998,Gracious Employees that take care of your every need!,50,June 2017,"Excellent Front Desk check-in, friendly and fast. Was escorted to a beautiful suite overlooking the pool area. This is hands down the most lovely Marroitt Courtyard I have ever stayed at. The employees are so helpful, always smiling, and they truly go the extra mile to make sure your every need is catered to.
Jordy made sure I was able to stay in my suite an extra 2 days when my plans charged and I needed longer accommodations.
I stumbled onto an early yoga class and had the pleasure of meeting yoga teachers,
Agus & Suyadnya. Enjoyed both of their classes, consecutively, Friday & Saturday. Tiffany, the event coordinator, took some great shots of the Friday Class on my iPhone, which was greatly appreciated.
I can't say enough about the breakfast buffet- expansive, delicious, and beautiful presentation. I was especially fond of the juice bar and employee, Arya. He made me a speciality drink each morning, which was delicious and super fresh.
The employees are what make this Marriott property a real stand out!!!"
1999,outstanding !,50,June 2017,"this visit has to be the best I have experienced since coming to Bali...from the breakfast, which is endless and full of variety, to the absolutely wonderful staff, who are courteous and so helpful, to the hotel itself which is stunning and suits people of all ages...and the position of the hotel which is only a short walk to the beach, but if you cant be bothered to walk, a golf buggy is laid on to take you there!...I can only praise and thank all staff for helping me experience such an awesome holiday!!...I already feel lucky I am coming back in June! thankyou one and all!!!...by thw way, we returned in June, and if its at all possible enjoyed even more 2nd time around!!...I cannot tell you just how friendly, warm and helpful the staff are, a must visit place if coming to Bali"
2000,Exceeded all expectations,50,June 2017,"Wow. From the moment I arrived, I was treated to a level of service I've never experienced before. Food was exceptional. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. Beds very comfortable. MUST TRY the spa. Had a Traditional
Balinese massage for 90 min and then the Traditional Balinese Ritual for 3hrs. Faultless.

Only suggestion is to have a sheet on the bed under the doonah. Doonah gets too hot at night."
2001,Awesome experience,50,June 2017,"Was there for a 2 day seminar/ workshop, staying for 5 days.

The rooms are really nice, beds are comfortable, rooms clean and the staff are amazing, so lovely and accomodating.

The food is great and a few options you can eat at restaurants or get served by the pool.

Great for a conference they really look after you.

The Day spa is amazing, pools are great with pool bar, close the the beach, restaurants and bars.

Great experience and highly recommend it.

Thanks for a great trip."
2002,Fun and Relaxing,50,June 2017,We had a great stay at this hotel - everyone was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great and the room was nice and clean. The pool area was nice but there were times when it was difficult to find a seat in the sun. The beach chairs were a bit of a walk and just okay - would like it more if they were closer to the water.
2003,Perfect holiday!,50,June 2017,"Highly recommended!!!! Fantastic staff, always friendly and wanting to help with any question.
The room was neat and spacious. Breakfast was a feast every day!!
Thank you to yoga for making the BEST tacos on the taco truck out the front!!!
We will return :)"
2004,Holiday,50,June 2017,"Highly Recommended

Great hotel, Great location and Fantastic staff.
I would highly recommend this hotel to all our family and friends coming to Bali.
This was our first visit to Bali on a luxury escape package.
Special thanks to the great staff of the hotel who made our stay in Bali so enjoyable, In particular Anton, Augustine, Ross, Cinta, Nara , Dewi.
John you and your staff make this hotel a great place to stay.

Thanks

2005,What The Truck- Delicious,50,May 2017,"Situated outside of the Marriot Courtyard Hotel we stopped here to pick up lunch as we were walking past. We sampled a beef rendang and a pork taco. Served in soft wraps. Two wraps per portion, generous. The filling was juicy and delicious. Washed down with a beer and a cider. Yum."
2006,Great Resort + Wonderful Staff,40,June 2017,"I did a last minute short break with my daughter and stayed at this fantastic resort. I love the place as the location is ideal for us - everything is within reach.

The room is nicely appointed and clean. We were upgraded to a nice poolview room. The staff are genuinely caring especially Anton, the Asst F&B Manager. He was one of the reasons why we returned to stay at the resort. At our last visit, my daughter was down with flu and was not able to enjoy the facilities for about 2 days. Anton showed concern by offering his assistance and constantly checking on her wellbeing. We have not forgotten how special he made us feel then. The staff at front desk, Seminyak Kitchen and Zanti Spa are also very warm and friendly.

My other feedback is the pool. The area is small and the deck chairs are limited due to space constraint. I wish that the resort can collaborate with Courtyard Nusa Dua by running a daily shuttle to/from the two resorts so that the guests from both resorts can also enjoy the facilities there as they are both managed by Marriott International - just an idea."
2007,Everything you need in one place,40,June 2017,"Fantastic resort with great amenities, you really don't need to lift a finger while staying here! Rooms are big and clean.
Walkable to shops, a short taxi ride to the main strip of restaurants. All the staff are very friendly. Personally there is too many kids at this resort for my liking so next time I will probable look at staying elsewhere."
2008,We come back here for the kids club!,50,June 2017,"We have visited Courtyard Marriott twice in six months! Santi and Komang from the Kids Club are sensational Children Carers. My three kids 6, 4 & 2... absolutely fell in love with Them. Santi in particular is very special. She looked after my children every evening, so my husband and I could enjoy and explore the restaurants on Eat Street. Nothing was too hard, her communication was excellent and we never had any issues. After the first trip my children spoke of Santi so many times that we decided we had to revisit. The staff in the restaurant during Breakfast were amazing too, helpful and accommodating. The resort itself is perfect for families. Great location, fantastic food and rooms are modern, very clean, comfortable and spacious. The only thing I had a problem with, was the pool service. Trying to order food and drinks most of the time was very slow. I would stay there a third time! Why... because the location is awesome! Restaurants, bars and beach all within walking distance."
2009,Great service,50,June 2017,"We met up with friends and all of us were impressed with the service, given it was so busy. Excellent security. All the staff are a credit to Marriott. Really great facilities for families. Food was good too. Lots of entertainment if you want it. My wife even played Bingo at 2pm."
2010,Best Bar staff ever,50,June 2017,"A week here was just not long enough, but a huge thanks to Wika and the rest of the bar staff for helping to make our stay so much fun. Their customer service was great, even remembering our names each night. Thank you and can't wait to visit again"
2011,"Great hotel. Just watch out for the nasty ""private taxi""",40,June 2017,"The hotel is great. Friendly staff. The only thing they can improve is the juices. Both at the breakfast and at the bar downstairs.

Uber and Grab are forbidden in Bali. However I regularly used it. Cheap and convenient. I don't see how this can be illegal but then again it is legal to have non-metered taxi rides or ""private taxi"". The private taxi in front of the hotel chased away my Grab car and then offered to take me to the airport for 5x the price... I just went 100m further and ordered a new Grab. I used Grab bike all week and went from Seminyak to Kuta for about 10.000 rupiah or even less. So thanks Grab to make my stay in Bali a lot more convenient, happy to deal with friendly drivers and not with ""private taxi"" or Bali taxi who think they can ask prices that are higher than Singapore."
2012,Excellent Service - Customer/Hotel Loyalty is important too,40,June 2017,"First time staying at the CourtYard in Bali. Last time, was at the Courtyard in Bangkok. Service at both are ""courtyards"" are excellent.

Room condition are great, breakfast at teh Seminyak Kitchen is good. We just came from a 5D/4N stay from Club Med Bali. First impression was the ""spread"" was nowhere when compared to Club Med. The taste of the food was the ultimate winner.

Location wise, the free buggy service brings you to the ""food street"" of Seminyak. Many restaurant within walking distance.

Taxi rides from the nearby restaurant at ""food street"" are very reasonable.

The only ""downer"" was when I inform front desk that we would be checking out 1 day earlier, they immediately assumed, we booked via the ""various online travel portal"", and thus it was a pre-paid stuff, and we would forfeit our payment. Upon check in, it was made clear that we booked direct, and it was a corporate rate, which is not ""pre-paid in advance"".

Hope the hotel will remember though it must adapt to the 'new online culture and payment', the old corporate culture where customer loyatly is still very valuable.

We do known online portal gives us cheaper rates, and we don't get recognition for booking via such portal. We still booked direct, in order to be loyal customers.."
2013,"The best holiday we have had in sometime, a lot to do with the Hotel",50,June 2017,I want to support my Wife's review of the Courtyard Marriott. Superb staff in all areas with their service and attention to detail first class. I loved the way their executive staff appeared every day moving around taking to guests and helping their staff in menial tasks. we loved our room on the 6th floor and it was well serviced. The location was spot on and we felt very secure with their team of security people being very vigilant. I have nothing but compliments and we will be back. Ian Cousins
2014,LOOK NO FURTHER,50,June 2017,This is a really great place to stay at. Rooms are well appointed and spotless. All staff are very efficient and friendly. The restaurant is very well managed and produces excellent fare. The pool area is great. The spa is tranquil. The gym is small but immaculate. The property as a whole is exceptionally well maintained and managed. It is also well priced. All in all so good that we hope to return for a further stay in November 2017.
2015,Great location,50,June 2017,"Everything was as it said it was.
John and his team couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Will definitely be staying there again.
The location being so handy for the beach and a stroll to shops bars etc.
Colin Perth"
2016,Fabulous Dinner,50,June 2017,"We visited the Seminyak Kitchen for dinner and it was fabulous. Everything from the moment we arrived to paying our bill was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the coconut curry and my husband had the roasted chicken and we were both very pleased with our meal. We also received a welcome drink and some bread while we waited. Particular mention to our excellent waiter Jul, he was genuine, attentive and very friendly. We could not have asked for a better service and we will defiantly be back."
2017,Just as before,50,June 2017,"The Courtyard by Marriott is one of the best 5 star hotels I've stayed with. Yes I could say others have had aspects which may have been better individually.

My last review in 2015 spoke of the somewhat austere architecture of a hotel not long opened.

An overview would suggest the poolside rooms are well appointed, spacious enough, with pool access right outside the door.

Staff are superbly trained without a hint of ""Bali hurry up and wait"". Attention to detail and customer service is second to none.

Client facilities rate the same.

Another great stay."
2018,Beautiful clean hotel,50,May 2017,"We stayed here for 4 nights as the first part of our 16 day stay in Bali

The hotel was very clean, the room was spacious and spotless. The staff were all very polite, welcoming and attentive

It's quite expensive inside the hotel for food / cocktails however there's a Taco truck on the grounds of the hotel which is very reasonable and sells delicious food!

The location of the hotel is great with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. You can also walk to the beach in less than 10 minutes

The pool gets quite busy and we did struggle to get sunbeds on one day.

Would recommend this hotel & stay again."
2019,Spectacular Resort Central to Everything!,50,May 2017,"This was my first (but certainly not last) visit to Bali and I wanted to be central to all the island has to offer. I did not want to be locked away at a lonely resort where you must drive to get everywhere. I'm so happy with my choice to stay here at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak, as it truly combined the very best location and beach access with being on one of Seminyak's main streets AND having full resort amenities. It is absolutely a perfect choice for a first time visitor. I had emailed beforehand to arrange a hotel car service for pickup at the airport. I had no trouble organizing this with the hotel and the driver was exactly where he was supposed to be with the CY sign & my name to greet me. It is a few dollars more than a taxi, but after flying virtually 2 days it was very much worth it. On my return trip to the airport the hotel called a reputable taxi company that always uses the meter (Bluebird I believe)-very much appreciated.

After about a 40 minute journey (Bali traffic near the airport is surprisingly heavy) I arrived at the hotel where every vehicle goes through a side entrance for a brief security screen. If you are aware of Bali's unfortunate past history this procedure has become necessary. When walking into the hotel you must also go through an airport style X-ray machine. I found both to be completely convenient, quick and courteous. For safety's sake it is completely worth it. Check in was a breeze in the lovely open air lobby. I was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a one bedroom suite as a Marriott Rewards Gold member. I was allowed to check out the room first as it was on the ground floor facing the inner pool area (my profile says high floor)...& I found it to be perfectly fine due to lots of plants and trees between the room & pool. Noise or privacy really were not an issue with my ground floor room.

Upon entry to my room there was a large living room/dining area with sofa, table & 4 chairs and a large refrigerator stocked with soda, waters & beer. It also had plenty of room for your own supplies. There is a fairly large market directly across the street. I had a separate large king bedroom with second flat screen tv and large dressing room and closets/safe. Lastly there was a large bathroom with a huge deluge equipped shower area (no tub) and a Toto toilet. All very sleek modern and clean. I had regular housekeeping service daily AND turndown service each night without asking.

The pool area and swim up bar are central to the social/recreation areas of the hotel. The pool is sectioned off for adults only by the bar and more family oriented on the other end. There is a ""land side"" bar where you can get food and enjoy different live entertainment nightly. Also nightly is a Happy Hour(s) that offer 2 for 1 drinks off a special menu. I was extremely impressed by the entertainment and HH. It is a lot of fun. Speaking of fun, you will notice on old VW bus out front called ""What the Truck"". It is converted to a funky food Truck where you can get a variety of food & drink. One evening I was there they moved this VW and added about 20 more to the lot next to the hotel for a food truck block party-a really fun time!

I had breakfast included each morning in the open air Seminyak Kitchen restaurant. It is a spectacular buffet encompassing local Balinese/Indonesian fare, other Asian delicacies and western favorites. The wait staff will happily bring you hot/iced coffees & teas or help yourself to an array of juices and beverages. You can easily eat for the entire day at breakfast!

The location of the hotel is on one of Seminyak's main roads. Lots of nightlife, bars and restaurants can be found by turning left out of the hotel. If you are a gay traveler, note the islands concentration of bars is also located here, only a 5 minute walk away. If you turn right out of the hotel in 5 minutes you will reach the beach. You will be facing west, so go at least once for a spectacular sunset! Several cool & fun bars and restaurants are to your left once you get to the beach path. The hotel maintains a beach of their own but I did not use it. There is a shuttle provided to take you there but going down the street was good enough for me.

There are also full day tours offered at the bell desk. I took the one that went to Ubud and surrounding areas. The cost was 700,000 Rupiah for just over 6 hours & 3 stops (Batuan Hindu Temple, the Sacred Monkey Forest & the Tegalalang Rice Terraces). The Monkey Forest was brilliant-I could have stayed all day!

One evening I was invited to a Manager's Reception on the terrace of the Seminyak Kitchen. It was such a delight to meet the fine people that make the resort so wonderfully fun and inviting. Many thanks to John, the General Manager & Ketut, the Front Office Manager. You have a spectacular resort and a superior staff working with you. All my queries and needs were met with a smile and a can do attitude. I can only hope to return someday to my new favorite Courtyard! Thanks again for a truly memorable holiday experience."

2021,Fantastic resort,50,,"Our family had an amazing holiday at the Merriott courtyard Seminyak, the staff were fantastic very warm and friendly, the ""Seminyak kitchen"" for breakfast was certainly a highlight and most definitely the best in Bali. The kids enjoyed the pool and kids club and the adults enjoyed the cocktails by the pool!!! We will be returning annually....."
2022,Excellent Stay,50,June 2017,"We arrived at the hotel at 14:30 hrs and after a waiting for the room were given a free upgrade to a pool view room, Nice.

The room was clean and housekeeping did a brilliant job on the days we requested for service. Breakfast was amazing,...with a good choice and variety, the staff though busy were extremely friendly and efficient.We did try the Tacos from What's the Truck and it was good.The staff at the Pool bar were superb and though went there only on a couple of occassions, the manager and sevice staff ""Chintan"" stand out.

The hotel location is just close to the shopping area and a 5 minute walk to the beach, which is another +

Would definitely recommend Courtyard Marriott."
2023,Great location .great staff,50,June 2017,"This is a very nice place to stay ,we went there as an offer from Luxury Escapes, it was very good value .
Our room was nice ,good size bathroom,balcony facing onto the pool (all rooms face onto the pool area)The room was lovely and clean
The staff in all areas were very helpful and happy and friendly two staff members that went way above were Arya and Arti (hope I got right) Both lovely young men.All the staff were great but they stood out."
2024,Awesome Place To Relax,40,July 2016,"We were upgraded on check in to a room that went straight out to the pool. The breakfast was lovely, cocktails menu for the pool was awesome and they were not that expensive at all. Highly recommend staying here."
2025,"Great food, great location, great atmosphere",50,June 2017,"I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again. Everyone is very friendly and the service is great. They strive to give you the best customer service as well as quality food in the ""seminyak kitchen"" and ""what the truck"". Best breakfast I've had and the rooms are very clean. The location is great because it's not too loud and the beach is a 5 minute walk away. Thank you for a great stay!"
2026,Great Location and Hotel,40,April 2017,"Having always stayed at the Padma in Legion this was our first visit to the courtyard marriot and we were not disappointed.

Great location, easy to get to everything including eat street on the hotel buggy when available. Good rooms and clean and modern bathrooms. Great swim up bar. Thanks to Penni at swim up bar who makes some amazing cocktails and is very friendly. Breakfast is also very good and they provide complimentary takeaway drinks/coffees if asked.

Yes, there is the security scanning overtime you enter the hotel but it wasn't a bother and its for our own safety after all.

Ari (i'm sure thats his name)at the front desk was very helpful. He went over and above whenever we needed any help. Even when the buggy were out of action he drove us in a hotel vehicle to eat street. He tried very hard to get us last minute table at some of the best local restaurants (mamasen , sarong etc). Always a good idea to book a couple of weeks in advance at peak periods.

One area of improvement is that there should be more awareness made of the hotel's relationship with various restaurants that have specials for hotel guests. Its only on the last day i found out about these after having visit some of the restaurants so could not take advantage of these specials. A little booklet in rooms with these offers or alternatively on the map you provide (which i think is a great thing).

Also the visible presence of management at breakfast was great talking to residents , clearing up etc was great. Probably the first hotel where I've seen that sort of interaction.

We will return for sure."
2027,"Great vibe, great service, in the middle of everything",50,May 2017,"A full service hotel with everything you need and terrific service to boot. Everyone goes out of their way to be helpful and you can't walk past anyone without them giving you a smile. We started each day at the BEST breakfast in the world. One day we say by the pool all day listening to good music and enjoying the great food, drink, and service. The tour desk made it easy to book a car to visit local temples and other tourist attractions. The beach is a quick walk down the street, and its worth a visit - especially for the sunset. Lots of great restaurants and bars nearby. We're already looking forward to going back!"
2028,Ok a little disappointing,20,June 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for a couple get away with 5 other couples
I have stayed in many hotels in Bali but won't be back to this one.
Not nearly enough space and pool chairs around the pool. For the first time ever in Bali the pool was freezing cold
Rooms clean and spacious but noisy we stayed on the 5th floor and from 7am onwards could here all the going ons at breakfast on the 3rd floor (singing happy birthday is a lovely touch by the staff but not for people trying to sleep.
Toilet has no privacy - had a glass door to desperate the shower area - why bother when it is a see through glass door??
For the price you pay plenty of other hotels in the area that are better"
2029,Great experience,50,June 2017,"Wow where do we start with fantastic helpful staff in all areas .. in particular Ayau in breakfast area .. so helpful & nothing too much trouble .. She is a delight & represents your hotel well .. The security is so professionally run & very helpful ..Management staff have created a good culture within this property ... We love the pool area ,the health spa is exceptional & the hotel provides an excellent place to stay ..: Thank you üôè"
2030,5 star hotel in prime area of Seminyak,50,May 2017,"The hotel provides excellent and friendly service. The staff are always pleasant helpful and seem to thoroughly enjoy working at the premises. Well maintained hotel that has excellent facilities and a shuttle service to the local beach (where they have a section for hotel guests), eat street and local shopping."
2031,Right in the thick of things,50,January 2017,"This is a standard Courtyard by Marriott property - but with lots of local Balinese touches that make it special. The staff were all very nice and even though the hotel was very busy, the service was always excellent. The hotel is walkable to the beach and everything that Seminyak has to offer, yet feels quite private once you are inside the property. I highly recommend it."
2032,Lovely,40,June 2017,"If there‚Äôs one right decision you can make when you are in Seminyak, Bali, it would be staying at Courtyard Seminyak.

I loved stay at this hotel and we couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Everything was lovely and outstanding‚Äîfrom the three-tier pool with colorful lounges, the pool bar that serves the most refreshing mixes, the all-day popcorn and fairy floss station which everybody loved,Everything was pure perfection! My room had a balcony overlooking the pool and the turn down service at night is just impeccable.

Most importantly, i truly appreciate the warm welcome and quality service that each staff we encountered offered to us. It was such a good feeling seeing their genuine smiles; they truly made us feel at home and in good hands.

Such a relaxing stay! Good job, Courtyard! :)"
2033,Great service,40,June 2017,"Good Points:
-- Couldn't ask for more friendly and helpul staff.
-- Breakfast was amazing the best selections I have seen to date.
-- Cleaning staff are brilliant, they leave the room spotless.
-- Good location

Bad points
-- The pool only gets sunlight until until 3pm in June."
2034,Fantastic hotel,50,April 2017,"We stayed for 7 days at the courtyard Marriott. Location was very central, hotel was beautiful - rooms are modern and very clean, pool lovely and enough room for all patrons and staff very helpful and accomodating. Yeh hotel spa is also fantastic and I would recommend it to all patrons. Buffet breakfast good variety for all tastes. Would certainly stay again! A relaxing stay"
2035,"Good hotel, great staff.",40,May 2017,"Stayed here for 4 nights in May.

The hotel was of a high standard and the rooms were very comfortable with a mini bar, TV, and air-conditioning.

The breakfast had a great selection and the food from the pool bar was very good too.

The pool was nice but was quite sheltered from the sun and the beds all got taken fairly quickly with only beanbags left to relax on.

The staff were so attentive and hard working but I felt a little sorry for them due to some of the very demanding Australian customers we witnessed at beeakfast time.

Overall the hotel was very good, with great staff, and in a good location. (It also had very high security with airport style metal detectors for pedestrians and sniffer dogs checking cars.)

Area:
Take a right out of the hotel and it's a 5-10 minute walk to the beach where you'll find a great selection of chill out bars & restaurants with live entertainment overlooking the surf. (take a left when you get to the beach to find the best chill out bars)

If you want some thing nice to eat closer to the hotel take a right out of the hotel and walk 50-100 metres to Miura Pintxos Bar & Grill where you can have a nice steak or some good local dishes.

The sail sensations catarmaran trip to Nusa Lembongan was a great day out with snorkeling, bbq, and the chance to see some of the local area by sea."
2036,Most amazing hotel ever,50,May 2017,"I took my girlfriend to Bali from the 20th of May until the 30th of May and stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for these 10 days for her birthday! It was both of our first times in the country and the hotel itself made my experience even more unforgettably incredible. After looking at the pictures i didn't know if i had been sold a dream or not, but in retrospect the pictures don't even do the hotel enough justice!

The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and catered to our every needs. To the point i feel as though i am going to miss them :(
The pool and pool bar area was everything you could ask for and more! Pool had comfy beanbags surrounded the top pool and deck chairs around the bottom pool. With happy hour on an evening and events like fire dancing in the garden area!
They hosted a #whatthetruck block party across the street with loads of food stalls and dj's!

Room service was efficient. The room itself was huge, with a balcony and enormous and very comfortable bed to lay and watch tv in on a tired night!

Buffet Breakfast was better than anywhere i've stayed; with a full english section, Indonesian section, ice creams, cakes and pastries, waffles with loads of different sauces, fruits, smoothies, milkshakes!! And an egg man who makes the best poached eggs ever!!!!! -- the staff were always extra helpful at breakfast too (Special thanks to Utami) -- not to mention as a birthday treat for my girlfriend holly they all sung happy birthday and brought out a delicious complimentary birthday cake!

Situated in a very nice area, with free shuttle buses to seminyak square and the private beach club where you can relax on beds in a secluded section on the beach and use their wifi without worrying about being hassled! Would often leave my bag and phone behind the counter at the beach club so could play in the sea without fear of theft!

All in all, my girlfriend and myself had the best experience! I would recommend this truly 5star hotel to anyone!

Thank you once again to all the staff - Mara for you friendly welcoming, Utami for your excellent service everyday at breakfast , And the WhatTheTruck Man for your amazing beef tacos and Mexijitos.

Miss it already! Can't wait to come back!

Best time ever!
Nathan"
2037,"Great rooms, nice facilities, helpful staff, and great breakfast!",50,May 2017,"Staff was extremely nice and was particularly helpful when it came to figuring out places to go in Seminyak, arranging transport to our next location, Ubud, as well as recommending sites to see there. Rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable, pool was great, and the breakfast was amazing, huge spread for all different tastes. Would definitely stay again if I get to return to Bali!"
2038,Wonderful stay,50,May 2017,"We stayed for 3 nights for 2 rooms here and our request while booking was granted - adjacent rooms. Hotel staffs are all accommodating and always smiling. Checking in and out was smooth. In both instances, we were attended by Laura from the reception. All praises for her for being so easy to talk to. Very congenial. Then hotel breakfast is one of the best I've seen. Security is high. The pools are also beautifully designed. Over all I can say that Courtyard Marriott is living up beyond expection."
2039,Either for beach or pool,40,May 2017,"We stayed 4 nights at the Marriott Hotel. Breakfast was very nice unexpectedly. Poolside is nice for having a relaxing time. Staff is also very helpful and kind. The hotel is very close to the seminyak beach,
just 10 minutes walk. Fitness room is also providing nice exercise equipments. Location is also good for this hotel. I may stay at the Marriott hotel if I go back Bali again."
2040,Fabulous Hotel,50,May 2017,"This is our second visit to this great hotel on a Luxury Escapes deal. Just love the atmosphere here...the live music every evening is a real treat. The staff can't do enough to meet any request. The day spa is divine. I would like to make a special mention for Widi , Elta and G'day who are waitstaff and chef....such happy friendly and helpful staff. Also... Anton who is always up for a chat and a laugh. Can't wait to come back. Ian and Val. Australia."
2041,Perfect luxury away,50,May 2017,"We stayed for four nights and it was amazing. The breakfast buffet was huge and everything was so fresh and tasty.
Our room was perfect and everything was very clean. The bed was huge and comfy and the air-conditioning was whisper quiet There was also a nice day bed on our balcony which was a good spot to relax.
The pool was the perfect for those hot days and the swim up bar was cool. As people have mentioned though, the day beds do get taken up pretty quickly.
There was also a useful gym which was great for an early morning workout.
Overall a great experience, a stress free and relaxing getaway."
2042,Amazing stay at the Blissful Courtyard Seminyak,50,May 2017,"We had the most beautiful week at The Courtyard. We booked a 1 bedroom suite which was perfect for a family as it meant you had extra living space. The pool was beautiful and there was plenty of lounges available. We ate breakfast daily which was beautiful as well as pool side and in room dining. All was fresh, delicious and prompt service. The staff are what makes this place outstanding. The always said hello and particularly made our toddler feel extremely comfortable! The location is great with delicious food options and great shopping nearby. The shuttle service provided by the hotel was a wonderful added bonus! Thanks so much and we can't wait to visit again."
2043,Beautiful Hotel,50,May 2017,"We have spent the past week at Courtyard and have had a fabulous experience. The Staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. Today is my birthday and we indulged in an hr Balinese massage at the Zanti retreat this morning and it was just divine. We then returned to our room to find a Birthday cake and a note from the staff which was a special touch. Huge selection at the breakfast buffet, everything you could think of (and then some!). We have tried room service and it was prompt, hot, generous & delicious. The security is high with an X-ray bag scanner as you come in and security checks on all cars coming in including sniffer dogs. You feel extremely safe in this resort. 5 min walk from seminyak beach, there is also a private beach club with an attendant & wifi. Buggy runs from the hotel to the beach club or to eat street. We can highly recommend this hotel, thanks for having us!"
2044,Great resort for your Bali vacation,50,May 2017,"Recently stayed at this resort for three nights, and had a fantastic experience. The staff is super helpful, courteous, and go out of their way to make your stay memorable and comfortable. Seminiyak kitchen also has great breakfast options to get your day started, and they also have a good number of options for lunch/dinner. They also have childcare center, which our three year old enjoyed thoroughly. The pool activities (yoga in the pool, etc) are well planned, and creates a community feel while you're out on a vacation, where you can interact and enjoy with other guests if you choose. Definitely recommend this resort for your Bali visit."
2045,Best Bali holiday,50,May 2017,"The staff at courtyard were fantastic! They made sure we were well accommodated and looked after. Breaky was delicious and the bar staff remembered our orders. Anton, Penny and Hendra were the best staff members to name a few. Very good at English and very helpful with information. We had a great trip and will be coming back to stay! Thank you so much. Great location, very close to everything. They also have a golf cart that will take you places rather than taxi! Was great service! Rooms were nice and neat. Thank you guys!! Xxx :)"
2046,"Caring staff, lovely room!",50,May 2017,"This is probably my 5th visit, I've lost count! And the standard just gets better each time! It feels great to stay at a place where you know you have your needs taken care of!

Fell sick at the start of my trip, so I was quite miserable. Thank goodness for a fantastic team (Priscilla & Grant) who sent some ginger tea to my room twice during my stay! I can guarantee that the bed is comfortable, considering I spent pretty much the whole time in bed for the first two days (and didn't get any backaches or neckaches!)

I managed to order in delivery once, as I was craving miso soup --and the reception very kindly arranged 2 security guards to escort the delivery girl up to my room, cos I was too sick to pick it up from reception. Thank you for making a special exception for me and for being accommodating! (Hope I didn't get anyone into trouble!).

Credits go out to housekeeping (Sujana & Dicky) for spending some time folding me two huge towel bears to cheer me up when I finally got out of the room and for cleaning up the room, and refilling the tea bags, water etc.

Managed to recover sufficiently to attend the What the Truck Bali Block Party .. these guys sure know how to throw a fantastic party! There was still security in place and many caravans worth of food and booze, including a booth selling motorbikes. lol.

Thank you John & Grant for your hospitality. It was great seeing you guys again. The bintangs were lovely :) It's been way too short of a trip for me. I look forward to returning again , hopefully all well and dandy! I'd be back !!"
2047,"Not your typical Courtyard, it's a Resort!",50,April 2017,"If you have experienced a Marriott Courtyard in Canada/U.S.A., take good note that this one is different. It's more a Resort than a cheap North American hotel. We stayed 1 week as a couple (full disclosure, we are both Marriott Rewards gold members).

The service is outstanding and their employees have only one mission: to make all their guests happy! They even have a dedicated ""Employee Relations"" person to make sure that you have a good time! There are lots of activities, a happy hour special, and free popcorn!. What makes this place exceptional is that it is safe, clean, welcoming, and affordable. Kids seem to love this place! The hotel has a nice private section on the beach too (free golf cart shuttle), with towel service and water (sometimes, free popsicles!). The Courtyard's restaurant is amazing in terms of quality, menu originality, and presentation. Try their Bloody Mary burger if you are super hungry - it's big and delicious!! For a Courtyard, the very complete buffet breakfast is way above and beyond what the hotel chain normally offers (Asian & American food). As LGBT travellers, we received the warmest welcome ever, so there is no reason to by shy here at all. Located on ""Rainbow road"", the hotel is a few steps to the only gay area in Bali. In other words, come as you are. Everyone is welcomed here. This hotel is also excellent as a base for touring Bali because of its location.

The employees were so nice to us, that it was very sad to check-out and leave them!

Marriott Rewards gold members are invited once a week to the manager's reception, which was a lot of fun, with free drinks and canap√©s, and a small band. To our surprise, we also got upgraded to a suite at check-in, which made our week long stay very confortable and enjoyable. The room was really spacious and beautiful. Thank you!"
2048,"LOVE this hotel, great access to beach and nightlife",50,May 2017,"""This is a Courtyard?! Wow!"" That was my reaction when my brother and I checked in for a three night stay. It was our first time in Seminyak, and it couldn't have gone better. For starters, this is not your standard Courtyard like you find in the US. This is more like an urban resort, with a big, lovely pool, a very social poolside bar, a great kids club, incredible breakfast buffet, and super clean and sparkly rooms. I'm not sure how old the hotel is, but it sure seems new and well maintained. The staff is well trained and very friendly, and most of them have very good English. Staying at the hotel was fun and easy, and it was tempting to stick around...except Seminyak is awesomely fun and must be explored. The Courtyard's is perfectly located to do so. It's a quick 7-8 minute walk to the beach, which is great, especially at sunset with the restaurants all have live music and beach seating with drink service. Such a great vibe. Tons of fantastic bars and restaurants in easy walking distance or a short taxi ride (or moped ride if you're a bit more daring). If you get one of the hotel vans to drive you anywhere it will be 50-100K Indonesian, so I recommend getting a taxi or Uber instead. Uber is the cheapest plus you don't have to worry about haggling (always a paid). So glad we stayed at this great Courtyard! Can't wait to come back!"
2049,Great Hotel if you Get the Right Room,40,May 2017,"Stayed for 6 nights in a Deluxe Room at pool level. The room was modern, clean and had a good sized bathroom with excellent lighting. The included breakfast was great with lots of choice. Service at the poolside and in the restaurant was fast and efficient. Location is fantastic being close to the beach and with shops, money changers, restaurants and a good laundry service nearby. The rooms facing into the courtyard are good. The pools are fantastic. We had a day room that faced out on the road on our last day and it was very noisy from traffic even though on the 3rd floor. The taco stand out the front is great for a snack."
2050,Excellent Hotel with Exceptional Service,50,May 2017,"I have made a booking from another online platform to stay in this hotel for 2 nights for the last leg of my bali trip.

On arrival at around 12noon, were impressed with their very tight security checks.

The hotel lobby was ok, facing the pool and immediately we were greeted by the hotel guests using the pool, in a positive way, you feel alive once you step into the hotel. Theree were very much of positive vibes about the place. Probably is due to the music they played.

We were informed that check in time is 3pm, and we can either hang around the pool till our room is ready at the same time we were given a choice of welcome drinks. We were surprised to hear that beer was offered as a welcome drinks! We defintely went for the kill and ask for beers!

Check In was smooth and fast, however, due to the building setup, I was kind of lost of where to go to my room, but was happy that it is near the lobby and to the restaurant for breakfast.

However, I was given a room that is facing the street. I remembered i booked for the room that was supposedly to be facing the pool. Somehow it didn't reflect it in my booking nor was it on their system. Anyway, I just accepted it since i am just going to be there for 2nights.

The room was big and comfy with a huge 42in tv and have very good reception and clear pictures. Bathroom was of modern design and good finishes were used. I would say it is worth every penny that you spend with them.

Breakfast were of high quality and variety, servers at the entrance were attentive to our needs, however, the servers on the floor were somehow lacking. For e.g. i have asked for Americano as my coffee, they brought expresso, not once but twice. Cleared my plate even before I was done with it. Good thing though for their breakfast, the chef was extremely fast with his cooking, that results in very small and short queue is formed. And the eggs standard is still good despite he get ti done in such speed.

They have 2 pools, one pool comes with a pool bar, both you can swim your laps in the morning before the crowds starts to form. They have lounges and many bean bags that you can use while you are at the pool.

If you like it to be bear the lobby and the restaurant, then ask for the *87, *88, and *89. The only thing is that is somewhat faces the road, especially the *87 rooms. * is the floor level. The building is a 4level building but their floor in the lifts are L,3,5,6 and 4. Yes the ""4"" floor is on the top. I didnt explore if it is an actual floor as I noticed i was already at the top floor. Didnt expect them to be that superstitious.

Comparing to their sister property in Nusa Dua, I preferred this Seminyak resort more than the one in Nusa Dua."
2051,"wonderful hotel, beautiful staff",50,May 2017,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 8 nights. We were met at the airport and easily found our driver before being transferred to the hotel where we were greeted with cool towels and refreshing bintangs. We went through the security process which was bags through an xray machine and walking through a scanner. I noticed some people have complained about this in previous reviews but it seriously only takes 10 seconds each time you enter the hotel.

Check in was fast and easy before being shown to our room. The room was lovely, clean and spacious overlooking the pool. The bathroom was large and the shower had normal and rainfall heads. All the normal toiletries were provided and there was a set of scales to weigh your bags before leaving if you go crazy in the shops.
The bed was super comfortable with a thick pillowtop on the mattress. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Wifi in the room was fast and efficient (as it was all through the hotel) We found the room very quiet and were not disturbed by any noise.

Breakfast was the best buffet I have ever come across in a hotel! There is a vast selection of hot and cold, Western and Asian, healthy and indulgent foods to choose from. The barista made coffee was also a bonus.

The pool, gym and all areas of the hotel were meticulously maintained. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and a credit to the hotel.

The tacos in What The Truck were amazing. They are more than a snack and could easily be a lunch or a dinner with 2 tacos in each serve. The truck is available from 8am to 10pm so available pretty much all day. We had trouble using all our vouchers so they can also be used for speciality coffees, which are great to take away if you have an early morning tour.

The beach is a 5 minute walk away or you can get the buggy. The hotel is located on a street with lots of minimarts, restaurants, bars and market stalls. We walked along the beach to Kuta Discovery Mall which took just under an hour.

We loved this hotel and would stay again and recommend to others without hesitation.

The only slight negative would be - it would be nice if the pool with the swim up bar could be just for adults. There are another two pools for children to use. We came home a couple of evenings after long days out and wanted nothing more than a nice cocktail sitting at the swim up bar but the seats were taken by young children whose parents were drinking at the bar. Another day we sat on the bean bags around the pool enjoying a drink before dinner and there were kids screaming and dive bombing in the pool and saturating us and others sitting around. I think it would be nice just to have this area for adults to enjoy.

But apart from this we absolutely loved our stay and would like to sincerely thank all the staff for their kind hospitability during our time there. Hope to see you again"
2052,"Amazing location, great for kids, still dreaming about the breakfast buffet",50,January 2017,"We stayed here for 6 nights in January with our 2-year-old daughter. Loved it. My husband is still dreaming about the breakfast buffet :)

This hotel is a good choice with kids: it has a stunning pool area, quite a large grass area where you can play around and also a kids club with nice activities every day. We also tried nanny service one evening, everything went well and the service was reasonably priced.

Location is amazing: You can walk to the beach, supermarket is just across the street, lots of restaurants nearby. And they also offer a shuttle service free of charge.

Our room was as expected in a hotel like this: very clean, spacious, big balcony and nice view to the pool area.

The gym is alright, though it is quite small and hence was rather busy especially in the morning. I also tried yoga which they offer a few times a week. It was okay but nothing special (try Yoga 108 instead, it is amazing, their studio is within a walking distance).

Breakfast buffet was pure bliss. Lots of fresh fruits and juices and smoothies, a bagel station, lots of local dishes.... And you should definitely try their eggs benedict :) Everything worked well even during the busiest hours.

The staff is super helpful and friendly and they offer lots of attention to kids.

We would love to stay here again."
2053,High quality accommodation in the heart of Seminyak,50,April 2017,"Comfortable, large deluxe rooms with fantastic bed and facilities, set in the heart of Seminyak, a short walk from the beach and near to great restaurants and bars. The service is good from start to finish and the hotel really tries to impress guests with one of the best breakfasts in Bali. Fresh fruit juices, western and asian dishes, and my favourite selecitions of bacon, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms (yes it's an English breakfast) in the whole of Indonesia. You'll have a great time based here for your Bali holiday."
2054,Deceived and some issues,30,May 2017,"I had booked to stay here based on the location, pool view room and breakfast with it being close to the beach.

On arrival we were warmly greeted after a long flight which was nice and on speaking with the check in guy (I won't mention name) he welcomed us and advised us happy anniversary as I booked to stay here for this.

As we were being processed I asked him for a nice room if possible (had also requested this months in advance) and a high room so we are not too close where people can be looking in from the pool bar etc. We were given room 324 which was not a pool view room what I had paid extra for and instead had a big palm tree right in front of the balcony, you could see the pool if you looked through the tree towards the end of the balcony but obviously if you have paid extra for a pool view room then that's what you should be given.

Credit where credit is due the room was made up nice and a nice welcome message but I went straight back to reception to advise this wasn't the room I had booked. Immediately understanding my concern and agreeing that it wasn't the best view at all and definitely not a high room I asked for 3 times (324 is basically the first floor by reception) he offered to change as soon as possible but after a long flight we were so tired we just couldn't be bothered so I just advised we were disappointed as I am a Marriott member and have stayed in loads but this was the first time I felt deceived by the chain.

I didn't take photos of the view as there wasn't one, also it made it difficult to dry our clothes as there was no sun coming through due to the tree and being so close to reception. You can also hear people constantly stomping above you in other rooms and it seems as though when people shower above you that the water take ages to trickle down the system so at 2am it sounds like you have left the shower on.

Our toilet in the room for the first two days as well stunk of urine, it was horrible. We just sprayed the first two days and luckily on the 3rd day it had gone. We didn't complain as we out it down to the pipes but would you expect this on arrival at a 5 star chain??

Also Management please remove the lamp in the room as its full of mold! Not nice by the bed when you have the lamp on and it's full of mold.

We also missed out on a food night as we didn't check the flyer in the room that same day. Again reception are missing a trick to upswell their food nights, example on checking in it would have been nice to have been advised of the food nights there and then to give us an idea and that way the hotel make more sales. We only found out by walking past and when asking we were told its once a week. Now maybe I should read the flyer in my room near the balcony but again why not mention and be shown the flyer at check in?? That way people are aware straight away and not likely to miss that particular day once a week.

Also the beach club has a shower that you can wash sand off etc but then you have to walk back to your sunbed thus getting covered in sand again - may begetter to have a little hand brush by each bed or a small bucket with water?

I echo another review the layout of the pool is terrible you have to go in the water in order to have a bed/bag around the pool so we didn't bother.

I didn't hear from management during my stay but reception did give me a credit for some good and drinks in all fairness which we used and on check out there was no record of this so I had to prove I had a credit so it could be taken off the bill - come on Marriott really is there communication between yourselves? Reception had no clue whatsoever - just make a note on the system!

Breakfast was good with good variety and staff were friendly but not a 5 star and a disappointing stay at the Marriott so don't think we will come back and disappointing from the chain itself"
2055,Perfect Location- great Service,50,May 2017,"This hotel has not only one of the best locations - near bar, restaurants, a shuttle to the beach, a special private section of the beach, etc etc etc. its people are also one of the most cordial and welcoming in Bali. A special Thank you to Priscila for making such a great impression with your service- Even the manager is a real person with a personality- taking care of customers and making sure everything is running smoothly. I had the chance to talk to him- Mr. Woolley leads by example and it shows. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great service and perfect location. Also, do not leave without trying their breakfast buffet- worth the money- so many choices, including a fresh juice (raw bar) made upon request, nutritious options to choose from. Well done guys !!! Thank you very much for making my stay in Seminyak, so special!!"
2056,Nice hotel with a few problems,30,May 2017,"Great hospitality, the staff were very welcoming and accomodating. Breakfast is unique as it has a bagel station complete with cream cheese and smoked salmon, freshly squeezed fruit juices made to order and they refrigerate local salads and fruits...talk about attention to detail ;)

I booked the room through booking.com and turns out they ran out of room with views so I was given room 250 which the staff recommended as a ""quiter room"" Yes it was until 3-5pm on the weekend when all the kids in the pool were screaming and having fun lol...turns out this room is near the kids swimming pool with view of wall of the next building.

Problems: The seat on the balcony was dirty, the toilet not clean enough, and no water heater to make tea in my room plus it was very far from the lobby. I couldn't turn on the rain shower either. Fuzzy picture on the TV.

Nice swimming pool and pool bar although the sun beds were placed closed together.

I ordered room service and the burger patty tasted like salt bricks although the mocktail was good.

The room has wifi however I my mobile phone coulnd't connect to the wifi and the staff could not help to trouble shoot the problem unlike other hotel's staff who alsways fix this problem for me as I was using Google as my web browser (higher security in logging in hotels or public spaces).

The staff was nice enough to offer me a free airport transfer after I complained about my room problems."
2057,Home away from home,50,May 2017,"Our second stay at The Courtyard within 6mths. Booked for 5 nights and ended up staying 10. This place is fantastic. The accommodation is awesome, clean, modern and very comfy beds. The facilities are superior .. no need to even leave the hotel if all you want to do is relax as everything is at your finger tips. The food options are endless... from the breakfast buffet -to the restaurant -to the ever popular food truck .. it's all top quality!! Love the taco and mojito combo!! The best bit about this hotel is the staff!! They are amazing, happy to help whenever they can to make this place feel like we are part of their family. The location is central. 5 minute walk to the beach, 10 min walk to eat st and located on a main rd full of shops, restaurants and markets (but zero street noise). Perfect for couples, singles and families. We will see you all again in February. Oh - and for coffee lovers, they have the best!!"
2058,Lovely Staff/ Great Food,40,May 2017,The staff was the best about the place. They were so friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was excellent as well. We are happy we chose to do include the breakfast buffet in our booking. The rooms were a bit outdated. Some of the walls were cracked but overall I will stay here again.
2059,Good but some issues.,40,May 2017,"We recently stayed at this resort and found the hotel very nice but there were some issues, the courtyard design and swimming pool does seem a little crowded with all the sun beds very close together and cramped totally impossible if you want a little privacy or space, and they do have the beach club but again very small area and the beach is not very nice and mostly dirty with litter and rubbish just dumped, I find it incredible that they do not have people clean the beach to keep it nice for tourists as it would be in there interest to do so,the guys at the beach club do a fantastic job looking after you and are very friendly and helpful with clean fresh towels, water, and the ice cream to keep you cool and also the shuttle guys who take you there and pick you up they all do a fantastic job, the hotel rooms are very nice, new and fresh and very comfortable beds with a great house keeping team that do a fantastic job.
The breakfast is one of the best we have had in asia and its a huge spread that caters for everyone, western and Asian food, a healthy station and juicer station, egg station, cakes/pastries, bagel station, Chinese noodle station that is changed daily, cerials/ yogurts fresh fruits and great coffee and never a queue for anything so that is due to the very many hardworking chefs, and the managers that are always around to make sure things run very smooth, they even help to clear plates at busy times something I have never witnessed before on my travels in asia.
The hotel is close to many outside restaurants, massage and shops and a short shuttle ride to Eat Street is available, so all in all this is a good hotel with great staff, some very good points and some minor issues."
2060,Short stay,50,May 2017,"First person to thank is Chinta, our amazing waitress for the two night we stayed. What wonderful and attentive service for the lovely lady. The resort is beautiful and everything you could expect from Bali blissful breaks."
2061,Good service,40,May 2017,When I got to bali and went into the courtyard I felt as if I was in a circus. The noise level was through the roof. You could hear it two hotels away. Eventually I spoke to a manager and he adjusted the TV and even the music from the singer became manageable. The first room had slight moldy smell but eventually they upgraded me to a room with wonderful comfortable bed. I didn't like seminyak but if that's where you want to be in the end it was a good choice.
2062,Helpful staff,40,April 2017,"The resort doesnt not have a beach on the site, we need to get a shuttle to go to their private beach.

The breakfast buffet is not that variable compare to other hotel of the same level. The room was not soundproof. I could hear people talking next to my room. But other than that the room were nice and clean.

The staffs were very helpful and nice. The pool was great and it's cover with trees so not very hot."
2063,Amazing Outdoor Pool,50,March 2017,"After spending a few nights in at B&B in Legian, I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Bali Resort. I felt very secured from the very moment my taxi drove towards the entrance. The taxi was searched, and I went through a security screening (just like at the airport) before any formalities at reception. Checking in was smooth, and my bags were quickly taken up to my room by one of the porters.

My room had a lovely view, overlooking the busy main street. My room was spacious, the shower cubicle space was generous and the bed was very comfortable. My room had tea and coffee making facilities, which I particularly love as I normally have a hot drink first thing in the morning and when I come back to my room after a long day out. The WIFI connection was excellent and had no problems with it throughout my stay.

Breakfast in the morning was amazing! A never ending choice of food and drink, both hot and cold were available. I particularly enjoyed the waffles.

All in all, my one night stay here was excellent. Just bear in mind, it is a good 15-20mins walk to the beach, and you will go through security everytime you enter the hotel premises."
2064,Treated like royalty,50,May 2017,"Loved every second at this resort. The staff were friendly and greeted us with a cold wipe and refreshing drink. They kindly took our bags and delivered them to our room. The room was beautiful and overlooked the giant pool. Everything was very clean (as I can be funny about cleanliness). The resort is child friendly (if you wanted to take children). There is a swim up bar and many lounges and couches available to lay by the pool. The food was delicious and the drinks were great and decently priced. The pool is to die for. One of the highlights of this resort. I love the location too. It's within walking distance to many lovely restaurants and bars and you can also walk to local shops and stalls. I honestly have no complaints and I would totally stay here again! If you want to feel like a Queen/King, stay here!"
2065,Great Resort,50,April 2017,Spent eight days in this resort while in Bali for my son's wedding. Excellent in all respects. Stayed in a second floor pool view deluxe room. The room was clean and well maintained every day. The breakfast buffet catered for all tastes and was one of the most extensive I have seen. Could not fault it or the service. Eggs cooked to order or variations made on request. Had daily cocktails from the poolside bar and tacos or coffee from the van at the front which were all good. Pool very clean and well maintained. Complimentary shuttle to beach or main Seminyak streets. All the staff were friendly and attentive.Special mention to Elta and the Australian day manager (not sure now of his name) who both took time each day to talk to us and see all was well.
2066,Bali Getaway,50,April 2017,"Myself and 3 friends stayed at the hotel in April. The facilities were awesome, clean and comfortable. The staff were more than happy to help when we wanted to change rooms. The gym is a standout however did become busy during the morning. Water aerobics is a must. Make sure you grab a bean. Ag early as they are in high demand. The best aspect of the hotel is the breakfast! So many options and great quality. The rooms were adequate size and bathrooms were clean. I would recommend a room facing over the pool as the rooms facing on the street are not soundproof and with the hotel being on a busy street there is little relief from the sound of traffic. A short walk to the beach and cheap cab ride to the bars."
2067,"Um, no ,thankyou",30,April 2017,As a regular visitor to Bali I expected more after this hotel was recommended by a friend. The only thing that lived up to expectations was the buffet breakfast that clearly catered for guests from all over the globe. It was plentiful and delicious. Rooms were well appointed and quite comfortable. There was no turn down service of an evening. We were on an upper floor on the other side from the pool courtyard with a view of a vacant lot. It happens and I was thankful because the courtyard was noisy day and night (there was a function on) and the noise and music carried to our room. Cant imagine how that would have been for those in rooms facing the courtyard and for that matter the ones above the restaurant which overlooked the busy street. Most staff were friendly. Hotel takes your credit card details on arrival. They dont however tell you that they not only do a pre authorisation for accommodation they actually add a loading of what you 'might' spend; equivalent to a few hundred dollars. If you dont spend it takes up to a week for that to show up in your account. If your travelling on a budget that could be a problem.
2068,Our bali holiday,50,April 2017,"We spend 8 days in the Mariott hotel in Seminyak & had a wonderful time. The hotel itself is of great standard & the staff are absolutely amazing. We didn't have a kettle in our room & the the bar fridge wasn't working properly. Within 10 minutes we had a kettle & a new...cold...fridge was put in. The general manager spoke with everyone & wasn't shy of picking up something from the table eg: dirty plates. The security staff was always very polite &the poolbar staff always had time for a chat (Ebit the poolbar manager). Our keycard didn't work at one stage due to an empty battery & Ari, from reception, made sure that it was fixed as quick as possible. The entertainment every night in the pool area was fun & at 9pm it was finished, which was good in case one wanted a bit of quiet time after being on the go most of the day. We would certainly go back to the Mariott as we had a very good special. Many thanks to everyone at the hotel. David&Ruth from Perth Australia"
2069,Love!,50,July 2016,"Great service but took a while to check in to my room.

but when we waited they serve us a couple of drinks and the waiting area also super comfy.

the room was great but without a bath tub and quite small.

breakfast was great.

xx"
2070,Paradise in all!,40,October 2016,"What a magnificent hotel! The accommodation, food, staff and ambience in brilliant. The Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak is what everyone wants. Sometimes you may not even want to leave the hotel because you'll feel like everything there is perfect. What a place!"
2071,Hotel with Great Breakfast !,30,May 2017,"Hotel is in a good location with lots of restaurants nearby. All staff speak good English and are friendly. However, I find the housekeeping in my room not quite up to standard. The mirror in the bathroom was not cleaned, I could see water stainmarks. Another thing that annoyed me was when we asked for taxi, we were told to wait outside to flag down the cab. Staff was persuading us to take the taxis from the hotel at a fixed price. They kept saying we might wait for a long time to get a taxi from outside. Their saving grace - breakfast buffet is great with lots of varieties of food & drinks!"
2072,Almost 5 stars,40,April 2017,"This hotel had excellent services, friendly staff and an amazing breakfast. The only disadvantage is that the rooms are very humid at all times, even with the AC this does not get better. Otherwise very modern and clean rooms, and the extra services are great, for example the hotel private beach club and the sightseeing tours organized by the hotel."
2073,Excellent hotel,40,June 2016,"A very nice hotel within a close proximity to the beach and a lot of local restaurants.The rooms are spacious and clean. It felt very modern and airy, and very comfortable to be in. Breakfast is excellent and the staff are very friendly & courteous."
2074,Amazing week amazing service,50,May 2017,My partner and I came to Bali with another couple. We had such a great experience. Our room was perfect the room service was delicious the free shuttle bus is handy but the customer service was the very best part the staff are so lovely the pool bar staff make friends with you and are always ready to have fun. Can't wait to return!
2075,Bali Dream,50,September 2016,"My first stay at this hotel was 15 nights. From the moment i checked in the service was friendly and first class. the rooms are amazing in size and the housekeeping was exceptional. The Seminyak Kitchen breakfast is an adventure with so many choices, overall the food and drink both at breakfast and the pool bar was fantastic. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome a nice touch when they remember your name. I look forward to my next tip in Sep 2017."
2076,Excellent stay but the check in process needs improving.,40,May 2017,"Having paid extra for a pool view room in advance of my stay, I was disappointed to find out upon checking in they did not have me booked into a pool view room. They soon rectified their mistake and LUCKILY they had one room available with a pool view. Unluckily this was on the first floor. I'm a very light sleeper so requested a high up room, however was told none would be available until 6pm. I agreed to wait. 6pm came and went. Finally received a call to say this would now be 8pm. (Not sure how it takes housekeeping 8 hours to clean, but ok.) at this point I refused and put up with where we were. Balcony didn't feel private at all as we were at head level. Clearly some improvements on their check in process are needed if the reviews and experiences below are anything to go by.
Having said this, the rest of the stay was sublime, hence the 4 star review.
Pros:
- great location. 5 min walk to double six beach (recommend checking out la plancha!) bar and restaurant wise - you can get a buggy from the hotel to eat street where you can find a good range of eateries and bars. You will need to get a taxi to the other side of town though where potato head and ku de ta are as they don't drop off there.
- breakfast was phenomenal. SO MUCH selection. You will not be disappointed. Best breakfast buffet ive ever had on holiday.
- pool area is fab. No sunloungers are in the sun all day though so we sat on the beanbags on the top pool by the bar where you get sun all day. Food is good round the pool but expensive. Good mix of music.
- very modern room. Good aircon. Amazing shower. All the amenities - hairdryer, bathrobes, excellent wifi, very comfy bed. Housekeeping team work hard.
All in all a very good hotel with only a few tweaks needed - including a review of the price! This was an expensive choice, given the choice in Seminyak. Was it worth it? I think so."
2077,A Stunning Abode in Seminyak!,50,April 2017,"One of the best decisions we‚Äôve made for our first time in Bali was staying at Courtyard Seminyak! High-quality amenities and facilities coupled with heartwarming hospitality and service from the hotel staff. And yes, they offer true Marriott quality at a valuable price!

We were billeted at the fifth floor where we had a bird‚Äôs eye view of the three-tiered pool. Most (if not all, I think) of the rooms have balcony and offer the same mesmerizing view. Believe me when I say that staying at this hotel made us ditch our Tanah Lot tour just to be able to spend more time lounging at the pool and the pool bar. Yes, it‚Äôs that good!

What we liked best:
- Our pool-view room with our own balcony
- Fluffy bed and pillows‚Äîhigh-quality all the way!
- The turn-down service every night
- The three-tiered pool and the colorful lounges. There‚Äôs room for everyone! It does not feel crowded at all. You‚Äôre bound to find our own spot.
- Their own colorful mini-Balinese lounge and mini-garden. It just pops! I had countless of photos here.
- The pool bar! Refreshing mixes and hip music!
- All-day popcorn and fairy floss station right beside the pool‚Äîhow can that be topped?!
- Healthy choices and a whole lot more at the extensive breakfast buffet
- Buggy service going to the beach. But with the hotel‚Äôs strategic location, the beach is just a 5-minute walk from the property.
- The best filet mignon in Bali! If you‚Äôre staying at Courtyard, be sure to have at least one meal at Seminyak Meat Shop.
- The unique food concept that is ‚ÄòWhat the Truck‚Äô! It‚Äôs a taco truck located at the pedestrian walk of the hotel lobby. Grab a yummy taco here and don‚Äôt forget to order the mojito!
- Their corporate social responsibility initiative. At the reception lobby, guests can opt to buy cute plush bears. Proceeds go to Yayasan Solemen Indonesia (Solemen), an Indonesian registered non-profit foundation, which raises awareness and provides funds to support accredited agencies and projects for the disadvantaged in Bali.
- The high-quality service and heartwarming hospitality of the hotel crew‚Äîeveryone is smiling and in good spirits. They all went above and beyond to give us an unforgettable service and stay.

What can be improved:
- During our stay, the Seminyak Meat Shop was closed for maintenance. While we were able to enjoy their fine steak and wine, we didn‚Äôt get to dine inside their actual space. We had a table at the Seminyak Kitchen

- It was raining hard during our stay and the drizzle reached our floor‚Äôs hallway. It was slippery and wet but the housekeeping was always quick to mop the floor and ensure the safety of the guests. Safety signage was also in place. Just be extra careful when it rains.

Overall, the rain did not dampen our stay. We loved every minute we were in Courtyard.

There were a lot of picture-perfect spots and most of all, the service will make you want to come back. One day, I will. Until then, thank you, Courtyard Seminyak!!!"
2078,Casual family oriented hotel that is close to the beach,30,May 2017,"Our check in experience as marred by the fact that we were unable to checkin at 4pm (official checking is 3pm) and were advised the room wouldn't be ready for another 15mins. My husband had to complain before we were offered drinks at the bar whilst waiting which is disappointing for an international establishment. We then actually ended up waiting till 5pm.

Checkin aside, this hotel was a bit loud (pool music) and busy to be a relaxing 'resort' getaway."
2079,Excellent choice,50,May 2017,"I was travelling alone in Bali and decided to spend few days in Seminyak. Best choice in Seminyak, with great location. 5 mins walk from the beach. Nice pool bar. Excellent breakfast. Very friendly staff Overall, I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel!"
2080,Best choice in Seminyak,50,May 2017,The best hotel choice in Seminyak. Location is walking distance to restaurants and entertaiments. Mr. Anton restaurant manager is very friendly and always addrress to my needs. Tips their beach club is only 5 minutes from hotel by their buggy available in lobby. Breakfasf is excellent and the staff are very friendly. I met their sales team Ms. Amy Ms. Debby and Mr. Ingan - I would say they always understand what I need as customer in their hotel. I highly reccomend this hotel for holiday or for short business trip.
2081,Excellent hotel,50,April 2017,"Stayed here for a week with my girlfriend at the end of April 2017. On arrival, the check-in staff were great, gave us wet towels and a cold beer to greet us. Once checked in, we went up to our room and were delighted with it.

The room was large, spacious and clean. It felt very modern and airy, and very comfortable to be in. We had a pool facing balcony as well which was ideal to sit in and have a few beers and listen to the music coming from the pool bar in the evening.

Breakfast was included in our room rate and the breakfast itself was good, with a wide selection of food - both Western and Asian - and lots of fresh fruit juice etc.

The pool was large enough, although if you're down late you may struggle to get a sunbed. Half of the sun loungers are in the shade all day (although that may only be during that time of year). The pool bar was good and we got beers and ood there a couple of times.

The location of the hotel is also great. It's only a short walk to the beach and there are plenty of bars and restaurants on the street and within a short walk/taxi ride distance.

Overall, would highly recommend."
2082,Fantastic start to finish,50,May 2017,"We stayed for three nights and wish we had booked the remainder of our trip to stay here.

Check in was quick and efficient and we got an upgrade to a suite because of my husband's loyalty status.

The room was large and clean with a separate lounge to bedroom. The balcony overlooked the pool so you do pick up noise from there but it wasn't a big disturbance.

We had a slight issue with the towels smelling a bit funny but this was quickly rectified with fresh towels.

Breakfast was fabulous, everything you could want including ice cream. Try going before 9am as it can get very busy. We also tried dinner in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

Pool area is large and very well maintained. I didn't use the gym but our friends did and they said it was good.

Location is good, 2 minutes to the beach, recommend seeing a sunset. Walking distance to restaurants and markets. The hotel provides a free shuttle drop off to popular locations including eat street.

Check out we accidentally left a bag behind and the hotel arranged for it to be delivered to us immediately to our new location in Bali - very much appreciated!"
2083,Room not available and made me pay to upgrade!,30,May 2017,"I recently booked a deluxe double or twin room online and made special requests for a king bed and baby cot. When we got there at check-in I was informed that there were no more rooms left with a king bed and only a room with 2x single beds. When questioned I was told that the king bed rooms were already allocated to other people as I didn't put in a special request, however they could upgrade me to another suite room for around $90 per night (or AUD $250 including taxes). When I checked through my emails and showed them I did indeed request the king bed and explained that the single beds would not be acceptable for us as my toddler shares the bed with my husband and I, whilst the person at reception forward the email as proof to her manager, they would still not upgrade us for free or budge on price!!! At this point my toddler and baby were tired and hungry from travelling and about to loose it completely so it was pretty stressful, if this had not been the case I would have simply cancelled the accomodation and gone elsewhere which I indeed threatened to do, and still they would not budge on the extra payment despite it being their mistake. I had actually booked 2x nights as we had a midnight flight the next day, so we were actually only going to stay the single night but needed the extra late checkout. So in the end what happened is that I cancelled the 2nd nights accomodation and instead paid 1/2 rate for the extra late checkout (when booking I wasn't aware this was an option). So basically I paid the extra fees to upgrade to the suite room, but instead of paying for 2 nights I paid for 1.5 nights to give me the late checkout, so it ended up being close to the price I had originally booked and paid for the 2 nights in the original room. My husband even questioned whether they could give us restaurant meal/ breakfast included to compensate us for the mistake and they refused. Overall not happy at all with this experience, and I am sure in Australia if a hotel made a mistake with your booking and the room you booked was not available, they would upgrade you to a suitable room for free, not hold you at ransom demanding $250 extra!
Aside from our horrific check-in experience, the hotel staff were otherwise very friendly and helpful, the facilities very good and if rating the hotel alone I would actually rate it highly. The suite room we ended up staying in on the ground floor was amazing and had direct pool access which was so convenient. It meant the baby could be sleeping in her cot inside the room with the door open whilst I reclined on a sun lounge by the pool some 5m away. The food at breakfast was great and the pool was amazing. The room service food and drinks were very expensive but not unexpected in a hotel for its size.
If not for the check-in experience we would have had a very enjoyable stay there. The average rating I have given is simply due to the check-in experience, and honestly it left such a bad taste in my mouth I wouldn't stay there again. There are plenty of other similarly nice hotels in Seminyak and next time for piece of mind I will be staying somewhere else. I would recommend to other travellers to triple confirm your room requests before arriving if staying there to avoid being held to ransom like we were."
2084,Fabulous!!,50,April 2017,"Myself and my boyfriend had a wonderful time here! Our room was lovely, very comfy large bed, great tv, large modern bathroom and great balcony overlooking the pool! The pool was also great with one section being more for kids and the other half more quiet with a swim up bar. Staff were exceptional and super friendly our entire stay. Breakfast was delicious and had a very large choice of food and drinks. They also offer a free golf buggy service to the shops&bars, the beach and good shopping areas. I could go on and on!! Would defiantly recommend!"
2085,Fantastic! Will definitely go back,50,April 2017,"My partner and I stayed here in April/May 2017. We went with friends who stayed for a shorter time. The 8 days we spent here was a great/fantastic/loved every minute experience. Staff were amazing and friendly, service 100%. The room we upgraded to a pool view was modern clean- we could not fault it. The bed was perfect. Pool perfect, breakfast perfect. Club Sandwich- perfect. Will be going back next year, and taking our teenagers. We are now officially addicted to Bali, Seminyak and the Courtyard by Marriott. Please put this on your list of stays."
2086,Excellent Choice for Seminyak,50,April 2017,"We recently stayed for 5 nights and I have to say I was quite impressed. You expect nothing less coming from the Marriott brand. Service was of a very high level - warm, courteous and very attentive. When we arrived way early for check-in, Grant the day manager went out of his way to chat with us and made arrangement for early check-in. Even treated us to coffee on the house, nice guy.

Rooms were quite spacious although we didn't exactly get the best view. Great A/C served as a welcome respite from the scorching Bali weather.

Food at Seminyak Kitchen was of a very good quality, with variable buffet options at night as well. The Nasi Goreng we ordered for lunch was the best I had during our entire stay, bar none.

Also props to Sila at the check-in counter for ensuring check-in/check-out proceedings went smoothly.

Location was, its a very quick cab ride to the Eat Street/Seminyak Village areas save for rush hour traffic. You can also walk to Seminyak beach from the location.

Overall, I thought we got phenomenal value for what we paid for and would definitely stay again."
2087,Can't believe this is a Courtyard Marriott,50,May 2017,"This hotel/resort blew me away at every opportunity, and I look forward to my next visit.

Located in the heart of Seminyak, the Courtyard is a massive property that features several places to dine, coffee shops, a fantastic spa, huge pool and spacious, modern rooms. If you're an LGBT traveler you'll appreciate that the ""strip"" is only about 100m away from the hotel's front door.

Service is excellent, and at no time during my stay was I ever wanting for anything, Even though I used mobile check-in, the front desk staff still took the time to personally walk me all the way to my room to ensure I understood how everything worked, where to find the hotel amenities, and so on.

Breakfast was also excellent with a fairly massive spread. It can get a little busy and the room isn't really that big, so unless you go early you might have a bit of a wait during prime time.

This is definitely a stand-out in Bali, where many of the other hotels and resorts can feel a little dated. I felt like I was in a brand new property in Honolulu and I'll definitely be back again."
2088,Excellent hospitality,50,May 2017,"Excellent hotel, fast check-in and check-out. after an initial hiccup at the restaurant, the staff made sure our holiday was very enjoyable. Very friendly staff, would like to specially thank Mr Adi Wibawa and Mr Juliantawan for their excellent customer care and hospitality.

Rooms are very comfortable however don;t book rooms facing the main road. Very noisy so had to change the room second day facing the pool. Great pool and facilities. Food even though bit pricey compared to others very tasty and good quality.

Good location too."
2089,Mesmerizing Place & Hotel,50,May 2017,"What a place to chill, relax and enjoy ! Think we are really lucky in choosing the very best property in the heart of Seminyak and close to the beach ! The staffs are very friendly and always smiling attending to the guest needs and request, the hospitality extended to us is marvellous ! The team headed by Mr. John Wooley @ hotel is very cordial and were at our service whenever we made some request !!....We recommend this property whole heartedly to other travellers visiting Bali, because we are confident that you will like this place, service, hospitality and the cheer ambience !!"
2090,Fantastic Hotel,50,March 2017,"We had the best stay at this hotel. Breakfast every morning was delicious, huge variety on offer. We stayed on a luxury escapes deal so had daily cocktails and tacos included too.
The room was modern and clean. Great location and easy to get to all the great restaurants/bars/stores of Seminyak. Will definitely return."
2091,"Very good, with a caveat...",40,May 2017,"This is a very good hotel: the location in Seminyak is great, less than 5 minutes walk from the beach, less than 5 minutes walk from the bar area. It has a nice swimming pool. The rooms are good, bed is fine, bathroom is spacious. Finally, the breakfast buffet is good, great selection of fresh juices, all types of foods made to order, good coffee...
My only problem with this hotel was this: I was expecting for a relaxing weekend in the middle of a business trip to Asia. I chose one of the rooms that are at pool level, as I thought it would be great to be able to just step out of the room and get in the pool. However, I didn't think that everyday at 8:30am there would be kids screaming in the pool right next to my bedroom. I believe all the rooms face the pool, so I wouldn't really recommend this hotel if your plan is to rest and have a quiet time in Seminyak."
2092,Mrs,50,May 2017,"1st time in Bali. Although we have travelled to many parts of the world and stayed at many of our favourite hotels. My husband and I are very impressed with the Marriott Courtyard hotel here in Seminyak.
We were made very welcome from day one, and when my daughter and partner arrived to join us, sadly we had a bit problems with their room as it was not ready and had to wait about 5 hours and the room they got later was not what TripAdvisor showed when they booked, but anyway, the receptionist at the check in desk upgrade her to room next to us with the pool view. Excellent..!! Impressed..!!
We are very happy indeed being look after on our very 1st visit here.

Breakfast spread are plentiful to choose from everyday. The chefs put a good spread of varieties of different food. The health bar fresh juice is awesome!!,love it.
The staff are very courteous, friendly, efficient, service with a smile always. What more can we asked, when they make you feel at home. We feel very welcome and comfortable from day one.
We are coming back here for sure. It will be our second home away from home."
2093,Loved it!,50,May 2017,"We visited for 9 nights with our 2 children. We absolutely loved this place, the staff went out of their way to ensure we had a fantastic time. The breakfast was a highlight, amazing selection of food, a special mention to Elta, who everyday took our girls to help them select what they wanted so we could relax, she was outstanding! We loved the pool area to sit by.. the kids club was just enough for our girls. I recommend this hotel for families or couples, it cannot be faulted!"
2094,Good Hotel,40,May 2017,"This is my first time at the Courtyard and I would happily stay here again. The hotel has all the amenities that you could wish for and the staff are excellent, staff new my name, remembered the drinks I liked and went out of their way to ensure I was treated like the only person at the hotel. The hotel is located a short walk to the beach and in ten minutes by taxi you can be in the centre of the restaurant district. The hotel caters to a wide variety of guest. You wont feel out of place here."
2095,Wonderful hotel & Wonderful staff,50,March 2017,"We spent a week at this hotel and it was absolutely wonderful. It had it all - great location, new and pristine services and rooms, spacious bathrooms and a breathtaking pool. What made the experience even more special was how extremely kind and friendly the staff were - especially Elta Amelia. Elta made us feel so welcome during our stay and was a delightful host. She also shared with us great tips for places we should visit, shop, and eat/drink - she was just wonderful. Thank you for everything Elta.

I couldn't fault the place, and will only be staying at this hotel in future when I visit Bali."
2096,"Excellent service , best location and reasonable price",50,April 2017,"My 5 day stay in this hotel was very pleasant . this hotel staff are very friendly and efficient.
Location is just 5 minutes walk to theseminyak beach with great sunset view from the hotel beach club.
Breakfast has full range of local as well as international choices( better choice than many other hotels in bali)
The food truck at the entrance of the hotel sells good tacos.

F and Bev price is reasonable

Close to restaurants entertainment and shoppings"
2097,Amazing Services as always,50,May 2017,"The staff at courtyard were amazing, we went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and the staff surprised her with birthday cake during breakfast service. We really like to thank John, Anton and the rest of the team, we surely will come back again! Much appreciate the warm welcome!"
2098,"Amazing, I highly recommend!",50,April 2017,"I was blown away by this hotel. All aspects were fantastic - the room, the breakfast, the dinner, the pool, the pool bar, the service, the view, the location, the hotel drivers (paid extra for this but well worth it!), the housekeeping staff, everything was fantastic.
The Indonesian food at breakfast was delicious! They do have western style breakfast as well if you'd prefer but I would highly recommend eating the Indonesian breakfast.
We prearranged hotel drivers to pick us up and drop us off at the airport. It does cost a little more than the standard taxi however they drove very well and I felt safe with them . The car was clean, well kept and road worthy. We hired the hotel drivers for day trips out and at other times as we appreciated their service and how they drove.
The pool in the hotel is fantastic and is broken up into 3 sections so it is quite big and has a relaxing atmosphere. We ordered some cocktails at the pool bar and service was great.
Our room was spacious and had a large bathroom. It was always clean and air con worked well.
We saw staff in the early morning spraying the gardens and surrounds with insect replant so mozzies aren't too much of a problem within the hotel. Of course, you will still need to spray your own insect replant on yourself.
Overall, I thought this hotel was fantastic and I would have no hesitations staying here again. Considering the price we paid, it far exceeded any expectations. I would highly recommend this hotel."
2099,Great Value for Money,50,May 2017,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Courtyard. Staff are exceptionally friendly. Security is very well maintained. Rooms are very clean and well appointed, although a little on the small side. Extras included in our deal were good with great savings. Breakfast is 10/10 and always has something different every morning. Very central and has shuttle service running daily with staff happy to take you to most places. The Pool Bar has a great vibe and drinks are not overly priced. Would definitely recommend."
2100,Food Truck park in hotel area,40,April 2017,"This Food Truck unusual Food Truck coz located in hotel area, in front of lobby of Courtyard Seminyak Hotel. This truck served light food & beverages as well specially for local beer. Beef Rendang Kebab always my favorite whenever going back to this area. Only 50K you will get this food (promo buy 1 get 1 during I'm visited) and the taste WOW.....so meaty, crunchy from the fresh veggies, bit spicy with bit of chilli sauce made my day really good....."
2101,Vacation,50,May 2017,"The perfection. Everything super clean good service, room perfect. Loved The pool area so relaxing And beautiful. Good service Also in The bar The waiters so nice speacially The girl Elta she is so careful And nice service to The client. Position really close to The beach 5 min walking. Also close to all bars restaurants And shopping , everyhing lovely i recommend."
2102,Perfect hotel in Seminyak,50,May 2017,We had booked this hotel 1month before to arrive to Bali. I cant choose easily a hotel but i think Mariott is the best choice. They serve a fantastic and plenty of variaty breakfast. It is a real dream to eat. U can find even icecream in breaskfast buffet. The pool and pool bar are alse fantastic. The ambiance is lovely. We ll definetly prefer Mariott if we decide to come back again to Seminyak. In addition personel are so friendly and concierge is very helpfull.
2103,Great stay,50,April 2017,"We loved our stay at the Courtyard from the moment we arrived , very comfortable rooms, spot on air conditioning , it is within a easy walk to the beach , or free transport down .
Best breakfasts , and the What the Truck altogether it was easy to want to stay longer . All staff we encountered where friendly and so helpful towards us, thankyou"
2104,Excellent value for Marriott room quality,40,April 2017,"Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak has lived up to the Marriott quality standards . Security was its best . Our taxi on arrival was inspected .

Check in was swift and we were given a room with the view towards the outside with glimpses of the water . Room size was huge and bed was comfortable.

Morning breakfast has a lot of variety to choose from . Latte for morning coffee was also available. Excellent quality of Indonesian local and international food. Just great. Right opposite the front gate of the hotel is a medium size supermarket called Star minimart. We bought our bottles of water and other snacks at reasonable prices .

We arrived on a Thursday and so happened, Thursday night buffet
dinner at the hotel Garden was Indonesian style . Price of 275,000 IDR ++ per head was reasonable for what local foods were available.

There was a roast suckling piglet , Babi Guling , which was good but not great as the skins were not crispy and crunchy enough . Pork satay were great .

Honestly Balinese warung eating places are a rip off. We have lunch at a place called Warung Ocha at the end of the street , on the main road and the place was nearly void of customer on a busy street at noon but we went in there , thinking being not crowded , perhaps better service. We were wrong , food were expensive and cooking were terrible with lot of MSG. For 2 of us , with just two dishes with juice drinks , our bill was 326,000 IDR with 10% taxes and 5% service charge for a non air conditioning place , infested with mosquito. Tourist being rip off at its worst and ugliest.

Hotel location is great . Walking distance to the beach .
. Good value for a room with water view and daily first class breakfast booked through Tripadvisor for less than US$200 per night .

A great smile from me."
2105,Could not fault this place - loved it!,50,April 2017,"Stayed here for 11 days and had the best time! I honestly could not fault this fabulous hotel. The hotel is super secure and safe and the staff are so friendly and always smiling and saying hello. The two managers at the hotel were often around which I thought was really nice that they get so involved in the front of house running of the business and mingling with the hotel guests. The buffet breakfast was hands down the best I've had - so much choice! They had everything from cereal, fresh fruit, juices, rice and Asian dishes, fresh bread, bagels etc, bacon, omelettes, beans etc.
The hotel was so clean and modern and the room service was always great. The pool and pool bar were great and on the few days that we didn't feel like doing much, it was so nice and relaxing to just lie by the beautiful pool.
The hotel went over and above to provide entertainment such as bingo, aqua aerobics, ping pong tournaments, live music & buffet BBQs. There was even a self service popcorn and candy floss stall you could use for free! They also often handed out complimentary ice lollies, cocktail tasters and cold towels whilst lying by the pool.
They also offer a complimentary buggy service which takes you into Seminyak which is helpful.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to both families, couples and friends and I'll certainly be back to stay next time I'm in Bali. Everything about the hotel was welcoming and we really felt at home. Thank you Courtyard for a great holiday :)"
2106,"Good location, excellent facilities but...",40,May 2017,"Courtyard by Marriott is certainly a very comfortable stay. Security is tight (and reassuring I guess) with car search upon entering, and everyone going through security scanner.

Had a delay during check in, so reception comped a free burrito/taco from the food truck on premises. Rooms are well appointed, but minor details showing it's age. Beds are comfortable. As one would expect of this hotel :)

TIP: I would suggest getting a pool facing room, or any rooms NOT facing the street. Bali/Seminyak street traffic is bad with frequent use of the horn for communication. Also had construction happening across the street which you can hear through the windows. Managed to get my room changed on the same day - much quieter though room had a musty smell which maybe related to air-conditioning. However, the rain shower head in the new room was malfunctioning. Given that I was only staying 2 nights, I didn't bother addressing it with housekeeping until checkout.

Location is good in Seminyak. Easy walk to nearby shops. There is a buggy service also but that is for limited distance and finishes by 8pm. I would prefer a more regular shuttle route that covers a more expansive area. Rather than dealing with the incessant taxi drivers offers and their monopoly in the area. Beach is within 5 min walk... however not the best beaches in Bali.

Pool area was busy. Gym was spacious enough and not very busy. Breakfast buffet was nice with prompt service."
2107,My stay at the hotel,50,April 2017,"I stayed in this hotel for one night last week during my stay in Bali. This hotel in Seminyak is well located near restaurants, shopping , SPA‚Äôs and night life etc. The rooms are excellent and the breakfast amazing. They give you a choice of different fruits or fruit combinations and prepare juice fresh for you during breakfast. They have an amazing swimming pool and also children play area. I was very impressed with Mr John Woolley the General Manager from the hotel . He is hands on and very active . He personally talks to the guests to ensure that that guests are having a comfortable stay. I also want to thank Ms Selvia Derosa Sembiring, the Sales manager for showing me around. I highly recommend this hotel to all kinds for tourists including FIT‚Äôs and group to experience this hotel and make their stay in Bali memorable."
2108,Above and beyond!,50,May 2017,"We have just returned from an amazing week in Bali. The team then went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. The hotel had a great vibe for all ages. Was extremely clean and well maintained. The breakfast was endless (special mention to Ayra for the amazing juices). Wifi connectivity within the hotel was flawless. On our last day I realized I had left an expensive earring in a shop in Seminyak. Ari went above and beyond in his own time to track it down and ensure it was returned. This was an amazing gesture and greatly appreciated!

Many thanks to the entire team for a fabulous stay!"
2109,"Great staff, accommodation, facilities and location",50,May 2017,"We had a great stay, the staff were definitely 5 star, going way above and beyond providing a superior customer experience. In particular Ari who especially went out of his way to find a lost earring in a shop outside the resort, Arya who ensured we had fresh juice delivered to our breakfast table each morning with a smile and a welcome, and Ketet - one of the managers and concierge who always had his finger on the pulse ensuring we were well looked after and felt safe and well organised, as well as Grant, the operations manager who also shone with plenty of great ideas of how to fill our day. Thx to all. We had a ball."
2110,We will be back!,50,April 2017,"This was my third visit to the Courtyard Marriott, it is by far the best hotel I have stayed in in Bali, and I can't wait to book my next stay. The breakfast is amazing, the grounds and pool are beautiful, I cannot fault it. The staff are absolutely lovely, especially the staff in Seminyak Kitchen and the kids club. My nine year old son was in heaven! It is such a relaxing place to stay, in a perfect location. I cannot wait to return! Thank you for another fantastic holiday!"
2111,Relaxing stay,50,April 2017,"What a great hotel

Stayed here 5 nights and couldn't fault it. The staff were all so friendly and the rooms were comfortable.

Breakfast each morning was great - so much to choose from. Omelette station, juice station, cakes, pastries the list goes on.

The location was close to many restaurants in Seminyak.

We really enjoyed lazing beside the pool. There are three separate pool areas all connecting. Each pool had their own vibe - the top pool with the swim up bar and music, the middle pool which was relaxing and quiet and the kids pool which was shallow and cool.

I would definitely stay here again when next visiting Bali."
2112,Top Stay! Best Pick in Seminyak!,50,January 2017,"Great Hotel!
Breakfast was the best breakfast is Bali! Amazing Buffett with everything you could ever want!
Room was great! Comfortable bed. Nice bathroom. Good wifi. If you can request a pool view room!
Pool was fantastic!
Felt very safe and secure here with security checks on every person who tries to walk into the hotel!
Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again!
Only a few minutes walk to the beach and la plancha. Massage places and lots of shops close by!"
2113,Sensational,50,April 2017,"Was a little hesitant booking not on the beach in Bali but this is a quiet little haven in the madness but still lots of fun. Balinese breakfast every day at Seminyak Kitchen.. 8 or so different dishes to die for each day (they have loads of western breakfasts but why...). The pool is great and kicks up in to a little party late afternoons with live music, happy hour. Heaps of activities, great Spa and gym.. fantastic staff"
2114,Great Hotel and Location,50,January 2017,"Great hotel, Best Breakfast I've had while traveling the world. Hotel and facilties are excellent and the pool is fantastic. That creates the problem because no one leaves the hotel and is does get a little crowded around the pool which is annoying unless you are one of those people that puts a towel on the chairs at 6am to guarantee a chair. Bars and restaurants around hotel are fantastic."
2115,Poor room quality & general lack of ambience,20,March 2017,"My wife and I had booked a discounted holiday at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for 8 nights. Upon arrival in Bali, we were met at the airport and transferred to the Hotel with ease and courtesy which was the best part of our first day. On arrival at the hotel we had to undergo a personal and baggage search prior to checking in, where they found a small knife that my wife uses for peeling fruit etc. This was confiscated to be returned when we left. We have been in Bali many times in locally run hotels and never been subjected to more than a mirror search beneath the taxi. Every time we entered this hotel we were subjected to the same security checks, which we had accepted as part of an American owned hotelier.
Upon checking in, the reception could not find our booking until I showed them my paperwork then an embarrassing checking through their bookings, eventually we were given the keys and coupons (on our prompting) for all the 'extra's'. Our room was on the ground floor with the pool access at the far end of the complex.
The chairs and pouffe's furnishings were grubby and we would not use any of them. The room was only set up for 1 person and we had to call for more towels, slippers, dressing gown and toiletries etc. I tripped up and nearly fell on the corner of the carpet which was curling up, several times. The shower had not been cleaned properly as the floor was slimy. I reported all these faults but only the toiletries etc. were carried out at this time.
When we got into bed, all the bedding smelled musty, although it seemed to be clean. This was one thing that was never improved upon during our stay although we had several bedding changes. It smelled musty due to the drying process I am informed, but we had never experienced musty sheets ever before in any hotels in Bali.
The hotel was definitely not up to its ***** rating.
At breakfast next morning a staff member asked if all was well, and I let rip. Apologies all around and after an inspection we were informed all would be put to right.
Upon returning to our room sometime later, the chairs had all been changed,(the fabric was now a dark grey, differing from the light green) the carpet was stuck down and a non slip plastic mat was supplied for the shower even though the slime had been removed. We were offered a $50 compensation which we accepted and covered our next meal.
Although we favoured the pool side terrace room for it's access to the pool, there was no outside lock on the patio door so you had to leave by the main door and walk round to your terrace if you wanted the security of your room when you went for a swim!!
The main restaurant, although the food was very good, lacked Bali ambience and could have been a staff canteen from any western city in the world.
I would rate that hotel a 4 star for facilities, a 2 star for room quality and 1 star for Bali ambience. We will not use this hotel again and unlikely to use any of the Marriott hotels in the future.
Our last day just prior to leaving we experienced an earthquake, something for which the hotel was not responsible."
2116,the nicest people,50,April 2017,"stayed for 6 nights and found the hotel to exceed expectations. at check in I was offered a welcome drink in the form of a cold beer. at breakfast, barista coffee and a great selection of food which rotated daily. Friendly and attentive staff are found throughout the hotel. Give Grant a wave and before you know it you have found a friend who can give you some sound advice on the local food spots."
2117,Fantastic Hotel,50,April 2017,"Recently visited Bali to attend a wedding and stayed in Seminyak.
The Courtyard Bali Seminyak was perfect.
The rooms are modern and spacious with a comfortable balcony to rest after a busy day exploring.The bathrooms are large and have a spacious shower. There is plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe and they come with an ironing board and iron.
The air conditioning is very good and can be controlled from your room. The location although not directly on the beach is only a 5 minute walk to the beach or you can use the free hotel golf carts which offer a regular service to the beach or other parts of Seminyak.
The pool is very large and has a swim up bar. There is also another bar adjacent to the pool where you can sit and enjoy a beer or cocktail and great food."
2118,Royal Treatment!!!!,50,April 2017,"Can't say enough how royal we got treated here during our 9 night stay. From the front desk to the house keeping, everybody made us feel welcome. A special thanks to the house keeping manager for taking care of every little detail immediately. We also have to the thank the 2 chefs which helped us to prepare a wonderful meal during our cooking school at Seminyak kitchen. Same to the super nice breakfast staff.
The rooms are nice and spacious. There is a king size bed, desk, safe, huge shower and reliable internet.
The Seminyak Kitchen restaurant is one of the best around. Ate here several times and really enjoyed it. Definitely get the breakfast, highly recommended.
The hotel is no beach resort. They have some chairs by the beach but nothing special. Tip! Take some towels, walk up the beach (right or north) about 20 - 25 minutes and you will find a MUCH cleaner beach and plenty of beach chairs (we paid 100K for 2 chairs and umbrella).
We can highly recommend this hotel to everybody. Will be back here next time around."
2119,Lovely Hotel to be at Bali,50,May 2016,"Great place to be, friendly staff ; buffet breakfast served great selection , love the local Bakso soup noodle üçú.
Interesting Cooking class to learn the local Sambal. Walking distance to the beach and pubs."
2120,Great Stay ;D,50,April 2017,"Stayed here for 3 nights. They upgraded us to a quiet, pool facing room which was nice of them. The buffet breakfast was awesome, eggs Benedict, Asian dishes, & a fruit/veggie blend station & many others. Breakfast hours until 11am! I requested extra towels & shampoo & blankets and they all delivered in 5-7 mins, Super fast! Friendly service, all smiles. Air conditioning was super cold. Pool was ok, not that big but a nice place to relax. The hotel is 5 min walk to the beach. You can get a buggy ride if available. It's also 10min ride (w/o traffic) to the area where all the known restaurants are like Mykonos, Rumours, Chandi & Ultimo. Happy experience overall, would return again."
2121,Can't rate this place enough!,50,April 2017,"We stayed in courtyard seminyak for 1 week, from start to finish we were treated like royalty! The staff are so helpful, the hotel is spotless, the public bathrooms are consistently being cleaned throughout the day! The pool bar staff are wonderful every few minutes they are at your service with cloths for freshening up or to check if you needed anything. Our room was cleaned to perfection every day with fresh water left!
We used the zanti spa a couple of times and it was amazing the therapists were all so friendly! And last but not least our wonderful driver wayan baru who collected us from the airport but also took us on a few day trips, one of the nicest people o have ever met and extremely professional! Thank you so much to everyone in the courtyard hotel, we will 100% be back!
Aimee Mc Donagh"
2122,Not a great stay at the hotel,20,April 2017,"after staying in sanur and ubud, i travelled to Seminyak and we had booked at Courtyard. We had booked 3 rooms a couple of weeks before we travelled to Bali. We reached at about 3 PM and we were given 1 room for 7 of us. The other rooms were still under housekeeping. Finally, after 2 hours we were given the rooms. the rooms were okay, not super awesome. Day 1 of the stay, the rooms were cleaned and arranged by the housekeeping by the time we came back from the day tour. Day 2 was a shocker, we came back from the tour in the evening to find the room still in the mess we left in the morning. The housekeeping came at 5PM ish, which was really annoying. complimentary breakfast was good though."
2123,Great property all round,50,April 2017,We were looking for a place for 5 people ranging in age from late 20s to late 50s. We really liked this area so decided on Courtyard Bali. It was the perfect choice. The rooms were well appointed. The pool area was large with plenty of lounges. The swim up bar was lively with good music- especially late afternoon. We loved the breakfasts and the coffee bar was great. Staff were accommodating and efficient. An all round great location.
2124,"Wonderful, wonderful!",50,April 2017,"The hotel has everythng one could ask for ... with one exception. No one could have imagined how wonderful the people are, all caring and attentive, from the management team through to pool staff and housekeeping.
Worth a stay to see what the ultimate in customer service is all about.
Bryan"
2125,Fantastic Service,50,April 2017,"I stayed here recently for 3 nights for a conference. From the moment we arrived, the service we got was fantastic. Everyone was really friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home.

The rooms are a nice size and well appointed. Good selection of channel on the TV. We had breakfast and lunch in Seminyak Kitchen restaurant and the food was great. Drinks by the pool bar every evening was also very nice.

Would love to go back for a holiday."
2126,Very friendly hotel,50,April 2017,"We just stayed here for two weeks. The rooms were lovely and the staff were excellent. It is a very friendly place, very convenient for local places to eat and Double Six beach. The rooms were great and the pool area is very well kept. The hotel also has a beach front area with towels, loungers and free water and a buggy to take you there and back. Perfect hotel for all ages."
2127,Fantastic,50,April 2017,"We stayed for 9 days loved this place. Its not often we find a hotel that we would be happy to stay around for the day. This hotel has so much to offer. Great pool, swim up bar, free activities like aqua aerobics, bingo and yoga. Music by the pool and live music in the evening. The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic. 5 mins to beach or the buggy will drive you to beach or eat street. Buffet breakfast is good but not as good as other Marriotts like gold coast aus. Frankensteins restaurant is in the same street and plenty of nice spas etc. Free WIFI is good. Looking forward to coming back"
2128,Beautiful Hotel and Memorable Holiday,50,April 2017,"From the moment I was picked up at the airport until the moment I left the hotel I enjoyed every minute of my stay! I loved the offer of cold drinks in the airport pick up, was very welcome after a long day of traveling from south east asia!

The room was beautiful and fresh, great facilities and very comfy bedding. Pool view was excellent and was nice to watch some of the activities occurring below. Stunning buffet breakfast and the day spa is worth a trip as well.

Very much enjoyed the pool bar for food and drinks, reasonably priced and great quality. Lots of nice little touches around the hotel, free popcorn and fairy floss, loved my towel animal and note I received on my bed on the last night. The ""What the Truck"" food truck out front of the hotel is fabulous. Great for a snack if you don't feel like going to the restaurant.

Hotels location is great, short walk to shops, beach and beach clubs but can also utilise the buggies to get dropped off at other locations.

The staff were amazing, from the drivers and security to the wait staff, house keeping and management - everybody demonstrated such respect and professionalism towards the guests. I often noticed Director of Operations - Grant talking to guests and providing assistance. It's nice to see management talking to guests and making their stay that bit more memorable. I couldn't really fault anyone or anything! Will definitely be back."
2129,Great place in seminyak,50,April 2017,Just spent 8 days in this resort. What a fantastic place. We had a pool view but I would say most rooms had a pool view. Rooms are good and bathroom even better!! The breakfast buffet is great. Plenty of choices and all very yummy. Swim up pool bar good and snacks around pool are also yummy. The bean bags to lay in are very comfortable. Service and staff all throughout the hotel is wonderful. The What The Truck out the front is great for a cheap snack. Plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. Could highly recommend this hotel for couples and families. There is free wi-fi all throughout the hotel.
2130,Excellent Hotel with Great Customer Service,50,April 2017,"We only stayed one night at the Courtyard Marriott before heading back home (spent most of our time in Ubud). Staff were friendly and accommodating, they granted us a late check out (additional 2 hours) at no extra cost as we had a late departure home. After check out we were still able to use hotel facilities which included the 24 hour showers in the gym. Location is excellent, a short stroll down to Seminyak beach and also walking distance to excellent restaurants and shopping. Room was modern, clean and comfortable. This was a great little Oasis to retreat to after the hustle and bustle of Seminyak."
2131,Retreat!,50,April 2017,"We stayed there for 5 nights and stayed in a deluxe pool view room. The hotel staff was helpful and courteous. The pool was the best relaxing space with a pool bar as well with music throughout the day to help you unwind while in the pool.
The pool bar had live music and cocktail hours every evening.
Shuttle service was provided free of cost during the day for dropping around the area!
The breakfast spread was good and the hotel was buzzing with travellers. It was sold out throughout and I'm glad that we were able to enjoy every moment of it as everything was managed perfectly.
IRD should have more options though as the menu was very limited.
Overall... it was a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend this hotel as even the location works out for the best as it has everything around. A 24/7 convenience store located just 100 m away and lots of options for a night out or just a simple dinner. A 5 mins walk to the beach and all the shopping around it in Seminyak."
2132,Easy stay and lots of fun,40,April 2017,This was a perfect hotel for Seminyak since we were out and about most of the day. They've got a lot going on in the courtyard and lobby area so it's very happening! There's a food truck just outside an even a cotton candy machine -- its a very friendly atmosphere. The security staff were very nice as well as the cleaning. Rooms were comfortable -- try and get a pool view as the back view is horrendous but not the fault of the hotel. Location was central so it was easy to walk to places and cabs are easy to catch from the front.
2133,Great Staff,30,March 2017,"Thank you to Grant and his staff for the lovely cocktail night we had on the lawns of the resort. We did spend a lot of time in the pool especially around the pool bar, all the staff were amazing especially Arka who always remembered our names and drinks. We will be seeing you again soon."
2134,This hotel is the real gem of Bali.,50,April 2017,"My name is Ian Ting. My wife and I stayed 6 nights at the Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak and was not disappointed from day 1. The service was top notched and everyone has a cheery and happy demeanor about them. The hotel staff are always happy to help and nothing was too much trouble.
Special mention to Grant (the Director Of Operations), Anton & Davin and the rest of the staff we interacted with, whose name I don't know, who helped to make our stay absolutely enjoyable and memorable.
We will definitely return to this hotel, whenever we are to return to Bali.
Sampai kita berjumpa lagi, Anton :)!!!"
2135,Great hotel and service,50,April 2017,"We were few days at this hotel for vacation and we were very satisfied with the hotel and services. Main point to mention probably is the nice people everywhere in the hotel. This situation compensated somehow the visit to seminyak which we did not find so espectacular. .. beach is big, black sand and visual crowded . Lot of traffic and few space to walk.it could be dangerous due the traffic and few space for pedastrians. Area is expensive and in Bali everything is extreme overpriced for tourists.
Hotel great! Swimming pool fantastic! Nice people!"
2136,Service and Personnel Second to None,50,April 2017,"Completely satisfied with our stay at this facility. The entire staff made us feel like our needs and pleasure was priority number one all day and night long. Especially enjoyed the enthusiasm and joy the delightful ""Ms. Gita"" in the Seminyak Kitchen displayed each time we traveled through or dined at the kitchen. Very enjoyable experiences that will bring us great joy in years to come and we recall them. Please let the hotel arrange your transportation needs. Mr. Gede was superb! We wanted to go the mall prior to our departure. Upon checkout, we put luggage in storage. We made arrangements with Mr. Gede to meet back at the mall pick up point. Mr. Gede claimed our luggage and met us at the mall to bring us to the airport for departure.
Thank you and please keep us the great work and service.
Joseph & Marian Myles

2137,Not so relaxing,30,April 2017,"Our room was well appointed, rain shower, bottled water and comfortable bed. The constant music most of the day and night was irritating, We shifted rooms far away from the pool area and it was better. The people above seemed to be dragging their furniture around the room alot and it became very annoying for us underneath. Room 550 was good if you would like peace and quiet as we did. The Seminyak Kitchen had a great breakfast with much variety daily and friendly and efficient staff. Real espresso coffee and freshly made juices werea bonus. Would have been perfect had it been a bit cooler, it was warm most of the time despite being indoors. The pool was nice, 3 separate levels. Check in and out was slow and tedious, we were not able to check in any earlier than 3pm unfortunately. It was pleasant enough. As we were hoping for a relaxing week, this might not be the best place to stay."
2138,Nice food!,40,April 2017,"Nice hotels with great food and clean environment!All staff very friendly and treat you like at home.
Appreciate Muhammad Ali from Banquet staff.Really hopefull with sniling face and Treat me well and others . Great place , great people and great food!"
2139,"Superb location, great place to relax",50,April 2017,"We were given a beautiful flower to put in our hair upon arrival, greeted with a refreshing drink and a cold towel - a perfect start for any holiday. check-in was quick and our room were ready when we arrived at 1.30pm. everyone was so friendly and ready to help.

The view on our balcony faced the road but we could see the ocean far out which wasn't too bad. The room was every bit of luxurious. Spacious, comfortable and clean, we couldn't fault anything at all. The bathroom was one of the better ones, lots of space and i loved that the wardrobe is in the bathroom which makes getting dressed so convenient. The toilet and showers (boasting a rain shower) are in separate compartments too which means the vanity area dry and nice.

Was informed of a buggy service that could drop us at 3 different locations however we were told to wait for 5 minutes before another buggy would be available. we even got ourselves some complimentary popcorn while we waited! 15 minutes passed yet none of the buggy could take us. on the third night, we asked for information to get to a restauarnt and someone from front desk told us a buggy could take us there so we got back to our room to rest for a bit. However, concierge later informed us that the buggies were down and none of them could take us. The buggy services sounded like a great service however we never got a chance to utilise the service which was a shame.

what i loved most about this property was the level of security - i felt very safe at all times. each vehicle will be scanned and same goes for people. every single time we returned to the property our bags will have to go through the scanner and we would have to walk through the metal detector. every entrance and exit were secured.

the breakfast at seminyak kitchen was the highlight of our stay! everything was so delicious and it was a really generous spread. i loved the bagel station, the bagels were so good i had 2. the breakfast selection was more than i could ask for, efficient service too.

our room was turned down every night too. all in all, a fantastic stay and the location is simply amazing. minutes away from the beach and tons of restaurants and a quick cab ride to seminyak square and the main shopping street."
2140,Almost 5 stars...,40,April 2017,"I stayed here with my husband during the Easter holidays for a few nights. I cannot give our stay 5 stars and I will detail that below.

First, the positives.

The most important and best thing about this hotel are the staff. They are friendly and always happy to help. If this review was simply on staff (prior to checking out) the resort would receive 5.

The hotel is in a fantastic location for the beach and surrounding shops, they offer a free buggy service to the beach and their beach club (some loungers and bar in a private area of the beach) which is great if you don't fancy the walk (although it took us less than 3 minutes to walk to the beach).

Seminyak Kitchen and the Pool Bar offer very tasty food and a good range at reasonable prices. We ended up having lunch here every day and dinner twice during our stay, including the sea food buffet on the Saturday night.

We stayed in a Pool View Room with a balcony. Excellent size, clean and comfortable. Cannot fault the room.

The hotel have a very rigid security policy which does make you feel safe when in the resort.

Some good daily activities for children and adults alike, e.g for adults - aqua aerobics and bingo.

The reasons that I cannot give the hotel 5 stars are for the following.

Check-in was slow and rooms were not ready at 3pm (check in time).

We had paid for a pool view room and were given a room with a view of a wall - this was sorted after a trip back down to the front desk. Unfortunately, the member of staff who was helping resolve the issue questioned my issue with the view as they hadn't received a complaint about it before (I did take a photo to show them) - not exactly the response I was expecting. We did move rooms though.

There are not enough sun loungers around the pool area. The hotel operates a 30 minute wait policy whereby anything left on loungers unattended for 30 minutes will be removed which is great but there simply are not enough loungers unless you are down there at 8am!

We had issues with charging things to our room and it was demanded that we pay cash - again another trip to the front desk and it was resolved for that day and then happened again two days later with no explanation as to why.

After we had checked out, we ordered lunch at the pool bar as our flight was late in the evening. We had done this every day in our stay and never waited more than 10 minutes. On this occasion, we waited 55 minutes and saw others (clearly still guests) place orders and receive their food. We asked after 25 minutes and were told it was coming, at 40 minutes someone saw us looking around and again told us it was coming, by 50 minutes, we went to the front desk and 5 minutes later our food came with two complimentary beers for the wait time. Although the supervisor said it was because they were busy, it was obvious that it was because we had checked out as we saw so many others receive their food before us even though they ordered after! There was no need for anything complimentary as all we really wanted was to have some lunch!

Overall, we had a nice stay and it is suitable for all. I think we would stay here again as the negatives could easily be rectified, it is just a shame that there were any at all!"
2141,Perfect holiday,50,April 2017,"Thanks to Kamong, Santi, Debbie, Soma, Priscillia, Ade, Anton, Ramu, John Woolley the general manager himself and many more staff whose names I'm sorry I didn't get... We had an excellent stay. Beautiful service, such friendly people, so accommodating and helpful. We are sure to return. This one goes down in our memory list as the number one holiday. The kids club is a big deal and so are it's people. The gym is terrific too, so is the pool, and the breakfast a complete treat. Truly a gem hotel. Fantastic location too!"
2142,Resort Gem,50,April 2017,"I stayed at this property for 6 nights and had a great experience. Hotel is in great condition and serviced well. Pool is a great size and allows everyone to have their own space; although there were always kids in the adult area when I was there, I would just move to another area of the pool given the space.
Rooms are on the smaller side, however the bathroom is extremely spacious and the showers are massive, which was great!
Breakfast had a good selection and includes barista made coffees and iced lattes which was a nice addition as many top quality hotels tend to charge extra for these.

Service was fantastic and the staff are all well trained and very professional. You can tell they all really care about what they do and take the time to remember your name and greet you daily. Would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel in Seminyak. Ideal for families and couples.

Finally, great wifi service throughout the property!"
2143,Its own paradise,50,February 2017,"Not far from the beach in a good location and upon entering the complex you immediately felt safe with guards and compulsory bag scans; its a reprieve from the worries you have on the streets in this busy area. With a warm welcome and a cool drink I took in the beautiful surrounds, the pools (with pool bar! Happy hour 2 for 1 cocktails) were beautiful and well kept with plenty of room and a separate kids area at one end. Love kids but glad to not worry about a ball flying into my face haha.

If pools aren't your thing the Marriott also has a beach club with free use of lounge chairs, umbrellas, towels and complimentary fruits. Good place for beginner surfers.

I have to note that the beds here are the most comfortable I had in all Bali! I could have stayed in bed all day watching the many satellite channels and oh how I wish I could take those pillows home.
The rooms were very well kept, clean and serviced daily with new water and mini bar snacks.
The buffet breakfast is not your ordinary buffet breakfast; there is everything you could ever want to wake you up. From a fruit and fresh made juice bar to a omelet and eggs anyway you like bar (including eggs bene) and a bakery section , there's asian foods and foods from around the world even cereal for the boring ones (jokes). You can get real coffee and any kind of teas; they even come around to your table and hand out samples of things like a digestive tea.
The breakfast is worth every penny and you will probably over eat... but dont worry you have free use of the gym!
One tip I could give is that unless you like to watch the crazy outside streets a pool view room would be the go."
2144,Amazing experience,50,April 2017,"What a great place on earth,courtyard marriot had and staff here made our holiday memorable. Highly recommend this place. Staff is very friendly, professional and accomodating. The moment we stepped in marriot we were made felt very special. We truely had amazing experience.

Thanks you Marriot team
Specially Ramu, Ulasi, olly and Patrick"
2145,Amazing Service,50,January 2017,"We stayed at this resort January 17. We took our 2 children aged 4 & 6. From the minute we arrived we were blown away with the kindness and friendliness from the staff. The hotel amenities were great, the restaurant food was outstanding and the attentive staff were always there to cater for your needs. ""what the truck"" out the front was always great for a mexican snack and a Bintang on the go!!! We were a short stroll to all amenities shops, restaurants and beaches, and a quick golf buggy ride to eat st. The pool was always well maintained and was hard to get the kids out everyday. Kids club was amazing and the kids loved learing about the balinese culture. One thing that will stick in my mind is the kind, caring nature of one particular staff member Elta. This young lady is an asset to hotel and i will be back to stay at this hotel because of her. She is a genuine person who really took an interest in her guests and was always on hand for tourist tips and recommendations for things to do. And the kids loved her friendly cuddles every morning at breakfast. Will definately return."
2146,Amazing,50,March 2017,"We had 9 nights at the Courtyard Marriott. Was the best place we have stayed in Bali. The amazing staff are what makes this resort. The gym, spa and all the facilities cannot be faulted. The food and breakfast was sensational. Security excellent. How else could you describe this place other than Amazing"
2147,Staff Review,50,March 2017,"I stayed at this resort with my friends from the 3rd- 10th of March. It was a pleasant experience. As soon as I arrived the Staff were kind and helpful. I found the pool bar staffs service excellent. I highly valued ""Elta's"" service skills as she treated me with respect and helped me have a nice relaxing holiday. Thank you Elta for your fantastic work."
2148,Best hotel I have ever stayed at.,50,April 2017,"The Courtyard Resort is an oasis. The rooms are comfortable and the level of cleanliness is astounding. The room was a good size and well appointed and the mattress was so comfortable - with options of both feather and non-allergy pillows on the bed. The bathroom was clean and had all the amenities you could ask for.
The breakfast buffet was amazing. It would have to be the most comprehensive buffet I have ever seen. Everything was delicious. It was hard to not keep going back for more.
The pool area was spotless. The service was fantastic.
It was very hard to leave to venture outside the resort, it is so comfortable that it is easy to forget that anything else exists.
Security is high but well managed for modern times.
All of the staff should be congratulated for making this such a friendly place to stay. Their attention to detail from the way the hair dryer cord is wound, to the exemplary wait service made us feel like we were royalty.
It is also nice to see that Duty Managers and even the General Manager of the resort helped out during breakfast service, chatting to guests and ensuring everything was as it should be. I love this level of engagement with staff and guests.
I cannot wait to stay here again."
2149,Very Enjoyable,40,March 2017,"This a qaint modern style hotel with an appartment style and cool and groovy feel. The restaurant is located in the front of hotel which is not ideal as it's a little small and pokey, but the food is good and the service is fine.
The pool is terrific located in the middle of the complex.
The staff here are very nice with many of them working here for a long time. I really enjoyed it and would come again."
2150,for those who spend days in hotel pool and nights in pubs,40,December 2016,"hotel was super, rooms and pool were great and breakfast was amazing! It was close to the city and pubs but I would only recommend it for those who like luxury resorts and night life. Families with kids will not enjoy.
The beach nearby was not a good place to chill in bikini on sand, but rather drinking beer in beach bar"
2151,Lovely stay,50,April 2017,Stayed here for 3 nights. We had a poolside room which was comfortable clean with a large comfortable bed. The staff were really friendly and helpful lots of poolside waiting staff. Breakfast was included and was really nice lots of variety.
2152,Greatest holiday of my life,50,October 2016,Great facilities and the best service of any hotel worldwide. The breakfast is the best in Seminyak and caters for all diets and nationalities. Just a short walk or buggy ride to the beach and the famous Eat street. World class boutique shopping is a 20 minute walk or quick buggy ride away.
2153,Amazing stay.,50,March 2017,"Modern hotel with contemporary rooms. The hotel has the best breakfast in Seminyak! There are so many options to choose from and coupled with Balinese hospitality makes it worthwhile. It's also located at a nice spot, you are not exactly in the crowded part but neither far from it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to explore Seminyak."
2154,"""unforgettable hotel""",40,March 2017,"Great staff, great massage for my wife and I by very competent staff at ""Zanti"" within hotel (Kerti & Hari). Great security. A very friendly trainee (Yvenka) who has a great attitude. Bar staff also very good. Only hiccup as per previous review was that ATM's throughout Bali were deliberately switched of for Balinese New Year but no hurry by locals to get them up & running again. Had to borrow $ in the end from fellow travellers. But yes an unforgettable Resort in Bali."
2155,Good Value for Money but service could have been better,30,April 2017,"Overall a good option if looking to stay in Seminyak and prefer a hotel experience:

Room
We had a pool view room which was nice, room was moderate size, with a nice bathroom and balcony. AC was very good !

Services
From the point of check in we found the staff to be unhelpful. Overall throughout our trip, at meals / at the bar etc. everything was very slow with us waiting for our main courses 1 night for 1hour ! We also had an issue when all the local areas shut down ATM's for the religious festival as we had no cash , and when we asked the staff what to do, they said they didn't know and it ended at that. We did use the Spa one day and would highly recommend this, very beautiful and enjoyable ! The beach area also requires work, its very small and not well maintained. The pool is lovely, but as its a courtyard, many of the loungers don't get the sun.

Food
Breakfast is nice, with a huge buffet. Other meals were ok ... not gourmet, but satisfying and decent options. The food truck out the front did the best taco's !

Value for money
Overall it was good value for money and we had an enjoyable trip, but I expect better service from Marriott"
2156,Solid and good value,30,March 2017,"I booked this hotel last minute as I was a bit tired of staying in the jungles of Ubud (which were lovely), and wanted to head to the beach, and this hotel had the most reasonable rates. Check-in was an ok process - I landed early, so they didn't have a room available until 1 as the hotel must have been full. Also, a bit of confusion as I had booked through hotels.com and some back and forth about not charging me a cancellation fee for accidentally booking 1 day extra. Besides that, the good was: clean, modern, good location - close enough to main parts of Kuta or Seminayk, good wifi, expansive and decent breakfast. The bad: it's not on the beach, although the pool is decent (have to get there early to get a nice lounge chair), the food is ok (much better to venture outside the hotel to local spots). Also, I was in a room right above the hotel lobby and since it's open air common spaces, I could hear a lot of noise from in my room. Overall a decent place and good value for $."
2157,A very comfortable stay.,40,April 2017,"Located in a beautiful area in Seminyak. Close to Seminyak square with complimentary drop off. Check in was fast and efficient. Room was ready even before check in time. However my earlier request of surprising my wife with flowers and cake did not happen, even though they did confirm it would be done (it was our honeymoon ) . I was too tired to think also so didn't comment. Hotels gym was fantastic and had sufficient equipments. The facetowel and lemon infused drink was a nice touch. Our room was extremely comfortable. The toilet was well equipped. The balcony was super comfortable with nice view of the pool. Breakfast was delicious and my wife loved it. 5 star on this definitely. Room service was super fast and food was delicious. Customer service also very good. I would stay in this hotel again, just that my request was not looked into was kind of upsetting. Also we were thir during bali's silent day. Had plenty of activities arranged for the guests and their pool side bar was very good. Check out was prompt. Moreover a minimart right opposite to hotel, which was super convenient."
2158,Pleasantly surprised,50,June 2016,"Having not been to Bali before I was a little apprehensive, but as soon as we arrived at the resort all my cares floated away.

We stayed using a Luxury Escapes deal. Very secure hotel, with checks on cars and everyone visiting the resort. Rooms were quite modern and spacious, with balconies that looked out over the pool.

Buffet breakfast was adequate if a little small, but the lunches/dinners that came from the restaurant more than made up for it. Millions of restaurants within walking distance from the resort.

The pool runs through the middle of the resort which means half of the pool is in the shade for most of the day, which sometimes made it tricky to get a lounger by the pool.

This resort if a perfect base for spending time in Seminyak - it was walking distance or a short taxi ride to all the places you'd want to go: Ku De Ta, Motel Mexicola, Potato Head, etc."
2159,Great place- you won't be disappointed,50,February 2017,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed, the thing that sets this hotel apart is the service. The staff are all amazing and nothing is ever too much trouble, its a home away from home. Food is great in the hotel and priced very reasonable. The hotel has a good balance of younger couples & families so the hotel has a great vibe. Although its not on the beach its a short walk or you can get the courtesy cart down. Plenty of restaurants all within walking distance and a $3 taxi trip to Seminyak square. Happy hours is great every day and pool side tunes is a bonus :)"
2160,Ecellent Hotel in a great location stayed an extra night!!,50,March 2017,"Just returned from Bali and stayed 5 nights at this hotel.

Initially I was here for 4 nights with a work conference with my wife joining me at the end. I was going to book somewhere else but ended up staying here for another night before going to Ubud as the hotel and location were top notch and very good value for money when compared to similar hotels in the area.

The hotel is beautifully presented from when you first walk into the foyer. Everyhting is very modern and classy and the pool is fantastic with the swim up bar. The security check point was a little daunting the first time as I hadn‚Äôt experienced that before but you soon learn that most hotels and shopping centres provide the same service and it does give you a safe feeling.

The hotel staff were wonderful and very friendly. The rooms were big enough but in all honesty we were hardly in it as were either in the pool or out and about. The daily breakfast buffet was extensive and great quality food. Surprisingly the coffee was also excellent although I recommend a double shot!

You really can‚Äôt go wrong with this hotel and if I went back to Bali I would stay here again. It‚Äôs around a 5min walk to the beach which also has nice cheap dining options at night. It‚Äôs no more than $5 taxi ride to most places and about a $3 ride to eat street near Seminyak square."
2161,Stay at Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort,20,March 2017,"We arrive in Bali on the 21st March 2017 around 01.20am I had asked for transfer and no-one was there too pick us up! We organised our own transport.When we got to our room I was so tired it smelt like wet clothes I checked my son's room and it did not.So again I was angry when I finally got into bed the sheet had yellow stains on it again I was angry.We dont usually stay at five star rated so I was extremely disappointed.I did not complain because I thought they would move us away from my son's room that was next too us and my husband said to leave it.When changing my booking I sent email's to change things it was difficult to communicate.I will not stay there again just took it as a life lesson. There was one positive breakfast was great.

Linda Gardiner
Very disappointing ...."
2162,Fantastic hotel with amazing staff. We will be back,50,March 2017,"We have just returned back from our 10 day honeymoon in Bali. We stayed at this hotel and found the whole experience very good indeed. Hotel was very clean and modern. Food a good 10/10. The staff were very attentive and friendly. We had two spa treatments which in my opinion were outstanding value for money. It worked out around ¬£50 for the two of us and would have happily have paid around ¬£95 each back home. The therapists were amazing!

Rooms were very comfy with a great shower and king size bed.

Around the pool area there was often little snacks or complimentary drinks from pool staff who were trying to keep us cool and refreshed on the warmer days.

Overall I couldn't recommend the hotel highly enough. We will be back...."
2163,Professional from the moment we arrived,50,March 2017,"We have purposely held off writing this review for 2 weeks to ensure it is not influenced by the immediate 'holiday afterglow' effect. We arrived at the Marriott and were super impressed by the unobtrusive but professional security measures taken to ensure guests can relax knowing they 'have your back'. Check in was a pleasure and I would recommend you take advantage of the once-off discounted Pool Bar food and beverage package - it's suprising how much you can drink in such a relaxed environment. Our Pool View room on the 2nd floor was excellent with all the normal Marriott amenities you would expect. The walk-in shower was huge and the balcony ideal for relaxing and listening to the evening Pool Bar entertainment. Breakfast (included in the room rate) was a veritable feast - there was something for everyone or in our case - a lot for two. If you have breakfast - forget about having lunch. Service was impeccable and where else would you get the Head Chef coming out to get feedback on what could be improved. Relaxing in one of the pools is my idea of what a holiday is all about. The pool staff, whether they be in the Pool Bar or roving the pool side were the most attentive and friendly people you could imagine without being in any way intrusive. The food and beverage choice was extensive and very reasonably priced and the nightly entertainment was just enough - not too long, not too loud and songs you could sing along to. We were fortunate enough to attend a complimentary Cocktail and Canape night with hotel management and from the informal conversations with each department head you could clearly see how the professional and friendly service ethos of the Marriott is a culture embedded by example from the top. Overall we could not fault our 10 day visit to the Courtyard Marriott and will definitely be returning with our extended family (including grand-children) later this year. A special call out to Grant Young (Director of Operations) who was really lovely to talk to, couldn't do enough for us and ensured our stay was as relaxing as could be."
2164,Breakfast experience,50,April 2017,"We heard a lot about the enticing breakfast experience at the Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak since our arrival in Bali and were looking forward to experience it ourselves. Having been there with the family this morning we can only confirm what was brought to our ears. A very nice selection of delicious food, extremely well presented. The place is inspiring, the staff is joyful and caring, and the rhythmic ambiance between kitchen and bar invites you to stay longer than just for a tasteful coffee served by a barista with a gentle smile."
2165,Very pleasant and affordable resort,50,April 2017,The Courtyard Seminyak is a very pleasant resort with upmarket facilities at an affordable price. The only issue is that it's not on the beach but it has a very nice pool area. I only stayed one night in transit to the northwest of Bali but I will definitely stay here again.
2166,Highly Recommended,50,April 2017,Stayed with my family for a week and everything about the hotel was great. Room was spacious and clean. Service was excellent and staff were great. Food was excellent. Facilities are excellent too. They have a nice kids club for toddlers and a nice pool. Location was also good in a clean and safe area
2167,Awesome place to stay,50,March 2017,"If you are not looking for a villa type of accommodation, I highly recommend this hotel. Adequately sized room with an awesome view of the pool. Plus, their breakfast buffet is simply amazing! Not only that, the staff are professional and helpful. Thumbs up!"
2168,Excellent hotel,50,March 2017,"Great hotel in a great location. We were there during Nyepi and big applause to the hotel management for organizing such great activities to keep everyone occupied.
Great food. Great staff. Pool bar is really nice."
2169,Another perfect stay,50,March 2017,"We just stayed at Courtyard Seminyak for the 3rd time in 7 months and as always it was a great experience. So nice when you arrive for the best breakfast in Bali and they smile and say ""Welcome Back""! We were offered a choice of rooms on arrival and an upgrade to a Pool Terrace for a slightly higher price however definitely worth it for the direct pool access. I have stayed in all 3 room options and all are of a high standard with good layouts. The staff are always happy and willing to assist and we look forward to seeing them again in July. Thank you Courtyard Marriot for your consistency in providing quality accommodation."
2170,Brilliant Break,50,March 2017,"Wonderful 7 night stay at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak. Nothing is too much trouble for this well run and motivated team. Smiles and hello's abound whether it's by the pool, in the bar, the restaurant or reception. There's a lovely, welcoming atmosphere from the moment you arrive. Rooms are super clean, well equipped and well maintained. The breakfast buffet is amazing with so much food - western and Balinese - on offer. There's something for everyone here: families, couples or singles. Thoroughly recommended."
2171,Lovely hotel and staff - spoilt by smoking,40,March 2017,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for 8 days.
Overall we had a great time. The rooms are pretty standard size with the usual amenities. Not large but certainly big enough and very comfortable. It was a bit musty at times, but that is usually the case in Bali and it certainly didn't really bother us at all.
The breakfast are great and we also had the Balinese dinner which had great food. We even used the Taco truck a few times.
The pool is large and we could usually get a sun bed, although we didn't go to the pool until later in the afternoon.
I did yoga 3 times (Merta is a really good teacher) and we also had 2 traditional Balinese massages in beautiful surroundings with skilled masseurs.
The location of this hotel is great and it is an easy walk to the beach, restaurants and money changers. There is a terrific vegan restaurant, Zula, a few minutes walk away. We ate there a lot.
My only criticism of this hotel is the smoking - it is pretty pervasive. Not in the restaurant but just outside, on balconies so depending on your neighbour it might not be too pleasant on your balcony, at the pool bar and at the pool. There is a non-smoking side of the pool but the people with pool rooms can smoke outside their rooms a couple of metres from your sun bed.
But we still had a great time and I would definitely stay there again as smoking is everywhere in Bali.
Finally I would just like to praise every single staff person that we came into contact with - the service and friendliness was exceptional."
2172,Great Experience,50,March 2017,"Well located hotel in the heart of the buzzing Seminayak . Has good well appointed rooms and a lovely swimming pool . The staff is extremely hospitable with a smile on their faces and always ready to help. 5 min away from the beach , they have regular shuttles from the hotel to the beach . The hotel has a private beach area. There is Shopping, restaurants and Spas within walking distance of the hotel."
2173,Sensational hotel,50,March 2017,"Stayed at the hotel for a week in march and had wonderful time . The atmosphere was laid back , cool and the service drom the ever smiling staff was fabulous.
Great location close to beach and nightlife."
2174,Amazing Hotel,50,March 2017,"My husband and I have stayed here several times and to us it's the perfect location. Top hotel, top staff that are very friendly and engage with all the guests. A special thankyou to Ade who is new and is a trainee that does a great job. Anna in sales of F&B who is just amazing and Patrick David chef De Cuisine also amazing . We can not fault this place 10/10. I highly recommend this place. Will be back soon.
Happy holiday !!!

2175,Standard hotel feel,30,March 2017,"Well, Marriott Courtyard, is new, and is a busy hotel. Many families there. Stayed in room 261. Just right beside the pool and the bar.. Music can be loud.

I feel that because it's a big brand hotel, service is standardized. Don't feel personalized."
2176,Awesome experience and awesome staff,50,February 2017,"My friend and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak in early February. It completely blew me away, the rooms, the pool, the food and the service was absolutely amazing and a great way to finish our trip. One of the employees - Elta always made sure we were well looked after especially with our food preferences and gave us great advice on places to see around the area. Exceptional service! We will definitely be coming back again and will recommend the Courtyard Marriott to friends!"
2177,Good hotel!!!,40,March 2017,"The Hotel is in very good center of Seminyak and also near the beach which takes only 10min to get there.
Seminyak Kitchen offers very good taste of local food, friendly staffs and beautiful opened-kitchen design. We've been to many restaurants in Bali but it make us wow and become our favourite restaurant so far
The pool is enormous with 3 level (two for adults and one for kids)
The room is clean, but room amenity is poor. We stayed with 2 people, but only set up one toothbush, no cotton-bud, no comb, no shaver. We thought it's a mistake at first night but the next day is still the same."
2178,Very Nice Hotel,40,March 2017,"This hotel looks & feel very new.
The room not so big but cozy and had a very good ambience. Had a private balcony and outdoor sofa. Very cool. And the Bathroom is nice with complete amenities.
The Pool always packed with the tourists.
The hotel location is also very good."
2179,Excellent value for money hotel,50,March 2017,"You can only report as you find it.....brilliant hotel. Room was modern,clean, neat and tidy. Air con worked really well and the rooms were quiet. Great location as well. Step out the front gate and turn right - 100m walk to the beach. Turn left and your in the hub of Seminyak shops,restaurants,cafe's bars etc. Everything in the hotel faces inwards to the pool area making it feel snug and secure. The pools...whooohoo ! Top one was adults only with a swim up bar, while to the lower one had a kiddies play area. Great poolside service from all the staff, so loved having a pizza and beer poolside for lunch.
If you can find staff that are more helpful, friendly, smilin' and a 'can do' attitude then I'm yet to meet them.
Lets balance the glowing report with two negs - Room service was a bit slower than expected....but we're on holiday so who cares.

We had the earthquake (6.4) while in bed in the room and we received no guidance from management that it was safe to use the lifts, leave or stay in the building etc. basic 101 management communication skills.
Seriously though, if you have a PA system - Use it.
If you don't have a PA system - suggest you might want to invest in one ?

Other than that - would I come back ? - YEP !!"
2180,Weekend getaway,50,February 2017,"This review has been pending sometime from my side,this was a great weekend getaway to Seminyak.
We checked late in the evening and were greeted with lot of enthusiasm by the front desk staff. It's a nice hotel located in the Seminyak area . From the entrance of the hotel the staff greets you and are genuine in their approach. The room was nice with all the basic amenities that is required on a travel. Nice comfortable bed,clean bathroom, television,etc.
I used the gym which is along with the spa in the hotel. The gym was well equipped with basic equipments and is spacious. The pool looked crowded but guests looked relaxed which meant they were having a good time . I used the Seminyak Cafe for breakfast on both the days and was absolutely happy with the experience. The buffet had everything that you would need for breakfast and the staff was crisp in their approach. I would recommend sit outdoors and enjoy the nature.
Overall a good hotel and highly recommended to everyone staying in Seminyak area."
2181,Best experience ever,50,March 2017,"From the time we arrived at Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak ...we were overwhelmed by the kind greetings and attention during check-in. Our room was very clean. The staff (such as uliss ,,uliss ,kisawa ,ana and so on ,,,)
are so pleasant and they make you feel at home . I must point out that the breakfast buffet and the pool bar was one of my favourite. supplied a shuttle to beach.A beautiful experience. I will definitely be repeating."
2182,Class Hotel with an Outstanding Service,50,March 2017,"I have travelled a lot and have never come across the level of customer service as at The Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort. It was absolutely outstanding from front of Desk, restaurant, pool staff and housekeeping. I can not rate the staff highly enough - in fact - the staff and how beautifully friendly and service orientated they were would be a key reason to stay there again. Most hotels and Resorts should take a point or two from this hotel and have their level of customer service as the benchmark. Starting from The front desk Manager Augustine, Director of Operations Grant and John, Guest Relations Ulis as well as all the pool bar staff were extremely outstanding in making sure our stay was comfortable.

The breakfast was the best ever. The Courtyard Marriott breakfast would rate as the best of any resort we have stayed and and again - the staff and their level of service - simply outstanding.

The pool and pool bar is incredible. Both Kasawa and Hendra from the pool bar made sure that we were well hydrated and looked after - another quality service by the staff. The shuttle service to the Beach Club was efficient and well thought of by the management. Everyone played a huge roll in making the whole trip fun not to mention the Block party and cocktail night - which was well executed.

The rooms were well appointed, practical and served us well. The Hotel is well located in the middle of Seminyak which makes it an easy access to Some great restaurants and night life at Seminyak.

Thank you to all at the Marriott Seminyak staff for our break and for making it so special. We cherished all the conversations we had with your wonderful people as well as tremendous staff members.

It will definitely be my go to for my next visit, and Highly recommend it for others."
2183,Awesome first time in Bali experience!,50,March 2017,"Hubby and I stayed here recently for 5 nights to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We were very impressed with the level of service received at this hotel. We booked this through a deal on Scoopon which included a heap of inclusions such as cocktails/beer every day, lunch, dinner, massages as well as transfer to the hotel from the airport. I was sceptical of what to expect given Scoopon is a bit hit and miss, but was definitely not disappointed!
We received a 'Happy Anniversary' cake in our room which was a lovely gesture. Our room was modern and clean overlooking the pool bar. The pool was beautiful and clean. The surroundings was just divine and picture perfect. The guest wifi was fast - added bonus!
The breakfast buffet is a must - one of the best!The only hotel I've seen that has a cakes, bagel and ice-cream station!
What I also loved about this hotel is the level of security - when you see 4 guards plus a security dog checking each car that comes through you know they mean business! Metal detectors on every entry as well which we didn't mind at all.
The location was also very convenient. Only about 30 mins away from the airport, and only about 10-20 mins by Taxi (depending on traffic) away from Kuta and all the great restaurants around (Mamasan/Barbacoa/Mexicola). There is a mini mart right outside the hotel as well a CBA atm which was handy. Also just a five min walk to Seminyak beach.
The staff were very friendly - special mention to Widi at the restaurant who really impressed us by remembering our first names throughout our 5 day stay there!
We will definitely come back - next time with the kids!"
2184,Best place to stay in Seminyak!,50,March 2017,"An amazing resort, where to start?
The pools is just divine, not to cold and now too warm. With two options to swim in, either the top pool which is alongside the swim up bar or the large pool further down. A variety of loungers and bean bags to relax on and poolside service team to deliver you drinks and food.
Room was amazing and modern, even had a rain rooftop shower in the bathroom. Only downfall was the towels seemed a little old.
The staff are so friendly and willing to help by any means possible.
They Buffet morning breakfast is delicious and I would defiantly recommend dining here for dinner also.

Highly recommend this resort!"
2185,"Great, Clean, Safe",50,September 2016,loved this resort....it was safe and all cars were checked when dropping people off with dog and all. you even had to go through metal detector before entering hotel. the breakfast was amazing and I recommend you definitely don't miss it. pool was nice but hard to chairs and sun due to building layout. my fiend did the pool exercise class and had a lot of fun. its a short walk from the beach as well...we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again
2186,My experience.,10,March 2017,"Dear General Manager John,
I am the sister of Alexi who requested the crib.
I would also like to clarify a few things. I requested this crib 3 months prior when i had made the booking. I also called up a few times to change the dates of our stay and while doing that confirmed the crib had been organised and was told this was locked in. I am happy to send you my confirmation that shows this crib was requested. When i got there i had a baby who hadn't slept and was beyond exhausted. I confirmed with the front desk as I arrived that a crib was in my room. I was told this will be done immediately. I then had to call reception another 4 times when i finally had enough and went up to the front desk. Eventually at around 10pm i got the crib.

In regards to my dad ""happily"" accepting the vouchers he was given by the manager, did he have any other options? He made it clear that he didn't want cocktail vouchers as none of us are really drinkers but it seemed that's all he could offer. It wasn't worth getting uptight or making a big deal out of it so of course he took the only option given to him.

The first day i got there I had lunch and a drink and was told so many times by the staff that i had to put money on my account. I told them i would do this when i got a chance to get organised and put my son to sleep. That night i get a note under the door saying that i need to put money on my room ASAP. This happen to other members of my family several times. ohh and the best part was getting chased by one of your staff members as we were getting into our taxi to say we owed 0.93cents after we spent close to 16k.

To be honest myself or my family members never actually do reviews or surveys or complain about things but we were extremely disappointed at the amount of money we spent for what we got. If we stayed in a 2 star hotel we would have been happy with what we got as that's what we would expect. The bathrooms especially
basins ( around the tap and drains) were disgusting.It also took about 10 minutes for the hot water to come on when we wanted a shower. On the second last day i also saw blood like stains on my sheets. not nice at all.

overall very disappointed with our 5th visit to bali.
The pool was lovely and most staff were lovely but just feel for what we paid for it definitely was not worth it."
2187,FABULOUS,50,March 2017,"First time visiting Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak in Bali.
Could not fault the place in Anything.
All staff so helpful and courteous, Spotless clean. Dining was great, Breakfast great variety.
Didn't like room on noisy side of road, Grant, operations manager was only too happy to relocate us.
Good location very handy to everything. Activities at the resort were very good.
They also have a food truck which has good range of quick and easy meals and drinks.
The security in the hotel is excellent and very polite and courteous.

Thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay. Thank you to Courtyard Marriott.....we will definitely be back."
2188,New Year in Bali :),40,December 2016,"l will be the first to admit that before booking this hotel l had literally spent hours on Tripadvisor and other sites getting as much information on Bali and where to stay. l read all the mixed reviews for this hotel and i will say knowledge is power because we got there with pretty basic expectations and i would like to say they were surpassed just a little bit. The hotel is definitely not 5 star, it is typical on any other hotel where there are hits and misses but it is not perfect.

The Kids Club is a hit and even upto now our 4 year old son talks about going to back to Bali and going to the kids club. l also had trouble at check out as almost everyone here has in when i asked for my money back which i had overpaid a bill from room service and they gave me some story and in the grand scheme of things it was like AUD$10 so l decided to not bother.

The pool area could do with some improvement as noted by the other reviewers as people hoard the day beds and at one point we went for like 90 minutes without being able to get one. The buffet breakfast is a must but i must say i got a bit weary of the manager/supervisor both the woman and the man coming all the time to see and check on how we are enjoying our holiday and one point even said ""make sure you give us a good review on Tripadvisor""! and i thought to myself wth!

The hotel is really well located and you can pretty much walk anywhere and the taxis are right outside if you want to catch one. For the money we paid, we were happy with the hotel and of course the food truck is #goals!"
2189,Yoga,50,March 2017,"Merton rooftop yoga is fantastic thankyou for the experience i will definitely do it again.
Merton is a very easy going instructor if you are still a beginner.
The Marriott has excellent services and is in a great location."
2190,Needs promptness,30,March 2017,"I recently stayed here. We took pool view with rollway bed. The hotel ambiance is pretty good. They are in central of seminyak, very good location. The hotel its elf is a bit cramped but I think it's due to the limited space in seminyak area.
The room is nice, not too spacious, but comfortable bed and pillow.

However, they need to improve on their promptness.
My rollway bed wasn't ready by the time I checked-in, I already stated in my bookings confirmation that there is rollway bed.
Only 1 room-slippers and bath robe available.
When the rollway bed came 30minutes after we called them up.

I asked for 2extra pillows (my rollwaybed was very weird. It was higher at the lower part), from 3pm till I went out and came back around 8pm, it did not arrived.
Only when I complained about it then they rushed to house keeping, took around 20-30minutes.

Breakfast was good, complete variety. Again, their staff is rather ignorant. Sometimes they took our plates without asking if we are done or no. In this case, my friend wasn't done with her food yet.

Overall i think this hotel is good, but they have to work on their staff more."
2191,NOT 4.5 STARS!!!,10,March 2017,"I've stayed in 3 star hotels that are better than this. Extremely disappointed considering the cost per night. Service was poor. Seems like its run by trainees. Nothing is consistent; same order can be different size and taste each time; drinks don't taste the same and are not cheap at all. Rooms are dirty, sinks are blocked up, doors are difficult to open and close. We ordered a baby crib a month in advance and confirmed it the night before we arrived. We kept getting promised one for 8 hours until we finally got one around 10pm. You can't charge things to your room, you have to have a pre-paid tab that ou need to keep topping up and you lose what you don't use. Will never stay here again."
2192,Taking parents to Bali for first time,50,March 2017,"Well where do i start ,i guess the pool bar as we spent a lot of time there ,and well i have taken my 60 something year old parents to their first trip over seas John and Annette (john(dad) became very well known with all staff by end of trip as he got up and sang most nights at the pool bar , fantastic entertainment there and the staff are truely amazing ,nothing was too much trouble , the parents were very nervous to go overseas and the staff at the Marriott have totally made there holiday ,so much so to my whole family's surprise the oldies want to come back to Baliüòäjob well done Marriott staff ... also Ari in the restraunt at breakfast was amazing he remembered us every day and the guys in What the truck ...The whole hotel has gone above and beyond to help my parents out as my mum has difficulty with walking around ..the location is amazing with shops and great restraunt close by ...totally recommend for first time in Bali oldies and anyone looking for luxury and to be treated like a king or a queen ..thank you again Martiott we will be back üòäüçπ"
2193,WORST SERVICE AND HOTEL MANAGER A JOKE,10,March 2017,"Service hotel staff - 5/10
Service hotel management - 0/10
Food - 0/10 - ( 3 of us got Bali Belly from eating nasi goren in their facility )
Cleanliness 1/10
Facilities 2/10
Value for money 0/10

Firstly... IF YOU LIKE SUN OR SUN BAKING, THIS HOTEL WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!

We spent $25000 as a family in this place and they chased us out the door as we were leaving in our taxi for 93 cents ( yes 93 cents ) as they miss calculated the final bill. What a disgrace!!!

My dads room had only himself in it but they forced him to pay for 2 people for breakfast. The hotel manager ( white Aussie guy ) came to explain that there was nothing he could do to refund my dad the $330 Aus that he paid for someone that was not even there. He went on to say that breakfast only costs them $3 per person and was there best profit centre???? This guy should not have such an important job and he is an embarrassment to the Marriott organisation.

My sisters room was supposed to have a crib for their 1 year old boy, they could not provide one for the first night as they claim we ran out of cribs sorry!!! PATHETIC.

My room, I don't even know where to start but the worst of it was blood or brown stains all over my sheets on arrival!!!!

Worst hotel and service I have had and I have stayed at over 100 hotels in my time all over the world!!!!"
2194,Excellent staff and breakfast!,50,March 2017,"Came back for a second visit as the last year's stay was so enjoyable.

Impressed by the continuous efforts for improvement by the management, new additions include a fresh juice bar during breakfast and a food truck at the entrance!

Being a loyal Marriott member, must say that the majority of this hotel's staff is exceptional:

-Anton+food team : Your kitchen def stilled my daily exotic fruit cravings and thanks for the cucumber donations during a nasty sunburn
-Surya : Your energy makes lazy-me want to get up and do water aerobics haha
- Security team: Thanks for keeping me entertained with the doggies while waiting for taxi :)

Room did smell a bit more damp compared to last year and the taxi shenanigan near the entrance increased too but other than that, perfect stay!"
2195,TERRIFIC CHOICE IN SEMINYAK.....MARRIOTT COURTYARD!!,50,March 2017,"Great location in Seminyak, Bali.......very attractive contemporary style Marriott Courtyard that has all amenities that guests may enjoy!!

The entire employee staff is very well trained and most accommodating. Nice smiles and friendly greetings each and every day.

We had the opportunity to stay 6 nights in a one bedroom suite....very attractive and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is simply delicious and very nicely presented with western and asian selections....the best breakfast buffet that we have had anywhere in all of our worldwide travels.

2196,"Lovely hotel, great staff, great food, close to everything",40,March 2017,"We recently stayed at this resort - it was lovely, staff excellent, all food excellent, breakfast, lunch and dinner, has private area on beach within 2 mins - they take you in a buggy, 3 pool areas, live music nightly
Our only complaint was the noise from the Pool Bar, which was directly below our room on 5th floor (3 floors below, the numbers dont go right). It was loud until around 9pm most nights, which was fine. On 1 night they also had a function in the function centre, and the guests were allowed to go outside to smoke. Well they did this until 2.30am = we called security at 12, then again around 1am, and it still didnt finished until 2.30pm. Sadly this was the only issue but we asked the next morning to be moved to another location - if we had that room from Day 1 there would have been no issue - so beware of the location of your room - if its near the pool or function centre it may be loud at night
Cant fault anything else - 5 STARS otherwise - would go back for sure, and ensure we had the rooms located away from that area"
2197,The best hotel and staff ever!!,50,March 2017,"We have recently returned from a two week stay at the hotel and I cannot stress enough what a wonderful experience it has been.

This is a wonderful hotel with wonderful staff!

Special thanks to Ramu, the concierge manager, for being so lovely and helpful throughout our stay. Ramu made sure that our every need was met with professionalism and kindness, a lovely man who we thank very much.

Big shout and massive thanks to Yeani, Widi, Ulys, Joni, Kia, to name just a few, for making our stay all the more special, for being so loving and kind .You guys have all been fantastic and we thank you.

We just couldn't fault this hotel if we tried, lovely rooms, great ambience, convenient location, best breakfast we've any anywhere and above all the most attentive and caring staff.

Thank you Ramu and team for making our holiday so memorable and one to remember.

Love from London,

Mia and John"
2198,Unforgettable Bali Trip,50,March 2017,"We arrived on the 8th March (after having spent 2 nights in Ubud). When we checked in we were very fortunate to be provided with an upgrade to a suite, overlooking the pool. The room was big, the bed was super comfortable (which is one of the reasons why we love Marriott). The balcony view faced the pool, providing a good view of the pool and everyone enjoying themselves at the bar or in the pool. On our first night we received an invitation to attend a cocktail reception, and we were able to meet a number of the hotel staff (marketing manager, operations manager and waitress staff), all were extremely friendly and helpful in providing recommendations on restaurants within Seminyak and the hotel as well). The next day we had a very good breakfast with alot of selections. We also really enjoyed the aqua aerobics/zumba classes held in the morning (the teacher was really good). The beach club was simple the staff were extremely friendly and helpful (Marriott staff are always friendly and smiling, and only too eager to help guests). The Bali buffet was very good value and very suitable for the environment.
We also took the convenient shuttle bus to ""Eat St"", staff were very helpful again in providing recommendations.
Thank you so much for all the staff.
Stayed March 2017"
2199,Expensive but good,40,March 2017,"While the hotel is beautiful, comfortable and in a great location, I found it a little expensive.

Unless you are having drinks during happy hour and sticking to the drinks on the list, expect to pay around 10aud per drink. And don't make the mistake of ordering 2 double gin and tonics which comes to 600,000 ($60)

The pool was brilliant but turned my friends white shorts green. Lol!"
2200,The nicest resort I've ever stayed at,50,March 2017,"I booked my 8 day stay through Luxury Escapes and there were a host of included extras (daily breakfast, daily drinks, daily tacos, specialty dinners and spa treatments). The resort was lovely, just like the pictures and the staff were amazing. A special call out goes to Ayu, Angga and Chinta at the pool bar - exceptional service :-) It was my first proper stay in Bali and it really did exceed my expectations. The room was lovely, spacious and clean as was the whole resort. I really enjoyed my 2 massages at the spa. Breakfast was amazing (as per all the previous reviews). Security was very visible and you had to go through screening each time you returned to the resort. The resort also had some great little touches that made the experience extra special (free mango or guava ice blocks serviced poolside on hot days and I even received a taster frozen strawberry daiquiri while I was in the pool). A minor downside: The resort does have a party vibe and unfortunately does not appear to have designated smoking areas (everyone seems to smoke in Bali). There's live music each night and it can be rather noisy until about 10pm. Loved the Seminyak area, a pretty beach with amazing sunsets over the water, great shopping and dining and I would definitely recommend a stay here."
2201,Perfect kinda of courtyard!,50,January 2017,"A nice clean hotel located in a section of Seminyak away from the main hustle and bustle of the busy narrow streets. Still relatively new, under 3 years old so condition is still great. Friendly staff make your stay very enjoyable. Don't miss the Taco VW Kombi food truck at the main entrance, definitely a unique food stop on this property."
2202,Wanna feel like Family?,50,March 2017,"We just spent 4 days here for my 68th Birthday and could not have asked for a nicer time. From the first contact with the security guards to exiting the property on our last morning, everyone was willing to do whatever it took to see us happy and satisfied. The Staff is just incredible and the onsite restaurant is most excellent. Anton, Director of Food and Beverage for Courtyard Seminyak, was more than welcoming and the entire restaurant staff made us feel like we were long lost friends.
The breakfast buffet is well worth the money. The selection and quality of food is great! I must mention the chocolate ice cream that is available for desert~ after filling up on the cooked to order eggs or omelettes, bacon, sausage, chilled smoked salmon, bagels, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, and Indonesian dishes. I am hungry again!
At the front of the Resort there is a little vehicle called the ""What The Truck"" that has tasty tacos. Chicken and pork, just the thing to tide you over until a full lunch or dinner, and you get two for 55,000 Rp!. The rooms are large and welcoming, the bed big and comfortable and the TV has every channel that you can need, even FOX News. The view into the pool area is wonderful and inviting. The easy 10 minute walk to the beach is nice and they even have a free shuttle to take you down, if 10 minutes is too far for you to wander. The beach is truly gorgeous: wide, long and white/grey soft and small grain sand. A fine place to try your hand at surfing~ small gentle waves and no rocks in the water.
Just outside the Resort is all manner of restaurants and shops for eating and souvenir gathering, all within less than a 15 minutes walk.
We are already planning our return of 2018 and cannot wait.
THANK YOU SO MUCH~~~~ BILL & MARCIA"
2203,Nice resort,40,March 2017,"I stayed for 7 nights, it was pleasurable, however usually I go to Kuta area and don't know Seminyak well in regards to shops and spas. Had body scrub and one hour massage$ 82 at hotel, was lovely and spotless I must say.
The resort is compact, 3 pools --amazing. Security - 5 stars. My room smelt a bit musty when you first walked in, which is a bit worrying, considering the resort is only 2 years old.
Breakfast is out of this world-- have never seen so many selections -5 stars!!!! Music at the bar, a bit too loud, had to raise voice to have conversation. All in all, it was a pleasant stay. Staff amazing and friendly."
2204,Really nice hotel,50,March 2017,"I would highly rate this hotel which has great food, friendly staff and lovely accommodation. Also central to some fun bars and excellent eateries, I would definitely consider coming here again. I would rate it 10 out of 10. Thank you staff and hotel."
2205,Absolutely Outstanding.!!!,50,March 2017,"Me, my partner and friends stayed 1-10th march here and had the most incredible vacation.

Our stay was beyond perfect in every way, the staff were so friendly and the service was impeccable especially from two of the girls I'd like to mention in the pool bar, were we spent most of our days relaxing as you do on holiday ""Elta"" and ""Penny"" thank you both so much for making my Birthday all that more special and for all your help and hard work, I can't wait to come back and have those delightful strawberry daiquiris, you girls did such a great job so thank you.

Our breakfast buffet everyday was so inviting with such a wide variety to choose from and the food was delicious, thank you to all the chefs and staff for doing such an amazing job.

On the night of my birthday me and my friends ate at the ""meat shop"" Seminyak Kitchen the food was faultless absolutely amazing, we thoroughly enjoyed it after we'd finish eating we were greeted by the sous chef, he came out with a big smile on his face and asked us how our meals were, the plates were licked clean and we all sat satisfied is was a lovely surprise to have him come out and greet us not to mention getting a surprise birthday cake.

Thank you Courtyard by Marriott my overall experience was so unforgettable will definitely be back again.

10/10"
2206,Excellent,50,March 2017,"Another great stay, 3rd visit with 2 more to come this year 10/10. Would not go anywhere else, staff are fantastic along with all amenities. Great location as well, if you want to be spoilt be sure to give it a go. See you all in June, keep the beers cold."
2207,Stunning,50,March 2017,"Second trip to this great hotel and back again in June. Brilliant rooms, pool, restaurants. Thanks very much to all the staff for making another memorable stay. And a special thanks to the manager John."
2208,Excellent Hotel with great Indonesian food & great service!,50,March 2017,"We stayed at Courtyard for 7 nights as part of a conference. The service was excellent and all staff were friendly and courteous. The best buffet breakfast is offered here and I have experienced may buffet breakfasts in the past. They had Asian and American breakfast and even ice cream. The food from the restaurant for lunch and dinner was also very tasty and excellent standard. The indonesian food was very delicious. Also the Taco food truck was good for lunch. The hotel is close to Eat Street with local taxi only cost A$2. The beach is also within walking distance. The pool is good, but they should have a non-smoking section as I was not use to the smoke. Tried the Hotel Spa and had the best massages very clean and relaxing. I would definitely come back to this hotel."
2209,Most enjoyable 4 day break.,50,March 2017,"Staff so welcoming,friendly & helpful throughout our stay.
Guests were mainly from Australia,China with some Europeans.
Breakfast was superb each day with wide selections available to suit guests.
Pool area well equipped,relaxing.
Room/bathroom was spacious,beds very comfortable,nice balcony pool facing.
Overall excellent value(e452 for 4 nights B&B 6/10 March).
Definite recommend.
P.S.Substantially better exchange rate on Rupiah purchased in Bali."
2210,Close to everything,40,March 2017,"If you are looking for a hotel that is right in the middle of the action while providing a nice little getaway, The Courtyard Marriott is for you. The facilities are modern, clean and the staff are very welcoming and attentive. I wouldn't say this resort is 5 stars, but it does offer all of the perks of being in a high-end hotel without breaking the bank.
It's also a bonus that all of the taxi drivers know how to find it!"
2211,Great Resort,50,December 2016,"Enjoyed our stay very much, staff were all very nice and accommodating. There were
Complimentary snacks around the pool area which were a nice touch. The rooms were nice, quiet modern and clean. Would stay again."
2212,Excellent! !,50,March 2017,"Came here for our 16th year wedding anniversary. The place was absolutely magnificent. All the luxuries you would expect from a high quality hotel, plus more.
The staff were the friendliest I have encountered in any hotel I have stayed at, from the chefs all the way to the security guards at the entrance.
Would definitely come back again."
2213,Very dissapointig,20,March 2017,"We arrived two days ago. On arrival it was announced that there was no room with one king bed which had been ordered there was only room with two split beds. Reseptionist guy offered to upgrade our room...but for additional money. I've never heard such offers from famous hotels chains.. even in Russia)
Afterwards it took about half an hour for check in!
We changed our room for the ordered one only next day in the evening after multiple reminders to receptionists from our side.
What else:
Linen smells dampness in the rooms. More over there was a smell of some chemicals probably insecticide in our first room number.
Also you have to know that hotel is situated on the ""gay bar"" street and the hotels marketing emphasize this through different promo and advertising, so be ready to meet this guys(gays)) near the pool."
2214,A clean and comfortable hotel about 500m from seminyak beach,40,January 2017,"A clean hotel with helpful staff. A big swimming pool is present in the hotel premises.
Its location is excellent and has many restauarants of varied cuisines within walking distance. The rooms were well stocked with all the amenities including provision for making tea & coffee, ironing clothes etc. The bathroom is of modern design and clean though it lacks a bath tub. Breakfast had a huge spread catering to many palates. All in all a good hotel and our stay of 3 days was very comfortable. We only had breakfast but did not have dinner or lunch in hotel restaurants."
2215,"Amazing Property, Amazing Staff, Amazing Value",50,February 2017,"We booked this hotel for a week-long vacation :) We took advantage of everything the resort had to offer, so I hope that this review can help you make the easy decision to book your stay here.

Before I even arrived to the resort, my upgrade to a suite had been confirmed. As a Marriott Gold member, I am not always used to getting upgrades, so it was nice to have gotten upgraded prior to even arriving to the hotel. We took advantage of the airport transfer from DPS to the resort. There was a lovely gentleman waiting for us with a sign when we came out of immigration at the airport. He took us directly to the newer model van and had us to the resort within about 45 minutes. He spoke highly of Bali and told us all the things we should see.

When we arrived for check-in, we went through the unique security process this resort has. They check every car before they enter the actual resort for any explosive devices, using mirrors and a detection dog. Once they've cleared the car, they have you go through metal detectors and X-Ray your belongings. With the attacks that have happened in the country recently, I appreciated the extra security.

The lobby staff were amazing. They took care of us throughout our entire stay. When we checked in, we received a cool towel, a delicious drink and a quick explanation of all the hotel had to offer. There were multiple staff available to answer questions during the check-in process, and a staff member escorted us to our room and gave us an explanation of all the features of the room. Our luggage was taken from us and delivered to our room as soon as we stepped out of the van.

Our suite was so spacious and comfortable. We had a one bedroom suite that had a living room area with multiple pieces of comfortable furniture, as well as a dining room table. On the dining room table when we arrived was a welcome gift from the manager (some delicious cookies!) as well as a note welcoming us to the property. There was also a large balcony with a comfortable couch. The bedroom was just as spacious as the living area and had THE MOST comfortable bed that I have slept on at a hotel. There was a small desk and another window overlooking the pool in our suite as well.

The bathroom and shower in the suite was one of my favorite parts. It was large with some really cool lighting and a large sink and vanity area. The shower was huge and had a seating area, a large rain showerhead which could be adjusted, and a hand-held showerhead. It was quite luxurious. There was plenty of hot-water and the soaps and lotions provided smelled wonderful.

The housekeeping staff were top-notch. They come to the room twice a day, once in the morning and then again in the evening for turn-down service and a light touch-up. Our staff member (Rich) was amazing and deserves a shoutout. Took care of us most of the trip. Our room was always organized and spotless, and even little things were taken care of, like our shoes moved to the door area and our charging cords wrapped up.

Our rate included free breakfast, and we took advantage of it every morning during our stay. The food was delicious and always fresh. There was a wide selection of both western and local cuisine and the chefs and service staff really take pride in their work. The coffee selection was also top notch and multiple varieties were sampled during our visit. We also ate dinner at the resort every night and enjoyed everything we tried.

The pool area is so great at this resort. There are three pool areas. One swim-up bar area that overlooks the other two pools below. There is a large main pool with lots of chairs surrounding it. We were always able to find chairs when we went out to the pool, and most of them were in the shade, which after we got sunburned was amazing. The last pool area is mostly for the children. It is more shallow and has some chairs in the pool for those that wish to partake.

We also had the chance to go to the spa while we were at the resort. We got the King and Queen package which included a footbath, body scrub, 90 minute bali massage and two facial treatments. The spa was under renovation when we visited, and so our treatment took place in a converted room. Everything was great except for a little noise from the main hotel area, and one of the individuals helping us was sick and coughed throughout the treatment, which made it hard to relax with her having to leave the room on multiple occasions. Well worth the extra money we paid to have it done in the hotel rather than one of the many local places nearby. The prices were still much more reasonable than what we pay in the states.

The resort offers a free shuttle to the private beach club they have. It is about a 15 minute walk to the beach club area or about a 5 minute golf-cart ride. The beach club has towels, cold water, chairs with umbrellas and a shower area to rinse off. The sand on the beach was pretty and there was no trash anywhere in the beach area the hotel overlooks. The sand was super hot though, people could easily burn their feet. My one complaint with the beach shuttle returning from the beach to the hotel is that it is only offered at 12/2/4/6PM and not on demand, because we ended up having to walk back twice because we wanted to leave at a time the shuttle was not offered.

Overall, the hotel was amazing and I would highly suggest anyone come here. I will be writing separate reviews for the spa and restaurant. We plan to return on a future vacation and are looking forward to it 100%."
2216,Perfect 5 night break,50,February 2017,"Stayed at courtyard Marriott 5 days end February. Was great. Loved the relaxed friendly atmosphere. The staff were professional and friendly without being over the top. The room was excellent, loved the huge bathroom! We had our grandkids visit us so made good use of the kids pool and area, and appreciated the no smoking area here. Breakfast had a huge variety and very good. The pool snax menu was good as was the kids menu. Perfect to sit under the umbrellas on the bean bags with the kids running on the grass. The location is great, right in the middle of Seminyak with an easy walk to the beach and with a couple of good restaurants close by if you want to explore the area (We loved lucky day just up the road).
Couldn't fault this hotel and would highly recommend it if you are after a well presented and serviced hotel to chill out in.
Perfect!"
2217,Perfect holiday,50,March 2017,"The Courtyard Marriot was wonderful. Beautiful rooms, fantastic facilities, pool and swim up bar that was straight out of the movies. Luxury laid on. The best thing though was the general feeling of welcome and care. It was like staying with friends, (only better). The staff were just amazing, so warm and caring. We cant wait to come back."
2218,Disappointing end to a lovely stay,40,March 2017,"This was my first visit to an Asian country, my husband has worked in various Asian places. We had a lovely stay, very relaxing altogether a great experience, all staff were diligent and helpful, that is until our last 1 hour when we had a tea and a beer while waiting in the Pool Bar for our ride to the airport. I paid for our drinks using 100000 notes by mistake, in all 900000 rupiah, the young woman serving me clearly saw an opportunity and chose not to point out my mistake. Chanti asked me to give her a good review on TripAdvisor, but quickly asked for the card with her name on it back when I realised my mistake and obviously she denied all knowledge. So always doubled check your notes because you can be sure they do... the number of zeros on the notes are confusing."
2219,Great tour guide in Seminyak area,50,February 2017,"We were looking for a driver/ guide to drive us from Ubud to Seminyak hotel. I found Nyoman Adnyana on trip advisor. He was a great find. He picked us up and we toured our way to Seminyak from Ubud. He had so much information, was very polite and spoke great English. He seems to love showing people his country and has lots of great advice. I would highly recommend him. We also booked him for our ride to the airport even though he told me he had to charge more than a cab, we booked him anyway as his rate was so reasonable and we noted his company and professionalism.
Hotel was great also, they have security scanners and belt you use every time to enter hotel!"
2220,If you want action...,50,February 2017,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard in Seminyak! Surprisingly great accommodations for being a courtyard. I had a deluxe suite room with a pool view. The location of my room was the best, in my opinion. It was the first room up the stairs on the left closest to the pool bar where all the action happens!

I am a Marriott Rewards member so, upon arrival they took a picture of me so that the staff knew who I was and how to greet me! That's was a nice touch as I've stayed at many a Marriott and that never happened before.

The rooms were clean and modern which was a nice escape from the rustic Bali scene. The pool area was always entertaining and the staff was very accommodating and super friendly! Great music at the pool and they often had live music as well!!! Oh, even though my room was by the pool and pool bar, the noise did not penetrate through the walls. So, that was nice! The gym was perfect. Never crowded. Can't speak on the spa as it was under construction whilst I was there. I scheduled a private yoga lesson in the courtyard and the instructor was great and very patient as I had a late night and an early morning class!

Speaking of the staff, Nyssa was first to greet me when I arrived! She invited me to a cocktail hour for Marriott Rewards guests and I had a great time!

Location of the hotel is great! Short walking distance to the beach where all the action happens. And there's loads of shops along the way that you can bargain shop at!

You can book trips and tours through the hotel but, if you strike a deal with drivers outside of the property, you can get a wayyy cheaper deal! I booked through Marriott to get my double rewards points! üíÅüèΩ Oh! Also, they provide buggy service to different surrounding areas but, you'll have to find your way back as it's a one way service!

I predominantly ate at the hotel aside from two meals on the beach. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and good! I really miss my dragon fruit, apple and banana juice in the morning that they make fresh for you and deliver it to your table! Must try it! Another must try is the taco truck!!!! In retrospect, I wished I ate there more! Soooo yum and super inexpensive!!!

Space was safe as most Balinese spaces are it seems. You must go through security every time you enter the property. Not an annoyance at all! I should mention that this was my first solo international trip I did not at all feel unsafe.

Overall great experience and I would totally recommend this space as the price was great for what you received."
2221,Courtyard Marriott Seminyak,40,March 2017,"I'm enjoying my stay in Seminyak at the Courtyard Marriott. Although the pool area is crowded, the service from the pool bar is excellent. Staff can not do enough for you. Elti, in particular, is always smiling and waiting to offer her help. Upstairs in the restaurant Jul has impeccable manners. It was a pleasure to be served by him. The service at this resort has been excellent and if you like 'busy' then this resort is for you."
2222,Champion Courtyard,50,February 2017,"Staff Staff Staff........Have stayed in many Bali hotels including Westin at Nusa Dua and the Padma, both fine hotels but I have never ever come across staff such as those at Courtyard. All without exception seemed genuinely to care how your day was or how your day is planning out.
Rooms are great size with large showers which also included a rain shower too. Looked at pool access suites and just wish I had saved a bit more money and been able to afford this luxury. I really mean luxury. Even for a few days of your stay would be bliss. Breakfast was excellent and if what you wanted was not there, it would be available the following morning. A/C silent. Only negative if I'm being real fussy was having to walk through the bar to reach the pool, we stayed in room 265. thank you Grant Young you have a great team, look after them each and every one including yourself are assets to Marriott. Walt Simpson Perth WA"
2223,Beckoning us to return,50,February 2017,"People travel to sightsee, to experience adventure and like it or not to show off on Facebook. Our family travel to have a family reunion and because our family span two continents we chose Bali to have a family holiday fit for three generations. It took me a good month to find a hotel that could meet the requirements of 6 adults and 1 toddler all of whom had various degrees of fuss in hotel standards, activities and gastronomic offerings. But everyone gave the Marriott a thumbs up because the young found it so convenient to move around, the older ones found the room so comfortable and the young family found the pool and activities so much fun that it was hard to go out. And at the end of each tiring day, when we were all too exhausted to look for restaurants outside, the Seninyak Kitchen served some of the best steaks we've ever had, seriously. So thank you Courtyard for making our family reunion a memorable one. Not only that we could show off on Facebook and meant it - no fake smiles!"
2224,"Excellent service, outstanding breakfast and nice facilities",50,February 2017,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel. We were so impressed with the helpfulness of the staff. The breakfast buffet was way above expectations. They have both Asian and western breakfast, plus ice cream! Our rate included a massage for each of us which was especially nice and relaxing. While we didn't have a chance to use their pool, it's huge and beautiful. We left 2 bags at the hotel while we went north for a diving trip. When we returned to pick them up, we were able to us the spa for a shower and repacking before catching a late night flight home. We will stay here again if we're in Bali and will recommend it to friends."
2225,Thanks for everything,50,February 2017,"I use to go to Bali often, even only for one or two days, I use to stay in villa in seminyak but at that time I decided to spend two days in a hotel,
I booked are room at courtyard Marriott in Seminyak and ..... wow .... they surprised me.
From the beginning to the end they make me feel special, I had a massage and was great. Food at the pool was great, the staff was so kind
Thanks for everything and see u soon"
2226,Worth it,50,March 2017,"The rooms are clean and comfortable. Plenty of space. Aircon is great. The service is fantastic. Every single staff member either at reception, restaurant or bar go out of their way to help you. The prices are a little more expensive for Bali standards, but you get what you pay for. Never disappointed. There are stalls just outside of the hotel to do some shopping. There's a gym and a spa in the hotel so you can get a facial or massage. The beach is walking distance, but they do offer free transport to the beach. Highly recommend!"
2227,Good for business meetings,40,December 2016,"We did arrange for a rather large business meeting at this hotel. A very good and efficient place to do this; close to airport with many international flights coming in.
The hotel is located in a busy spot of Seminyak hence many things to explore. The hotel design is nice but there it is a real courtyard meaning that it could be placed anywhere in a warm place. Security is odd; even when all alarms go off there is not issue and you can proceed.
Rooms are not spotless and furniture a bit dirty even; but all is well appointed. I had a suite at the top floor with a view on the swimming pool from the balcony; as probably most rooms.
The beach is half a mile away.
I can recommend this hotel for a business event definitely."
2228,Relaxing stay,50,February 2017,"Although this hotel is much larger than we would like, we were lucky it was not full. The room was clean, spacious, with a generous bathroom.
The staff were excellent, as well as the breakfasts. Most mornings all the pool lounges were taken, but if you waited a while you eventually got one. I would not like to be here in peak season.
The bar area played loud music most of the day and into the early evening. Not our kind of music, very 'doof doof'. Our room was just above that area and it was annoying while sitting on our balcony.
Good location, security, and added extras."
2229,Best place I've stayed in Bali this place is amazing,50,February 2017,Special thanks to the bar staff jasa ayu Hendra ebiet havi angga Maria elta for making me feel super welcome. Overall this place I would recommend to anyone from the rooms to the staff to the food A1 quality
2230,"Staff are amazing, excellent facilities however a little pricey",50,February 2017,"We are generally budget travellers however our first trip to Bali with our 9 month old we thought we would splurge a little.

Breakfast is great although some items have been cold on occasion.

The drinks are expensive but thats expected. Be aware the 50% off during rain actually means 2 for 1. No big deal.

The thing that really makes the hotel is the staff, they are absolutely amazing.

The room is comfortable and clean although smells a little mouldy, this has been consistent almost every place we have stayed in bali and is just a product of the humidity again it is no big deal.

The location is good, short walk to JL legian for shopping and bars/restaraunts.

Even with the minor comments I am still rating 5 stars thanks to staff and the quality of the hotel. Shout out to who I assume is the catering manager, we had a great chat for 30 minutes and she played with my son the whole time to let me relax :)"
2231,Excellent service,50,February 2017,"This is our second stay at the hotel. As with the last visit, the service was excellent. Not only did the staff accommodate all of our requests, they helped us a great deal in the middle of the night when our poor three year old son was sick. The housekeeping staff came and helped us clean up, made sure we had everything we needed, and was very sensitive and understanding with our son. The staff was also accommodating with our request for a late check out when we were concerned that we may need to delay our departure because of his illness.

Just as last time, great breakfast, great pool, great location, and large and comfortable rooms.

We'll be back!"
2232,always excellent services,50,February 2017,"I was happy comeback to courtyard bali seminyak, as ritz calton reward member they treat me as special guest.. personal wellcoming by Mr. Grant - director of opertion during check in time... make me proud. and upgrade my room to suite room..
also the next morning during my breakfast.. FOM & FBM welcoming with personal attention. I can say the staff services.. always excellent _ Good job and welldone"
2233,What a great break,50,February 2017,"We have had an amazing time here at the marriot courtyard hotel from arrival to departure. The staff (all staff) were wonderful, nothing was too much for anyone. The breakfast menu was gastronomic, every item tasty and begging you to eat more, mouth watering egg dishes to Asian soups to tasteful fruits.

After breakfast and a big rest by one of the lovely pools, one can attempt to maintain their weight at the well equipped gymnasium.

Towels water and even icicles are provided around the pool, you couldn't ask for more.

The area where this hotel is brilliant, very close to the beach where at the courtyard beach hut towels, lounges and water is provided. Catch the courtyard trolley if a walk doesn't tickle your fancy.

Nearby is eat street (need I say anymore) best foods I have tasted, once again take the trolley there also but it's very close.

Everything you need for a very very relaxing break is either supplied by the hotel or just outside, a terrific place tks all staff. I am sorry but I have no names of individuals but everyone deserves a pat on the back."
2234,Excellent Staff Excellent Hotel,50,February 2017,"We are so glad we chose Courtyard Marriott for our first time visit to Bali.
We were greeted at the Airport with a big smile any many a laugh by Wombi our driver from the hotel. Smooth check in with many scoopon vouchers to go with our stay.
Breakfast was great with a variety of different things to choose from again smiles all around Adi and Ayu were fantastic.
Rooms were great with a fabulous bathroom and views overlooking the pool and gardens.
We made many friends at the poolside bar which was fabulous Hendra and Penni our bartenders enjoyed making many cocktails and beer buckets for us.
Snacks poolside were also great coming from the Seminyak Kitchen were we also enjoyed lunches and two wonderful dinners.
Off we went to the Zanti Spa were I met Ita my masseuse for such a little lady she did a fantastic Balinese massage so good went back the next day for another. I was disappointed I did not have one everyday!!. Thankyou Ita.
Security was very high cars checked with sniffer dogs and every time you entered the hotel you had to go threw security check sounds like a pain but the guys and girls there were great.
It was with sadness we left, but it will feel like home when we return to our new extended family at the Courtyard.
Keep up the good work."
2235,Fantastic,50,February 2017,"This is our second stay here in four months. We rebooked as we loved everything about this hotel.
Position is close and walking distance to the beach and all the great restaurants and nightlife.
The rooms are modern and clean and look out into the beautiful pool area.
Breakfast is the best in Bali with so much to choose from and delicious fresh juices and to die for coffee made by professional baristas. I am vegan and there is plenty to choose from too. Unlimited fruit and nuts and all sorts of cooked food.
The staff like all Balinese are so helpful kind and friendly. Anton is a professional representative for the Marriott. Always happy to chat and make sure our every need was met. Ind it hard to believe this place could get anything but a 5 star rating as it's now our definite favourite place to stay in Bali.
Will be back again soon. Terimakasi"
2236,Just Great!,50,February 2017,It was a birthday weekend with the family. Stayed in a room with a pool view. The room is well maintained and cleaned daily. Staff are friendly. Food variety and options are excellent. The hotel has a shuttle to bring you in specified areas in Seminyak. It is also about 5-10 minutes walk to the beach.
2237,Beatiful Hotel and Lovely Staff,50,February 2017,"It is a good hotel with lovely staff. Wherever you go, they will smile and greet. This trip is for family nor honeymoon LOL. Wonderful breakfast until to 11:00, fit for us lazy person. And the room is also good and clean."
2238,Value for Money,50,February 2017,"Went there with whole team. Every one enjoyed the hospitality of the Staff. A centrally located property in Seminyak, Very good breakfast, helpful staff.

Above all the property is in hands of a very experienced GM Mr. John who went out of the way to make our visit memorable."
2239,Very nice family hotel,40,February 2017,We stayed at the Courtyard for the first two nights of our holiday and it's a lovely hotel especially for families. It's within walking distance to Double Six beach and has market shopping right outside the doors. It was our first time in Bali and I cannot fault the customer service. The staff go above and beyond to make sure everyone is happy. It's a energetic atmosphere with a life band by the pool each evening. The restaurant at the hotel does a lovely buffet breakfasts and we actually ate most meals there. Food is delicious.
2240,Unbelievable,50,February 2017,"I cannot say enough about my stay at the courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. From the moment we arrived till the day we left we were treated like royalty. The hotel is spotless. The rooms are fantastic. The pool is beautiful. The food is good but the service on every level is beyond amazing. I have never ever experienced such unbelievable service and I have travelled quite a bit. I will especially remember and be sad to leave Ayu. She works at the breakfast buffet. She remembered my name and my daughters name from day one. She made me feel so welcomed and apart of her family. I wanted to take her home and be my best friend. I will be so sad to say good bye. It is a real treat staying at this hotel. I highly highly recommend it for families and couples. I cannot wait to come back. Thank you Marriott and thank you Bali. I will forever have lasting beautiful
Memories of this country"
2241,best birthday & new year celebration,50,December 2016,"stayed here to celebrate my birthday on 31 December and celebrating new year 2017.
Arrive lil bit early in the morning from Jakarta so we cant get the room yet. got beer welcome drink (who dont like beer on holiday :) ) and disc for early breakfast.
really friendly staff. room was so nice.
got surprise birthday cake & celebration which arrange by Euis from Guest Relations and Nana (?) from Sales. Euis really know how to take care the guess.
Food was great."
2242,Great Hotel,50,February 2017,"Stayed for 5 nights and can't speak highly enough of the 1st class service from check in to check out.
Breakfast buffet was vast and all staff giving a super service.
Rooms were big with an outdoor balcony overlooking the pool and hotel had a shuttle service whenever needed for beach or other short trips.
Off to Ubud today but will be coming back here for last couple days before I fly back home."
2243,"Average, look elsewhere you will find better!",30,December 2016,"I wouldn't really describe this hotel as a resort to be honest, as i don't feel the size/facilities warrant the title of a 'resort'.

The most annoying thing is the security check at the front of the hotel. EVERY SINGLE TIME you walk in or out of the hotel, you are subject to an airport style security check, with both your person and your belongings passing through a scanner. Yes i understand security is important, however after the first time, this just gets under your skin. Not at the least because of the attitude of the staff manning the check point.

There are only a handful of beds around the pool, don't be surprised if you struggle to get one every single day. Also the pool area is pretty shaded, and doesn't get the sun for quite a few hours each day.

The rooms are nice and modern, however the entire hotel has a damp smell. It was quite strong particularly in our room, and actually made us feel pretty sick after a while.

The staff were pretty miserable and not very helpful at all.

My sixth visit to Bali and the least impressive. In no way is this a 5 star resort. Look past this hotel, you will find much better for a lot less money."
2244,8 nights of luxury escape,50,February 2017,"We stayed 8 nights at this very nice hotel, everything was received as promised,
Breakfast selection huge,Arya was our special person who looked after our every need at breakfast, rooms a bit small , but lots of entertainment at the hotel, good selection of cocktails, hotel food also reasonable priced, also has free shuttle into Seminyak and beach area
Can't fault anything ,"
2245,Escape!,50,February 2017,"Beautiful, fun, friendly classy!

Rooms are clean and updated. Staff is AMAZING! Resort is close to everything. Golf cart service to their private beach area. Spa is delightful. Perfect place to escape!"
2246,Totally enjoyable!,50,January 2017,Stayed at the Courtyard Marriot in Feb with my daughter. Absolutely lovely resort with the most amazing friendly staff. Nothing was too much a problem for them. Rooms very clean and modern with spacious bathrooms. Loved the location and the food truck out front! Will definitely return üòä
2247,Great Hotel and Location,50,January 2017,"Hotel was fabulous. Best breakfast in Bali, Hotel staff very good, had a couple of small issues like swipe card not working from time to time but fixed very quickly. pool is great and that is one problem because its always very busy. The gym is awesome. We had pool side room that was great because we didn't have to get up at 7am to reserve a lounge chair at the pool. The only negative is that they are very strict on checking in! we arrived at 11am and didn't get our room till 4.30pm a little annoying. Room cleaning was always very late after 3pm. But enough about the negatives its a good hotel with great restaurants every where."
2248,5 Star cleanliness & service,50,August 2016,"I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and service at the Courtyard Marriott. I generally stay in cheaper places but I was glad to spoil myself on this occasion. The rooms are great size with a massive shower in the bathroom and comfortable bed. Every day the room was cleaned to a VERY high standard, including tidying up any chargers I had left out.

I stayed on the middle level at the end and there are lifts for convenience. I found the breakfast to be an outstanding buffet including both western and Indonesian cuisine. The staff all provide excellent service but Dewi was a stand out! He introduced himself to me on the first day and remembered my name for the rest of my stay and also cooked me some amazing egg dishes.

The pool is great and has a drop off section which runs into another pool. There are lay low chairs and umbrellas the relax on, or you can use the swim up bar in the upper pool. They have live music there and some nights they also had fire twirling which created an awesome vibe.

The Courtyard Marriott is walking distance to the beach, and just far enough away from Kuta to enjoy a ""slightly quieter"" experience.

One tip is to not tell you taxi driver that you are staying at the Couryard Marriott as they think you are very wealthy and will try to charge more for the ride! I would simply name a nearby restaurant as a drop off location, and there are some very nice ones within walking distance."
2249,What more you can ask for?,50,September 2016,"Excellent environment and services from all staffs. Even the hotel isn't facing to the beach.

5 mins apart to seminyak beach.

Felt welcome at the lobby. You will receive welcome drink, lucky flowers and wet towel upon arrival.
There is popcorn and marshmallow for free just contact the duty manager.

Facilities: table tennis, bike for rent.

High security! Security check everytime you enter the hotel but fast! Staffs from security were very polite!

Interesting! There is food truck at the hotel entrance. There is special carnival (or food festival) on ever Friday (not remember is it Friday). Of course is pay for it but worth.

Nice pool! A lot of seats which provide a bell at your services! Also provide some balls for guests to play. There is pool side bar in front.

Breakfast: A lot of choice. Only can commented PERFECT!

Room: not big enough but good enough for couple. Should be every rooms have balcony.

Improve: would be great if double check the pool towel quality. And quality of room certain. Both had stains on it.
Would be great if the duty manager double check the name on the invoice upon check out.

Rates is reasonable. Every staffs met 6 stars services. Absolutely would recommend."

2251,Amazing hotel,50,February 2017,"Everything about the hotel was exceptional. Hotel located at the convenience area, staff are super friendly and very helpfull, service are attentive and efficient. The buffet breakfasts were amazing, food was beyond good and great value for money. Overall i was very pleased with my stay and although short and sweet this time, i hope to be back for a longer visit in the future."
2252,Service with a smile!!,50,February 2017,"Amazing hotel once again thank you! Breakfast was amazing!!! Great location and staff were very professional.

The free shuttle is very helpful but not a far walk at all from anything. Highly recommend this hotel."
2253,FANTASTIC RESORT TO STAY IN SEMINYAK,50,February 2017,"We only had 2 nights stay in this resort before we departed to other places. However, this resort gave me a lot of great memories. I was amazed with friendly and supportive staffs. The swimming pool is a perfect place for cocktails, sun bathing in a hot day in Bali. The resort is located in the central of Seminyak, just a few steps you have lots of great restaurants, small shops, spas, ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!! If I come back to Bali next time, this resort is my first choice at Seminyak !!!"
2254,Excellent Hotel in a great location.,50,February 2017,"We have just had a short holiday in Bali and chose to stay at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort. Our room overlooked the pool area, we had the Buffet breakfast on offer daily which is first class, lots of choices of both Western and Asian foods.
This is a fantastic hotel in an excellent location. A short walk to shopping, the beaches and lots of restaurants.
Friendly attentive staff, nothing is to much trouble and at all times delivered with a smile.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Bali. You can easily spend time being pampered around the hotel after the rigors of your shopping adventures."
2255,"Fresh, friendly, spacious offering",50,February 2017,"Having stayed at several Marriott hotels around the world, I found myself drawn to them when I found myself a day without accomodation.
I've had some ""interesting"" experiences at some well known brands in Bali, so my expectations weren't great.
Wow! What a contrast this hotel compared to its competition.
I had a king pool terrace which was spacious and the ensuite was massive.
All my needs were met and exceeded. Great water temperature and pressure in shower, wonderful bed and great food. The staff were attentive and friendly.
I highly recommend it and for first-time visitors to Bali, it would be a great place to lay your head as you familiarise yourself to the culture and standards outside the hotel gates.
I greatly value the exceptional level of security with x-ray and metal detectors, as well as car searches.
Grab a book and a sun bed by the pool and let go all the worries."
2256,Beautiful hotel in Seminyak,50,February 2017,"We stayed in a beautiful suite room overlooking the swimming pool. Facilities are first class and every comfort is provided. The delicious buffet breakfast caters for every taste and the choices are endless. The foodtruck at the entrance to the hotel is open all day and provides great taco wraps and drinks at very reasonable prices.
Location is ideal as there are many shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. A free buggy is also available for transport to the nearby shopping district but be sure to book in advance.
All vehicles and guests undergo a security check upon entering the premises which is great for peace of mind.
The staff here offer efficient and friendly service with a smile. The beautiful ladies in the spa provide excellent experienced service so why not pamper yourself. Prices also very reasonable here too.
Overall, this is a great hotel for a Bali holiday and I would highly recommend it."
2257,Nice short stay,40,January 2017,"We stayed for one night after a late arrival. It was a nice stay, but depends on what you're looking for. It's a fairly central location. Busy. Shopping and stores and restaurants close by.

The room was an ok size, but set up odd, with a weird table taking up a lot of the usable space. We slept great with the blackout curtains until the sun crept in through the frosted glass bathroom door. Ugh.

The pool was a lot of fun. There seems to be lots of space for everyone. There's a shallow end that's great for kids. They did start blasting music around 11am or so. Great for some. Not great for me.

The hotel had crazy, and somewhat annoying security.They scan cars coming in and you and your luggage upon entrance. I'm not quite sure why. Is there something I should have been aware of??? It was super annoying that cars couldn't wait in the drive. They had to park across the street and walk over. Then go back and get their car. It added 10-15 minutes to each pickup we had.

Again, it was good for a night, but we also enjoyed the rest of our time at a quiet villa, which we were happy we did."
2258,"Fantastic Staff, lovely hotel",40,January 2017,"Just back from 8 lovely nights staying at the Courtyard using a luxury escapes package.

Things we loved:
-Massive pools
-Buffet breakfasts were amazing
-My toddler loved the popcorn in the lobby as well as the small grass patch and rock path
-Nicely put together rooms with just enough space for 2 adults and a toddler
-Buggy to take us to the beach and eat street
- The staff! The staff are really what make this place special, every single one of them from the pool cleaners to the servers to the security greet you with a smile. They were all absolutely fantastic with my toddler, really I have never encountered such warmth and hospitality before and cant give the special staff enough praise and thanks. Also a special thanks to Arya one of the breakfast staff who went the extra mile entertaining my son every morning. Truly an asset to the hotel.

A couple of things we didn't like
- The beach! obviously this is not the fault of the hotel but I must say if anyone is looking at staying seminyak, kuta, legian for the beach don't do it! It is the most shockingly polluted beach I've come across is all my travels around SE Asia. The hotel does try to clean up some rubbish in front of ts little beach patch but i'm afraid that doesn't help much at all. Really its like a tip more then a beach.
-We were in a room that was very far from everything and walking with a toddler became a bit tiring.
-upon checking in after a long journey with a toddler the receptionist was insisting I present the luxuryescapes voucher which I didn't think to bring in this day and age of electronic tickets etc. So she asked that I find it in my emails which I couldn't get into no matter how much I tried (was being blocked for security I think as I was logging in from different country ). So after standing in lobby trying to do that with no success for 10-15 minutes she finally says ok go into your room but I will not give you any of the included drink vouchers etc until you can present the voucher. I accepted and kept trying in the room, finally getting the idea to go onto actually luxury escapes website, so down to the lobby I go (remember its a long walk). And even showing her my booking on the luxury escapes website was not acceptable. At this point I tell her I don't know what to do I have tried, I ask do they not send you guys some record of it?? She goes and looks and then comes back and lets my know 'i'm very lucky' they do indeed have a copy of it. Frustrating to say the least. Surely there is a better way in cases such as this."
2259,A memorable stay in a tropical paradise,40,February 2017,"This hotel could be one of the best places to stay in bali.

What makes it ideal:
-bang in the middle of seminyak
-10 min walk to the beach
-loads of shpping areas and restaurants
-new hotel with activitiesclike cycling,table tennis
-well appointed rooms
-and great staff-always smiling and courteous
-the buffet breakfast has a nice spread too.

One of our best international holidays till date- bali as such is beautiful and a great place to stay is an added bonus."
2260,Excellent stay with wife and toddler,40,January 2017,"Pros:
1. Luxury rooms
2. Friendly staff
3. Has a spa
4. Kids play area. Turned out to be very useful for us as we were traveling with a toddler.
5. Great variety with the breakfast buffet. Good in room dining menu as well.

Cons:
The locality of the hotel is a bit of a letdown. The view from our room was not that great. The access road to the hotel was pretty narrow, making it difficult for large vehicles to maneuver.

Having said that, the pros more than make up for the cons especially since as a tourist, one would be out of the room for most of the day.
I did the mistake of booking my hotel as a package deal from Expedia. I ended up with no 'included breakfast' and could not earn points as well, as the booking was not made directly from Marriott's website."
2261,2 Couples travelling,40,September 2016,"We had a deluxe king room on level 5 with pool bar view. The rooms were quiet enough and very clean, quite modern with comfy bed but quite small compared to alot of places we have stayed. The location was okay, easy walking distance to quite a few places but because of the heat we always caught cabs. It was quite busy when we were there and it was hard to get a lounge chair around the pool and they didn't like you reserving them by leaving a towel on there before breakfast. The stay itself was fine - I can't fault the hotel really but I probably wouldn't stay there again"
2262,A Safe Friendly Luxury Hotel!,50,January 2017,"Under the Marriott label, Courtyard is placed in the resort sector, and here it shines! Families with kids welcomed, and it is an excellent business hotel offering top notch business facilities as well. Free buggy service on call to nearby shopping belt, or to the private Double-Six beach. Oh, and free cotton candies for kids or adults too!

A modern complex for those more used to ab apartment type of accomodation, with a clean delightful pool within the center of the complex (plenty of sunshine and benches). Poolside bar are excellent and you can even sit on bar stools right in the pool while sipping your cool cocktails at the bar.

Room is large and comfortable as expected of any Marriott hotel. Used my Marriott points to stay for 3 nights, room and taxes all covered by the points! Excellent system! Upper floors facing the pool will be less noisy, the higher the better. For those who like direct access to pool, pool facing rooms are available, but you may loose some privacy due to its proximity to the pool (curtains have to be drawn all day).

Note: Safety of utmost importance! Courtyard have safety barriers in place and all incoming or returning visitors and their bags/shopping goodies are scanned prior to entry. Room safe, comfortable central air-conditioning, large naturally lit bathroom with strong rain shower. However, only one set of bathrobe, slippers etc on arrival. Ample two pins and 2pins/3 pins combination power sockets around! Free and fast wifi (can connect to 8 devices, but for some reason, only cannot connect my notebook. All play and no work only?) No fuss checking in and out. Did not try their breakfast, but our past experiences at Marriott Resort Pattaya tells us the selection will be superb and wide ranging! And the staff are good."
2263,Courtyard Marriott,40,February 2017,"A very nice hotel, within walking distance of the beach and local amenities.

The staff are beyond friendly and will go out of their way to help you.

The rooms are in very good condition and the maintenance standards are high. The beds are very comfortable and you sink into the pillows.

The food is of an excellent standard and cater for a wide range of cuisines."
2264,FANTASTIC HOTEL,50,February 2017,Fantastic hotel with incredibly friendly & helpful staff that bent over backwards for our young family. A special mention to Arya & Agus who where so great with the kids & could not do enough to help. This is our 3rd stay here & we will be back ASAP
2265,What a great find,50,January 2017,"I am actually staying here now and I would recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to stay at seminyak area. This is the best hotel at a very reasonable price you can find.

As the gold elite member the hotel was so generous and offered us an upgrade to a pool Terrance suite. Upon arrival the front desk staff quickly got us settle in and brought us 2 cold bottles of Bingtang! All the staff are so nice and friendly. What I really like about is the safety that the hotel is trying to secure, you have to go through the security every time but it for sure made us feel safe staying here. The breakfast is FANTASTIC too, I can't say enough about this hotel, too good to be true."
2266,Absolute perfection,50,January 2017,"We have just arrived home from our 10 day stay at Marriott CourtYard. We travelled with our 7 year and 2 year old children. Before arrival I checked in online via the Marriott app and would totally recommend this. I was advised when room was ready and could then check in early. We booked a 1 bedroom pool terrace room. This room was option was perfect for our family. Room was spacious, super clean and decked out very nicely, 1 TV in lounge area and 2nd TV in bedroom. Bathroom and wardrobe also very nice and lots of room to move. Pools are great, and the swim up pool bar is the best. We loved been able to enjoy a cocktail and still enjoy having the kids swim with us. The music around the pool is also great and gave a fun vibe around the place. There is a great grassed area that was also popular for our family as the kids could run around while we enjoyed listening to music and a cold drink or two. In the foyer there is free popcorn and fairy floss. This was a massive hit for all the kids. Breakfast- simply amazing
And provides many different options. As a coffee lover the coffee at breakfast was also great. Staff - all so kind, helpful and nothing was ever any problem.
Kids club - excellent service and my kids loved the afternoon activities on the grassed area
Taco van - this is at the front of the hotel and provides another option for a bite to eat and is very cheap for beers and tacos.
Pool service - excellent and never wait long to be asked for a drink or to order food. I also found good and drink quite well priced in comparison from staying at other 5 star resorts in Bali.
Location- excellent, 5 minutes to beach and about a 5 minute drive to eat street.
Overall I would totally recommend this hotel to my family and friends. This place ticked all the boxes for us and we are already planning our next trip with another family we met during our stay. Thank you Marriott for making our holiday a memorable one. We also had the pleasure of meeting John the GM and what a lovely gentleman he was. Just gave another personal touch!"
2267,The best deal,40,January 2017,"Courtyard Marriot is becoming our The choice of hotels when we travel overseas on family holidays

Specific to Seminyak, Bali property:

Great ambience, superb quality and size of room, very good breakfast and above all very courteous staff.

Especially self & my wife would like to extend our Big Thank you to Mr Sila at the front desk for making our stay extremely comfortable and making us big fan of Courtyard properties across the globe.

We definitely recommend this property for family holidays

Rgds,

2268,"Great stay, good location, great buffet and staff",40,September 2016,"My wife and I spent 6 nights in a Pool View balcony room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel facilities are modern, clean and exceptionally managed. The hotel Fantastic however what made our experience memorable was the staff at the hotel including Penny and Harry at the pool bar who always welcomed us with a smile and their great personalities. The staff are all professional, friendly and genuinely love what they do which shows when they interact with guests. We would highly recommend this hotel and stay here again."
2269,"Great resort, amazing staff!!!!",50,January 2017,"When we first arrived we were very impressed with the security and condition of the resort. I have to mention Gita for being the nicest staff member I have ever met she was so friendly and kind and gave us some great recommendations to visit while in Bali. Over all love this resort it's great for a holiday with the kids or a romantic getaway! Definitely deserves 5 stars for efficiency, price, quality and cleanliness! I recommend this resort for everyone wanting to stay in Seminyak."
2270,Very relaxed stay!,50,January 2017,"The hotel is very well located and extremely comfortable! The room and bathroom are both pretty spacious and well appointed.
I loved the service at the Pool Bar..Chinta, especially took special care to see that I was very comfortable. All the staff are extremely hospitable and very welcoming! The cocktails were superb! The pool bar has live music every evening and I loved every minute I spent there.
A boring business trip was definitely made fun!"
2271,Loved our stay here!!!,50,January 2017,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon in Bali. On arrival, we received a welcoming honeymoon cake and note. Was a nice touch. We actually chose this hotel based on the photos and reviews of its breakfast (we are foodies) and can say we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at the Seminyak restaurant! The staff are so friendly, making sure you have a coffee or tea and clearing your plate as soon as you finish so you can get more! Get the iced latte! It's so good. Bagels and waffles are a stand out. Staff at the hotel are so friendly, greeting you all the time. The pool is so good, with three different zones and pool bar with nightly happy hour. Pool food is also really good, with heaps of options. The tacos from outside are also amazing. Close enough to the beach however you will need to catch a taxi to all the good dinner spots but only cost us $4 return in legit bluebirds. Have seen complaints on security but we didn't mind it, was great for peace of mind. The security team are always so friendly and it only takes a second to scan your bags. We had pool view room and it was quiet and pitch black at night.

Small complaints:
On our first night, we were heading out for dinner and as we were still getting bearings the hotel drivers persuaded us to use their service at a cost of AU $10. We managed to catch a bluebird taxi the next night to the same location it cost us $2.50. Felt a bit ripped off and tricked by the hotel driver service on that and caught bluebirds after.

On the second night, we were awoken by a LOUD alarm going off in our room at about 1am. Reception called us and asked if there was a fire as they were notified of the alarm in the room. They said maintenance were looking into the problem. 30 mins later it went off again and didn't stop. They offered us to move rooms which was great but first they sent Someone up to fix the issue. The alarm went off once more during our stay, but maintenance came up straight away. A minor problem that the hotel staff handled well :)

It is hard to get a pool lounger and although it says they move stuff after 30 mins of non-attendance, we found this wasn't policed as with other reviews. We also found guests were using two loungers not paired together in order to get the sun leaving one empty. Not ideal when we wanted to sit together, feel this should also be monitored.

Despite these small complaints, we LOVED our stay and will definitely return again."
2272,Wonderful Property and Service,50,June 2016,"Love this hotel. The best Courtyard I have ever stayed. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The pool area, lobby and restaurant are all very nice. Food is plentiful and tasty. Just a 5 minute walk to the beach which has fantastic sunsets and some cool bars. We were invited to a managers cocktail party which was fabulous. If you stay here must check out a bar close by called Frankenstein's Laboratory. So much fun and entertaining. I will certainly stay here again. Thank you."
2273,Great Experience @ Courtyard by Marriott,50,January 2017,"5/5 - Stayed 8 nights and was made to feel nothing but welcomed by everyone's great customer service. The drinks, food and staff were the highlight! My expectations were definitely beaten and I would definitely stay again. Well done!"
2274,Superb experience,50,October 2016,Visited bali for my wife's birthday with my 1.5 yr old daughter. The hospitality was awesome..the rooms were great..the restaurant food was amazing.. its located close to the beach so you can walk or alternatively they provide transport to the beach too. There are many activities planned within the hotel that you can enjoy. The pool is located in the centre and is big enuff. If I ever visit bali again this is the only place I would want to stay in.
2275,Big Disappointment,30,January 2017,"Stayed here in 2016 and was very impressed. This visit in Jan 2017 has been a big disappointment. The in inconsistency across all services is unacceptable. Staff are all very nice but they all seem to be very junior and few senior staff to give directio. The towels are terrible with some even having holes in them. They are also grey. Our package included 3pm checkout subject to availability. Our son, wife and small son were made to check out at 12pm ""because the room is not available"". But by 10pm there were still no new people in the room. Don't like being lied to. The rooms have very poor soundproofing withe noisy parties in the bar and around the pool breaking the peace and tranquility. On the positive side food is very good and the pool is great and very good for families. Will not stay here again. I'm sure there are better options."
2276,Loved It,50,January 2017,"Came here in a Luxury Escapes package

Places is very clean, staff amazingly attentive, Seminyak Kitchen always hits them mark with their meals. Would definitely recommend it.

The only negative ( and I find this in a lot of resorts) whilst I don't have proof, it just seems the cocktails are watered down

Watched them make way to many üòâüçπ, but they just didn't have the real kick you'd expect with the amounts they poured in.

But I think this is industry wide!

Apart from that, loved it and yes I would return"
2277,"Brilliant Accommodation, Brilliant Duty of Care",50,January 2017,"The Courtyard Seminyak is a must as you will read from ALL the previous reviews; it is exactly as everybody has described. For us, the accolades go even further.
On our arrival, the manager: Grant Young came to ask us how our holiday in Bali was going. I think Grant was very perceptive to notice that I was a little disappointed/annoyed. When I told him that the night before we were tricked out of $110 AUD at a money changer in Seminyak - before we had even checked in Grant had his Security Team [consisting of the most helpful Araiwan and Sapari] drive my wife and I to the money changer and within 2 minutes of speaking to the so called business - our money was returned. We were obviously so very much impressed. As I had said to Grant - I put the mishap down to experience and learning. I was not expecting the outcome that came. Grant, Araiwan and Sapari all deserve hugh commendations for going over and beyond in the care of their guests - albeit, we were not even guests when the ""Mistake"" occurred.
We are so grateful and so thankful for what could have ruined our trip.
I have called to speak with Marriott Head Office regarding the brilliant staff they employ - but sadly we can only commend in this way or by calling the hotel itself. As I do not want to embarrassed these three excellent staff members by calling them, I do hope that this review might be forwarded to the Marriott board.
Thank you again Grant, and your very able staff.
Much appreciated,
Karen and Phil Kirkwood"
2278,In the perfect spot,50,January 2017,"We were here for honeymoon, and at first we thought the added security upon arrival was a little much. But once we got in we were treated by freshly made popcorn, we were told every night there was entertainment in the main hall. It was very much the resort life you'd expect in Cuba or Punta Cana and we were happy to have it!
The hotel is situated only 10 minutes from the main shopping area, and has some great food areas to check out behind it. It's a 6 minute walk to the beautiful water. The hotel always allows you to take a buggy to the Marriott area of the beach."
2279,Boxing day in Bali,40,December 2016,"Stayed here between the 24th & 27th of Dec 2016. Located close to the happening places. Activities were lined up for guests/kids relaxing within the confines of the property.... the central pool being the most active. The Boxing day party at the Hotel was indeed a carnival.
Breakfast seemed very good for anyone who was not a vegetarian. I had to stick to the usual cereal-milk-juice-fruits-yoghurt-and-tea routine. A wide variety of dip teas were being offered to choose from.
Staff are friendly & helpful. The free shuttle to the Seminyak market-place had to be boarded out-of-turn and we decided to take a cab after waiting for a while."
2280,Great hotel,50,December 2016,"We stayed over New Years and had the best time. The suites are amazing, fantastic kids club and the staff are so friendly and accomodating. Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return. Thanks to komang for looking after our baby so well and agus who took care of us at breakfast every morning. Only negative comment was that our room wasn't ready at check in until 4:30."
2281,Lovely Hotel,40,March 2016,"This hotel has a great location surrounded by restaurants, cafes and shops. Rooms are nice especially pool access rooms. Breakfast is tasty with big variety. It's suitable for couples our family travelers because it's big and has two swimming pools.

I highly recommend this hotel"
2282,our bali holiday,50,December 2016,"went to Bali for Christmas 2016. From Ireland so it was to be a trip of a lifetime. what a disappointment. Bali,well what we saw of it is nothing like white sand and clear water. We stayed in Seminyak and the beach was absolutely disgusting. It was my first time standing looking out on the indian ocean and we could not swim in it. It is so polluted with plastic, wrappings, cups and gods knows what else. The beach had mountains of plastic which the people from bars and restaurants had to clear on an almost hourly basis. We were so disappointed as we love being on the beach and swimming in the ocean.
On a more positive note our hotel was lovely and the Balinese people are lovely too.

Prices are very expensive and it is by no means a good value holiday. The price of wine is scandalous. We made the best of our holiday weather was lovely, pool in hotel was great, hotel was great and we took a one day trip to Ubud. We saw coffee plantations, rice fields and some lovely balinese dancing. Things are not as expensive away from the main tourist areas. We felt very safe both at night and during the day and we enjoyed the humour of the lovely Balinese people. We had some amazing spa treatments which are very good value. All in all I would not ever return to Bali and would not recommend it as a holiday destination to anyone."
2283,Great place in an excellent spot - perfect stay!,50,January 2017,"The Marriott Courtyard Seminyak is located on Jl. Compelling Tanduk, one of the bustling streets of Seminyak.
The location is very close to 66 beach - 5 minutes walking distance. Great spot with access to loads of nightlife options, beach bars and to explore Seminyak by foot or with a scooter.

The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside - but once entering, the property reveals its charm. Really nice and much bigger than expected with gardens, a massive three-part pool, bar and restaurant.

I had a pool view room on the second floor. Nice view of the inside towards the pool from a small and cosy balcony.
Nicely designed rooms, large enough and featuring everything you need including bar, resting chairs, small table and a nice bathroom with a rain shower.

Cleanliness is excellent, staff very friendly. Everything you would expect and more.

I did a treatment at the spa which was excellent as well.

Rooms rates are reasonable - I paid around 120 USD for the pool view room. Great value for money I would say.

Definitely a great stay - super combination of an excellent location, nice property, great rooms and friendly staff. Will come back!"
2284,BEST hotel in Bali!,50,January 2017,"Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort! Remember this name as this is the best hotel in Bali!
First time traveler to Bali! I have stayed with my newlywed husband for almost two weeks and honestly we couldn't have found a more amazing place to stay. This hotel has super friendly and helpful staff, excellent service and very professional management. We felt special from the moment we arrived until we left. The hotel is spotless and very modern with spacious rooms and bathrooms. Their restaurant is one of the top voted restaurants in Bali and we definitely had a taste of that. My favorite is the stunning pool with excellent service at the pool bar.
Overall we had the best stay ever at Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort and definitely recommend this peace of heaven to everyone!"
2285,WE WILL BE BACK,50,January 2017,"This is the first resort I'm giving a 5 star for. I travelled with 4 children for 1o days and can honestly say we all had the best holiday EVER
There were a few points that I can raise that need to be improved but OVERALL what a wow experience
Fantastic pool area which caters for the party goers, families and those who sway between the 2. Unlike other reviewers I found that the staff did monitor the chair hoggers and remove towels and possessions if left unattended. The policy was clearly explained to us
Loved the water aerobics!!!
Kids club was enjoyed immensely by my 4 year old
Breakfast the best I've seen in Asia
Food quality and price amazing
Staff the friendliest ever
Free popcorn and fairy floss very much appreciated
Security worth the hassle
Coffee truck.... I miss u!!
Gym very clean and sufficient
Comfy bed

Area to improve
Housekeeping like others report the housekeeping often did not provide adequate towels and toiletries.
The toiletries provided not amazing quality shampoo and conditioner. Suggest byo

Roo"
2286,Will come back again!,40,January 2017,"The only downside of the hotel experience is the constant smell of sewage coming from the toilet and the damp smell from the room.

Otherwise everything else is an ideal place to stay. Breakfast is good, dinner too and it is kids friendly.

The hotel staff-everyone including the Housekeeping crew were an excellent bunch!

Abit dramatic to say this but I will definitely stay here again because of the people."
2287,Big recommendation!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,50,January 2017,"This hotel is amaizing... everything is commendable... big, clean, light, modern rooms... fantastic, tasty, rich breakfast... beautiful pool with bar, very profesional and polite staff, good location... if you choise this hotel you will not make a mistake... thanks to everyone for perfect moments..."
2288,amazing,50,January 2017,"My family and I had the pleasure of spending 8 days at the courtyard and we were blown away by the hotel and service. Everyone from the reception staff , bar , restaurant security staff were so helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend this Hotel. well located and quite with a huge pool. Cant thank the staff enough for making our Holiday so enjoyable"
2289,"Updated property, good service, but unfortunately tarnished by dirty beach",40,December 2016,"First time traveller to Bali and we were there for 5 nights. Room decor was up to date, and bathroom also has a rainshower, which was nice to have. Breakfast buffet has a decent variety of selection along with local dishes as well. Staff service and also security were all friendly. There are also many local restaurants close by that are both very good in price and quality as well.

The main thing that I was very disappointed with my trip was the Seminyak beach just down the road and this was a big thing for me because I'm all about beach. Literally garbage, empty plastic bottles, even dog poo along the beach shore from just regular walking traffic and also from the nightlife the night before as they have restaurants and bars along the beach. Sand is literally dirt and water dark brown from the pollution, and they even put up ""Danger - No Swimming"" flags along stretches of the beach.

So for all 5 days, no beach and we could have probably rented a driver to bring us further north for probably cleaner beaches but its just more traveling and not convenient so we gave up and just focused on the food and nightlife around us.

Obviously the hotel has no control over this, however, they are in the same region so they are also part of it whether they like it or not.

All in all, I do recommend the property and its services and its only fair that I give them 4/5 as they deserve it, but just do not put any expectations on Seminyak beach."
2290,Nice hotel,50,January 2017,"We were greeted with warm welcome. Front desk said they have been expecting us. Gave us cold towel and lemonade. I was surprised I got upgraded room. One bedroom suite. Very nice and clean room. With balcony. Facing the pool. Gym is nice. But no sauna and steam room. Breakfast at the seminyak kitchen is very nice. At the breakfast WIDI an employee greeted us . He was so kind. Asking us if we need anything. Service is wonderful here. For dinner sometimes it takes way too long so if you are starving prepare to wait 30 to 40 minutes.
Overall accommodations were great. So many spa places, stores outside the hotel. Love it."
2291,Great value for money.,40,September 2016,"Stayed here for 9 nights in September.

Check in was smooth and efficient. Rooms were off good standard, clean and modern.

Both pool areas were good, and the swim up bar was handy, ideal for families, and couples alike. Only thing I didn't like is having to be up at the crack of dawn to get a sun lounger, as they do have a tendency to get reserved. There are signs up, but didn't see this enforced.

The breakfast was second to none, along with the staff. Make sure you get it, you won't be disappointed. Had dinner a few nights, and the food was off the highest quality. However I felt The cocktails, could do with being improved.

All in all this hotel is great, used the concierge service, and again the service was off the highest quality, also the airport style security, made you feel safe.

Great value for money."
2292,A great property for families,40,January 2017,"We had a fantastic stay at the Courtyard Marriott. The staff were incredibly friendly and really looked after us, the kids club outstanding and our kids didn't want to leave and the pools catered for everyone from the singles who wanted to drink and party to the families down the other end where the kids could splash around and make some noise.

Breakfast is definitely a highlight as it is a hawker style market with an unbelievable array of dishes.

The GM John Woolley is clearly very hands on as you see him regularly around the property keeping an eye on things.

The complimentary popcorn and fairy floss is a nice touch and appreciated by the kids as is the combi van out the front serving tacos and cocktails.

Overall a great hotel, well run in a great position."
2293,Outstanding!,50,January 2017,"Great service from the start. Kinda weird about staff trying to take photo of my family with the reason that they want to make sure that staff knows we are 'silver members' but oh well. Deluxe king was small so we asked for upgrade availability. Staff called said sorry but then a duty manager called a few minutes later and offered a last minute cancellation. Nice of staff to follow up. Dinner at hotel was nice; excellent carbonara and decent local microbrew. I loved the room- great balcony with sofa overlooking the pool. Tacky fire show on Sunday with talented Balinese dancers raging their fire batons to the tunes of pit bull and Lopez...and for some reason the staff played and replayed and replayed Rihanna about a thousand times at the pool but maybe that's hip. Brekky was great. For the bozo who said it sucked should just stick with the foo foo restaurants elsewhere. It totally worked for my picky eating 5 and 2 year old boys and ice cream for breakfast! Nice kids club; free for the first 2 hours. Popcorn and cotton candy daily. Across the street from two mini marts with endless bintang, Prost and underage Aussie kids on summer holidays trying to sneak booze. Kinda brought back old memories! Hotel has a stretch golf cart that drops you off at different spots. Do your homework and figure out where they can take you before getting ripped off by the fake blue bird taxis...or just get into a blue bird. This place was the best of our five visits to Bali. This Courtyard exceeded services at other international hotels in Kuta, sanur, Nusa dua and tanjung benoa. Maybe we hit this place on it game but it was great. In fact; Mr JW should tell his upper scale hotels in KL and BKK to take some lessons from the service at this hotel. Quirks - you need to go via security mag and x ray every time you step across outside to the taco truck or basically front of hotel. Staff also don't give you copies of receipts every time you sign out for room service, brekky, booze etc. they say that one copy for their accounting, one for them and one for the hell of it...I've been to Bali enough times that even the best of hotels make mistakes. Oh and Internet is the fastest we've seen in Bali with seemingly no restriction on devices. Don't take these things for granted when you are staying at other places. The rooms (both the king deluxe pool side view 5th floor and the 3rd floor suite) are bright, climate control is easy and the fake grass at the courtyard is nice and soft. Love the pool bar, courtyard picnic mats and all the friendly staff and guest (because they also like this hotel). Yoga and other activities throughout the week for free, at least according to the activities board. Happy hour at five - two for ones. This place really made our vacation feel like a proper holiday! Thanks! Now stop playing Rihanna and over!"
2294,Christmas at Courtyard,50,December 2016,"Christmas at the Courtyard by Marriott, Seminyak was a great experience.

The staff were attentive and very helpful. My mum wanted some boiled bananas and mentioned her request to the head chef Rhio. The next evening at dinner, Rhio presented her with bananas that he was going to boil.

Breakfast - good selection. Freshly squeezed juices would've been a nice touch.
Lunch and dinner menus were great value.
Cocktails and happy hour (5-8pm) was awesome!

There's a nice kids pool. The kids club was excellent, the first 2 hours we're free. Also, there is nightly movie session which the older kids enjoy. The highlight for my 5 year old was the complementary popcorn and fairy floss.

Also, every second night or so, there's live music at the pool bar, there was a fire dance, bird show at the garden in front of the lobby.

The room was very clean and fresh. They added a rollaway bed for my son which was very comfortable.

Spa treatment facilities were immaculate. Had several hot stone massages there.

But the ultimate highlight for me was when they sent back my son's beloved Moggy, his green soft toy frog. I had inadvertently left it in our room.
When we got home, my son discovered that Moggy was no where to be seen.
I emailed Courtyard to ask if they had found Moggy. I get a phone call saying that they've located Moggy and we're happy to send it. My son was so happy to see Moggy back.

Highly recommend this resort!"
2295,Family holiday,40,December 2016,Beautifully located and in a very happening place....lovely places nearby to see/eat/run....and overall a beautifully located property. the beach was a 5 minute walk. Shopping was a 5 -10 minute drive....excellent restuarants serving the best food in bali
2296,Perfect,50,January 2017,My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights and wish we stayed for longer! Beautiful hotel everything was clean and fresh the room was lovely and bright and cool. The restaurant was great all the food we had was so nice and fresh. The staff are really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I would recommend this place to anybody wanting to stay in the area. It is a short walk to the beach and Sunset bars. Fantastic experience! Hotel was full of Aussies while we were here as it is our school holidays üòÄ
2297,Fantastic time in Seminyak,40,August 2016,"Stayed in August 2016 as a couple. Lovely hotel will be back again!

Positives:
- Breakfast was amazing!! Best buffet breakfast I have had in Asia.

- Staff very attentive and helpful

- Pool bar is quite fun, always music playing

- Lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance

Negatives:
- Shade covers half the pool in the afternoon, so people reserve chairs first thing in the morning. Makes it difficult to get a spot in the sun unless your up very early."
2298,One of the best hotels in Seminyak area,50,January 2017,"Is not the hotels fault but is something that must be mentioned The only disappointment of this hotel was the beach. All Seminyak beach is very dirty.
Everything else was perfect. Spending a week there, was so relaxing
- excellent service with the smiling staff to be so nice with us
- the room was clean, comfortable with view by the pool
- the food was freshly made in front of us
- reception was always ready to help us with various questions we had about the island, things to do, things to see etc
- Big swimming pool, nice cocktails and the boys at the pool bar especially ANGGA was so polite and professional"
2299,Great stay!,50,January 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the Marriott for 5 days after New Years. Overall a great experience!

After having a 7 hour delay at Perth airport (Thanks Air Asia) we finally arrived at the resort at around mid night! We were both extremely tired and ready for bed! Check in was quick and easy and the security at the entrance made us feel very safe. When we got up to our room, we stayed on the 6th floor in a deluxe pool view room, we were both very happy. The room was clean and spacious with a cute little balcony that looked out over the pool area. We couldn't wait to get down there the next day! We both had an amazing sleep!! The beds and pillows are great and the room stays nice and dark so great for a sleep in, although we had a little bit of noise coming from the pool in the morning, but didn't bother us too much.

We didn't manage to try the breakfast buffet so can't comment on that but we had room service one morning as I was unwell. My partner wasn't overly happy with his meal and I can't really comment on mine üòúü§¢

The hotel was in a bit of a strange place as not close enough to eat Street and the nice shopping to walk. We had to taxi every time we wanted to go somewhere. The taxi ride was only about 10 mins though so it wasn't too bad. We did walk to eat Street one morning though, I do not recommend! It was very hot and took maybe 20 minutes! Ok for fit people that can handle the heat ‚òÄÔ∏è

The only thing that really bothered me on our stay was the sun loungers by the pool! There only seems to be one sunny side of the pool all day and the sunny sun loungers get taken up by about 8am! There are signs around that if you leave your belongings on the seats for 30 mins unattended they will be removed by staff. This rule was not enforced and really should be! It was clear people that had the pool terrace rooms were coming out in the morning and saving the sun lounges by putting towels and sun screen out!

Overall we had a great stay at the Marriott, I would highly recommend and would love to stay again! üòÄ"
2300,Super location,50,January 2017,"The Courtyard Marriott Seminyak is in a great location with easy access to shopping, beach & restaurants. Hotel staff are all very friendly , efficient and happy to help. Rooms are lovely and modern, cleaning service does a great job, pool is nicely set in middle of property with some fun activities during the day like bingo, water aerobics. Golf buggy service will drive you to top of eat street on request, also they have their own private section on beach which buggy can take you too. This hotel ticks all boxes, great location, friendly staff, clean , secure and nice atmosphere"
2301,i feel home,40,December 2016,"i stayed in courtyard bali seminyak resort for 10 days during my workshop in bali. everything was awesome..room, food, pool, location. you just have to walk about 5-7 min to go to seminyak beach and hang out in la plancha for a sunset view. definitely will be back to courtyard bali seminyak someday."
2302,lovely hotel,50,January 2017,i loved staying here with my husban it was a 4 night stop off after a month in austrslia. ideally located for dhops and restaurants and bars. rooms huge modern and clean and air con. staff are fantasic friendly and extremely helpful. cant do enough for u.
2303,Great service,50,December 2016,"Love this place, its large enough that It always feels spacious regardless of how full it is.
The food is excellent, the staff at breakfast are so gracious and eager to please. I love the shuttle to Eat sit and the beach. The pool is great, pool bar !!! The security at the entrance is reassuring."
2304,"Modern, clean + in the heart of Seminayak",40,December 2016,"Wouldnt rate this property as a 5 star. Its a small boutique hotel, offering clean, modern, medium sized rooms - good if you are looking to stay where the action is.
The breakfast is good, probably better a little better than other similar properties in the vicinity. The pool bar is good to relax and have a drink or two."
2305,"Not Great, Not Tranquil, Not Impressed",20,January 2017,"From check in to check out the hotel was bad. Room wasn't ready to check in at 4:30pm with a crying toddler; deep breath tell the staff I'll go and wait in their coffee shop and ask to be informed when room is ready (wasn't offered a free coffee considering my room was supposed to be ready at 3pm). Order coffee and desert hoping caffeine and sugar would provide a lift to deal with crying baby. Coffee comes (bad coffee) no desert for 45 minutes, no call for room ready for same 45 minutes now close to 5:30pm. Wife goes and checks if the room is ready which it is now and we tell the staff to forget the desert. Loud music now starts when putting the baby to sleep. Room was run down, towels threadbare, no hand towels for 2 days, had to call reception twice for toilet roll as it wasn't being replaced. Breakfast buffet is horrible we ate outside of the hotel. Last meal we did eat at the restaurant again as in a rush and they wouldn't let me charge it to my room unless I put a deposit down at reception even though I'd been charging meals and drinks to my room all week and they had blocked off cash from my credit card. I travel a lot probably 2 weeks in every month all over the world, this was frustratingly bad just because you expect a lot more from the Marriott brand. We will stick with Anantara from now on."
2306,"Clean, decent, large enough rooms for 2 people, small balcony to jam on",40,December 2016,"I wouldn't call the hotel luxury 5 star, but i went over new years eve, and the prices were what they were. I had friends staying in other accommodations that were not even close to this one. Not to mention Bali is an island paradise so there are lots of creepy crawlies and heat everywhere! Especially during rainy season. Hotel was lovely, staff were amazing very friendly, they had a smallish poolside bar, but it was good enough to have a few drinks and laughs. The food was quite good as well. There are plenty of restaurants and bars around the hotel so its location was also quite nice especially if you like exploring."
2307,Xmas Eve @ Seminyak Kitchen Bali,50,December 2016,"Just got back to Australia from a Bali Xmas holiday! We were lucky enough to share our Xmas Eve celebrations with Family at the Seminyak Kitchen.

The international Buffet was sensational with tastes from the globe as well as local flavours which we all thoroughly enjoyed; The food was extremely fresh and flavoursome, coupled with the Chefs ensuring the buffet was kept full for the evening! with a live kitchen set up which added to our experience‚Ä¶.The service was exceptional with an extremely happy team and could recommend this venue any higher.

Can‚Äôt wait till our next trip back as this is on our radar!!!!

Cheers Steve"
2308,Great hotel great location,50,January 2017,"We booked this hotel through luxury escapes,
From the moment we checked in the service was outstanding.
Hotel rooms very clean & serviced daily.
The breakfast buffet was excellent too for those that enjoy a large breakfast.
Staff throughout the week have been friendly, efficient and the standard did not drop until the end of our stay.
Pool has full sun all day, which is a bonus for those who like to laze all day.
Only downside was not enough lounges to accommodate the amount of people staying in hotel.
Very Highly recommended.
Will definitely visit again."
2309,Pool Terrace Room üëç,40,January 2017,"We had an overall nice time at the Courtyard Marriott. üòÉ

Check in was ok but disappointing as we wanted to upgrade to a pool terrace room but were told there were none so we checked in and were put on the top floor. The rooms are on the small size. With a fear of heights I was unable to utilise the balcony but was told it had a lovely pool view. The next day we asked again and were able to upgrade to the pool terrace which was fabulous. Highly recommend a pool terrace room even with its slippery slate tile.

House cleaning were impeccable and the service to the room was terrific. The shower was amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable and I was offered feather or foam pillows. We asked for extra black tea once and every day were given extra which was great. üõè

Spa treatment was the best (Ita) I have had in Bali although the location is a little noisy next to the gym and you can hear the pool noise. I recommend they pump up the tranquil music. üíÖüíÜüèª

Breakfast is your standard Buffett and the restaurant is so hot that you cannot stay long. It doesn't matter whether it was morning, afternoon or night it was still hot. We sat on the balcony closest to the pool this seemed to be slightly cooler. Not sure if connected but we did have an off day tummy wise not sure if it was the restaurant or the cocktails. From talking to a few people there were others with the same symptoms. üò∑ ü•êü•ì‚òïÔ∏è

The pool is basically 3 long pools spilt over a level so up the top is the yahoo yobbo pool where they play music, have exercise classes and play bingo and this is where the pool bar is. There are only bean bags for seats around this pool and they did look comfy but there were no umbrellas. The middle pool is where I spent all of my time and it was lovely and fairly quiet unless the kids were having fun which was fine. The last pool is a kids / babies splash pool but a lot of adults retreated here as well. There are plenty of pool balls and bean bags we bought our own noodles and were the envy of many. üèäüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§Ωüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Smoking, smoking, smoking.......gee I wish a hotel would take a stand and make itself non smoking or at least be strong enough to have designated areas. Do others feel this way? üö¨

The hotel is a 5 level honey comb high rise over looking long rectangular split level pools and frankly if you didn't have a pool terrace you had to commute via elevator down corridors to get to the pool. The cheap rooms face the road but majority have pool views.

We had a lovely stay and would recommend the hotel although location is not the greatest as you need to commute via their free golf cart or taxi to Eat Street and to the beach however the beach is close we walked it in under 5 minutes. There just aren't many shops, restaurants and markets like there is in Legian. üå∫"
2310,"Good, but not without problems!",40,September 2016,"This hotel is very interesting. Good security, nicely finished, but somehow still misses that final touch. The pictures make it look better than it really is. I stayed while this was still a Marriott and claimed to be a 5* establishment. I would not rate it 5*. The rooms and bed are very nice, bathroom is nice too. Pool area needs better gardening.
I had a problem when we arrived where I was placed in an inferior room after paying for an upgrade while booking through Marriott themselves, which was very poor quality. They eventually sorted out the problem and I was moved, however this should not have happened in the first place.
The Hotel is in a rather weird location. It is close to the beach but just like the rest of Bali it appears to be built on the only piece of land they could buy.

Now onto the breakfast... possibly the best breakfast I have ever had in my lifetime. You will see reviews applauding it and you will never understand until you try it. Absolutely amazing and no stone is left unturned!! Would highly recommend.

The staff were also very nice and allowed us to stay on after we checked out to use the pool and showering facilities as our flight was late at night. Very handy.

This is a good hotel. Not very much to complain about but certainly didn't live up to my expectations. I do recommend it but if I were to return I would not be staying here."
2311,Great Hotel and Great Staff!,50,December 2016,"The hotel was great in every from our room to all the facilities. The staff were all very courteous, helpful and always smiling like Ari and Wahyu at the reception to name a few. My wife and I had a great time there. The location is also great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Bali."
2312,Amazing....almost!,40,January 2017,"Overall this hotel blew me away. I have been to Bali about 8 times now and am already booked to go back over Easter 2017. I never stay at the same hotel twice as I love to experience new surroundings but this one I would definitely stay again if it wasn't for one thing that made my stay disappointing and actually difficult. I will get to the good things first though. Well priced spa, the pools and the area around the pools was very inviting, the daily entertainment, the extensive buffet breakfast, the comfortable bed and modern room, the Seminyak kitchen chef who made us a cheese platter as we just wanted to nibble with some wine but there was no cheese platter or antipasto on the menu, the general fun vibe of the hotel and the extra activities they put on like Zumba and movies. It almost felt like a club med or staying at the resort Baby stayed in the movie Dirty Dancing. Unfortunately though my room had a bad musty smell you get from water damage and moisture. I asked to change and the only other room they had was directly beneath the first room with the same musty smell. I had family members on the opposite side of the building to me and neither of these rooms had the same problem as mine or the second one they offered me which makes me think there is a moisture problem on the side I was on or possibly an a/c problem. The smell was very bad that when I complained it felt like the reception staff didn't believe me so he sent someone to check. He told me it was cleaning products as the room had been cleaned. Definitely not as I am in the building industry and I know what moisture and water damage smells like when it doesn't dry out. Anyone would know the musty smell you get when a pipe leaks water inside a cupboard. You get a strong musty smell. My room actually felt damp and made it very uncomfortable when in the room. I don't want to put people off this hotel as everything else was so great and you might get a room that doesn't smell so you would never know but for me, the smell was so unpleasant from the minute you walk in the door that it would stop me from staying again. I would need to be guaranteed a room on the other 3 sides of the hotel as its made up of 4 sides. I was directly facing the pool bar as I had a deluxe pool view room. I hope management reads this so they can have a look at this problem. I would really love to stay again."
2313,Absolutely Beautiful,50,January 2017,"Absolutely love this hotel.
It was our third time staying here and it's safe to say it only gets better every time!
The best part is the Pool Bar! You can spend hours here and not be bored!
The staff at the pool bar are great! Massive thanks to Peni and Hendra for making our stay unforgettable.
Can't wait to come back!!"
2314,Amazing Place,50,January 2017,"Absolutely love this place! From the rooms, to the breakfast and customer service. You cannot fault this place.
A special shout out to the crew in the Pool Bar, especially Hendra! You made our stay unforgettable, not to mention, great drinks!
Happy Birthday Hendra ahahah"
2315,Amazing!,50,December 2016,"We stayed at this hotel before Christmas and were really impressed. There is a great fun energy in the hotel, very laid back with a lot of young people and families. The staff at the front desk were lovely and helpful. Spa was great. Clean comfortable rooms. The pool was a big party with great cocktails and music. Breakfast was faultless. We wished we spent more nights at this hotel during our stay in Bali."
2316,Best Holiday ever,50,August 2016,"Wonderful venue with amazing staff. My second time there and I would love to go back. Beautiful staff, friendly and extremely clean and modern rooms. The staff couldn't do enough to make your stay fantastic."
2317,Awesome breakfast and central hotel,40,October 2016,"Excellent service, friendly and professional staff, and the best breakfast buffet- stayed here 5 nights and there were new things to try everyday!
The only disappointing thing is that we stayed here October 2016 and I'm reading on some of the reviews that there is private Beach access- not sure if this was available when we stayed, but was never told about it."
2318,Good Hotel in a great location,40,December 2016,"This hotel is good for a Marriott chain. Is a bit old, however the furnishings in the rooms and hotel are all up to date. The rooms are a bit small compared to other Marriott hotels. We had a room that faced the outside (road) on the 3rd level and we could hear the honking of the cars as they drove by. If you can, get a pool facing room.
The pool is divided into 2. They have an upper pool and a lower pool, The upper pool is where the sunken pool bar is. They dont have any pool beds here. All they have are bean bags around the pool, which are actually great and comfortable to use. However the bean bags do not have any umbrellas to keep you safe from the sun. This pool was generally used by adults, which a few kids occasionally coming through. The bottom pool is the bigger pool and has pool beds all around the pool with umbrellas. This pool was mostly used by families with very young kids and adults who needed a pool bed. The best thing about the hotel was you didn't have to get up early to get beds/ bean bags around the pool, which we have had to at other hotels, especially when this hotel was fully booked over the Christmas period.
The breakfast was average. There was a variety, however not as great as other Marriott chains (having stayed at other Marriott hotels I couldn't help but compare).
This was our first visit to this particular hotel and we stayed here during the Christmas break in December 2016.
The hotel staff are all very friendly and always there to assist when required. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle, however they do not really advertise it or inform you of it when you check in. They have complimentary shuttles to the beach, and the main strip in Seminyak (where all the restaurants are - leading towards Seminyak square). They also have happy hour daily between from 5:00 - 8:00 pm which they do not advertise either (the beverages are limited to small list).
The highlight of our trip was the pool party on boxing day which started at 12:00 noon till 8:00 pm. It was a really great party which included food and only cost Approx AU$15 pp. They had also organised games which were really great fun. As part of the pool party, you also got happy hour through the day (however it was limited to a list of certain beverages - never the less the cocktails were all good). The only down side with the pool party was the food as my wife are I are both vegetarians and the menu only had a couple of vegetarian dishes (spring rolls and a couple of salads), which they also ran out and had to improvise last minute with sandwiches.
Overall it was a great stay and I would definitely recommend it."
2319,""" awesome hotel """,50,December 2016,"Good hotel, good service. Great.
You‚Äôll feel like nothing less than royalty at this resort, staff members are hospitable, friendly and quick to offer any assistance during your stay. If you need anything to make your stay more comfortable, just ask Any issues that arise are sure to be taken care of immediately . It really doesn‚Äôt get any better than this!
I would stay in this hotel if I come to bali again.

i give 10 star for this hotel =)"
2320,Sleepless in Bali!!,20,January 2017,"This hotel has serious noise issues! Don't even think about staying in rooms ending with 70's or 80's. Those rooms sideline a street with a 24 hour convenience market where alcohol can be purchased and consumed. It is EXTREMELY noisy. You will NOT be able to sleep a wink if you stay in one of those rooms.

Also, even though the staff is very helpful and friendly, many are poorly trained. It took me a personal visit and two phone calls to get someone else's luggage removed from my room after I had already checked in and was looking forward to a much needed nap.

There is no breakfast included in most of the online room pricing. The breakfast buffet here at the hotel is quite nice, but very expensive when paid for individually. Make sure you get breakfast included in your room when making a reservation.

Overall, this is a lovely hotel conveniently located in Seminyak. But, comfort and sleep come foremost in my book and if you are looking for any more than a three or three and one-half star experience, you will be disappointed here."
2321,3 out of 5,30,January 2017,"Stayed at this hotel on a recent special that offered daily drinks and a lunch & dinner voucher, overall my stay was good but wanted to highlight a few areas for others.

Service - staff seem to be attentive with greeting all guests and assisting with orders at the pool bar and restaurant although when you have a query it seems the staff struggle to know how to handle or understand how to resolve an issue. For example, we had no towels after our room was cleaned, over a 3 hour period we had to call 4 times and each time they said the towels were on the way to our room although on our 4th call to reception they had advised they had a shortage of towels?
My dinner voucher was misplaced, I had approached reception staff twice if they could still honour, on the first occasion the staff member did not understand how to resolve and on the second occasion the staff member had no resolution for me.
Zanti Spa - excellent staff and treatments.
Gym - great facilities
Breakfast - just ok
Pool bar -not opened late for guests, on most nights it was closed by 9pm.

We ate at Motel Mexicola one night and we're given a free drink when they learned we were staying at the Courtyard Marriott hotel as apparently there is an affiliation although the hotel neglected to inform of this. It would be great to have an intro to the hotel and local area on check in to enhance the experience of our stay."
2322,Takes a bit of beating,50,January 2017,"We have just ended our stay at this hotel we were here for Xmas and new year absolutely loved it . From the minute we walked In the staff here are very attentive always polite and smiling the highlight being when they joined all the guests on the dance floor at New Year's Eve was fantastic the girl who is the customer service officer was fantastic. Special mention to AYU at the pool bar who was very helpful nothing was to much bother for her in fact all the staff were superb . If you do one thing this year a stay at this hotel is a must , the breakfast as everyone keeps saying is amazing we will definitely be back"
2323,A lovely hotel and fab staff,50,December 2016,"Stayed at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak for 12 nights 4 adults. 1 teenager and 1 child. Not an easy group to
The hotel was fabulous. Staff were friendly professional and kind catered for all our needs attentively.
We had a two bedroom suite which was fantastic.
Spacious and maintained to a high standard .
Breakfast was amazing, Widi the waiter was a credit to the hotel.
Anna the host was also amazing kind and friendly.

All staff we met were lovely . The courtyard made our first stay in Bali a wonderful experience üëçüèº"
2324,Best stay ever.,50,December 2016,"We were lucky to stay in the Courtyard Bali Seminyak over Christmas 2016.
Our stay was great and we enjoyed it immensely.
The staff is very helpful and professional. A special mention is the Guest Relation Officer - Ulis she is amazing! Ulis was very helpful and ensured we are being taken care of on our last day in the hotel.
I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who considering visiting Bali."
2325,Just as Good (stayed 3 times now),50,December 2016,"Staff just as friendly, resort just as well maintained, food just as good (bit different eg. taco van), just as relaxing at the spa. We have had another very relaxing holiday and since the hotel opened (3 years) stayed here 2 times previously (always on a Luxury Escapes voucher). If a Marriott member getting invited to the manager's ""Cocktail and Canapes"" on a Thursday is awesome. Highly recommend this hotel - still!"
2326,Definitely will be back!!,50,December 2016,"Stayed for 2 years ago in this fabulous hotel and nothing has changed. Well done! The strength of this hotel is definitely the staff. All people are genuinely nice and always go the extra miles.
As a Gold elite member I got an upgrade to one bedroom suite. Really spacious and nicely decorated. The bed is really soft and nice. They also keep the property well maintained.
Since last time they also opened a beach club along Seminyak beach. Little far from the hotel, but they have a free beach buggy.
Thanks again for a pleasant stay. See you soon again!"
2327,Great spot but room for improvement,30,December 2016,"Centrally located to all the nice areas. Step out of the driveway and walk left for plenty of restaurants, massage, shops. Turn right and walk for 10 minutes and you're at the beach.
I booked this hotel using my Marriott points. VERY good value for the points. We were upgraded upon arrival. The grounds are beautiful and the pool was perfect.

Here is my only one issue I had. As I stated before, I used my points to book this hotel. I was only given 1 type option when booking, which didn't include free breakfast. Apparently breakfast is included in most booking options, but ours didn't include it. So every morning we would show up to breakfast, they would ask for our room number, and then proceed to remind us multiple times that the buffet was not free. I had no problem paying for breakfast for the 2 of us, but for some reason the staff couldn't comprehend that. They assumed that we wouldn't want to eat there after learning our breakfast wasn't complimentary. The buffet was cheap (about $15 USD) and at 8am, the last thing I wanted to do was leave the hotel and stroll around the town looking for breakfast.

We finish our breakfast, sign the bill and proceed to walk out. As we walk out the door we hear ""sir, sir!! Your bill!. I proceed to tell them we already signed/paid the bill. To which they reply ""thank you have a nice day!"" A few steps later, the SAME conversation. We stayed for 4 nights, had 4 mornings/breakfasts, and this happened EVERY morning. It was really a turn off to the whole experience of being in Bali in a beautiful hotel. Especially after the 2nd morning of this routine.

So for those of you who have complimentary breakfast. I'm sure this is a 5 star hotel. But for the very few of us who weren't given the option, this hotel can really be a bit annoying for you. Especially after a few mornings.

This location really needs to figure this whole breakfast buffet thing out. Either include the buffet in everyone's room rate like other hotels do, or train your staff the proper procedures on how to handle guests in a less abrasive way.

If I visit Bali again I would probably consider staying somewhere else. Mostly because I want to be on the beach but also the situation around the breakfast was a turn off."
2328,Best Hotel I've been!!!,50,December 2016,"Been to different Hotels all over the world I have to say this has been one of the best Family Vacation, super clean Hotel and wonderful staff, wouldn't think about it twice next Holidays, many thanks to John (GM)/Tony - Ulys- What the truck Crew/ all the pool staff/ Kids club ladies... no words to describe what an amazing time we had... many Thanks!! Hope to see you guys in 2017... warm regards #639 Miranda Family"
2329,Good but slow,30,December 2016,"I am a Marriott Reward Members, we stayed here with my family and booked 4 Nights in 5 rooms and the 3 rooms with extrabed. The staff are friendly and professional but the coordination between department should be better for Marriott standard. On arrival at 15.00 only 4 rooms were ready but its ok we can wait and go for swim and refreshments and the other room only ready at 19.00 its also still acceptable but when we checked this room still no extrabed and we informed reception that we will go for dinner outside the hotel first and asking to set up the extrabed right away but when we back unfortunately the extrabed still not ready and we complained to the reception but he always said that the extrabed is on the way, we knew it is in high season but to setup one extrabed really took that long? We complained again because after an hour still the extrabed not coming and it is nearly 22:00 and we complained again because my nephew will go for sleep what is going wrong in House Keeping Department and always reception said will check with the housekeeping and the extrabed is still on the way, We do not understand how far actually they has to bring the extrabed and finally at 22.10 after the long way journey to our room the extrabed has arrived.

Secondly, my other family came for visit on Christmas Day and to try the facility in the hotel I bring them for dinner in Seminyak Kitchen at 19.00. We got long table at the terrace.We just ordered Main Courses only and we have to wait nearly 2 hours for all our food to came out, what another waiting journey again.Is it normal here in Marriott to wait the services so long?

I barely complaint about services which I still can tolerate but so sad for Marriott brand like this, especially after the merger and the world largest hotel company but the services slowing down?

Breakfast and poolbar Services were excellent, no complaint at all.

The staff extremely friendly and treat you like family this is the plus here right now."
2330,Great family holiday,50,December 2016,"Love this property !!! Great location! Great Staff. The staff are friendly and they cannot do enough for you, from the service desk, Grant, The pool barman Rudi and the Restaurant staff, Anton, Ayu, Donni, Dwi, Agus they make you feel like your the only guest. The rooms are spacious and clean. The pool is amazing and always plenty of space. Breakfast is included and the variety of food is great. The Shuttle to Eat street was a great service.
We will be back"
2331,Family Christmas holiday,50,December 2016,"Thank you RIO THE CHEFF Seminyak Kitchen Courtyard by Marriott. Rio very good friendly he talk to the guest.

I will be back for Christmas so many activities in this hotel they have kids room spa big swimming pool massage rooms etc. VERY HAPPY GUEST ALL WORKERS SHOULD BE AWARDED NOT JUST ONE EVERYONE worked hard and friendly workers"
2332,Christmas in Bali,40,December 2016,"The good bits: The hotel was really. Room was spacious enough for the 3 of us. Check-in was fast. They had a birthday cake waiting for me in my room on my birthday which was a lovely touch from the hotel. We had the 'Rustic Christmas Dinner' here on Christmas Eve and it was beautiful. The Kitchen serves nice breakfast but it's nothing more then the Asian buffet and the hype from other reviewers. Nonetheless there was plenty to eat, good coffee and juice options.
The not so good bits: coffee in hotel room is not good at all. It took the hotel receptionist 4 goes to get our charges right at checkout- which I thought was quite bizzard. The location is s but far to walk to main attractions and the street is quite dark.
Overall it was a nice holiday."
2333,amazing stay,50,December 2016,"had a wonderful stay here. Lovely, helpful staff, very clean rooms, beautiful pool. We had the breakfast included in our stay and the food was great too. Great location- close to everything in Seminyak- we could walk up to massage parlours, shops, cafes etc. Highly recommended!"
2334,Beautiful hotel and great staff,50,December 2016,"The hotel was amazing!! The pool was nothing short of amazing either. We felt very safe at the hotel. The staff was hospitable( Ari was great!) and were able to accomodate our needs. The beach is within a 5-10 minute walking distance and the hotel provides shuttles(drop off only) within the immediate area. Seminyak is a good area to relax and also enjoy nightlife.

Cons: the beach was ok. The black sand was different, but other than that nothing special. I would not recommend eating in the hotel because it is overpriced. Also make sure you get a pool view room...trust me it's worth it. You can book tours through the hotel but would recommend going through outside agencies due to having to pay additional money (i.e. park fees), you are really only paying for the driver.

Overall great hotel and would stay there again!"
2335,Big let down after the Marriott Stones,30,December 2016,"Stayed at the Marriott Stones in 5 minutes up the road 5 days before. Good opportunity to compare both Marriott hotels. Very happy with the Stones and very disappointed with the Courtyard. How can the 2 hotels be so different? The Courtyard is load, busy and staff so different. Load doof doof music in late afternoon with no regards for guests who would like it quiet. Staff are friendly but just dont follow up. My girl friend spilt a drink at dinner and it took they 20 minutes to clean it up. There seems to be a staff who clean and others who do not. Seems to depend on what shirt you where. Front desk not helpful, just want you out of the way. Hard to explain friendly without the service. No towels left on two occasions and we were only there for 3 nights. Only basic service. Go to Stones instead"
2336,Great Hotel,50,December 2016,"Love the Courtyard - staff are so friendly & go out of their way to be helpful. Pool bar, Taco Truck & Pool area make this a great hotel. This is our second time staying here & we are very happy - rooms are clean and general care of the hotel is of a high standard."
2337,Staff are amazing!!!!,50,December 2016,"10/10!!! Everything about our stay was perfect, the staff at the Marriott have made this stay so enjoyable and relaxing. They're so friendly and giving at every moment they have. We will defiantly be back to stay at the Courtyard by Marriott, and bring our family and friends with us. Thankyou for a beautiful holiday & we are looking forward to the next one."
2338,Highly recommended,40,December 2016,"The hotel is strategically located. There are many shops and restaurants around the area. The hotel has a Kids club facility and There are lots of organised activity around the hotel daily.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Very impressed to see all the management teams coming to say hello to every guest at breakfast room everyday. There is a little cart serving different type of soup or noodle dish daily and they serve ice cream too... Special thanks to Erviana and Parsini from Zanti Thank you very much for looking after us during our stay. If there is any feedback, perhaps the therapy rooms at the spa can be sound proof to avoid noise coming from the pool area during happy hours"
2339,Centrally Located,50,December 2016,This hotel was in the perfect spot for us. Steps from the beach as well as walking distance to our favorite vegan restaurants. Make sure to grab the free popcorn and cotton candy from the lobby after you check in.
2340,"Easy, Great Service & Facilities",50,December 2016,"This was an excellent hotel. Very friendly staff. Good location, great breakfast and facilities, including pool, bar and food.
Room size was OK. We squeezed in an extra single bed, but would have been nice if there were 3 singles, instead of King & Single.
However, sometimes taking the hotel car instead of a taxi was overpriced.
Would definitely recommend."
2341,Friendly Staff; Convenient location,50,December 2016,"The hotel is located at a very convenient place. 5 mins to the beach, 10 mins to whole street of all kinds of restaurants, local ones and trendy ones, also very close to the shopping area. The hotel also provide free buggy to drop you at the location above. Hotel also help you with transportation booking, which is very convenient and helpful!

The staff at courtyard seminyak is also very nice, friendly and helpful!"
2342,Best resort I've stayed in,50,December 2016,Great location (short walk to beach) Beautiful pool area and bar. Awesome breakfast. Super staff especially Grant and his staff who did an outstanding job setting our room up for our anniversary (see photo). Staff spoke very good english. Live music during happy hour. Very clean and new rooms with lovely bathrooms and comfy beds (toilets have a bidet :) special thanks to Tobias the bee catcher and Arya barista legend as well.
2343,Thankful,50,December 2016,"I've been to Bali Multiple times throughout my life, sometimes 3 times a year. I wish I stayed at the courtyard every time. Absolutely love the staff and so grateful for ANA!!! She went above and beyond for me everyday. I will be coming up many more times and bringing friends & and you'll be my recommendation for anyone asking me for ideas as to where to stay. THANKS Ana and the staff I will be bragging about my holiday regularly."
2344,How to make life easy: staying here helps.,40,November 2016,"This was a big, modern hotel. Clean rooms, comfy beds, great bathroom, decent-sized balcony. We had a pool-view room, which was pleasant to look out at, without being noisy. The pool was impressively big and the pool bar was a great place to hang out. Big shout out to bar staff: so friendly and made great cocktails!

The breakfast was pretty spectacular, with an incredible selection of both Western and Asian food. I found the Asian soup that was made on-the-spot, particularly yummy.

Courtyard Bali Seminyak is easy walking distance to Seminyak Beach and also has a private ""Beach Club"" for hotel guests located at Double Six Beach (towels, bottled water and beach chair and umbrella supplied free). There's also a spa, gym, personal trainer and a variety of activities on offer at the hotel.

We stayed four nights, yet only found out about the beach club, the day before we left, after enquiring what the golf buggy (stationed out front) was used for. I don't recall seeing any info about it in our hotel room.

Overall, it was a great place to stay, the staff were fabulous and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
2345,Fantastic choice for Seminyac,50,December 2016,"An excellent hotel in the middle of Seminyak. Normally I stay in an SPG hotel but now Marriot is a part of the ""family"". Being a gold member, we got an upgrade to 1 bedroom apartment and for late checkout, we were offered checkout until 9 PM. This is very generous and fantastic surprise in my first stay in a Marriot hotel. Great service, great smile and fantastic people. The location is great if you like to stay in Seminyak."
2346,Great rooms,50,May 2016,"Great rooms overlooking the pool. Very modern and one the best breakfasts in Seminyak. We stayed for a week and we are going back next year for another week. We have stayed in lots of places in Bali but this is a good hotel..safe, clean and close to the beach. It's a 2 min walk or if you need there is a golf buggy that will take you there."
2347,Just ok,30,December 2016,The Courtyard is located a short walk from the Beach. The rooms are very standard Marriott. It is expensive for what you get when you consider the large number of villas with private pools in the area at the same price point. Breakfast is ok as is room service. Reception could have been better organised. Plenty of spa and dining options near the hotel and some diverse nightlife. A good taxi ride away from Seminyak Square and Food Street. I would not stay here again. The private villa options are much better value and give you space and privacy at a similar price point.
2348,"Great location, excellent staff & services",50,December 2016,"This is the second time we stayed there. We love the staff and the services, the breakfast buffet is amazing. Love Anton, chef Minggu, grant & the rest of the kitchen and hotel staff. We will come back again!"
2349,Nothing really special,30,December 2016,"Located at a small road make it hard even for small bus to reach the hotel. But location is nice, walking distance to beach and shopping area, bar and restaurant. Facility of the hotel is adequate, clean and tidy as it supposed to, with 2 pools, gym, children play area, spa, but we don't quite remember anything special about this hotel."
2350,Lorraine,50,December 2016,I spent 1 week in this hotel and can not fault the friendliness' of all employees from professional security to management and complimentary golf cart to%from the beach my definitely stay next trip.thank you guys.
2351,Nice breakfast here,50,December 2016,"The staff here are amazing,
Elvin and Widi had a nice chat with me! :D
Everyone here are so friendly
They made me a banana smoothie after chatting lol
And the food here is good!!!
Love here so much <3
And the pool is nice, everything is perfect :)"
2352,"Beautiful rooms, view and location!",50,August 2016,"Was there early in the morning (around 8am), however the kind staff allow us to check in earlier (at 10am) when there was a room available and ready for us! Room was spacious with a great view of the pool. Service there was impeccable! Hotel staff would greet u and have a little chat with u and would even recommend places/ restaurants to visit!

The best part of it all was that there is a free shuttle van to ferry us to the beach and to the heart of seminyak where all the cafes and bars are located! However, it is only a 5-10 min walk to the beach and 15 min walk to the heart of seminyak.

This hotel is also very kid friendly! Kids and even adults can request for a complimentary popcorn and candy floss!

Would definitely recommend this hotel for couples and families!"
2353,Beautiful,40,March 2016,"Beautiful hotel and the pool was amazing, great position and walking distance to everything, markets, Bintang markets many shops. The little convenience store across the rd has everything with a very honest money exchange. Best part of this hotel is the breakfast üç≥ it was next level amazing. Had my bday there and the chefs made me a delicious birthday cake. Can't wait to come back. Karen and Linda xx"
2354,In the Center of Things,50,November 2016,"We arrived in the middle of the night after flying for 24 hours. I'm sure we were a little muddled as we checked in. The staff was attentive and very helpful in getting us quickly into our room so we could crash into bed.

As a Marriott rewards member, there was a card and plate of fruit awaiting us. This was a special appreciated ""touch"".

The next morning we appreciated the sumptuous buffet at the Seminyak Kitchen. Over the several days we stayed at the hotel, we were pleased to see that there were some unique foods each day which catered to both the European and Asian palate.

The pool was a refreshing dip after our daytime activities.

I really liked the central location of this hotel. We could walk one direction to the beach where we could enjoy a fresh chilled green coconut and stroll on the beach. The other direction led us to many shops and restaurants.

I appreciated the security at the hotel. We were scanned each time we returned to the property.

The services and staff at the on-site spa was amazing. We were truly pampered.

Our room was well appointed and felt luxurious. I slept well in the bed. We had a nice view of the pool."
2355,Very good stay!,50,November 2016,"Had a very good stay at the Marriott Courtyard recently! The poolview rooms are amazing and so is the breakfast! Daniel (Front Office), Nikki (Guest Relations) and Tobias (Food and Beverage), thank you for your help and suggestions during my holiday. Had a fantastic stay!! Thank you!!"
2356,Best hotel,50,December 2016,Best hotel in Bali. Friendly staff. Friendly service. Best breakfast. Good people. Thank you Anna for all your service. Close to the beach. Very secure. Hotel has X-ray machine for your safety. Best for families.
2357,Unforgettable breakfast experience!,50,August 2016,"The hotel is just a short walk away from the beach making it really convenient. Breakfast spread was amazing! Serving a nice spread of western and asian choices. Fresh pastry and icecream for the waffles!!

Hotel can be crowded at times but there was sufficient staffing. All staff were happy and definitely great hospitality provided to us. Grant Young was particularly helpful and ensured that we had a comfortable stay here.

Had a memorable stay. Thanks!!"
2358,"Beautiful hotel, amazing food & staff are unforgettable!",50,December 2016,"Our 3rd visit in December in a row. Home for us in Seminyak! Kids love it, we love it! Hotel is beautiful, food amazing and staff wowser!!!! They are very special people that work here. Thank you to you all for another amazing stay for us day 2, 6 to go. Lucky us!!!! üíó"
2359,Awesome,50,December 2016,"Nice pool, nice staff and nice meals. We stayed 8 days here and it was a great moment. Thanks for nice t-shirt and delicious manggo passion for my team. I wish there are many benefits you provide in the next visiting"
2360,Great place.. Great food.. Great staffs..,50,December 2016,"Cozy room.. Nice pool.. great services.. great food and good ambience @seminyak kitchen.. You can see directly the kitchen activity, the chef n staff was great..Try steak sandwich, one of the best menu i guess.."
2361,A place I could call 'home',50,December 2016,"Like I said it was a place I could call home.
All happy people... Great service... Amazing food... Crazy music... Name it and they have it.... The people of Courtyard Marriott Seminyak are magical as they can turn your day right around with their smiles....people make the place... And they are damn good at it.

A special thank you to Anna, Grant and John...

I really wouldn't want to stop writing but let me put it in one word... Courtyard Seminyak is MAGICAL.. LOADS OF LOVE AND SEE YOU ALL SOON"
2362,Friendly and helpful people,50,December 2016,"1. Comfortable room with cozy beds and homely deco.
2. Nice pool
3. Seminyak Kitchen food and service was great.
4. Water stretching was interesting. Suggestion is to have this for an hour. 30 mins is kinda short.
5. Commendations to Femi, Donni and Elvin- my boy had the Bali belly. They went beyond their work to make my boy feel comfortable. It is this kind of gestures that we appreciate and are thankful of.

Even though we didn't manage to explore Seminyak, we are glad to have stayed at Courtyard. We spent 6 days recovering in the room and hotel."
2363,Outstanding!!!,50,December 2016,"We were 2 families of 10 people and have thoroughly enjoyed our 7 day stay. The quality of accommodation and all facilities have been fantastic. Fabulous pools at a perfect temperature and the most amazing friendly and professional staff in all areas. In particular we thank all staff in the Seminyak Kitchen (special thanks to Widi and Rai and the pregnant lady who went on maternity leave half way through our stay - their customer service and friendliness was outstanding). We also really enjoyed our massages, time at the pool bar and all staff were courteous and friendly at all times. We all loved our beds. We were fortunate to have a promotional package through Scoopon which was incredible value. We look forward to the next time. Thank you all for a great holiday. Sad to leave."
2364,Always a lovely experience,50,October 2016,"It was always a great experience, service was excellent.
F & B experience was also great. Follow ups on requests was really well done.
Guest recognition efforts was excellent.

The only thing, we did not enjoy was the acoustic by the pool. The voice was average and it i was always too loud."
2365,Underwhelming,20,December 2016,"Stayed here for two days on business in a deluxe room without a view. Location is slightly out of the action, but there are passing taxis. Gym was adequate, had three or four treadmills, a couple of cross trainers and a free weights area. Pool area is ok. Rooms are sparse, only one mirror in the bathroom, balcony is basic and facing the road with a site opposite. Safe in room was faulty and needed two engineer visits to resolve. Dining is on the ""3rd"" floor (actually it is one flight of stairs from the ground floor), and has indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast was the usual omelette station, fry-up (pork served), cereal, drinks and sweets/dessert. Staff etiquette requires training. I was repeatedly asked by a breakfast staff member whether I wanted outdoor seating, because she couldn't be bothered to clear the tables indoors. This was despite my insistence that I require indoor seating with air conditioning. Other issues included incompetent check in staff. Specifics include different rates for the four business travellers, despite the same company booking the same time. Also had incompetent checkout staff who struggled with a taxi booking. Overall for ~US$100 a night this is poor value."
2366,Nice pool n view,50,December 2016,Our rooms has excellent pool view. Nice room n has terrace n good bathroom. The room provide iron too. We love the pool n nice sunbathing area. The hotel location is good n they provide also a shuttle cart go to Seminyak shopping area free. We recommend you to stay here. Their staff is helpful.
2367,The most beautiful staff in the world,50,November 2016,This is the best hotel I have stayed in my entire life and I have travelled extensively. My room was wonderful overlooking the lovely swimming pool. The food was excellent and everything reasonably priced. But the best of all is the lovely staff who made me feel like a member of the family. Sadly I cannot remember all their names to thank them all individually. I will definitely be back.
2368,"Usual Marriott comfart, luxury with best pool for children",40,November 2016,"Clean rooms, great staff and best breakfast in town. I stay one week and enjoyed all the Seminyak restaurants, shops with near beach location. This is one of the hotel easy to stay without long researches."
2369,Will definitely return back when next visit,50,December 2016,"Very nice hotel. Helpful Staff always with smile, nice facility, good location, fantastic breakfast, walking distance to the beach (approximately 7 mins). The honeymoon cake was quite impressive. Good job, courtyard."
2370,Unbeatable,50,December 2016,"Yes the Resort is in the middle of the bustling Seminyak, minutes away from the beautiful sandy beach, and yes it offers everything the discerning traveller needs but the approach and the way the team connects with guests is beyond expectations. Hospitality industry can learn few tips from here . Can't agree more with reviews placing this resort on top because when it comes to service it competes with the big brands; think of it as JW! I mean ask for Sous Chef Patrick and his colleagues, ask for Arvini, Juliar, Rai, Jessica, Batu, Melinda and many more my apologies just missed their names and see how connecting with people is established. Thanks for The GM and the dedicated team for making our stay as pleasant as possible."
2371,"Great hotel, wonderful staff.",50,December 2016,"I stayed at the Courtyard for a week and had an excellent experience. The staff could not have been more helpful and their cheerfulness at breakfast every morning was infectious. Incidentally, the breakfast buffet had everything and more. I had a healthy start with fruit, yogurt and granola followed by fried eggs and bacon. From GM John to the waiting staff and the reception team they all made me feel right at home. The Courtyard is set around a huge swimming pool on two levels and there was plenty of space to relax, enjoy a swim, or have a poolside lunch. My room was spacious with a decent sized balcony. Everything was kept immaculately clean and there were always fresh towels - and on one night, even a towel swan was there to greet me when I came in. Can't recommend this hotel enough. Great staff, great location, some great fun ideas like the popcorn station and the takeaway coffees at the breakfast buffet. Hope to be back again soon. Cheers."
2372,The best Courtyard!,50,January 2016,"When you think of the Courtyard Marriott, this hotel will very much impressed you in many good ways. You don't think a Courtyard Marriott is considered as a luxury hotel, but it felt like it. Nothing like in the Unites States. My husband is a Platinum member. Upon arrival we were upgraded from a normal King room to a Suite Room, due to his status and also that he has a Marriot Credit Card. We didn't expect that the room would be really big! However it was wonderful, on the top floor and facing the swimming pool. Unfortunately the hotel is not right by at the beach, it didn't bother us at all. We basically could walk for 5 mins only to the beach. With good services they provided to us, being not on the front beach really didn't take a bad effect for us.
This hotel provides an amazing breakfast buffet which already included in the price. All kind of varieties, from continental, American, and local breakfast. They have a good selection of ice cream as well!
They have a pool bar, great happy hour. Basically during happy hour, you can get two drinks for the price of one.
I've been to Bali countless time, took my husband to Bali twice (wish could be more than that since both of us love Bali!), but we were really happy pretty much with everything that they offered. Friendly and very warm service!"
2373,Beyond my expectations- amazing!,50,November 2016,"We travelled back in early November on the scoopon deal and the Courtyard truly exceeded my expectations. Everything was taken care of and the staff are amazing! So friendly and helpful. We had a pool view room, loved the view and yes the rooms are smallish, but you only sleep in them. We loved the pools, especially kids area, a big area which was great. And the complimentary water aerobics every morning was so much fun! Our 7 & 3 year olds loved the kids club, was very good to spend an hour out of the heat and we used it one night so we could have a relaxing couples dinner. The kids enjoyed room service delivered to kids club. The massage in our deal was divine and I used the fitness club a few times which was great. The food here is amazing, breakfast was the best selection we've ever had and the coffee was great! Every meal we had was superb! We've holidayed in many resorts across Asia and the South Pacific and Courtyard is high on our list. It's not the biggest (but that was actually nice) but it is certainly one of the best!"
2374,Holiday,50,December 2016,"The Courtyard was an excellent choice although there are cheaper places they will not be as well appointed. We liked everything about the hotel right down to the golf buggie shuttles around the place.

Seminyak can be expensive but with breakfast included the deal is still good value. The restaurant - Seminyak Kitchen was good and varied everyday. The air conditioning could be better.

The staff are exceptional and constantly try to please.

The closeness to the beach and the gym make it ideal for anytime workouts...."
2375,Courtyard Marriott,50,December 2016,"Just about to leave Courtyard Marriott Semiyak. A wonderful experience and Grant and his team could not have better.
Breakfast included which was fantastic.
The pool bar is cool and Harry and Chinta were great.
Do yourself a favour and check it out."
2376,Lovely hotel,50,December 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for one week and couldn't be happier with our stay. The staff are so polite at the hotel and the restaurant, with special mentions to Saputra and Femi. We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay with plenty of things to do to relax and unwind while being close to small shops and the beach. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a perfect part of Seminyak!"
2377,Wonderful Place for the Family,50,December 2016,"It‚Äôs my family‚Äôs first time in Bali and the Courtyard made it very comfortable not just for the adults but for our kids (aged 5 and 8 months) as well. Check-in was a breeze and our room was ready at 11 in the morning. The pool view room is not big but comfortable enough, the bathroom clean and spacious. Wifi was free and the connection was good. Breakfast has a wide selection ‚Äî not totally exceptional, but I personally enjoyed the local food, bagels and cream cheese, crispy bacon, waffles and coffee.

The kids loved the buggy that brings us to and from the beach. The Kids Club kept my little girl busy for an hour or two, and our baby loved the shallow pool. The water was warm enough to swim in even when it‚Äôs windy and drizzling. There are little treats for kids at the lobby ‚Äî popcorn, cotton candy and hot chocolate on rainy days.

The Courtyard is just a 10-minute walk to the beach, there are a number of convenience stores all around, spas are everywhere, and restaurants offering different cuisines are a few steps away (MIURA has excellent food and mojitos). The buggy takes guests to the Beach Club which is exclusive for Courtyard guests where you get loungers for free along with towels and ice cold drinking water. Seminyak Kitchen serves awesome local food and there‚Äôs a taco truck right outside the hotel. Every time we enter the lobby we need to place our things through the x-ray machine. Albeit troublesome, this made us feel extra safe staying at the Courtyard.

The staff made us feel at home ‚Äî from the Seminyak Kitchen wait staff, shuttle driver, front desk, kids club staff and housekeeping. They have all been so warm and welcoming that we felt terribly sad to go. The Courtyard made our fist visit to Bali very special, and we will definitely stay here again."
2378,Not a 5 star hotel,20,October 2016,"Unfortunately we did not enjoy our stay as much as we thought. We found the pool to be very shady and there was not enough seats/lounges by the pool for all guests which made in very annoying and disappointing when you couldn't get a seat next to the pool. We had come from another resort in Bali, and unfortunately found that this hotel wasn't nearly as good. The buffet breakfast wasn't very nice, and the milk they served us was off. I've never written a negative review before, but would definitely suggest other Bali hopefuls to look at other resorts if you are looking for a 5 star stay."
2379,Best hotel,50,November 2016,The one of the best hotel I have in ever seen in my life. Excellent service and awesome customer service. All staff are well trained and well mannered. Definitely will come back to this place and highly recommended. Cheers guys. Keep it up.
2380,lovely Staff,40,November 2016,"Lovely hotel with all that you need for a comfortable stay. We were upgraded to a pool view room which was really nice. Bed was lovely and comfortable. Rooms were on the smaller side and toilet was in the bathroom ( I prefer a door separating toilet ). Gym was small but had enough to have a good workout. We loved the complementary Yoga that was on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. One day was on the grassed area and the next in a room with doors closed and aircon off to experience hot yoga. The instructors were brilliant on both occasions. The pool bar was good and we always managed to get a bean bag around the pool. Rudi in the pool bar was a lovely guy. We enjoyed the fact that we could get complementary shuttle to eat st and beach where we did not have to pay for sun beds. Hotel is in a good location where there is lots to do. Our favourite would have to be breakfast! Lovely food and amazing staff! Every morning we were greeted and treated like royalty. Widi was such an amazing guy with the biggest smile and he remembered our names from the first day! Every morning he would make a point of coming over and talking to us and always using our names. He is truly an asset to the company! Arya was also such a lovey man and we would always get our fresh coffee and lime juice as soon as we were seated. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and the reason we would return is because of the staff."
2381,Excellent in every way,50,November 2016,"Upgraded to a beautiful, large 1 BR suite for being a Marriott elite member. Couldn't have been nicer or more comfortable. Fantastic breakfast buffet with everything imaginable. Service throughout the hotel was excellent. Thurs. night Marriott members invited to free cocktail hour to meet and greet staff. Great idea and well received. Pool has a quieter kids end and a louder younger adults end to fit most needs. Spa massages were very good in a really clean, lovely, safe environment. More expensive than other places out on the street, but comfort and convenience convinced me to stay in hotel. Because it was slow season, we got to have 8pm late checkout for a reasonable cost (20% of room rate I think???). I tried to get it 10 pm (we had a 1:30am flight the next morning UGHHHHH!) but I would have to pay the full night's rate. I don't really know why they couldn't make it 10 instead of 8 for a few more bucks, but they had their rules. Still, I credit them for helping us as much as they did at a very fair price. Watch out for shady money changers out on the street acting like magicians making your money disappear with sleight of hand. Go to larger reputable places that give receipt an slightly less conversion rates. Overall, great hotel at a great price that treats Marriot members very well. Have them call you a Bluebird taxi to hotel for about 100k instead of 350k that the hotel shuttle charges."
2382,Excellent people and service,50,November 2016,"We were at the Courtyard Seminyak in November 26, 2016. Everything has exceeded expectations especially for those providing hospitality. Thanks to Niki and Leo for their attentive service. I got my custom made hot cereal served to my table. What a good service. Soto Ayam was initially a little salty and after commenting, the taste was perfect the next day. We were upgraded to a suite. Nice!"
2383,Great vacation,50,December 2016,"The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Seminyak. Great pool area, wonderful spa and great restaurant. The staff is super friendly and efficient.
The have a private section at the beach and will take you there anytime you like during the day.
I vacationed by myself and felt well looked after."
2384,Great hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,November 2016,"This hotel is literally walking distance from beach, a lot of restaurants and spa. We booked 1 night for a deluxe garden view room but got upgraded to deluxe pool view. The room is quite spacious and clean with comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean too. They have a pool bar next to the main pool which is quite lively at night. However, I think they should have more floaters because the pool tends to get quite crowded during the day and some people just hog all the floaters. The breakfast buffet was delicious with plenty of options including ice-cream! Dinner at the restaurant was nice as well. The staff were friendly and greeted us graciously every time we entered. Overall, a good hotel to explore Seminyak and also just to chill by the pool."
2385,Sparkles like polished silver,50,November 2016,"Stayed 8 nights. The CY by Marriott Seminyak, did not disappoint. It has all the amenity I would have expected from a mid to high level resort. However, it stands well above the pack, in my view, in two important aspects. How immaculately clean the place is, it literally sparkles like polished silver. And the genuine warmth and welcoming attitude displayed by every staff member associated with the resort. Special mention though for the wonderful staff in charge of the resort dining room. Officially 'Seminyak Kitchen'. These are the nicest people you would ever hope to meet. They are so welcoming and friendly, Maria and I felt like privileged guests invited to their home. Adi (kitchen manager), Edi, Rai, Didi, Arya, Indah, purwatr, Arista, Ayu and others. Thank you all so much for looking after us and for making our stay at the resort a most enjoyable and memorable experience. We miss your friendly smile.
The popular Seminyak Beach is a leisurely ten minute stroll from the resort. 'Eat Street' is a little further away, but a complimentary resort buggy ride will drop you off at the very start of 'Eat Street'. Find your own way back via taxi, approximately AUD1.40 equivalent. From this drop-off point and within seven minutes walking distance (opposite direction to 'Eat Street'), the head office of the respected Central Kuta Money Changer is located on Jl Sunset Road (crossing this road is an experience not to be missed). A visit to the Bintang Supermarket is a must. If you can't find what you want here, it simply does not exist. Once again a complimentary resort buggy ride will take you along Jl Camplung Tanduk to the beginning of Jl Raya Seminyak. From here it is a fair walk to Bintang Supermarket, but I would recommend making the effort at least once to experience the vibe and activity of strip shopping in Bali. A return Taxi ride will cost you about AUD2.10 equivalent. A little further afield, but well worth taking a trip to the Lippo Mall Kuta, the most underrated mall in Bali. Clean, spacious with lots of excellent food options, excellent supermarket, a Cinemaxx, an amazing games arcade as well as a sizeable Matahari outlet."
2386,Holiday,50,December 2016,This is the second time we stayed here and it still was exceptional. management more than happy to compensate us for the fire alarm going off twice. Staff very helpful and friendly. The location is great close to the beach and lots of nice restaurants around .
2387,"Awesome Hotel, Good Staff",40,November 2016,"Awesome hotel with very good staff. Good reception area, nice big rooms, nice washroom, spacious pool area. It is near to Beach around 800 m away. It has good security and every time when someone comes in, he/she has to go through proper security check which I personally liked it. Lastly, please try out its buffet breakfast which is amazingly good."
2388,"Pleasant Stay, excellent property",40,March 2016,"Stayed here during our visit to bali, excellent property! we stayed in the rooms that had direct access to their pool, the rooms were super clean and very well decorated with all the amenities one would need!
There pools are big and we loved the pool bar! food served at the pool bar was amazing! the bartenders were super friendly and made really good cocktails! their breakfast buffet is to die for with all sorts of options from different eggs to different desserts! over all our stay was pleasant with the exception of the one dinner we had which was definitely not upto Marriot standards! half the food was undercooked and the service was really slow even though the restaurant was almost empty! it was our last meal in bali so we were very disappointed in having to leave that way!"
2389,Another Fantastic stay at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak,50,November 2016,"Just returned from another fantastic and relaxing stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. It was my 6th stay at the property since they first opened 2 years ago. The first greeting that i received from the security was ""Welcome Home"" with a friendly smile.
Just like my previous stays, the staff delivers the service consistently with a friendly smile, they remember my name and was happy to have a chat and offers suggestions on great places to eat and shops. Nothing was too much trouble.
As I wanted to relax on this trip after a busy few weeks, I had the chance to experience the spa, had one of the best massage. It's reasonably priced and it's nice having to walk straight to your room after a relaxing massage. Highly recommend Anni and Hari for your massage.
I also had a couple morning yoga sessions by the pool with Haryanto, who is also an excellent Personal Trainer, and will be happy to help you with your stretching after a hard work out at the gym. Highly recommend the Food Truck at the hotel entrance for delicious quick Taco and Wraps for 50.000 rupes too
Would also like to thank the breakfast crew: Indah, Yeanni, Elvin, Saih and Adi the F&B Manager for making my stay most memorable.
The Marriott is only 3 minutes walk from the beach. The have a beach club with towels, water and free shuttle provided for in house guests. Free shuttle is also provided to Jl Laksmana where all the Seminyak Junction, restaurants and shops are located.
Thank you for a great stay, Would definitely looking forward for my next stay when I'm in Bali"
2390,Great hotel great location,40,September 2016,"This is a fabulous hotel. I annoyed my stay here. Rooms were clean facilities great. The activities around to pool have something for everyone.

The pool bar is a bit of a party bar during the day and gives the hotel a great atmosphere.

When I checked in here I requested a non smoking room. Unfortunately the room I was allocated smelt of cigarettes. I asked for a room change which was no hassle from the reception team.

Room was big and modern with a view over the pool. This was a lovely hotel and it very close to the beach and the hotel offers a shuttle service to the beach where they have sun beds.

There is an abundance of restaurants and shops around the hotel and one could say spoils for choice. I used this hotel as base to tour the island and it fitted the bill perfectly.

Overall good value for money with excellent service with a smile."
2391,Amazing Hotel,50,November 2016,"We recently stayed 7 nights at the Courtyard Marriott and couldn't be happier. The service was impeccable and the hotel spotlessly clean. We had two rooms (one for my adult kids) and one for us and they accommodated the interconnecting rooms on my arrival without a problem. The staff were wonderful in particular:- Tobias, Agus, Nicky and Penny (at the pool bar & the pool bar staff) so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We will be definitely staying again and cannot wait for our next visit."
2392,Courtyard by Marriott: Good Hotel,40,July 2016,"I recently stayed at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort (July 24-29) for my honeymoon and was pleased.

Service: The service was impeccable. Staff members were extremely warm and welcoming. Be it at the Seminyak Kitchen or the Lobby, there is always someone who is happy to help. There is always more than enough staff members available at all locations allowing our needs to be addressed in a timely manner.

Hotel Grounds & Rooms: We stayed in the King Guest Room, which was very spacious and clean. The toiletries were updated as needed and the room was cleaned every day. The bathroom doesn‚Äôt have a fan/vent, which was annoying and the bathrooms had pharaoh ants; otherwise everything else was fine. There was a nice balcony looking into the street. The hotel grounds were also very clean and modern. There are three pools (one for children and two for adults) ‚Äì getting access to a chair in the sun is extremely difficult and other guests take them super early on in the day. One of the pools was right at the bar, which is nice.

Security: I noticed that many people complained about the security checks before entering the hotel. I honestly loved it and felt that it‚Äôs safer that way. Yes, I had to go through a quick two-minute security check prior to entering the Hotel every time I returned from somewhere, but it only allowed me to sleep in peace at night.

Food: We have had breakfast, lunch and Dinner at the Seminyak kitchen throughout our stay.

We were pleased with the breakfast buffet as there were many options to choose from (cereals, breads/bagels, smoked salmon, local fruits, juices/milk/coffee/latte/smoothies, cheeses, yoghurt, meat platters, etc‚Ä¶). The breakfast buffet also included some warm local Balinese and Indian dishes. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about these warm dishes ‚Äì especially the Indian food as I am of Indian ethnicity and am very aware of what the food should taste like. I also find that the food wasn‚Äôt warm enough (it wasn't cold either, but not hot).

We had a lunch and dinner voucher and the menu was the same for both. It was a very small menu with limited options. Some of the dishes we were interested in were not available. I had the chicken parmesan which was a huge portion but didn‚Äôt taste so good.

Massage: The massage was amazing! They welcomed us with a welcome drink made with cucumbers and honey (and some other stuff). We chose to have a full body couples massage and it was 60 minutes long. The room was really nice and clean and had a Balinese feel to it.

Driver services: we used the drivers that were recommended by the hotel to show us around. They charged about 850K rupees for 8 hours. Yes there are cheaper options but I liked going at my own pace and visiting the places that interested me. Traffic can be bad and there can be long delays so I would avoid traveling during rush hour. We ended up contacting the guy that took us out the first day and got him to stick around with us for the entire week. We also used the airport pick up and drop off services from Marriott ‚Äì basically, a man holding a paper with our names was waiting at arrivals and then within 30 minutes or so, we were at the hotel.

Location: the hotel was located 10 minutes away from the beach (by walking) and offered shuttle services to the beach (we never used it). There some restaurants nearby"
2393,Great Place,50,October 2016,"Nice rooms with individual balcony. Modern bathrooms. Well located close to beach(short walk) and restaurants. Convenience store located just opposite. Very polite and helpful staff.
Good breakfast. Would be happy to visit here again."
2394,Amazing Experience,50,November 2016,"We have travelled around the world and Bali was not on our bucket list however going there for the first time was above our expectations. The accommodation and service at the Marriott was first class. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Drinks and food were all reasonable priced.

Security was a feature also creating a safe environment in which to relax.

The gym was first class with all up to date equipment."
2395,Love this Marriott Courtyard,50,November 2016,"My husband and I recently stayed at this location in Seminyak. The staff was very helpful, polite, friendly and always had a smile on their face. Two employees especially stood out: Widi and Donni. These two gentlemen were our waiters at breakfast and dinner. They were interested in giving us the best service they could. Ariana was also very helpful, as well as the front desk staff. The breakfast buffet was included in the price of our room and it was outstanding. The pool and bar area was set up nicely and offered specials daily. Everyone on staff went out of their to give their best service. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again."
2396,Concrete jungle,30,November 2016,"Stayed here for 9 nights and was quite underwhelmed to be honest. Nice rooms, nice reception area and good pool bar, but.....it's not exactly a pretty resort. Concrete from wall to wall and feels very sterile to be honest. Security is very high at this resort and every time you walked back into the resort you had to go back through it. The gym is good, the spa is excellent and breakfast is wonderful. My biggest fault for this resort was the noise, from 7:30 am all we heard was construction going on from a top floor, we did complain but nothing was done about it. The cleaners were very hit and miss as well, some days the room was cleaned really well, the next day it was just slap happy with no toilet paper etc, this was ongoing and an inconvenience if we'd been out all day and you get home to no toilet paper! Is this resort ok, yes but would I stay here again...no"
2397,Bali yes,50,November 2016,"I spent 10 days staying at the Courtyard and I can recommend it to anyone wishing to stay here as it is a superb hotel. It is only about 3 yrs old so a very modern hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean and the hotel staff are great, very polite and mannerly. the hotel location is great on the main street making it easy to get about.

The food is superb, the pools are great and spacious and there is a bar located in the upper pool. Would I stay here again, most certainly and I have already recommended it to friends who intent to go to Seminyak on holiday."
2398,Great Resort,50,November 2016,"We have just spent a week here and love this place. Ideally located close to shops and the beach and with fantastic staff who will go to any lengths to make your stay a pleasant one. We spent most of our time lazing by and in the pool and did make use of the fitness centre and spa. There is a friendly kids club too, to give mum and dad some downtime."
2399,Great hotel in good location,40,November 2016,"My husband and i have just returned from a 6 day stay at this hotel. Excellent service, rooms cleaned to a high standard, huge shower, the best breakfast we have had by far in any hotel, friendly staff, free popcorn fairy floss and hot chocolate in the lobby fantastic pool area , water temperature just right. The location of this hotel is only a few minutes walk to many restaraunts and massage parlours.i would definately stay here again. My reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that there is only 1 bathrobe and 1 pair of slippers supplied to a room with 2 guests we found this quite annoying. This is the only hotel we have come across that doesnt cater for 2 guests , we have stayed in a lot cheaper hotels where 2 robes and 2 slippers are standard!!!!!"
2400,Best buffet breakfast I've experienced,50,,"Wow we spent 8 wonderful nights here for our anniversary. From the moment we checked in from the security guards to the reception staff I knew I was going to enjoy our stay, our room on the 6th floor was amazing, very clean, a well stocked mini bar and a beautiful little cake to celebrate our anniversary was a lovely surprise. All the staff were always smiling and nothing is to much trouble. The pool is amazing with beanbags to float your day away, we spent the first 3 days chillazing by pool enjoying the yummy snacks & cocktails. Breakfast is the best buffet I've experienced so much variety every thing is fresh & cooked to order. The Zanti Spa was the BEST spa I've ever experienced from the time you check in we were made to feel so relaxed, just wish I could of gone everyday it is so tastefully decorated it really deserves 5 üåü I can't wait to come back it was a very memorable experience. Thank you to Elizabeth for being a wonderful host at the GM cocktail party which we were so lucky to attend, it was a delight to meet the management team and learn how this hotel operates, which gives an understanding to why all the staff look so happy in there job. Overall I can't fault this wonderful hotel. Can't wait to come back üòÅ
Thanks to Hari for the delicious expresso martini üçπüçπ"
2401,Wow,50,November 2016,"Beautiful 8 days spent here

Near from the beach.. friendly staff actually alvin from restaurant area..she's very helpful n care with my daughter..
Vert nice swimming pool bcz in the afternoon they invite us to exercise in the pool..very fun.."
2403,Excellent staff and customer service,50,November 2016,"We booked this hotel because we wanted a good base from which to explore Bali. However, upon arrival it became apparent that it was actually a very nice hotel with excellent rooms and wonderful facilities.

The rooms were a good size and had everything we needed. The balcony was a very nice touch. The pool area was awesome and there was live music in the evening.

The staff at this hotel are really what made the experience. They were very welcoming and would do what they could to make you happy.

One negative is that the food is quite expensive compared to what you can get in the local area."
2404,Good new hotel,40,November 2016,"Located in seminyak , i think this hotel is good enough with good value of money.

The pool quite huge.
The room is well decor and big enough , the space of shower room is big and so comfort ( this what i like most ).

There's small sofa / living room in the room , so i think this room is quite big

I order alacarte and bfast in the pool side. So nice"
2405,comfort place to stay,50,November 2016,"the hotel with the good ambience, warm hospitality and excellent service , The rooms were clean and spacious with very comfortable bed,all staff so assiting and responsive you have to try the Breakfast it was awesome you ha"
2406,Excellent Choice For Honeymooners,50,November 2016,"My husband and i stayed in here from Nov 21st till Nov 23rd 2016. We had really great time here, and very satisfied.The staffs hotel are very friendly and helpful. Tight security, they checked all people who come inside and out which is great. Wonderful and spacious swimming pool. We ask for the room near the pool. The hotel gave us more than that they pick us a room not only near the pool but also near the pool bar and restaurant. NICE!!!!! And this hotel near the la plancha or double six beach.and we can rental the motorcycle in hotel, the price is still reasonable."
2407,"Nice hotel, but........",30,November 2016,"First time at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak. On the positive - great service, really friendly people, breakfast is good, rooms are clean and Concierge service really great. But. Isn't there always a but..... Rooms are small. They are well appointed but really on the small side so you feel like you are living on top of each other."
2408,Warren,40,November 2016,"Lovely fresh, modern, centrally located hotel with great facilities.
Excellent attentive staff (sometimes too attentive). Extensive buffet breakfast offering many cultural varieties.
Large pool area with great service from the many attendants including Angaar and Chinta.
Reasonably priced drinks with some good happy hour specials."
2409,Gud jobüëåüëå,50,November 2016,"First time went to courdyard Seminyak Bali for holiday with my Lil family..

2410,Amazing stay at Coutyard,50,November 2016,"Rooms were really good. Great hospitality , friendly staff and amazing food. Location is really good and the beach is at the walking distance.Really loved the pool bar and the swimming pool. Great value for money!!"
2411,3rd stay and will stay again. A very good hotel.,50,November 2016,"Have stayed three times and will stay again. The rooms are very well equipped and clean. There is an excellent pool with quick and good food/drink service. Free buggy to Seminyak areas and the staff are polite. Food is very good too with a popular breakfast buffet. Or you can have dishes brought to your room. Gym and spa are both great, too and well maintained."
2412,"Great luxury chain experience, no local flavour.",40,December 2015,"As a Marriott, the venue is nice, clean and friendly. We loved the two week stay. Rooms are clean, but on the small side.

Service is immaculate as expected, and friendly as expected.

Pools are very nice for a family with a 3 year old. Beach was close enough, but the shuttle service was appreciated with a kid - all the stuff that comes along with her.

Excellent breakfast with variety for most needs, definitely a highlight of every morning. Food in general is of high quality and modern (regardless of ethnicity), safe choice. Value is OK, as prices are high. But please don't have all your meals here. ;)

What let us down is the lack of local flavour, hence minus one dot. The luxury is very generic and non-balinese. Why?"
2413,Great service great location great food and great,50,November 2016,"Stayed for 6 nights and it was excellent experience. Great location in Seminyak, lots of restaurants, bars, exchange, spas around. Great experience started from checkin to checkout. Staff are very friendly, polite, and smiling all the time, from the reception, restaurant (Seminyak Kitchen), housekeeping, and to pool bar, etc. The breakfast is very good. Lots of choices of food and different types of food also. The juice and coffee are great. Bed is very comfortable and room is big, nice, and clean. Recognized the gold status and got upgraded to suite room. Wifi works very fast and perfectly around hotel area. They even sent me a birthday card and a cake on my birthday. Very nice and kind! Have security check each time when you enter the hotel, very safe. In total it was a excellent stay."
2414,A quick birthday trip,50,November 2016,"Just stayed here for the last 5 nights, very helpful and polite staff at check in. Nice clean spacious room
Lovely cool pool and bar area.
A nice surprise in our room when we got back from shopping today a very tasty birthday cake thank you
We'll be back"
2415,Great Place to Stay,50,October 2016,"This is a magnificent resort, we loved every aspect of it from reception to the swim up bar. The best breakfast a well.. we will stay again very soon. The ground floor rooms are the one's to go for with access to the pool."
2416,Always good to be back!,50,November 2016,"This time we got rooms facing the entrance. Soundproofing is good so no noise from the road. Enjoyed having coffee at the balcony watching the traffic on the road.

Rooms : Comfortable like the conveniently located plug points for charging our phones. The cupboard inside the bathroom is a great convenience.

Food - The coffeeshop is great for breakfasts.

Service : Attentive at all times. Buggy drops to beach, shopping are a big + for me.

Pool : Love the pool and its big enough for a busy hotel. Lots of lounging area by the pool and a bar nearby."
2417,Excellent facilities and great for kids,50,November 2016,"We had two interconnecting rooms with great views of the pool. Breakfast is the best I've had in 7 trips around Asia over the past 6 years. Rooms are very clean, pool bar great with a 3hr happy hour every day - although no umbrellas to keep from the sun at the pool bar area (there are around the remaining pool areas). Importantly, security is top notch with no exceptions and the staff very friendly so we always felt our kids very safe. Besides, the free popcorn and candy floss was a winner for them - as was the ice cream at breakfast. A short buggy ride gets you to a great beach. Highly recommended!"
2418,"Comfortable, clean, and up to date",50,October 2016,"I stayed here after arriving on a VERY early morning flight. The hotel was very accommodating to let me check in early. The room was modern and in great condition (I have seen many chain hotels which are not as well kept-up)

The pool side-room was a little loud during the day due to music, and the pool area could be quite crowded. Despite this, it was fabulous to nap on a floating pillow in the pool

I would happily stay here again."
2419,Good value and excellent location,50,November 2016,"This is my third stay at the Courtyard Marriott in busy Seminyak. Although it is 200-300 metres from the beach there is a beautiful pool area and lovely gardens.
Staff offer excellent service and are always smiling.
A very safe and secure hotel."
2420,Enjoyable and comfortable,50,October 2016,"We stayed for 8 nights and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. We had a garden facing room which is very important as the streets are chaotic!! The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. Our room was cleaned daily and the beds were very comfortable. We stayed with our family and had adjoining rooms which was very convenient
Breakfast was amazing!!! We also had a seafood buffet one evening. The manager of the restaurant personally picked a selection for us from the grill and it was delicious and reasonably priced.
Loved the pools and the poolside bar.
Also had 2 massages in the Spa and they were very good."
2421,Good service and location,30,November 2016,"The best thing about this hotel is the location ( near the beach, and several good shopping areas in Seminyak) as well as good service at the front desk and overall from the staff.

However, I belive this hotel suites families and/ or people that are not looking for a quite and autentic balinise experience. For us this experience was okey,but if we were to choose again we would rather stay a place where we could experience Bali, and not feel that we were in some hotel in Austrailia.

A major minus was the extreme noice during breakfast. I have seen people commenting on this before so the hotel should see if there is any possibilities to reduce this noice. However come earlie like 0730 and you will be fine. We also missed more healthy options, but know that the majority likes waffals and chocolate so this is just our opinion.

A tip to the hotel: we saw so many people stealing food during breakfast. They broght big containers that they filled for their lunch meal for their family. I was shocked when I saw this. You should hang a sing about this if this is not acceptable, as we saw people doing this every day for 12 days.

A major plus was the gym. Just amzing! We used it everyday and it had everything you needed. Both for cardio and strength exercises. They also had a video screen showing suggestions for workout routine this was truly a great idea and I saw so many guests besides me using this.

Overall.. nothing wrong with the hotel, it is just a bit unpersonal for our taste and especially as we came all they way for Europe. I do however belive that Australian families just looking to get some sun and drinks would enjoy this stay."
2422,Staff Excellence,40,July 2016,"A couple of months ago my wife and I together with another couple had the pleasure of staying at the Courtyard Seminyak. The staff from John the manager, Prisi his understudy down to the cleaners cannot be faulted. They make you welcome and feel like one of the family whilst looking after your every need with a smile as big as the Sydney Heads. Once again thank you for the experience."
2423,Best Courtyard I've visited,50,October 2016,This is not your typical Courtyard. There are more amenities than usual. The pool bar is great as well as the pool. The rooms are comfortable & clean. The staff is friendly. The breakfast buffet was great & included with the room. Required to go through a metal detector when entering the hotel. The only negative is the distance to the beach. It is a walk & I never found the location for the Courtyard.
2424,Excellent service,50,November 2016,"First time stayed at this hotel. All the staff are friendly, warm, welcome and so helpful. Me and my husband would like to say thank u to Ibu Agustine/duty manager who set up our room so special, she put some cake and honeymoon greeting card for welcoming and blessing us.
All the staff at seminyak kitchen are friendly. Specially for ""Elvin-trainee, Agus-supervisor"" who made our breakfast so enjoyed.
We'll back soon and for sure will stay at this hotel. So lovely."
2425,Great stay,50,October 2016,"We visited on a deal which was fantastic as we would not have stayed here otherwise. And the included extras allowed us to stay longer at the hotel during the day.
Rooms were clean, staff were friendly, it was highly noticeable the management made an effort to chat with guests during the day.
Yes the day beds fill up quickly but staff try to clear the beds if not being used which was great. However with a group of 6 and 2 toddlers we spent most of the day at the bottom kids pool playing which was not as busy and quiet.
Pool side snacks and kids room were great. Only suggestion would be to add some grassed area for kids to kick a ball or play equipment aside from the pool.
They try to offer something for everyone which is noticed.
Also need to mention What The Truck which is a great food option to tie you over from the amazing buffet breakfast to dinner!"
2426,Beautiful Hotel Great Staff,50,November 2016,"Hotel staff are amazing. They great you by name. Engage in conversation. Anton is the Best!! They all are really. Helpful and friendly. Beautiful big smiles.

The rooms are a good size clean comfortable. Great shower.

Huge pool with wonderful floats to relax on. Bar area around the pool.
Good variety in the breakfast bar.
Delicious cocktails.
And I looove the press for service button's around the pool.

Excellent hotel in a good location."
2427,Courtyard Marriott Seminyak.,40,November 2016,"I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for 7 nights.

The first night we arrived late and were placed in a room which the balcony looked out onto what could only be described as rubbish tip.

The next morning we mentioned to the manager on duty that we had been told our room was pool facing and we were really disappointed with the view. We were upgraded to a room over looking to pool which was truly beautiful.

This hotel is like a little paradise surrounded by chaos on the streets outside.

The food was fantastic, staff were very friendly, security was very high.

The beds were comfortable and rooms stylish, modern and clean.

The hotel is not on the beach but is only a short walk, there is also a buggy they use to take you there if you don't want to walk.

I would definitely go back and stay here, but can't stress enough to make sure the room is inward facing, this would be a big deal breaker for me."
2428,First time to Bali and will be back!,50,November 2016,"After spending 10 nights here, I cannot recommend this Resort enough! A very clean Resort from our room, to the lobby and pool areas. Staff are delightful and always take the time to smile and say hello.

We stayed in a Deluxe King room and were on Level 5. The rooms are generous in size, you don't feel cramped (the photos do not do it justice) and there is a big bathroom space including a huge shower!

There is a complimentary buggy that runs to Eat St (most popular area for shopping and restaurants) and the resort's private beach club. This beach club is equipped with lounges, umbrellas and a staff member who provides complimentary cold water and fruity ice blocks. The buggy does three pick ups a day at the beach club back to the resort.

We walked everywhere, only taking a taxi once back to the Resort from Eat St when it was raining. It's about a 25 minute walk to/from Eat St and 7 minute walk to the beach, but there are an abundance of taxis if you don't want to walk.

The pool and pool bar are fantastic, very luxurious. Sometimes we stayed by the pool all day and ordered food from the hotel menu. Great food, reasonably priced. The pool bar also has happy hour from 5.00-8.00pm every day with live music.

The Seminyak Kitchen was great, we had breakfast there every day (a very big selection of Asian and Western food and pastries, and egg station and coffee/tea to order). Definitely recommend getting breakfast included in your stay.

During our stay the fire alarm momentarily went off accidentally at 6.00am. Later that day the staff then personally delivered apology fruit bowls to everyone for their mistake, another example of fantastic customer service!

My partner fell and grazed his leg at the Resort and the staff were very attentive getting antiseptic, ice, and bandages to fix the wound.

We used the Airport Transfer service back to the airport. It cost 350,000 IRD ($35 AUD) and recommend it over a taxi which we used to get to the Resort. Clean, cool and a safe driver!

This Resort was by far one of the best I have ever stayed in, and definitely has persuaded us to come back to Bali. Based on this experience, we will be looking to book with Marriott when we travel abroad again. You won't regret staying here!"
2429,"Great location, friendly staffs and excellent pools",50,November 2016,"I am traveler from Singapore and as Marriott Gold member, I had stayed in many other Marriott property and this is one of the great property. I hardly leave the hotel but just enjoying the pool at the door steps and the great hotel services throughout my stay. It is great just doing nothing but relaxing by the pool."
2430,Great hotel in central location,40,November 2016,"Find the comfort of home away from home at the Courtyard Marriot in Seminyak, while not on the main road near the Seminyak square, as you step out there are plenty of shops, restaurants and spas, plus the cheap taxis make it easy going anywhere from here. The rooms are big, comfortable and with a nice d√©cor reflecting the local culture in a subtle way. The staff has been friendly helpful and pleasant all the time, special thanks for Tiko in reception, and the guys at the pool always willing to go the extra mile and lovely to talk to. Would definitely recommend using this hotel if in the area. Also if you are not big on breakfast you can have nice coffee and Danish pastries from the truck outside the hotel, the guys at What the Truck always friendly and with a smile any time of the day, must try their tacos and burritos!"
2431,Awesome stay,50,November 2016,We had a great time. The kids enjoyed the pool and their time at the kids club. The breakfast was good with good selection of menu. Staff service was excellent especially Elvin. We Enjoyed our stay there.
2432,Hotel review,40,October 2016,"This hotel was booked last minute. Location, hotel, cleanliness, staff, pool, shuttle service all great. Really close to the beach and shops. I would return to that part of Bali and that hotel again. My favourite accommodation in Bali. Thanks"
2433,Excellence at its very Best,50,November 2016,"First Class operation
From the bell desk, front check in all the restaurant and service staff housekeeping staff grounds and maintenance staff
Even the head of the financial department was engaging with customers on a daily basis along with all senior management. We especially liked to see interns at all levels being trained in such a professional manner. One of the top 5 Best experiences at both the restaurant,(food and beverage operations) and hotel of any Marriott property we have stayed at the last 40 years. This hotel is run like a Ritz Carlton The whole organization top to bottom clearly understands the Attitude and Actions of Service Quality Cleanliness and OUTSTANDING Hospitality !!!!!!!!
Alit in housekeeping always a smile and prompt response to any requested
The young women on the front desk checkin who brought us up to our room and truly showed us an Outstanding Marriott Court Yard welcome explaining all aspects of the facilities,surronding area of the hotel and staff.(She will be in Mgt.soon)

2434,Hotel Paling Ramah,50,November 2016,"The first time staying here , hotel Near shopping areas , enough facilities , good food, good taste and innovative . The front officer very helpful and very quickly in working , which makes it easy for in the process of check in . All the waiters responsive to what has been a request . The hotel best of its class to affairs of service .

Thank you Mr. Daniel, Mrs Saih And the all employe, i am feeling stay at home and i want stay at here for a long time."
2435,Short Seminyak stay,40,November 2016,"From first arrival, the staff were friendly and the hotel was great. Our room was a deluxe pool view studio with a small balcony overlooking the pool. The pool dominates the interior space surrounded on all sides, but unlike some this pool and the loungers get sun all day. There is a swim up bar at one end and a kids play area at the other.

Seminyak Kitchen for breakfast is a must!

The massage centre was very nice, with a variety of styles and prices but a pity about the pool noise Intruding on the ambiance. There is a gym also with treadmills, steppers, stair climbers and even free weights.
Security was paramount, which was reassuring but onerous, having to go through detectors on every return.

This hotel is at the Southern end of Seminyak so it's best to take a cab to Seminyak Square and other shopping areas. It is close to the beach, shopping and some great restaurants."
2436,Love it,50,October 2016,"First time stay at this hotel, staff is very friendly, they have vallet service to every guest who stay, room is clean, neat, my son is happy to explore everything in the room, pool is great they have separate pool for children and adult, they even served ice cream to every guest at the pool for free..at night you can walk near by the hotel to find good food or even club to party (when we walk at nite we see a view club around the hotel)
Breakfast is superb, we love it so much."
2437,Great Location.....,40,October 2016,"Stayed for 5 nights in October 2016, and a Bintang on arrival in the hotel lobby...
Be aware of the number of sunbeds available around the pool, I counted approx 100 in total and the hotel can accommodate 336 guests!! also there is no other space to sit around the pool either if the beds are taken.
That said we used the courtesy golf buggy most days for a return lift to the private hotel beach area as we could not get around the pool, this was a great location with bars around you for lunch and a drink if required.
Great location to explore restaurants around and again a free buggy ride to ""Eat Street"" is a great idea.
First room we were put in was not clean and dirty along with dirty bed linen, moved rooms the same night and what a difference between the 2!!
Breakfasts were very good with a huge choice.
No recognition of SPG Preferred Guest even though they keep advertising the merger with Marriott everywhere in the hotel?
Great staff all around the hotel and friendly service, gym was always busy and not enough equipment, if you like that sort of thing.
Overall....probably not go back but can see why a lot of people like it there."
2438,Amazing Stays again!,50,November 2016,"Thanks again to Marriott - Couryard Seminyak for never fail to provides excellent service for my stay at the hotel. My room was spacious and just opposite the pool, too bad I did not have the chance to enjoy the pool.

Thanks to Chinta of the Poolside Lounge for her excellent customer service. She remembers me! as my last visit was about 2 years back. I feel sense of belonging is there the moment the hotel staff remembers you and your drinks.

To the rest - Andrew and Augustine of FO, thanks to you guys too!

Regards,
Loyal Marriott Member"
2439,"Beautiful hotel, great location and value!",40,October 2016,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at this hotel and were very impressed. The property was attractive and clean and the staff was very kind and friendly. We had a great view of the large pool that is in the center of the courtyard and loved our room. The AC worked great, wifi was quick, and the shower was so spacious with a great waterfall shower head. We enjoyed the pool, happy hour at the bar, and best of all was the breakfast buffet. There was so much variety and we enjoyed having a great meal to start off each day. The hotel is in walking distance of many shops and restaurants in Seminyak. Since we are Silver members in the Marriott Rewards program, we were provided nice fruit and macaroons in our room which was a very nice touch. One other nice thing to note is that the lobby offers free popcorn and cotton candy daily for a tasty snack if you are walking by. We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to others. The quality, price, and location were great and consistent with what we expect with the Marriott brand."
2440,Great atmosphere,40,October 2016,"This is our 2nd stay at this hotel & this stay we were with 3 other couples & purchased the Scoopon Deal. The hotel was brand new when we 1st visited & a lot quieter. We found the deal to be great & utilised the pool area much more this visit. Free massage really good & lunch in Seminyak kitchen nice. We used our Dinner voucher for seafood night but a little disappointed with the seafood it was fairly tasteless although adequate portions. Rooms are clean & bed comfortable only problem the room itself is fairly small as is bathroom area although this doesn't bother us too much as we tend to spend very little time in room. The breakfasts are fantastic with such a wide variety to choose from. Found it hard to go past the eggs benedict. The location of this hotel is a highlight being 5 min walk to beach or buggy ride to their own beach club. They provide free water, ice-blocks, fruit & their own shower to rinse off. Buggy takes you back when you are finished. No charge for beach chairs. Beach was beautiful during our stay. Would recommend this hotel for an affordable mid-range stay."
2441,Excellent resort,50,October 2016,We stayed at the Courtyard for 3 days in October. We were greatly impressed by how friendly and accommodating the staff were. We had a fantastic experience. Clean hotel rooms that are serviced everyday. We had a room overlooking the pool which was worth it. Breakfast buffet was a hit. Certainly wouldn't hesitate to return to this resort if we travel to Bali again.
2442,Outstanding!,50,October 2016,"Couldn't fault anything! Location, cleanliness, attentive staff (including management) the happy atmosphere by the pool, breakfast and all meals, cocktails... the list goes on... all excellent and made our 25th wedding anniversary honeymoon üòÄ very special and memorable."
2443,Great position,40,October 2016,"Family of 5 stayed at the Courtyard for 8 nights. Room was well appointed although it was a bit small and the wardrobe space could have been more spacious. We had 2 deluxe poolview rooms with a balcony overlooking the pool. The pool itself was great and the water temp was good. Quite often in Bali the pool is like pea soup, way to warm. This was not the case at the Courtyard, Breakfast was excellent, everything you could want. The pool bar was a great spot for cocktails and snacks.
The spa was very relaxing and enjoyable. Walking distance to the beach and a short cab ride to Eat Street. All in all we had a most enjoyable stay."
2444,Loved the Courtyard Seminyak,50,October 2016,"We stayed 10 days and could not fault the hotel. Staff, security, food, pool and location were all excellent.
We had a room overlooking Bali and street rather than pool view and we enjoyed this more as we felt part of the action.
Great access to shopping and beach and quite close to eat street."
2445,Great location!,40,October 2016,"Good hotel in a great location. Walking distance to the beach. Many shops around the corner for shoppers. Multiple massage places next to the hotel. Courtyard's in house restaurant -Seminyak Kitchen served fantastic breakfasts, multiple options in local and international cuisines. Their dinner menu was delicious too.
My daughter loved going to their onsite kids club. Great friendly staff there.
The pool seems small for number of people courtyard accommodates. We never visited the pool as it always felt crowded. The pool view room was a good idea but when we sat out, people at pool probably felt overlooked. So will not be taking a pool view room again.
The hotel had daily evening events such as Balinese dancing, firework show etc.,
We stayed 2 nights."
2446,Good location overall nice hotel,40,October 2016,"Great location and friendly staff. The pool bar and pool area is lovely just wish they had more banana lounges. Love that they have buzz services so they come to you for drinks or snacks. The lunch menu for the pool area could have more options, like make your own panini etc. only criticism is we had put in request for double bed and got twin bedding. I then had check in staff claim the travel agent didn't request it.... Disappointing as I'm the travel agent who did request it. They moved us immediately so it's a shame we had this experience. Other negative about this resort is we paid a lot for money for ground floor pool terrace based on info and images assumed it has pool access where you can jump it. It wasn't the case so I wouldn't have spent the extra money. Instead of jumping into the pool I had young families screaming at 7am. Other than than great location great breakfast and only 5-10 mins to eat street seminyak."
2447,Excellent,50,October 2016,"Stay at Marriott for 7 days from 25/10/2016 til 01/11/2016. Found hotel excellent right thought to breakfast and snacks around the pool to dinner.
All the staff were very helpful.
The one I liked about this hotel was that the staff were happy nothing was too much trouble for them.
They all work really well as team.
We received upgrade to pool room which was lovely .
I have stayed at quite hotels in Bali and I have say this one was excellent .
I would like Marriott staff for a wonderful stay."
2448,lovely hotel,50,October 2016,"Great location, walk to shops and restaurants. friendly staff. amazing pool and pool bar, and very clean. entainment most nights. and specilality food nights. also happy hour every day. Has a great kids pool for babies and toddlers and games room. and toddlers room for the little ones, with activities"
2449,wonderful hotel,50,April 2016,"courtyard bali seminyak resort it was wonderful resort, huge pool, nice room with pool view.. If you're looking for restaurants and shops within walking distance this is the place for you to relax and enjoy for stay"
2450,good,40,October 2016,"the location is good, breakfast is nice. the room is bit small vs price is quite high (but its very well decorated room). we get free upgrade to pool access room. but we did not really enjoy it as the pool is quite crowded. however pool access room will be a good option if you travel with kids."
2451,Nice but not Fantastic.,30,October 2016,"I just spent 8 nights at this hotel and I was a little disappointed. The location is excellent and the room and bathroom was very clean and tidy but a bit small. I had a twin share pool view room on floor 6 which was quiet as it was the top floor. It was a bit cramped with 2 suitcases and 2 carry on cases though. The air conditioning was excellent but the bar fridge wasn't cold at all. I had to request ice every day to get our drinks cold.
The pool area looks great but as is the case with most large hotels there are never enough sun lounges. The main pool adjoins another pool which has a swim up bar and the edge of the pool has bean bags to relax in....if you can get to one. The access to the bean bags is a bit tricky as most of them are only accessible from inside the pool and there are no ladders or steps up to them!
There is a buggy that can take you to the beach club which doesn't open until 10am and closes at 5pm. The buggy can also take you to the main hub of Seminyak also known as Eat St where you will find numerous restaurants and shops. It's about a 5-10 minute ride and it is a complimentary service.
The staff were very polite and friendly and happy to help with any requests.
Would I go back? Maybe for a shorter stay of 2-3 nights but I think for a longer holiday I would much prefer a villa."
2452,Very lively hotel,50,March 2016,We stayed in Seminyak for 3 nights and had an amazing time. If you're looking for restaurants and shops within walking distance this is the place for you. The hotel is on a strip where you can find anything for your taste-buds.
2453,Amazing property that is both fun and peaceful,50,October 2016,"Before coming to Bali, I was comparing the 3 current Marriott properties in Bali (since I am rewards member), and boy am I glad I chose to stay here. It certainly lived up all the reviews about it so far, and so if the reviews about the other Marriott properties in Bali are also true, then this is the place to stay.

Great friendly, helpful staff. Even though they're a resort property, they respect your rewards membership level (which I read not all Marriott resorts will do). I received a room upgrade even without asking, and had attentive service from beginning to end.

The room was fantastic and luxurious. Some people might complain about some of the stains on the upholstery, but if you think about what couples tend to do at these sorts of places in a location as nice as Bali, then it's really not something you can fault the hotel for. The pool and pool bar have a great lively, relaxing atmosphere, and the beach is only a short 5 minute walk away. The hotel is also conveniently located right next to a convenience store and food mart.

Breakfast buffet is also great value for the money, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The taco truck at the front the hotel is also surprisingly delicious - you must give it a try! My only negative experience during my stay here was that the service could be a bit inattentive at times in restaurant (during both breakfast and dinner). I also did not enjoy being constantly reminded to review the restaurant by the wait staff while I was eating.

I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking to visit Bali, and I only wish I had more time to stay here. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Bali."
2454,Joseph,50,November 2016,"Had a most enjoyable holiday with my wife. All staff are friendly and extremely helpful. Had many tasty and delicious meals, starting with magnificent breakfast, great snacks by the pool and sensational meals from their Seminyak Kitchen. Met 3rd Head Chef, Minggu. Very hospitable and great chef and the restaurant staff, terrific.
Highly recommend staying at the Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak."
2455,Get service,50,October 2016,Although not on the beach it is in a convenient location to all seminyaks great shopping and restaurants and a short stroll or buggy ride to the beach. The service is second to none and the staff are friendly and helpful. The managers Jonh and Grant are hands on and assist in a great experience. The rooms are getting a bit tired but are very clean. The pool is great and the swim up bar is fun. The inhouse restaurant serves great food with different themes on some nights. The breakfast is amazing. All this makes for a great holiday.
2456,Great place to stay,50,October 2016,"We stayed a week and thoroughly enjoyed it. Seminyak is really busy, but the hotel is in a great location, close to the beach (they run a golf cart that takes 6 people to an from the beach - about 1km down the rd - and have a private beach area where the staff watch your bags, provide fresh towels, cold water, etc). The Hotel itself is really nice, a large pool, including a swim up bar, happy hour that can run for several hours, and the food in the main restaurant (breakfast is included) is amazing with a huge range and style of choices. Family friendly as well, or great for couples as we were. Staff are very obliging and friendly, would definitely go back there.
Only thing they could improve is how you contact them other than ringing a landline - an email would be useful!"
2457,the only thing i could not endure.....,40,October 2016,"room's good, foods great, location convenient, concierge helpful....
the only thing i could not endure was that when i grabbed one of the bottle waters at the mini bar upon my first entrance into the room, it was already opened!"
2458,Two thumbs up!,50,October 2016,"A very good option for tourist to stay. We cannot doubt that marriott is one of the biggest hotel company now and being away from home we must choose a place that really nice to stay and i think courtyard is the answer. The room was very comfortable, the service was great, the pool was huge, nice breakfast, and its located only 5 five minutes walk to the beach! Not too much effort for watching sunset.

Ps : theres a club named KOH who plays techno music from thursday to saturday in the same street as this hotel, a very good option either!"
2459,Friendly and relaxing place to stay,40,October 2016,"We loved staying here for 7 nights in October. The staff were extremely friendly, always saying hello and starting conversation. The buffet breakfast was 5 star. Rooms were great - everything we needed and nice and modern. Handy to have a gym and spa on site and also walking distance to the beach. We would stay again."
2460,Great hotel in a great location,50,October 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard for a week in a pool view deluxe room.

The hotel is located a short walk from lots of great restaurants and spas but they offer a shuttle service too if you dont want to walk. The staff were attentive and helpful.

The pool is huge with the choice to sit on beanbags around the pool bar or down on sun lounges by the main pool. The room was nice and spacious, with an amazing large shower. We used the gym every day - it was much better than other resorts we've stayed at with lots of equipment.

We had the buffet breakfast each morning which had a huge selection of both western foods and some Asian/Indian selections. They also offer a range of different coffee styles which was a nice change from the standard black coffee offered at most hotels.

We loved this resort and would come back again in a heartbeat."
2461,Sad to be leaving!,50,October 2016,"So sad to be leaving this magnificent hotel today! The staff have gone above and beyond to accommodate us. The location is good and the shuttle service to the eat street was great. Pool is nice and big, and pool bar is super cool! The rooms and spacious with a very very comfortable bed. Would definitely stay here again!!"
2462,Wonderful service!!,50,October 2016,"We visited the resort for a couple of weeks for our honeymoon and we got impressed by the service of the hotel! All of them were very polite and whiling to help us to everything that would come up with a big smile. Breakfast was one of the best we have ever seen, with great variety that includes most of the local goods. The pool bar was also a big hit with a great menu! If I could ask for something more, than it would be a ventilation system to the bathroom, because the high humidity of the island is kind of a problem some days. Besides that I would definitely recommend it for anyone who would like to visit Bali. It is a great hotel with great people!!!"
2463,Lovely hotel in Seminyak,40,October 2016,"My sister and I loved staying at the hotel but there seemed to be something missing.

The rooms were really nice and spacious but there was a lot of noise coming in from the streets, particularly in the evenings.

It was situated in a very good location. Shops and restaurants were walking distance. The pool area was beautiful but very busy for off season in Bali.

We loved the food at this hotel - breakfast had loads of choice..

I would visit again, it was very good value for money too!"
2464,Lovely choice,50,October 2016,"We chose well going to the Courtyard Marriot. We had adjoining rooms for my husband and my two teenage boys. We had the Luxury Escapes package for 8 nights.

The rooms are well maintained. Big bathroom. The main room is not huge, but fine. The balcony's are nice.

The room service is really quick and I like that they service your rooms before lunch time.

The staff were outstanding. Nothing is a problem.

There is a dedicated staff to manage transport needs, if you don't want to catch the taxi. They also have a buggy which will take you to Eat street or to the beach. There are alot of shops within walking distance. There are also lots of spas and restaurants.

The breakfast is good. The meals in the restaurant were about half the price of a comparable hotel in Australia.

The beds were comfy. Airconditioning worked really well. The gym was well fitted out. Pool was lovely. Not cold as I had read on some reviews."
2465,So Friendly!,50,October 2016,"Amazing staff, amazing food & drink. Overall a wonderful experience.

The staff here will go above and beyond to do anything for you, extremely friendly and will assist with any queries you have.

Should be a 5 star resort!!!!"
2466,Top breakfast,50,September 2016,"This was our first trip to Bali and was guided to the Courtyard Seminyak by TripAdvisor reviews and was not disappointed. The breakfast at the Seminyak Kitchen was excellent with many types of cuisine to choose from. We stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the swimming pools. The room was very clean and comfortable, great bed and very welcome air conditioning at the end of a hot days touring. Great swimming pools and swim up bar, but the lounges are at a premium if you are not there early. They have a policy of removing towels etc. from lounges if no one is there for half an hour, but I didn't see this happen during our 4 day stay. Excellent service by all staff, and would stay there again."
2467,A great lively hotel- walking distance from the beach!,50,October 2016,"This hotel is a energetic lively hotel and close to the beach. The staff are really friendly and professional. The breakfast is amazing too much to choose from fresh omelettes to even fruits and ice creams. You can even put a special request forward like a delicious smoothie.

The hotel resturant food is simply amazing thanks to all the brilliant talented Chefs. A big thank you to Mr Juliar Tawan a sweet 23 year old he was very attentive, professional and friendly guy who should be promoted very soon. Thanks for taking care of us during dinner Juliar:)"
2468,Fantastic,40,October 2016,We stayed for 7 days at the Courtyard by Marriott and had a great time. The location was perfect for what we wanted. The beach is to the right of the hotel and was not to far away. The sunset was superb. The staff at the hotel are fantastic and there was alot of variety with the kitchen meals. Highly recommend the Courtyard by Marriott and we will return.
2469,Top service in Bali,40,October 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard two weeks ago and found the rooms to be adequate for our needs. The only thing that got in the way was the desk. I guess it is handy when on business,but for a family holiday it would be good to have no desks in the room.
We were on the 5th level overlooking the pool. It was cleaned well daily and the beds were comfortable. It would be nice to have an extra towel for each guest in the room.
We as a family group were very impressed with the service overall. All the staff are such lovely people. I cannot remember all the names but,one of the training waiters ""Deva"" is an excellent guy,and really made us feel very welcome in Bali.
The pools are great. Especially for our 2 year old grandchild who loved every minute of it.
The hotel offers a shuttle service to the beach which was very handy.Once on the beach the pampering carried on with us being given ice cold fruit on a stick,compliments of the hotel.The staff member also sprayed us with ice cold water to cool us off while we lounged on the stretchers.
""oolala only in Bali.""
The breakfast selection is huge and decent coffees as well.
I would definitely recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to anyone wanting a laid back no fuss holiday in Bali."
2470,Modern hotel close to the beach,40,October 2016,"Moved to the Marriott as last minute option.

The hotel has fantastic breakfast and gym facilities and its less then ten min walk to the beach. There is also a mini mart across the road with very well priced basics.

Rooms are modern, my room had pool view with small balcony.

Staff are very welcoming and friendly.

The pool is good but gets overcrowded easily do get a spot early!

Music is pretty loud around the pool - definitely catering for younger party crowd. So if your looking for a chilled out place to read and enjoy the sun- the pool at Marriott isn't ideal unless you have ear plugs!

Overall great modern cost effective place to stay with good security and facilities."
2471,Great stay,50,October 2016,"Stayed with my sisters and girlfriend, had an amazing stay. Nyssa at the reception is great and accomodating, Wika at the pool bar is great. Ayu, Widi, nevlyin ( im not sure this name is correct,but she was on her internship from surabaya i think) are great and hospitable too. Nikki helped my sister finding her book was also helpful. All in all good experience. Thank you."
2472,"New well designed rooms, no bed dunny (ie dunny isnt on top of beds) & good restaurant",40,October 2016,"The best thing about the Courtyard is that it is near new, rooms & all fixtures/fittings, tv, internet etc, all new.

Rooms are well designed & even though bathroom doors are sliding opening facing onto beds, they are well fitted & reasonably private. One of my pet hates is hotel/villa rooms with the dunny in the bedroom.....'bed dunnies'. You get this in base roooms in many hotels, in Bali, we have stayed at Conrad & Intercontinental & quite a few Villas and many have varying degrees of 'bed dunnies'.

Next best factor is Seminyak Kitchen, excellent breakfast & definitely woth getting included.

Locations is pretty good & getting busier every time we stay there such that there were a few blackouts while we were there. As usual tried walking distant local restaurants & still prefer Moonlite on the beach overall.

Staff were good.

Pricing, very good value.

What I didn't like was sharing a pool with a thousand other people & so just gave up. Too many noisy people for me.

Overall would recommend, probably 7.5 ....pushing 8 out of 10"
2473,Top Notch Courtyard Marriott,50,October 2016,"Spent 4 nights at the Courtyard Seminyak and I must say it was the best accommodations of my 25 day Bali trip. I had a better experience here than I do in the Courtyard Marriott's in the US. From check-in, the food, the customer service everything here is seamless. Just a 5 min walk to the beach and many delicious places to eat close by. If you're planning on a stay Seminyak, I would stay here. You will not be disappointed."
2474,Gem in Seminyak area,50,October 2016,"First , I don't expect too much when I know the location . Usually bad traffic , lot of Bar and narrow street.

But totally changes when I proceed a check in and entering room . Room are big , comfy bed and good air conditioning.

Breakfast was perfect with various of foods and fresh cook .

Overall , impressed with the staff services and hospitality ."
2475,"Nice, clean hotel",40,October 2016,"We are on the last day of our 5 day stay at Courtyard. Our room is very nice and clean, the pool is lovely and the staff and friendly. Location is good, close by to many restaurants and easy to get a taxi. Great security.

Negatives: we have one set of slippers and one robe, there are 2 of us staying here. Quite often we only got one face washer so not sure if they thought only one person was staying despite 2 being on the booking and checked in.

Very poor selection of gluten free food options on the room service and pool menu, salad only being the only option. For a western run hotel chain this is poor given most other restaurants around the place offer gluten free meals and breads for burgers. Some of the staff when approached did not have a clear idea of the requirements which meant eating here challenging. This meant my husband and I chose to eat out a lot as there was not any options for him to have here which was disappointing as we would of preferred to eat around the pool. The breakfast staff however did try their best and offered gluten free pancakes."
2476,Great hotel,50,October 2016,"Amazing.

This is our second visit. Great value. Great kitchen. Exceptionaly friendly staff.
We can say lots of things about the hotel.
First and foremost is the excellent service and friendliness of the staff.
Nothing was too much for them.
The pool is great but it will be nice to have more chairs around the pool.
All in all ery good.

Theo & Toni
Sydney Australia

Nice rooms and very clean.
Highly recommended."
2477,Definitely 5 star.,50,,"The stay was wonderful, very relaxing, the security was exceptional. Staff treat everyone with the up most respect.
The staff that stood out to me are mariai and ayu at the pool bar. And July in the kitchen they were awesome, made the stay more pleasing."
2478,A Memorable Holiday,50,October 2016,"Our four nights' stay at Courtyard Marriott was memorable in many ways. Staff at every level and area 'left no stones unturned' to make our stay a pleasant one. Allow me to start with the Kitchen. You have the most tantalizing breakfast buffet spread to suit almost every palate, including peppermint that my friend requested. If I may add, your breakfast would be complete if you had added yoghurt and cereals. Special mention must be made of the attentive staff especially Arini who listened intently to our every requests and brought our food in double quick time. Management staff like Tobias and Grant played their part too when they asked on many occasions whether we were happy with the service provided by the junior staff. It was customer service at its very best that by our second breakfast, your service staff were addressing us by names. We took every opportunity to eat other meals in your Kitchen even though we had prepared a list of other favorable restaurants in Seminyak before we came. And we even found excuse to eat the delightful mee goreng recommended by the bubbly Arya before we left for the airport on the final day of our holiday. Kudos to everyone at Courtyard Marriott for such a memorable time spent at your resort. Sing Tong/Michael Phua."
2479,"Great Staff, Great location, Enjoyed my stay!",50,October 2016,"I recently stayed for 3 nights at this resort in Seminyak, Bali. The staff are amazing, always attentive and engaging with guests. The breakfast buffet is wonderful! Great selection, eggs benefit - delicious, only the coffee quality needs to be improved. The Pool Bar is very nice and offers great and delicious drinks and snacks. The GYM is 24 hours open, this gives great flexibility. The GM and even the Director of Finance mingled with guests over breakfast. This is great to see as the presence of senior management really makes a difference. The rooms are great, clean and have balconies or terraces. All in all, great holidays! Thx to all the team!"
2480,Courtyard seminayk,50,September 2016,Love this place so modern and the rooms are so clean and nice! Location is great to only a few minutes walk to Seminyak beach and has lots of yummy food / shopping places near by. The buffet breakfast was delicious so many options. We stayed here for 5 nights at the start of our trip in Bali and it was a great way to start the trip with the hotel staff being very helpful with organising drivers and recommending things to do. Would recommend this place to anyone and we are going to be coming back in our next trip to bali!
2481,Excellent hotel,50,October 2016,We have just returned from an 11 night stay and I have to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. We were a party of 4 and we were celebrating my husbands 60 th birthday. When we arrived check in went smooth and we were taken to our rooms where the staff had left a birthday cake and a nice card. The room were very large and the bed was Hugh and comfortable. We ordered room service and this was great and very cheap. Breakfast was amazing and staff could not do enough to ensure you had a great stay. Pool side could be busy and getting down for a lounger early is advisable. The hotel is in a great location and close to beach. Must make a special mention to Supatra and assistant head waiter Abi and chef who took the cooking class (muunip) not sure of his name. Our rooms were cleaned to a great standard. On the day of my husbands birthday staff decorated our room and sang happy birthday at breakfast time this was a lovely touch. We could not fault the hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to others. In fact our friends have booked it for a short break in February.
2482,Nest to relax,50,October 2016,"This is the second time i stayed here. The bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious with balcony facing swimming pool. The staffs are really warm and willing to help you. They have some activities, so you don't need to go out and can still enjoy your holiday in the resort.
Minimarket and restaurants are close to the hotel, if you want to have something other than hotel food. Seminyak kitchen serve very good foods!
Breakfast was excellent, simple but really enough to fill your tummy :). Their egg Benedict with Salmon (smoked also available)was excellent, must try item! Variety of coffee also served here. The best part, they serve you mineral water for free in the room ( u can order extra for free - to drink not to take bath üòâüòõ). No worry you still can enjoy seminyak beach, just ask to drop you there and enjoy your holiday. Highly recommended."
2483,Great holiday,40,June 2016,"Had a great time here in June for a friend's 50th. The package overall was a great deal and we made the most of the F&B allowance during happy hour. There were 1 or 2 issues though, and it would be stretching it to say the room we had was a pool view room (which was part of the package). The issues were resolved well by the front office manager Daniel and the director of operations (whose name I forgot) and overall it was a great week. Breakfast buffet was fabulous and we had a seafood buffet dinner in the restaurant on our last night, which was fantastic. Hotel is ideally placed and very central for everything. Would certainly stay there again."
2484,Nice Hotel,40,October 2016,"This was a very nice hotel to stay at.
All the staff are very friendly around the hotel, also saying hello when they pass you.

The rooms are nice and clean and the bed was super comfortable

The breakfast was very good the only small downside is that they could of been a better rotation on the western side of the buffet

The pool side snacks where great it was great to get the fries n the bintang chicken bite nice n hot and not soaky

The location is good

Will return to this great hotel"
2485,"""Nice Hotel""",50,October 2016,"Courtyard Marriot Seminyak Is a Good Location, Frendly Staff...All Food Is Delicious..:) I Have been Dinner In Seminyak Kitchen Restaurant At Courtyard Marriot seminyak... ""Waiter and Waitress Is a Frendly..."""
2486,Nice stay,50,October 2016,"This hotel is very nice and the staff are very helpful and friendly! The rooms are nice and spacious and the aircon is amazing, nice big pool with shallow area for kids, and breakfast is awesome! would recommend this place."
2487,Family holiday done right,50,October 2016,"This is our return visit here as a family of 4 (kids aged 6 & 4). We booked a twin room and we're thrilled to be upgraded to a pool view twin room. We are on the 5th floor and have a great view of the resort. The beds are 2 small double beds but big enough for us to sleep with 1 child each.

Pool
The pool is large and runs down the centre of the resort. It broken up into 3 parts. The bar area, the main swimming area and then a kids pool. Great atmosphere at the pool with music and kids laughing. There are buzzers at your lounge chair to order food and drinks. I loved the lunch time wraps.

Kids Club
Our kids were begging to go in here. They made lots of things and loved their time with Santi. We even had her bring the kids back to our room one evening to mind them while we were at dinner. All for $65k per hour. I should mention you get 2 hours free kids club per day.

Breakfast
I know everyone says it but this really is the best buffet available in Bali. The coffee is great and the freshly made juices a highlight.

General
Taco truck was delicious, 2 large tacos for $50k. Free fairy floss and popcorn for kids. This resort really does suit everyone but in particular, families are catered to perfectly. While the kids all play together you can actually relax and read a book. The Spa Bali around the corner is exceptional and I visited here each day.

We had a ball here, would highly recommend and will definitely be back."
2488,Fabulous,50,October 2016,"We loved this place. Suited us perfectly as first time Bali visitors. After spending a week with children & grandbaby in a rustically charming Canggu villa we had eight days at the Courtyard. Can't fault it. Modern, centrally located, short walk to the beach & to heaps of shopping & eating places; easy access to taxis out the front & super helpful, efficient & accommodating staff all round. The restaurant & pool bar offer a wide selection of well priced food & drink in very attractive settings with fast 24/7 room service readily available. Our room on the fifth floor overlooked the courtyard & pools, was light, spacious & thoughtfully designed, with a v comfy bed, great aircon & security, terrific bathroom & plentifully equipped with high-spec accessories. To top it off, Ms Parsini, from the in-house Zanti Spa on the lower ground floor, gave this boomer-body THE best set of stress-relief massages it's ever had in its long & active life. We'll most definitely be back & recommend The Courtyard unreservedly."
2489,H,50,October 2016,Best place to stay pool bar start are incredible penny and Hendra are simply awesome couldn't ask for more love u to bits room is great all staff so friendly food is also awesome as wall as the kids club and endless popcorn and fairy floss what more could you want
2490,Nice hotel in Great Location,50,September 2016,"I love this hotel because the room is spacious and very clean. We had a barbecue on Saturday night, the food was delicious and the guy who played guitar sing a nice song. The Location is perfect, not too far from the airport. The beach is about 500 meters from the hotel, you can sit and relax while waiting for the sunset at La Plancha. I love the buffet breakfast! lots of selection. The staff are nice and friendly. There's nothing that I don't like about this hotel. It'll suit your needs, whether you go as a couple or with the whole family."
2491,"Good hotel, nice friendly staff and good food",50,October 2016,"Our first trip to Bali and our first hotel on our Bali itinerary of our holiday.
Can't really fault it apart from having difficulty getting our tea and coffees with our breakfast on the last two mornings. Took over 30 minutes one morning and nearly 20 minutes the second morning. We could not understand why as on previous mornings we had our tea and coffee just after we sat at our table.
Hotel is good, modern with nice rooms and facilities.
Staff very friendly and helpful.
Recommended - you won't be disappointed."
2492,Heavenly,50,October 2016,"Absolutely love this hotel. Came back for a 2nd time and brought 5 families with us.
Beds are the best I've ever slept in. Breakfast brilliant, coffee, security, and all the staff are amazing and location can't be faulted. Next door is Spa Bali which is amazing and the free buggy to go around the local area is excellent.
The kids loved the free endless popcorn and fairy floss and us adults loved the pool bar and good vibes around the pool. Only slight criticism is that the pool chairs are too close to one another and can get a bit crowded... but overall 9.9/10 hotel for value for money and atmosphere.
Can't wait to return."
2493,Lively hotel with the best buffet breakfast,40,October 2016,"Loved, loved, loved the buffet breakfast. Widi couldn't do enough for us. I had my ice lattes and freshly squeezed orange carrot juice every morning with all sorts of fresh goodies. We had an early morning pick up one day and the Seminyak Kitchen crew packed us a breakfast box - bless them. Other stuff we loved: the 5 minute walk to the beach, rain shower, decent WiFi speed, and free cotton candy and popcorn.

Stuff we didn't love as much: loud music blasting out from the pool bar area in the afternoons and surrounding restaurants at night, less than smooth check in process (we checked in early then left our bags as our room wasn't ready and when we returned, they couldn't find our reservation), and faulty door lock (apparently, the door lock needed new batteries and it took half an hour and 4 different staff members to have a look at it before we could get into our room... all this late at night, after dinner with a tired kid). Also, bring your own toiletries - the hotel provides some but in teeny, tiny quantities and at the end of each long, hot, sweaty day, it just wasn't enough."
2494,Amazing for a courtyard,40,October 2016,"This is the largest and nicest Courtyard I have ever seen. Large double pools. Swim up bar. Room service. Large restaurant. Pool restaurant and bar. Spa. Fitness center. Pretty much everything you wouldn't expect to see at a Courtyard. Marriott is a great brand. The staff was very nice and accommodating. If the Marriott food truck is outside when you visit, definitely stop by for the tacos. Some of the best I've had in Bali"
2495,Punishment over too soon,40,September 2016,"Good security is always welcomed but it was the first time we have had a sniffer dog check the suitcases in the boot of the taxi and then having to clear all luggage and possessions through the x-ray machine before arriving at reception. Check in went smoothly until we were told our room was not ready having arrived at 15.20, this really infuriates me and ruins the expectation of arrival at a new destination.
After my usual rant surprisingly a room became available, small, clean, modern, adequate wardrobe space, slick bathroom, an amazingly comfortable bed and pillows, and a balcony high enough above the side street to avoid seeing the mayhem below but unfortunately not high enough not to hear it.
At this point our three day stay seemed like punishment but after unpacking and a cold beer I would recommend you walk to the beach a five minute walk away, grab a bean bag at the beach bar settle in with a few more beers and watch the surfers and fantastic sunset, you now know why you are staying in the Courtyard because value for money and location you will struggle to match this hotel.
I have to mention the buffet style breakfast and the warm welcome on entering the restaurant. Directed personally to a table with a copious supply of coffee is a great way to start the day. The choice varies from Asian, Indonesian, Western and even ice cream, this is advertised as one of the best hotels for breakfast in Seminyak, I would not disagree. Seminyak kitchen for dinner was equally as good, on the one occasion it was too wet to venture out we tried the hotel restaurant, excellent service, good food and favourable prices.
Location is good, Seminyak Square is about a 30 minute walk and slightly quicker in a taxi on a busy day. Several bars and restaurants are minutes away and a very handy supermarket opposite.
One disappointment are the close loungers around the pool, I appreciate space is at a premium or am I just getting old, the solution, hire a couple of loungers and parasol on the beach, unbeatable.
Punishment finally over it was time to check out. This is a lively modern hotel that actually grew on us. The noise, well that's Seminyak, the live bands playing on the beach with a bucket of Bintang next to your bean bag, priceless.
Would we return to Seminyak, without doubt if we were thirty plus years younger, would we want to stay in the Courtyard, you bet!"
2496,Fantastic Hotel,50,September 2016,"We LOVE this hotel. This is the second time we have stayed here. The buffet breakfast is amazing - anything you can think of is available. The rooms are a good size, clean and modern. The location is fantastic - 5 minute walk to the beach and a 5 minute taxi ride to Eat Street. The hotel also provides a complimentary buggy service to the beach and to the top of Eat Street. Our kids loved this hotel, there were plenty of options to keep them entertained including aqua aerobics, kids club, ping pong competitions and bingo around the pool bar. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. All the staff from the restaurant, kids club, pool bar, security and reception were so friendly and could not do enough for you. The general manager John is always around the hotel and will take the time to chat and ask if you're happy with your stay. We would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Thank you for such a great holiday."
2497,"Amazing Breakfast, Pool & Bar Staff!!",50,October 2016,"We came to Bali with the idea of booking accommodation as we go. After we spent a beautiful day by the pool, we decided we would book in for a couple of nights at the end of the trip. We truly thought we had found the best hotel breakfast until we stayed at the Courtyard - talk about variety! I couldn't even decide what to eat there was so much to choose from. Everything was so fresh and delicious!

We spent a lot of time around the pool and pool bar during our stay. There was an abundance of sunshine and the vibe was just really cool! The bar staff in particular definitely made our stay here great. Hari and his team Penny, Arka were super friendly, welcoming and really looked after us. They were so flexible and always had a smile on their face. A+ for service. I will definitely be recommending the Courtyard to friends!

Annie."
2498,Amazing breakfasts!,40,September 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights - we had two rooms which were inter-leading. There are no sea-facing rooms, as it is set too far back, but we had a nice balcony which overlooked the street below. The rooms are really lovely and well equipped - we were pleasantly surprised. They are a really good size, comfortable beds, great wifi, good airconditioning and good ammenities. The rooms are clean, as well as the communal areas. The breakfasts were until 11am and it is a proper buffet of anything your heart desires - really a bonus! It's not far from the beach or the shops, so the location is great. We had a lovely stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
2499,Second amazing stay,50,October 2016,"We originally stayed six weeks ago at Courtyard Marriot Seminyak on a Scoopon deal. We enjoyed it so much that we have returned for a 2nd visit. The service and staff are amazing and to name just a few stand out people .....Hardi, Anton and Elizabeth. The breakfast has to be one of the best in Bali with such variety. Don't quite understand a previous comment that it can become repetitive.
We have enjoyed the pool and the daily water aerobics are a highlight. We have always found a sun lounger without issue.
The rooms are very well equipped and user friendly with beds to die for.
We have also enjoyed the day spa with daily massages.
I would recommend this hotel highly as you need never leave this complex as caters for everything you could wish for.
Thanks for a great 2nd visit and we will return."
2500,Amazing,50,October 2016,"Just back from five days at this amazing resort. We were a family of four (2 teenage kids) and we loved our stay here. Staff were friendly and very helpful, breakfast was amazing. Our pool view view room was beautiful and very comfortable with lovely large bathroom and big shower. Loved the pool bar. Location was excellent, close to shops, cafes and a shuttle buggy to private beach area. All in all, a perfect time, came home relaxed and Looking forward to another trip to Bali in the future as this was our first time. It won't be our last.."
2501,Loved it!!!,40,October 2016,"We stayed at the courtyard from September 10th to 18th, as young travellers this was our luxury hotel that we saved for our last week. It was lovely, staff were incredible, Kendra and Polly (the pool bar staff) were a highlight of my stay, going down for happy hour and sharing laughs.

The buffet breakfast was enjoyable, the rooms are comfortable and a great size although we felt our aircon didn't work as well as my sisters room (but we probably pressed a wrong button). Room service was delightful and so polite and the rooms were always cleaned and freshened up!

The only downside was the noise, our room was right above the lobby and I woke to people constantly laughing and carrying on between 1am and 4am, and then kids splashing in the pool by 8am. Although this isn't anyone at the hotels fault, a noise policy could be enforced.

Other than that we loved our stay, it's beautiful, great location, friendly staff and enjoyable food and also a great selection of restaurants all up the street, I only wish we stayed longer, and hope all the staff are doing well. We will be back!!"
2502,Surprised by all means,30,October 2016,"Great and disappointing at the same time.
Breakfast is untill 11am. This is awesome as not a lot of hotels ends this late!
Staff are friendly. Just makes your day easier with those smiles.
Wifi speed is great. Did a check and it went up to 50mbps on average.
Great location, not far from the beach but not far from the centre either. Being remote from those noisy bars is a great plus for relaxation.

Interior are quite aged. Stains are not washed properly.
Towels are aged too. They could really replace them it looks like it's from a 3 star hotel.
Pool is small during peak times. I wonder if it can fit not even half of the guests at the same time.
Connecting room's door open. My neighbor couldve easily came into my room and stole my stuff.
Loud. I'm not the deepest sleeper and those noises every now and then from the corridor or your neighbor bothered.
All the negative facts above are not acceptable when you pay for a Marriot price.

Super ups and downs, was a very tough to decide whether it was good or not."
2503,Well-designed and well-managed hotel,40,October 2016,"Great service. Nicely thought-out design. Family-friendly. Good food. Nice pool. Every table by the pool has a Service Call button connected to smart watches of select service staff so you can get service in no time, even during peak swimming periods."
2504,Loud hotel,40,October 2016,"Stayed here for 12 days.
Pros:
Clean
Great breakfast
Great pool
Great service
Friendly smiles every day
close to beach which was a plus however had to taxi it to 'eat street' daily

Cons:
Loud
Constant music was irritating
Could never get a lounge seat- they were reserved by 9.30am by people leaving there belongings on the seats- it says that things will be removed if there's no one there for 30 minutes however this was not the case

If you're looking to completely relax and unwind I wouldn't recommend staying here."
2505,Good location,30,August 2016,This Marriott is relatively new and a good location walking distance to the beach. No view rooms and don't let them put you in an upgraded pool suite - everyone can see in your room and doesn't feel safe. I swapped rooms around 10pm when one came available to the top floor - far more quiet and private. Free breakfast for platinum elite was fine but a zoo scene and difficult to get a cup of coffee. The restaurant was not air conditioned and so not able to really sit and enjoy for too long. Overall an ok spot - but if you prefer a more zen and quiet spot - choose their Nusa Dua property - far better experience and setting. Nice touch to have the private beach area.
2506,Holiday,40,October 2016,"Clean hotel, friendly staff, fairly efficient.
Rooms spacious, but no bath, otherwise comfortable. Our room is situated on street side, quite noisy and in the evening loud live music from opposite restaurant. I tried to change room but hotel was fully booked.
Definitely recommended pool view rooms.
Nice pool and busy pool bar.
Hotel open plan, do not very cool outside your rooms.
Nice breakfast, extensive choice.
Only downside of this hotel is the smoking everywhere. I think it should be non smoking or dedicated area for smoking.
Good location.
On the whole ok."
2507,Loved Every Minute!!!,50,September 2016,"We had a destination wedding to Bali and got married in Ubud. I contacted the Marriott explaining that we would need about 10 rooms and from the start they were amazing (Shout out to Selvia!! Amazing!!! Efficient!!! So helpful!!)
I chose the Marriott as a lot of our guests were first time visitors to Bali and I knew the Marriott would have international standards. No, the Marriott doesn't have Balinese decor but that didn't worry any of the guests. They all only had positive things to say about it!
The staff were amazing and so friendly! The location is perfect, in between Double Six Beach and Eat Street, they have a free buggy to take you to either location. There is also a little supermarket across the road which was very handy for snacks, insect repellant, little gifts, extra toiletries ect. The breakfast was so delicious!!! And the staff will make you any fresh juice you want, I loved the detox juice! The rooms were spacious and clean, we had a 1 bedroom suite. My auntie had a pool view deluxe room and it was also lovely.
The Marriott will definitely see us again and I know they will also see our wedding guests again too!
Thank you to everyone at the Marriott for playing a huge part in the success of our destination wedding!!

2508,Disappointing,20,October 2016,"After reading the reviews on this resort I had expected more. This could be a great resort but unfortunately it is lacking in many areas. We have been to Bali many times and perhaps we have been spoilt with some amazing accomodation before - the Courtyard did not impress. Our first two nights were spent in a roadside room listening to motorbikes and dogs barking. We were moved for the next three nights into a pool view room which was quieter. Unfortunately the noise of the pool bar is overbearing- I was lucky enough to enjoy a fantastic massage at the spa but had to listen to the techno music for the full hour while I was in there. Message to the manager - turn the music down. This resort isn't just for guests wanting to drink at the bar! Our room wasn't overly impressive - marked bathroom countertops, cigarette buts on the balcony,broken power points and housekeeping put there dirty mops in your bathroom sink while cleaning! The breakfast was ok- nothing great and they run out of a lot of the food. Only positive is the fantastic girls in the kids club and the girls in the spa are lovely too - great massage.Would not come back here and find it interesting that the manager only responds to positive feedback."
2509,Great hotel and very good service,40,September 2016,"This hotel was a great 5 star hotel. Very close to the beach and places to eat. Clean rooms except the smelly pillow cover. Big swimming pool. But for quieter rooms, better stay on the 3rd floor and up because all the rooms has pool views, so we can hear lots of sound from the pool. Overall this hotel worth the 5 stars."
2510,Amazing !!,50,October 2016,"I must say this first time trip to Bali is the most memorable experience for me , great choice at Seminyak court yard by the Marriott would have to be the best resort by far !!
The hotel facilities fabulous very clean ! Free internet WiFi access is great ! and staff service is exceptional food is delicious especially their breakfast buffet the best !!!!
Will definitely come back to Bali but will be back to this hotel .. Won't bother to look elsewhere.. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED !!!!
Thank you to all the staff especially Seminyak kitchen you are made me smile every morning, can't fault anything.. Keep up with the friendly smile üòÑüòÑüòÄüëçüëçüëç

2511,A Smashing Trip at the Most Wonderful Bali Resort,50,September 2016,"Staying at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort was the right choice during our recent vacation in Bali. The moment you enter this resort, you know you‚Äôre in for a good time when you‚Äòre greeted with the buzzing vibes from its excellent pool bar. Our room overlooked the swimming pool and we enjoyed lounging on our balcony whilst soaking up the beats from the pool bar below. The bed in the room was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean, everything in good condition.

In terms of security of the resort, rest assured that ‚ÄòBlackie the dog‚Äô (that‚Äôs my nickname for it) and the rest of the Security team are always on duty to ensure safety every time you enter the resort, albeit in a non-intrusive manner.

The resort is a pleasant 5-minute walk to the beach or you can hop onto a complimentary buggy that drops you off there or the restaurant and bar areas amidst the vicinity. The nearby Seminyak Square is also where you can go shopping.

I left the Seminyak Kitchen for last (but certainly not the least) as we spent our mornings here enjoying the lovely breakfast buffet. Nothing kickstarts the day better than going to a place where you feel so welcomed. The array of dishes served is commendable, you‚Äôll get to savour local Indonesian dishes, Asian selection, Western and even ice cream. Breakfast here is the best in Seminyak, I‚Äôm told, and certainly lives up to its expectations. Two stars of the Seminyak Kitchen who stand out are Dwi of the eggs station and Ayu, the hostess. Dwi was a gem ‚Äì his cheerful demeanour is infectious and it was such a pleasure to meet him every morning, he portrays a genuine passion to be in the kitchen doing what he does. Not only that, he was also good with recommendations whenever we asked him to suggest what we should eat for the day. With the right exposure and learning & development, he has the potential to go far. Ayu was also very sweet and pleasant, engaging with us and remembering our names.

Courtyard Bali Seminyak is a smashing resort, and I‚Äôll definitely be back again!"
2512,Great place to visit !!,50,October 2016,"We visited for only 4 days, for a relaxing break . It's a Beautiful clean resort, with a great atmosphere and service !!

Chinta pool bar was where I spent most of my time and i was impressed . Good food, friendly staff.

Very happy"
2513,Superb,50,October 2016,"This place is genuinely fantastic. A combination of a laid back attitude matched with effortless attention to detail. The staff are friendly, engaging, courteous and constantly smile and joke. Great bar by the pool, good gym (small but works if you are imaginative with the gear), delicious food.

I'll certainly return.

Oh yeah, shout out to Chinta by the pool bar. Top lass!"
2514,Excellent service through out !,50,October 2016,"Amazing hotel with the most amazingly hospitable staff ! Our holiday was like a dream and a dream we will return to live again and again !

Massive shout out to all the Pool Bar team as their service was first class, made us feel at home !

Highly recommend this Hotel !!"
2515,Amazing breakfast great for gluten free people,50,October 2016,"After staying one night when we initially came to Bali we stayed in ubud and then to that Marriott in nusa dua. We decided to cancel the rest of our time in nusa dua as seminyak one was better located with more choice of food.

Breakfast was amazing, gluten free pancakes, waffles and bread üòÄ.... not only that but the executive chef Datung made gluten free pau (small Asian type rolls)... absolutely amazing best day of my holiday!!!

If you stAy here head down to the Bo and bun, another exceptional eatery üòÄ."
2516,best staff,50,October 2016,Had a nice stay here with my partner the staff were exceptional and were always very polite and would ask how our day has been. The restaurant here was really good food and its a very welcoming and home feeling hotel. Overall had a nice stay and would reccommend !
2517,Honeymoon Stay,50,September 2016,"We stay in Courtyard Bali Seminyak during our honeymoon and I could only say great things. The service is really nice and the brekfast is really good one of the bests I have ever stayed. Beisdes the location in Seminjack is perfect you could arrive at the beach in less of 5 minutes walking or they could drop you with the buggy they have. Also for having dinner there are a many nice places in the same Street of he Hotel.
They really make us feel like at home.
Besides they present me a cake the day of my birthday ."
2518,Great starting/leaving point for Bali,40,September 2016,"This is a lovely hotel and ideal for your arrival or departure into Bali. It is ideally located for the bars in Seminyak and the local beach.
The staff are attentive and friendly, always with a smile.
The pool runs along the centre of the hotel and rooms overlook it. My room was opposite the pool bar which was ok with me but expect music to be played once the morning kicks in. This didn't bother me as it was a sort of alarm clock to get going but if I had children or was in party mode it could have been a hindrance and probably a good idea to ask for a room away from this area. A friend had a room at the other end of the pool and you couldn't hear a thing.
All in all a lovely place to stay and spend a few days. I'd certainly return."
2519,Newer hotel a short walk to the beach,40,September 2016,"We had a suite at pool level. I was concerned about the noise, but it was fine. During the day it was what you would expect. We could hear music from the bar in the evenings but it was not annoying. The room was quite spacious and modern. We did not use the pool or restaurants except for breakfast. The breakfast buffet had many many choices and the coffee was very good. We walked to the beach several times but never quite found the exclusive area reserved for Courtyard guests. We did not try that hard either as we just wanted to walk and not lounge at the beach. You need to go through security each time you re-enter the hotel. We had to check our little dive knives from our SCUBA gear with security but we got them back with no issue when we checked out. When we checked in we had to go back to the valet and identify our luggage as the claim tag seemed to get lost from the front desk 20 feet away. Also, on check-out, the front desk failed to ask for a porter, so we walked over and asked for one and had immediate service. They did a nice job arranging transport to and from the airport for us at a fair price for us and all of our gear."
2520,Amazing customer service!,40,September 2016,"This was our first trip to Bali and the arrival and check in was seamless. Beautiful staff throughout the hotel from upper management to the ground staff, all smiles and grace.
We had a deluxe room overlooking the pool which was lovely but loud some nights until the pool bar closed at 9pm. Our room was lovely, comfy bed however, the towels need replacing as they were a bit tired and some hooks to hang them on would have been appreciated. Rooms were serviced daily but it was hit and miss to what standard was achieved as some days it was lacking in finesse.
The pool was a welcome respite from the heat but it was difficult to get a lounge by 11am, although, hats off to the pool attendants policing the 30minute rule.
Seminyak Kitchen has lovely waitstaff, special mention to Rai, Gita and Araya but all were attentive, friendly and had gorgeous smiles.
The two concierges we dealt with were amazing, as was Ari who organised our transport.
Would definitely return."
2521,"Organized, clean, friendly place",50,September 2016,"Staff were very nice at check-in, then the room was very clean, organized and comfortable, well located with walking distance to the beach, restaurants and some bars. I organized the tours to visit Bali tourist place with the concierge in a very secure and on time way at proper costs. Then the swimming pool and bar were very convenient and nice to enjoy too."
2522,Great value for money,50,August 2016,"Second time staying at this resort and not fault it in any way. The service, staff, facilities and food amazing. Location is fantastic. Staff are always accomodating and friendly. Great value for money for a resort in Seminyak."
2523,Irritating room design / furniture....,30,August 2016,"A standard international chain hotel which has extensive grounds and a very large pool which is sectioned off to cater for various guest types; children, families and adults only.

Rather than sing the praises of the staff who are all great, I just wanted to highlight some very irritating aspects for the traveller who perhaps stays for more than 3 or 4 nights.

The rooms have next to no cupboard space nor is there very much drawer space so where does one keep their clothes?? Of course, silly, we should just leave them in our suitcases which then have to be left accessible in the room somewhere, but that too is a problem, because of the really idiotic desk and seat arrangement right by one side of the bed. Come on Marriott, when you inspect a hotel perhaps you should live in a room for a few nights to experience what a guest does.

More annoying issues with rooms, no hooks or rails to hang towels, robes, clothes etc in the bathrooms and if you're lucky enough to have a bathroom window then prepare to be awoken by the blazing daylight which will filter through the bathroom, through the glass bathroom door and right on to your sleeping head in your bed!! Really??

The breakfast, billed as the best in Seminyak, becomes monotonous and mundane after a few days. Again the setup is ridiculous. Diners need to open and close fridge doors to get at juices, fruits and salads, but as there is no table nearby upon which to place glasses and plates you have 'dish gymnastics' going on in front of the fridges. May I humbly suggest that rather than trying to be all things to all men, the F & B department try to offer excellence in its items and then build from there. For instance, why offer, Indian food if it is going to be a paltry and pale imitation of the real thing.

Enough ranting...the poolside snacks were great and the staff prompt. Towels were always for pool goers.

Overall, would I return? Regrettably, no."
2524,Middle of the road hotel- well priced and comfy,30,September 2016,"What we liked about this hotel
- we got a ground floor interconnecting room that opened into the pool. This was convenient and appreciated.
- beds and pillows very comfy
- rooms well appointed with TV, table for meals, big bathroom with two shower heads, (no bath) robe, lounge on veranda etc
- room service was good and pretty fast - under 20 mins
- popcorn and fairy floss in foyer as well as food truck in driveway
- thorough security which was a bit annoying but understand why
- location 5 min scooter to main RD in Seminyak
- staff very friendly and helpful
- didn't use the buggy to the beach but a good option

What we didn't work for us
- most of the furniture in our room and within the resort was worn and stained
- pool area feels cramped with number of guests
- shower had big water stains and needs a good scrub and one bathroom had a foul smell which we find common in Bali generally.
- music from pool bar was loud and also noise in hallways but we expected this from previous reviews and wasn't major.
- we were concerned by the number of hours the security dog was chained up in the heat working and found it a bit distressing."
2525,Courtyard Bali Seminyak Should be In Your Sights For a Hotel in Bali,50,September 2016,"Where do I start. Imagine a holiday destination where every staff member treated you like royalty. From Security, Bell Desk, Reception, Room Service, Kitchen Staff, Massage Centre Staff, Pool Attendants the whole team, wow. I could go into detail but I wont. If your reading this review you are at least interested in this amazing location. My wife organised the Scoopon Deal, and it is amazing. We arrived, your treated no differently. The check in was super efficient, and they then give you your Welcome Drink & Cold Towel, the vouchers for the Massage, Lunches, Dinner and the free cocktail/drinks around the bar. Its such a hassle free reception and transaction. Our stay was 10 days. In the Scoopon Deal, they talk about a free upgrade to a superior room, subject to availability. Don't be to stressed if you don't receive it, the Deluxe room rocks just as well. Our room looked over the garden end of the hotel and was breathtaking. This hotel, my wife and I rate 10/10. Often when you read reviews you ask yourself is the person writing the review wordly, have they stayed in quality locations, whats their standard they live by. The best statement I can make to you about this hotel, that I am not just leaving a review here, I am writing to the President & Managing Director of Marriot International, Mr Craig Smith, to let him know he has a jewel here in Bali. The best compliment I can give to this location is that my wife and I will definitely stay again."
2526,"A Great Resort, Wonderful Staff.",50,September 2016,"We stayed as a group of 12 at the Marriott recently. We were 5 adults and 7 children ranging in age from 11 to 17. From the moment we arrived at the Marriott, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The reception staff were extremely accomodating, offering to move and link rooms for us for young children if we wished.
We had an amazing breakfast every morning, with a huge range of western and international food on offer, I would be surprised if people were unable to find something to cater for their tastes. The staff here always went above and beyond to ensure we were happy by providing first class attentive service remembering our names each day and coffee choice! Thank you to Arini who was just delightful! The chefs were incredible, preparing anything we asked and even sharing some recipe tips! Even the hotel manager, John Wooley, was available to talk with those enjoying their breakfast, giving a personal face to the management of the resort.
The rooms were equipped with everything we needed, and were cleaned well each and every day!
There is a shuttle service to the beach and Eat Street and the location was great for access to everything in the area. The pool area was beautifully maintained and even in a group of 12 we were able to find a lounge each day and again we were greeted with smiles by all of the staff attending to this area.
We could not have been happier with the service at this resort and although this was our first trip to Bali, I am sure we will be back and will definitely want to stay at the Marriott.
Thank you to all who made our stay such a pleasure.
Deborah B"
2527,Highly recommended!!,50,September 2016,"We had a 7 night stay in a pool view with interconnecting rooms. One room had a king size bed and the other room had 2 king sized single beds. Rooms were very comfortable with a great view of the pool from the balcony. The pool was amazing!!!
Buffet breakfast was beautiful and they had a variety of yummy foods.
Staff at the Courtyard by Marriott and so friendly and are always there with a smile to help you with your needs. We can't wait to go back to Bali and we will definitely be staying at this hotel again. Highly recommended!!"
2528,Amazing Staff,40,September 2016,"It is the staff who make this hotel. Generally extraordinarily attentive, kind, respectful, gracious and engaging. Kudos to Surya (at the beach and pool), Laura, Wahyu and Jessica (at reception) and Ardana, Gita, Kardana and Tobias (at the Seminyak Kitchen).
Phenomenal and comprehensive breakfasts at the Seminyak Kitchen. Absolute abundance which does not stop.
The property is well kept, clean, modern, cool and beautiful - love the atria gardens. This hotel is ideal for families.
A drawback to the hotel is the loud clubbing music which it starts playing from around 10am. Another drawback if you have sensitive hearing is the whirring noise from the air conditioning system which can be heard throughout the night if you leave your balcony doors open.
Overall an enjoyable stay, amazing staff and great value."
2529,Fantastic Hotel,50,July 2016,"Fantastic Hotel, the staff are very very attentive, Ive been back 5 times now and they remember me every time and make myself and family feel welcome.
The restaurant food is plentiful and a great selection.
The location is great just a short stroll to the beach and Eat Street is just around the corner."
2530,Excellent hotel!,50,September 2016,"Excellent hotel to stay in:
- good and prompt service
- good location

Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Advisable to get a pool view room. However, the music may be slightly loud.

Love the buggy service to the beach.

Overall, a very enjoyable stay! Will be back again!"
2531,Holiday,30,September 2016,"The Receptions not so friendly. no smile....Stay for 2nights after staying in a Resort in Ubud. Then I felt the difference in services.
When we arrived , the concierge took our luggage and i passed the receipt to reception when I checked in . after got the room key , I went up and the bell boy still asking me our room number .. ( the bagage delivery system is not working , I think )
The room is good and clean, we love it
Lucky on the last day Bfast , the staffs are so friendly with lots of smiles. They greet all the guests who come
The training girl , Elvin is good. Giving smile and offering a cup of drink (coffee, Tea, hot Choco ) to take away as part of the system in this resto. I just knew it ."
2532,Honeymoon,50,September 2016,"There was so many highlights staying at the Courtyard by Marriott in seminyak.
Breakfast was amazing. So many options for everyone free coffees, juices. Breakfast went from 6:30- 11am.
The 3 separate pool but joined were great for all ages smaller pool was good for smaller children and baby's.
Loved the bean bags and sun beds. Sun beds get taken quite early in the morning so be by the pool earlier. You can order food and drink on the sunbeds by pressing a button. Was fantastic.
Swim up bar was awesome and that's where we met most of our new friends.
Great security we felt very safe.
We stayed in a lovely room. Pool deluxe with a nice balcony overlooking the pool and a comfy king bed. Shower was amazing.
Staff were fabulous and so so friendly.
One staff member in particular Penny is such a beautiful person. Great to see people loving their jobs and being so kind to every guest.
If you want a cheap and delicious tacos go to the front of the hotel where there is a kart selling cocktails and tacos.
We will definitely be back as my husband and I came to bali on our belated honeymoon. Next year we will be bringing our 4 children ages (7, 9, 12 and 14).
Hope this helps fellow travellers."
2533,Fantastic Hotel and Location,50,August 2016,"They were all so incredibly friendly, welcoming and helpful. It's so nice to be greeted with a lovely smile. The security men, bar staff, restaurant staff, reception, cleaners, all are a credit to the hotel. The rooms are a very good size with a large bathroom and shower, nice touches with the little extras, and especially the imaginative towel creations, that always made us smile. The restaurant where we had breakfast every morning has very good choice and quality and also served excellent evening meals as well. The pool is lovely, with a good bar, and sensibly they remove towels from loungers if they've been there too long without anyone using them.
Fantastic smaller hotel in a great location. Not huge rooms but everything is in good condition and very clean"
2534,Awesome & Excellent Stay,50,September 2016,"Courtyard gave me a free upgrade to one-bedroom suite because I'm a platinum member of Marriott. This wonderful surprise gave us an extra pleasant memory to our stay here. Staff and room services have been wonderful. Fantastic breakfast at their restaurant and we had our best spa experience at Zanti. Loved our stay here and definitely would come back again.

Great job, Courtyard Seminyak."
2535,Great Hotel,50,September 2016,"We have travelled to Bali a few times but this was our first stay in Seminyak and at the Marriott. We were all very impressed by the service from all the staff always smiling and helpful. Our room was lovely (one bedroom suite) very spacious & clean. Seminyak Kitchen offers a wide variety of options for breakfast that would suite most people we also ate here for dinner and it was lovely. Pool staff were very attentive; yes, extra sun lounges by the pool would be great and if they could fit them in I'm sure they would & there are always the 'guests' who 'reserve' a sun lounge while they go shopping for hours. Can I suggest after 1 hour if no one has returned move their belongings & use the lounge; There is a sign on each sun lounge stating they can only be reserved for 30 mins. We managed to get sun lounge's and there was 6 of us. We also had a massage at Zanti Day Spa and it was beautiful and reasonable so was the food and alcohol. We all were very impressed; just one suggestion & this is for the rooms near the waterfall & light sleepers, turn off the pump at night time. Thank you to all the staff at Courtyard Marriott."
2536,"central, clean and smooth but...",40,September 2016,"we stayed there for a week during our honeymoon. Our check-in was very smooth and quick, the room is well equipped and the bed was super comfy, we had a large TV and a decent bathroom and balcony with a small pool view (we had paid for the lowest room category so its fine). The room service is not too slow but the in-room dining wasn't the best, we had twice ordered dinner and for me pasta was a failure.

The hotel is very central in Seminyak which is exactly what we needed, their breakfast is superb, it was really something to look forward everyday: they served everything from waffles to indian to international and Balinese, I could pick from cappuccino to iced latte everyday. It was fantastic.

The pool wasn't my thing, it was always loud and crowded even at 10 am and i failed to find a proper stay. This for me was the down part."
2537,Great location!,50,May 2016,This hotel was perfect. It is on the larger scale bug rooms very modern and clean and everything you need. Beds are comfortable. Roof top pool had a great atmosphere with tunes plying and a bar for delicious cocktails. Breakfast was everything you need in a breakfast. Walking distance to beach and all the staff were friendly and helpful. Reasonably priced. I would definitely consider staying again on another trip to Bali.
2538,"Some good, some bad!",30,September 2016,"Good points first:
Clean hotel, Amazing staff who were very helpful, polite & couldn't do enough for you.
Amazing Spa, best massage I ever had, clean with great staff.
Buffet Breakfast is amazing, plentiful choices to suit all, wide range of foods for every palette. As much tea & coffee brought to you as you wished.
Bad points:
Too busy, scoupon deals bring an influx of people.
Breakfast time too busy, cues for making toast or waiting for eggs etc..
Not enough sun loungers around the pool, sometimes had to walk round several times to get a lounger & sometimes none were available. People would save their towels on them & be gone for hours, so staff need to control this better or have sufficient loungers. Worse was having bean bags poolside, how can you sunbathe on a bean bag??
No control over children sitting at pool bar or playing around that area, especially annoying if you want to order drinks or sit at the bar, again no control.
Promotional dinners expensive & food not that good.
Sadly I would not return to this hotel or destination.
The hotel knew we were disappointed & tried to compensate with free meals but it was not enough to compensate the let down."
2539,I love you guys!,50,September 2016,"It really feels like home coming back to the Marriott -- the bed is so comfortable, it's just so easy to sink into bed and not emerge! Location wise, it's within a short walking distance to my favourite bar Lucky Day, huge convenience store just directly across the road which sells everything including clothes! And for people who wish to venture out , Spa Bali is just a quick walk away round the corner from Marriott.

Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen was great, a lot of variety, and very hangover friendly. Efficient staff, no overtly bright and chirpy staff or grumpy ones, which is great for a non-morning person like me. The best part is that breakfast ends at a grand timing of 11am :) For Pokemon Go players, Seminyak Kitchen is the best spot to be as it has 2 pokestops within radar distance. Had a couple of meals there too-- Do try the mie goreng from there, it's yummy!

Very accommodating staff, nothing was ever too much trouble, such as asking for ice at 2am in the morning, and only calling for housekeeping at 9pm...though they must probably hate me for making them work overtime! :P

Special mention to housekeeping attendant Imas.... Thank you for folding me towel animals as requested and for very neatly coiling up my cables. My bear was really happy to be tucked into bed by you too! Was always a fun time coming back to the room and being amused by your handiwork :) YOU ROCK.

Thank you to John Woolley the General Manager -- Glad we managed to have a quick chat this trip and for being so open to feedback. [The WIFI signal is fantastic! Probably the best in that stretch!] You and your team have really made my stay such an amazing one! Shout out as well to Grant Young, the Director of Operations (who really does look very young!), thank you for directing me to the best place in Bali for pokemon hunting. It was a worthwhile adventure heading out :)

Watch out guys, me and my bear, we will be back!"
2540,Holiday in Bali,20,September 2016,"I might have too high levels of standards, cleanliness and service but here goes.
Reception was pretty straight forward, taken to our rooms on 3rd floor. Rooms were cramped, furniture well past its sell by date, furniture on balcony stained, filthy and cigarette burns. Two of the pillows stunk of sickly sweat. In fairness Reception tried to respond but were tardy in doing so, the replacement pillows, one black mould marks, the other a horrid brown/orange mark, again requested to be removed.
Cleaning was slap dab happy.
Breakfast was nothing to write home about, sausages were the hot-dog variety and although a good omelette an expensive breakfast. Got to say coffee was good.
Food was generally pretty good, service around the bar and restaurant too.
The layout of the pool with sun-beds packed side by side military fashion around it was a put off.
Not the normal Marriott experience by any degree, all in all a disappointing experience."
2541,Sorry to leave,50,September 2016,"Cannot say enough good things about this Hotel and ALL of its Employees, My daughter and I arrived from Uk totally worn out to be told that our reservation for Twin bed, Pool view, High floor had only been a request, therefore we had been allocated a street view room, lower level but could have twin beds.......NO NO NO, I had not booked 6mths previous and travelled this far for that, so was extremely upset ( tired beyond believe and high in expectation), however the chap on reception sorted it for us and we didnt get high up ( we got high enough though ) but did get Garden/Pool view, Twin beds and from herein the whole experience was amazing!!....Everyone is so friendly without being in your face, Staff Training is evidently of a very high, consistent standard, nothing is too much trouble for anyone, they pre-empt your every need, the rooms are fabulous, spacious, crisp, light and have everything you are likely to need on your trip, housekeeping is of high standard and friendly staff, Food choices are fabulous, for those here saying different I am wondering just what do they want because there are so many choices, Asian, Indian,Indonesian, European amongst others, every day, if you dont see it you are encouraged to ask for it and hey presto its there! there are busy times but its a large hotel with many people so not surprising, there is security every time you enter the hotel but its not at all intrusive and the security staff are polite, apologetic and friendly and most importantly there for our protection.....I do not have one complaint about this Hotel or its staff, the Pool is spotlessly clean and kept an eye on for leaves etc, theres a buzzer if you really cant be bothered to walk all of 10metres or so to the pool bar or food, you may wait a few minutes to be answered but again, busy hotel,so to be expected! also, if you insist on reserving a seat etc then going off for breakfast, off course your things are moved after 30 minutes, its not strictly adhered to but if someone is looking for a seat and theres one so called reserved but not being used, then staff will remove things so you can have the seat, I dont see that as unfair, There is entertainment nightly but finishes at approx 9pm so doesnt disturb the guests, the staff or management cannot be held responsible for customers making noise / being drunk, Theres more I could say but I think Ive given you the gist.... Would Highly, Unreservedly recommend this Hotel for all types of travellers....will definitely be returning ourselves asap, Thank you All at Courtyard at Marriott for a fabulous stay, thank you too to the Manager John for taking time out for a chat, whilst clearing and tidying the breakfast tables alongside your staff, good on you :)"
2542,"Friendly Staff, Enjoyable Stay",40,September 2016,"The room itself was of a high quality and comfort, unfortunately the television and some power plugs weren't working. We had to call the engineer and thankfully they fixed the problem. The highlight of our stay however, was the friendly staff, the most notable one was the girl named Elvin who took care of us during our breakfast and showed a very caring hospitality which we really appreciated."
2543,Beautiful Balinese people and a Warm Welcome in a Fantastic Boutique Resort!,50,September 2016,"This was our first trip to Bali. The staff - especially the staff of the Seminyak Kitchen made this trip one to remember for all the very best reasons - genuine, beautiful warm hearts with welcoming smiles every day - the staff could not do enough for us. The resort itself was very clean, modern, ice cold air-conditioned rooms - which was a pre-requisite for us! Staff and the guests here in this hotel have all been lovely - made some wonderful new friends while dining at breakfast and dinner! Extra special thanks to the lovely Sait & Ayu, Rai, Tobias, Elvin, Arini, Donni, Prisi, Saputra, Dewi, Mega, Arta (loved your suggestions for places to go), Edi & Adiw(fab Barisita - thanks for the double shot cappacino for Romy and my Chai latte every morning) and our chefs Alit (best Omelettes ever!) and Mingdu (thanks for the corn fritter and chocolate truffle). We cant wait to stay with you all again soon! We would recommend anyone stay here at this resort - you will not be disappointed."
2544,Great hotel,50,September 2016,"This is our 3 rd stay here and we were not disappointed
Had lunch and dinner and the food was fresh and delicious
The breakfast is always outstanding so much to choose from
The staff went out of there way for us
The beach staff Putu Surya was just a delight couldn't do enough for us
Even the security all were very gracious
Great job well done Mr John"
2545,Enjoyable Stay!,40,September 2016,"Had a great stay with my partner! Good location with shops and restaurants within walking distance (but still a walk from Seminyak square), and beach just down the road. Breakfast was excellent, lots of variety. Wonderful staff and clean rooms. Only down fall was we checked in at 6.30pm and our room wasn't ready?? (normal check in is at 3.00pm) so we had to wait another half hour. They offered drinks while waiting, but was still a bit annoying. Also when checking in, reception did not explain any part of the hotel, like where breakfast is, where their services were, room service, shuttle bus and just general things that a hotel normally go through during check in etc. So we were left guessing where everything was and how things operated at their hotel. But wonderful stay, do recommend!"
2546,"Awesome and convenient place to stay in Bali, highly recommended",50,September 2016,"I booked for 5 nights, hotel is near to the seminyak beach, just walking distance, the pool and the pool bar is awesome to spend you whole day , lots of activities the entire afternoon like Bingo and stuff.
I just loved the breakfast their in seminyak kitchen and the food is delicious too overall.
I planned a surprise for my girlfriend where the entire guest relation team helped me to get everything perfect.
Overall , perfect hotel to stay on a visit to Bali.
Employees like Frisca [GR] , Nyssa [GR] , Arya [HK] and Helmi [FO] are great example for perfect hospitality professionals."
2547,Love this place,50,September 2016,"This resort is fantastic,
it's close to shops and the beach. It has a very nice modern style and great air conditioning in the rooms. The pool bar is great and although you can probably find cheaper places to stay the security and staff here are really top notch.
Would defiantly recommend and stay here again!"
2548,Enjoyable stay,50,September 2016,"I stayed for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite with my husband and 2 kids aged 5yrs and 2yrs. I had won a competition through Honeycombers website for a deluxe pool view room, breakfast and massage but as we had 2 kids with us we went for the bigger room. Initially I had booked a 1 bedroom suite with pool access but after looking in the room I realised it wouldn't be suitable for our family. The main issues were the door leading out to the pool only had a turn lock that our 2 year old son could easily open. He has mild autism so is quite the escape artist and we always need a safe room to stay in. Also the main door out to the hallway had a security latch but it was just above the door handle so our son could open that too!!
I decided to pay the difference to upgrade to the 2 bedroom suite and was very impressed with the amount of space. Wasn't in as great a position as it was on the 5th floor but meant that it was very quiet and we had amazing views from our bathrooms especially of the sunrises!! We still had the issues with the doors but the balcony rail was very high so there was no issues with our son if he happened to get out to the balcony. We also used a pair of tongs to secure the latch from the inside of the door when we were in the room.
The 2 bedroom suite consisted of a huge lounge room, 2 big bedrooms both with ensuites with shower, seperate bath and toilets. The wifi was excellent in the room and when we ordered room service it came promptly and was good.
Breakfast was great but very busy at times. You were able to order a coffee to be made which was nice and I loved the smoked salmon bagels. There was no real kids area for breakfast but there was well and truly enough options to keep them happy.
The kids enjoyed the kids club which was right near the kids pool so handy to take them for a swim afterwards. Our sons nanny was able to take him in as he was only 2 yrs.
The times that we wanted to use the shuttle to the beach the buggy was available both times. The kids loved the ride and even though we didn't use the beach club it was in a good spot with lots of lounge chairs.
A couple of issues that we had were:
- We had a complimentary massage at the spa and even though the massage was great the noise levels weren't. As it is located close to the pool bar the noise can be heard quite easily even with music playing in the spa room. Offering noise cancelling headphones may be a solution here and I was disappointed to hear from a friend that she had complained about the noise at the spa a year ago and appears nothing has been done to rectify this.
- Sun loungers are hard to obtain and it wasn't even an issue of towel hoggers but the hotel is too big for the amount available. The pool area is a fun place to be but probably not the most relaxing so if you are after a quiet, relaxing holiday by the pool this may not be the spot for you.

Overall we had a great stay and I loved the position of the hotel, close to the beach and restaurants/shops nearby. We used the laundry, Warung Laundry Drupadi, just behind the hotel on Jl Drupadi and found it excellent. Also Spa Bali next to it was great and my daughter had her hair braided which was of very good quality."
2549,Nice hotel with great service.,40,September 2016,Very nice fairly new hotel with a beautiful pool. Location is convenient but probably not the best you can get in Seminyak. Standard of everything is high in line with what you would expect from a Marriot. It is a bigger hotel so there is some entertainment and enough people around.
2550,Strategically located beautiful Resort,50,September 2016,"Very Beautiful hotel in a strategic location, it is a walking distance to seminyak beach, shops and restaurants. The rooms are clean with beautiful view of the pool ( pool view rooms). We appreciate the complimentary cocktail drinks while waiting for our room. The're quite serious in terms of hotel security, your things will go on x-ray machine every time you enter the hotel."
2551,Excellent service A special shout out to F.O. Supervisor Cinko,40,October 2015,"Arrived by Taxi and immiediately checked in. We were asked to sit while we waited for a available receptionist. When we were in the room, I realized I have left my mobile at the Taxi. Immediately went to the front desk to ask for help. Mr. Cinko assisted us and inquired the approximate time we arrived at the hotel, and got the taxi license plate number from the security guards. He asked us to just relax and go back to our rooms. Long story short, the mobile phone was returned to me in less than an hour. Excellent service."
2552,An Enjoyable First Family Holiday,40,August 2016,"Hey there TripAdvisor browsers,
We purchased a great deal on Scoopon for 10 nights stay at the Courtyard Marriott Hotel in Seminyak.
I would rate the hotel as a 4 star. When we arrived late at night, we had to wait a little while before we were able to check-in. When we eventually check-in we were given verbal directions of where to find our room but it was quite tricky to locate our room as one floor splits into two and we were walking around in circles until we finally asked an employee to take us there.
The breakfasts were delicious with plenty of cuisine styles to choose from.
The wait staff were attentive and were very helpful with entertaining our 8 month old baby.
As is always the case at most resort hotels, a good seat to spend the day by the pool is a hot commodity. So you best be early to lay claim to your spot, but be warned, if you just leave some of your personal belongings on one of the deck chairs to reserve it for more than half an hour, you may be at risk of it be removed and find someone else enjoying your spot when you return...lol
Our Deluxe room was small and we were located quite close to the reception area which is also close to the bar where they have live music playing till late into the night. Not too conduct to a sound nights sleep especially when you have a little one in a cot bed next to you. The cot bed also had a hole in the side of it that could have easily allowed mosquito's to enter through. We filled it up with a wrap and used a net over the top.
We really loved the taco/wrap combo van at the front of the entrance which made delicious snacks at a reasonable price (owned and run by the Marriott).
We had a couple of massages in the hotel spa and unfortunately the ambience was not relaxing due to the pool bar music overpowering the relaxation music inside the massage suite.
The location is great and in good walking distance to outside bars, restaurants, shopping and of course the beach.
I've stayed at 5 star resorts (Double Six, Seminyak) and this is a little ways off from that level of luxury.
All in all, not a bad place to stay when a reasonable internet deal presents itself."
2553,A little bit of bliss...,40,September 2016,"A lovely hotel with good staff, good food, nice rooms (could do with a couple of drawers if you're a neat freak like me), lush pool and great location - even has a mini bus to take you to their private beach and other local places of interest. Breakfast is excellent and available until 11 am - perfect! Enjoy! Register for a Marriott card and get 20% discount on food and drinks (excludes room service)."
2554,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff",40,September 2016,"Just returned from a Fabulous 8 days in Bali . The Courtyard is ideally located for you to get around all the gorgeous restaurants and shops. Set in a quieter location away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak Square. Our room was spotless over looking the pool with large comfy bed and beautiful bathroom. We Stayed B&B and were not disappointed. The Seminyak Kitchen is fantastic with something to suit everyone. The staff in the hotel are lovely and friendly, greeting you with a warm smile and can't do enough for you which really made our holiday. Would like to mention our bartender Amil , lovely young man who gave us lots of tips of where to go when we were out and about. Our Only negative comment is that the Pool area gets very busy and most of the beds which attract the sun all day are taken quiet early. I think management should stop guests reserving beds with their towels for more than 1 hour, after that time if they've not returned I think they should be removed to give everyone a fair chance if your not an early bird. We spent most of our time in the Garden Area because of this. Just a tip about the taxi's when you're going out, use Blue Bird taxi's. they have a sticker saying Blue Bird Group on the front window screen, they are metered so you see how much you are paying. On our first 2 days we got ripped off and paid well over the odds, this is no reflection on the Hotel but just good to know."
2555,We will be back,50,September 2016,"We recently stayed at this fantastic resort! We could not fault a thing. The staff are all fantastic, super friendly and their English is extremely good. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard and nothing was a problem to the service team. They always replied with, ""no problem"". The breakfast team were also brilliant. They remembered our names, coffee and seating preference. The massages at the Zanti Spa were great too. The beach club which is only a 5-10 minute walk away is great with free water, towels and ice blocks at 2pm. A real plus to have and not common with all resorts. Getting a lounger at beach was never a problem. The buggy which takes you to beach and Eat Street is also very handy. Pool menu food is also very tasty and is conveniently delivered to your lounger at a press of a button.
The management team is very approachable and very visible within the resort which I have not experienced at other resorts I have stayed. We spoke with the General Manager, John during our stay and he is a super nice guy, very genuine and approachable. John the resort is a credit to you and your TEAM."
2556,Nice hotel with friendly staff,50,September 2016,"Great hotel in excellent location close to La Plancha beach and all other Seminyak offerings.

Big shout outs to the following staff who made an extra effort and ensured our holiday was very enjoyable: Hari,Penny and Widi.

We will be back for sure.

Keep up the good work."
2557,Standout Service,50,September 2016,"Really love this resort for so many reasons. Wifi is the fastest that I have experienced in any hotel. Rooms are spacious and contemporary. Buffet breakfast is fabulous, I follow a paleo diet and there is plenty for me to choose from. The waitstaff have great comraderie, they high five each other when they arrive for a shift. The complimentary little extras such as daily popcorn and candy floss, refreshing icy poles at the pool, golf cart rides to the beach, live music during happy hour adds to the experience. During a fire dance show one night, no guests were left standing, extra bean bags were immediately brought over from the pool area to ensure optimum comfort. There are lots of activities at the kids club to entertain younger children and a well equipped gym, water aerobics/ bingo etc for teens/ adults. John the General Manager is often present at breakfast and takes the time to chat with guests about their experience. The chefs shows pride in the presentation of food and also chats with guests. The Director of Marketing also stopped by our table at lunch to ensure we were enjoying our stay. There is such a lovely sense of community, well and truly exceeded my expectations!"
2558,Nice Hotel but...,30,September 2016,"Hotel is new and the rooms are really nice and big. Gym is good compared to many other hotels and the staff is really great and helpful (except the front desk). Pool area is ok but it feels like you are on charter trip with Germans ( every lounger has a towel/personal belonging on it at 7AM) and the volume of the music from the pool bar is sometimes just insufferable. Breakfast or rather the food is great but it's like having your meals in school, they noice level is just to much."
2559,Quick response and solution,40,September 2016,"I need to continue from my last review. After we have been somewhat dissapointed with the staff paying attention to detail I have made the effort to bring this to the attention of the manager. Kasper, was extremely accomodating in taking the time to listen to what we had to say. He appologised on behalf of his staff and assured us to pass on the suggestions. We saw improvement within the next day and Kasper followed up with us to have another chat. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I recommend this hotel if you are looking for a central, well secured hotel with 4 star service. Unfortunately, a guest has nicked my Seafolly sunvisor but that is not the hotel's fault."
2560,Pool bar,50,September 2016,Very happy great staff very efficient and friendly. Especially Chinta. Will definately return ..Rooms very modern with all amenities. Quick check in . An absolute 5 star presentation and service.great spot close to fine dining and boutique shopping. Beach few metres down the road. Great location.
2561,Good service and large rooms!,40,September 2016,"Location is walking distance to Double six beach, in a quieter side of Seminyak. Lot of spas, restaurants and shops nearby though it can be a long walk from the hotel.

Large room, great view from the balcony and great bathroom.
Rooms can be a bit of a walk from the elevator. Spa is small (4 beds) so reserve ahead as it is always fully booked. Gym is large enough - okay for a quick workout while on vacation. Large breakfast buffet and great coffee options! Breakfast is worth buying as part of package and they can do a packed breakfast for you if you're leaving early. You can also book a yoga class with them (private or group) for 150,000 or 400,000. There is also a pool and poolside bar though we were unable to try this as it closes early.

Muhtar from front desk and their manager very helpful as room wasn't available yet for early check in. Transport desk also friendly and they give you an area map that is helpful. They will keep offering hotel car however, it is cheaper to take taxi.

Wish they provided a shuttle to other sides of Seminyak like the square or other beaches as their location is a bit far. Or options for Yoga by the beach."
2562,A must stay in Bali,50,September 2016,"What a cracking hotel. The hotel is as you expect from a Marriott, clean, modern, helpful. The staff cannot do enough for you and the food and drink there is excellent, everything you want/need is available and is not too much trouble. The hotel also has a golf buggy service which will take you to three different stops which saves walking in the heat or cabs which is a real bonus. Breakfast is epic, and a free daily popcorn and candy floss service!!

We were Marriott rewards customers and was told that we had a 20% discount on all food and drink, this would automatically be added when we gave our room number, this never happened once, each time we had to remind them each time and was told to write it on the receipt, but to be honest I did not recheck on checkout if this had been deducted as it became a bit of a running joke. I would 100% return and be more conscious with the 20% off nextime!"
2563,Great place to stay,50,August 2016,"Stayed here for a second time last month. Very good rooms with nice and cold air conditioning. The pool is fantastic to just relax in and the service from the staff was brilliant. I tried to think of what to say that was bad about the place but that was too hard. If your after a sit by the pool and relax holiday hotel, this is your place."
2564,Highly recommended - Convenient location & excellent service,50,August 2016,"Service: excellent. Upon arrival we were welcomed with drinks and local sweets. Overall Friendly and helpful staffs at the hotel and Seminyak kitchen.

Location: Approx 1 hr drive from the airport. The hotel is conveniently located with only 10 mins walk to Seminyak Double Six beach and 10-15 mins to shopping & eatery district Jln Raya Seminyak and Kayu Aya.

Comfort: hotel is fairly new and room is clean. Amenities provided - toothbrush, sanitary bag, and shower cap, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Iron and its boards are available for guest's use.

Facilities: Hotel has pool bar, main pool (1.2m-1.5m in depth), baby pool. Floaties and balls are available for guests at the pool. Pool showers are also available. Free wi fi. There's also gym but didn't get chance to check it out. Hotel also offers buggy ride to nearby areas. If not mistaken, you can also hire bicycle at the hotel.

Breakfast: ""Eat your breakfast like a king"" was written at the Seminyak Kitchen entrance and couldn't agree more! I always look forward to having breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen during my stay. There's a selection of continental and oriental breakfast. The Balinese style Egg benedict is a Must try!! It's not served everyday because the egg benedict menu changes everyday. I also love the toasted bagel and hot latte. Yum.."
2565,My perfect stay in Seminyak,50,August 2016,"My recent stay of the Courtyard Seminyak from 27th August - 10th September 2016. was first class. Front desk staff, perfect. Room service, perfect. Cleaning service, perfect. Security staff, outstanding. Pool/Bar, Seminyak kitchen staff, top notch. Customers service at the pool bar was first class, I was always served within minutes of sitting down The breakfast in Seminyak kitchen, what can you say apart from outstanding in every detail the choice of food was amazing as was the service from all the staff.This is one hotel i will be visiting again The Management and all staff at this hotel deserve all the praise I can give. A massive thanks for a great holiday. Look Forward to seeing you soon."
2566,"Hotel is fine, but I would never go again",30,September 2016,"We arrived 5.30 P.M. Room was not ready, had to wait. Room was in the 5th floor. Balcony/Windows faced to the street. Constant traffic and bar/ pub noises. When we made a complaint (since we were unable to sleep) man in the front desk said that next time we should pay more (to get better room). Quite a service, I did not feel welcome at all. Also, room had terrible smell. Housekeeping was sloppy. Pool area is small and all the chairs were always reserved (with towel / book etc.) Breakfast was good. Also beach is within walking distance."
2567,friendly staff good location,30,August 2016,"We stayed here in august. First of all we went to the stones hotel in legion originally for two weeks but changed one of our weeks to go to the courtyard for the location.
The pool isn't that great very narrow and can never get a bed at all unless you are up very early.
The room we had was a suite and was excellent and good space, clean and everything you need.
When we went there to ask to change hotels they could not do enough for us to help. We are platnum Marriott members and they did everything they could to help us move. The staff were very good and so friendly. I have to say a big thankyou to Melinda,Daniel Philip and Nyssa. There are so many more but cannot remember all there names.
We would go back again but mainly for the location and the room. We didn't go around the pool but they have a buggy that takes you to there private beach which is lovely."
2568,"""Very good hotel in seminyak""",40,September 2016,"Very good hotel in seminyak area,nice swimming pool,nice room and great breakfast and nice staff...and meeting room avalaible and other facilities..strick security area to enter the hotel....great hotel!!!"
2569,My almost perfect stay...,30,August 2016,"My recent stay of the Courtyard Seminyak was almost perfect. Airport transfer to Hotel, perfect. Front desk staff, perfect. Room service, perfect. Cleaning service, perfect. Security staff, outstanding. Pool/Bar staff, meh..yes, meh..I found it difficult to get any assistances while I hung out at the pool.

Day 1, when I arrived to the lounge area there were only 3 customers in the pool/bar lounge area. I waited for service as I sat comfortably in the bar/lounge and watched staff members walk pass me and waited on the other customers. After waiting for service, I politely called on the waitress who drop off a nice cool beverage at a customers table next to me. Oh! I forgot to mentioned that I watched this waitress take this customers order, so, hopefully that gives you an idea of how long I waited. Needless to say I wasn't impressed at all since, the customer service was lacking customer service skills but it was only my first day and I just thought it was a fluke.

Day 2, I actually was able to grab a pool lounger next to the pool. As I lounged by the pool, which wasn't full at the time I found myself lounging next to 4 unoccupied loungers (2 to my right and 2 my left). I watched a pool staff member place service attendant (electronic) bells, on the all the tables next to the unoccupied and occupied loungers, excluding mine. He simply walked right passed me and placed a service attendant bell at a unoccupied areas and continued to make his way around the pool. What?? Come on now, I wasn't that hard to miss. So, I got up from my lounger and grabbed an attendant service bell and buzzed it to get some service. The same young man (who placed the service attendant bells on the tables) appeared in an reasonable amount of time and proceeded to the ask a couple who just arrived to the 2 unoccupied loungers (to my right) if they need any assistance. Huh! Hello, it was me who buzzed for service. I politely told the man, that it was I who buzzed and I asked if I may look at a menu to order a drink. He asked me if I was a guest of the hotel. Oh My! My, oh, my. I remained calmed and said yes. I also advised him, I watched him placed the service bells out on the tables and I had to grab the service attendant bell from the vacant table/lounger 2 seats away from me because he did not put one on my table. His response was, they didn't have anymore service attendant bells, that's why he skipped me. *Sigh*

I know, I should asked for this young man's name but I deal with this type of BS daily in America and I just wanted to enjoy my vacation. I just needed to take a well deserve break from my daily reality.

Now, I will say I have used the Marriott chain in the America and I have never experienced any problems. My stays have been quite pleasant and comfortable.

Will, I use the Marriott chain again when traveling internationally? Yes, I would, I will not allow one unpleasant experience outweigh future visits."
2570,GREAT HOTEL!,50,August 2016,"We stayed here in August and loved it! We felt so safe there with every bag being scanned through X-ray and going through metal detector screen every time we returned to hotel. We had a 2 bedroom room with a shared lounge and balcony. Both bedrooms had spacious bathrooms. The amenities themselves were very clean and well stocked. The buffet breakfast was delicious every morning.

The courtyard had a great atmosphere. The pool was a hotspot so sun loungers were filled/reserved everyday so you had to get in early for those.

The hotel had a great range of activities on daily from Aqua Aerobics to Bingo. Happy Hour changed daily so it was always fun to get Buy one get one free! The poolside menu was good with a huge variety to choose from. The hotel reception had a complimentary popcorn stand and candy floss stand for guests to grab some fun snacks by the pool.

We loved it and would return to the courtyard again!"
2571,Fantastic,50,August 2016,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff especially made our stay very special. Rooms are lovely all have balcony or terrace most facing the pool. Beautiful breakfast. Lunch and dinner in their restaurant also great. Huge pool with plenty of sun beds. Or if you prefer the beach there is a shuttle to private beach area. All in all wonderful,sadly we left this hotel to stay at another in Legian (Pullman) which was very extremely disappointing."
2572,perfect place to stay in seminyak,50,August 2016,Great hotel walking distance to everything friendly staff nothing to fault best breackfast i have ever had whilst traveling shutle to beach if wanted rooms clean and tidy and modern friendly staff will stay at hotel again
2573,Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort,50,September 2016,"Had a very satisfying stay there from the 22/9/16 to the 29/9/16. The first 4 nights were in a pool-side room on the lower ground floor, very convenient if you're going to be using the pool frequently, means you won't need to find a vacant cabana as you'll have your own in your front porch, however; be aware that there'll be no privacy as a lot of traffic goes by, means you'll have to have your drapes drawn most of the time so no natural light.
The remainder was up on the 5th. floor overlooking the pool, excellent room.
The daily breakfasts, nightly entertainment and the pool-bar were also excellent, as was the service.
Good location with lots of shops/restaurants at the front door and withing easy reach of Kuta and other places of interest."
2574,Little gem!,50,September 2016,"Stayed here with my bestie for her birthday and we were very impressed! Where do I begin!
- warm welcome at the front desk
- super friendly staff!
- stunning grounds
- excellent pool/bar
- great buffet breakfast
- well maintained rooms
- great location from seminyak beach
- close to eat street and they have a golf buggy shuttle to take you there!

I could go on! We enjoyed every minute of our stay in the Courtyard seminyak and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of a relaxing holiday in Bali away from all the tourist traps."
2575,"It was a truly stunning hotel, with amazing service! Very central and easy to locate everything from.",50,September 2016,"It was a truly stunning hotel, with amazing service! Very central and easy to locate everything from. We had a beautiful room that over looked the pool, the restaurant food was amazing and the breakfast the best of our trip"
2576,Great place to relax,50,August 2016,"We loved staying here. The room was large and clean and the staff kept it that way. I did the cooking lesson they offer in the hotel. Chef Rio was an excellent teacher. He explained things really well and his ""chef"" shortcuts were something I will remember. Pool area is very relaxing. So much choice for breakfast and the seafood for the special bbq they offer, was extensive."
2577,Ms,50,July 2016,My daughter and I had a lovely stay here. Loved the breakfast and it all was very new and clean. The pool was lovely too. The staff were all fantastic and I really enjoyed my cappuccino just like back in Australia.
2578,Hotel is beautiful but food not good,30,September 2016,"beautiful and clean however the food is not up to the standard. I tried in room dining twice and food looked good but taste below average, pool bar 1st time amazing 2nd waited 30m for club sandwich and it didn't come i asked and they forgot i left"
2579,Amazing resort,50,August 2016,"I recently stayed at Courtyard Marriot for 10 days with my partner, mother and friend and had the most relaxing stay. The beds were like clouds to sleep on and the poolside rooms offered an amazing view. The best part about my stay was the smiling and always attentive staff from the omelette maker to the reception staff that were all amazing. Would definitely stay here again.

Darren"
2580,Relaxing Stay,50,August 2016,"We have recently stayed at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort. The resort itself is very clean and new. Rooms are spacious and clean, fantastic big bathrooms, extremely comfortable beds. All the staff at the resort were just great, can't say a bad word at all. Breakfast buffet was simply one of the best i have ever been too. Great fresh fruits juices. Cooked on demand eggs good coffee. The pool is just what you need plenty of space with water at the right temperature to cool you down from being in the sun. Great pool bar too. Just a really great stay and super value."
2581,Seminyak Livin',40,September 2016,"Excellent hotel, we stayed there for 7 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff are amazing and really make your stay enjoyable.

Pros:
- Room is fantastic, clean and just enjoyable in general. The beds have King Koil mattresses and are amazing.
- Seminyak Kitchen serves amazing quality food, breakfast is delicious.
- Hotel runs a lot of events i.e. Jimbaran BBQ in small grassed courtyard.
- Room service menu has good options.
- Hotel security is outstanding.
- 'What The Truck' street party was fantastic.
- Hotel staff are amazing.

Cons:
- During our 1 hour balinese massage at Zanti, the peace and serenity was completely destroyed by being able to hear the music and general noise resonating from the pool area. It is not sound proofed at all. In saying this, the spa itself is fantastic as well as the service, but some sound proofing clearly needs to be implemented I mean it seems ridiculous to not have had it resolved already. Lucky this was an included massage and we did not have to pay upwards of $65++ AUD each for the session.

Areas for Improvement:
- Rooms take a lifetime to get serviced everyday, sometimes even by 5pm the rooms are not finished which is frustrating when you want to have a shower before going out and need fresh towels or amenities.
- Activities generally cost money i.e. Yoga is about $15++ AUD per person per session which seems too expensive to me when other resorts offer services like this for free.
- Not enough seats/bean bags by the pool so if you do the right thing and only go to sit when you want to use the pool then you will more than likely miss out. There are some laminated notes hanging around stating that after 30 mins any unattended personal items on chairs will be removed but we never saw this being enforced.
- Table tennis can only be played till 8pm, people are on holiday not at a school camp.
- Small grassed courtyard/area grass looks terrible. Should consider making it fake grass or using an alternative as opposed to the botched patch up jobs using a handful of turf here and there that ends up being aesthetically unpleasant.

Thanks for a wonderful first time in Bali!"
2582,Lovely stay,40,September 2016,"I recently stayed at the courtyard for 6 nights. We booked directly through the hotel which had some amazing inclusions. We were given an upgrade upon request as it was part of the deal we had booked. Our room overlooked the pool. Here is a list of my pros and cons from my experience

Pros:
-Delicious breakfast Buffett, lots of inclusions something for everyone they included western Buffett, Indian, Asian, fresh fruits, cereals, soups, eggs made fresh anyway, pancakes and even ice cream was very impressed with the breakfast
- Rooms are very modern and spacious
- security check for those who are safety conscious
- swim pool bar which we ordered a few things from all was excellent
- the gym small in size but has everything you need.
- excellent, attentive staff they are happy to assist in anyways they can
- lots of activities for those wanting to participate in them e.g aqua aerobics, bingo

Cons:
- First three days couldn't get a chair by the pool they were often reserved from patrons in the morning with their belongings so for those who sleep in or go to the pool later it can be difficult to find a sun bed. I did see a sign saying items will be removed after 30 mins but from my experience I don't think it's well monitored.
- on the Legian boarder so short cab ride into Seminyak which wasn't a problem for me but it's a bit to long to walk to the main set of restaurants in Seminyak.
- cleaners sometimes came to the room very late was inconvenient if your planning sunset drinks and need to get ready and can't because they are mid clean and its late
- I did receive a massage at the day spa the treatment was wonderful but when I left I realised I was only given a 45 min massage but you pay for 60 mins.

All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I would consider staying here again only if I could get the same deal with inclusions."
2583,No need to leave!!,50,August 2016,"I just returned from a quick weekend trip to Bali with my 8 year old daughter, we stayed at the Marriott for the first time! We stayed in a Pool Terrace room which was great for access to the Pool.
Everything was absolutely perfect, we couldnt have asked for more.
The bed - sooo comfortable, we slept so well and could have stayed in bed all day
Breakfast! wow! amazing, everything you can think of is available and is restocked throughout the morning.
Staff - oh so helpful, they just couldnt do enough for you.
Check - in - download the app and you can organise check in pre arrival - so simple
Check out - we asked for a late check out and it was promptly organised, our flight didnt leave until after midnight so we spent the afternoon just relaxing by the pool.
Pool Bar - Great selection of tasty snacks and drinks
Pool - perfect! so many options of where to sit with some shaded and some in full sun, although you've got to be early to get a good spot! the bean bags by the pool are great.
Room Service - was perfect and also speedy
The golf buggy is available for drop offs just near eat street in Seminyak - so good, no need for a taxi.
Concierge - the concierge organised airport pick up and drop off and a scooter for us for our stay.
Gym - lots of free weights and cardio machines - take your runners
Kids - fantastickids club with various activities, even yoga.. plus in the lobby there is a popcorn and fairy floss machine - big win with my 8 year old
Location - 5 minute walk to Seminyak beach
All in all the hotel is just beautiful, extremely clean and the staff are so friendly and helpful.
Highly recommended"
2584,Hospitality,40,August 2016,"We stayed three nights in this hotel and the only thing that wasn't completely to our liking was the fact that we were ""upgraded"" from a poolside room to a suite. We wondered what would have happened if we had said we don't want the ""upgrade"" because we think our other room had probably been given to someone else. The Seminyak Kitchen and Reception staff were especially helpful and the menu in the Kitchen very reasonable. The hotel is ideally located from our point of view being away a bit from the Aussie beach crowd."
2585,good location,50,August 2016,had a great stay its close to many bars and restaurants the rooms are very good suggest pool facing room the staff are very friendly and helpful the breakfast is excellent and it has a happy hour near the pool bar from 5 to 8pm buy one get one free also has good WiFi will stay again
2586,Amazing staff,50,August 2016,"We stayed with friends at this property on a luxury escape deal.

The property itself is in a good location with close access to the beach and local Restaurants etc.

However it is the staff that really set this property apart from others. They were engaged and welcoming from the Room Attendants, Pool Attendants, F&B staff, Front Office and Security Officers who always welcomed you back to the hotel with a smile.

If you have young children this is a great hotel, our friends were astounded by the level of care that was shown towards the children. Management of this hotel should be proud of the accomplishments of everyone."
2587,Hospitality at it's best!,50,August 2016,"What a great place!! The very warm welcome already started with the security inspection of the vehicle upon arrival. While the guards are seriously screening the car they are doing everything with a warm smile. Also we were presented flowers to get our attention away. All encounters with the serious security team were amazing! Thanks you for all you do!!!! Then we were checked in by Helmi, the most kind and friendly man we could hope for. I needed to see a doctor upon arrival and he made it happen right away. Also all other encounters with for example the housekeeping staff were so positive. In a very very touristic area the staff is yet so warm and friendly..
The room was really nice, I would go for a courtyard/ pool view. If I would go to Seminyak again, it will absolutely be the Courtyard!
Thanks for the experience!!"
2588,pleasent Stay,40,August 2016,"My wife and I stayed at this resort after read the reviews. We had a pleasant stay as we had friends staying here as well but i don't think I would book again only because I think i will book a resort next time. Our room could have done with up dating there were some minor stain on foot stools bathroom wall little mold on curtains etc but the bed was comfortable. The resort looks better in the hotel photo's. The one downside is that there are not enough pool side chairs to lay on to get sun so people get there early and just throw a towel on them and go to breakfast there is 30 minute time limit on them but this was not in forced. All so everyone raves about the breakfast yes it is good there is plenty of room around the food area and it has all the western and Asian foods and I must say the is that the coffee is really good. I won't book this hotel just on the breakfast reviews. the other point to keep in mind is the massage & spa rooms are near the pool bar area and at around 5 pm the have music which my wife said could be heard in the spa room and made her treatment not all that of a good experience, so keep it in mind when booking you treatment. The one thing that makes this hotel great is the very friendly staff they are brilliant nothing is to much trouble, congratulation to Grant and his team."
2589,Excellent all-round hotel stay!,50,August 2016,"Loved it - 8/10! Location is at the bottom of Seminyak, so most of the best restos are a quick $2-5 taxi ride.

The level of service was exceptional - friendly, quick, attentive and everyone is very well-informed - nothing was a trouble and no questions could be unanswered.

We upgraded on arrival to a pool-view room as it was quieter and more shielded from the sun. A worthwhile investment of $17 additional a day. The rooms are modern and brilliant - the bed is super comfy and HUGE and the selection are pillows are perfect - both latex and feather and low-medium profile. Our only criticism is about the toilet - there is no modesty - only a glass door and no sound-proofing, no fan or ventilation, no air freshener and no toilet brush. When my partner got Bali belly, it made for a very uncomfortable experience for us both.

The buffet breakfast has something for everyone! We loved the selection of both local and international foods. Our feedback here is that the texture of the sausages is very pur√©e like and not enjoyable; the coffee was very hit/miss; the soy milk is VERY sweet and not enjoyable (I can't drink milk so drank black coffee and no cereals for me)

The pool is an oasis and allows you to forget about the busy streets. Get there early to grab a loungechair! We spent 2-7hrs here daily! Our feedback here is that the bar music is really clubby and needs to be changed up a bit, especially when it is so loud during the day and early evening; the cocktails are wayyyy too sweet - every one had loads of sugar syrup in it, and minimal alcohol. The prices do not justify them, so we drank Bintang for most of our stay; the male singer at night didn't know the (English) lyrics or tune to a lot of a what he was singing, and you had no choice but to hear it in the complex... just needs a bit of a scrub up! (The female singer was awesome!)

Obviously these are all little criticisms, but overall we found it to be an expectional start to the holiday and we would definitely return.

Special mentions to Aji for trying all day to phone a beach club to find my ATM card; Widi for being a whizz in the restaurant, and Alit (who lives in Tanah Lot) for being a total dude, remembering who we were after a week and bringing us smiles and beers. But honestly, everyone was amazing.

P.S. Best food in the area...
Wacko Burger - behind hotel - burgers
Warung Ladah (The Pink Elephant) - mie/nasi goreng and sate
Moonlight Kitchen and Bar - espresso martinis that look straight to the sunset and over the whole beach"
2590,great service,50,August 2016,"first time in bali brought a deal from luxury escape friendly staff great with kids. great service .great food from seminak kitchen. shuttle bus to their private beach, shops and restaurants recommend. definitely coming back."
2591,Great breakfast,50,August 2016,"If you can ask for top floor pool side room to avoid street noise or pool noise. Noise levels are reasonable either way. Breakfast as they claim is the best and it goes to 1100hrs, no need to wake early just to get your free breakfast. Pool bar is great as well as the staff."
2592,Fantastic Hotel - great location,50,August 2016,"The Hotel was perfect for us, we were travelling as a couple with friends who had kids. The pre-arrival process was excellent. We made some room configuration requests which had all been actioned so check in was easy. We pre-booked the hotel shuttle to collect us from the airport which was waiting for us as we came through the airport - again super easy, what you want on holiday.
The rooms were great - very comfortable, functional and clean. Our room attendants did a great job. We had breakfast daily which was amazing - so many options and they even made gluten free pancakes for my partner. Service by the pool was fab - you only had to press buzzer if you wanted to order anything to eat or drink at reasonable prices for a hotel.
The staff through out the hotel were amazing - all were very engaging and seemed to genuinely enjoy their work - obviously very well trained.
We had a massage in the spa and loved the experience. We also utilised the hotel gym which was well equipped for both male and female work outs.
Our friends used the kids club and it was fantastic - they felt very confident leaving the kids in good hands while they could have a couple of hours peace to relax.
The location is also very convenient - less than 5 mins walk down to the beach and loads of bars/restaurants/shops/spas on the door step, along with an amazing Taco truck provided by the hotel.
Overall we would thoroughly recommend this hotel to any holiday makers."
2593,Great! Recommended,50,August 2016,"I choose this hotel without planning actually. But I'm enjoyed. Great!

What I liked
1) the location is good, close to Seminyak street. I think the location is strategic and central in Seminyak area.
2) the price is cheap and acceptable. Worth it!
3). The room is nice with balcony. Choose the room with the pool view. Highlight is the air conditioner in the room works well.
4). The pool is comfortable even not too many the chair pool.
5). The breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen on 3rd floor is great.
6) try the dinner all you can eat grill sea food in Seminyak Kitchen.

Recommend hotel in Seminyak !"
2594,Great Stay,40,August 2016,Booked through Luxury Escapes deal and wasn't disappointed. Hotel lived up to all our expectations. Staff were great and always obliging. Rooms were clean and modern (unsure that the bathroom layout works). Meals were good especially breakfast. Beach is walking distance away or you can use their complimentary golf buggy. Plenty of good restaurants around especially over at Eat St part of Seminyak.
2595,staff,50,July 2016,"not sure if my comments went through... We stayed at Courtyard Marriott from 18th July to 4th August, room 345. Our stay was fabulous, the staff were wonderful, there were a few people who really excelled in our opinion. KETUT TOM our transfer driver. also took us out on a day trip. KETUT TOM could not do enough for us,He was polite,full of useful information, nothing was a bother,and he had the biggest smile, we could not help but love him. Also MUHAMMAD FAHRUL, in house keeping, our room was always cleaned thoroughly, anything we needed was never a problem. he was just wonderful. Also from kitchen staff,3 people were outstanding and always made us feel like we were special. Their names were ANGUS MULYONO.he always greeted us with a smile and made sure all our needs were met. He really looked after us. Also PARWATI and JULIARTAWAN were the sweetest young adults.We would watch them as we ate breakfast. Not only were they hard working,but there manner with the guests was just gorgeous. They were polite, always greeted us with a smile and a bit of small chit chat asking about the day infont of us. we noticed we got more of there time when it was not busy,but on busy times,they still greeted us beautifully,then quickly got on with there work. The world would be a nicer place if it was full of PARWATI'S and JULIARTAWANS. THEY WERE GORGEOUS KIDS. One more person stood out,and that was ALFI on the buggy.My husband was sick for about 4 days.ALFI would ask me every day how he was. Also he would help us a lot with local information, which made it a lot easier for us to get around and know how things work in Bali. In all, we are so pleased we stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, the staff could not be friendlier or more helpful,THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU."
2596,Smiling staffs with private beach club,50,August 2016,"Just perfect.
Really enjoy my stay. Smiling friendly staffs, great swimming pool for relaxing. Private beach club endorse and try their numerous breakfast buffet... hardly resist personal ice cream. Definitely come for another vacation reason"
2597,Beautiful resort,40,August 2016,"We just came back from a 5 night stay it was a beautiful resort but upon arriving we we started off on a bad note, we booked two rooms as there was 2 couples and I wanted them close together as stated , but when we arrived we were told the hotel was overbooked and they moved us all into one room with a king in one then two single beds ? We are not happy so we asked for two rooms as requested but had to wait until about 4:30 for the other room we were a fair bit away from each other one with a pool/garden view and one overlooking traffic, we thought the room was beautiful but it was extremely noisy with traffic all night and very early in the morning ! Other wise we had a great stay breakfast with beautiful and the hotel was amazing didn't get much of a ""bali"" feel but it was nice , pool was very cold but was still nice - a special shout out to ""penny"" at the pool bar she is very friendly and welcoming !!!"
2598,A little piece of paradise!,50,August 2016,"We are staying at the Courtyard Seminyak for the first time and we love it! The rooms, staff and food are amazing and it's only a short walk to Seminyak beach (or a short buggy ride to the hotel's exclusive beach club!). Highly recommend!"
2599,Third time here,50,August 2016,This hotel is a great base and I enjoy coming here when in Bali as it is a really good location and has lovely rooms. The pool and breakfast and gym are all fantastic. It is really easy to jump on a shuttle to the beach and I often come here to work and the wifi and facilities are great.
2600,Best breakfast in Bali,50,August 2016,"From start to finish the service was fabulous! The room was spotless, spacious with the most comfortable beds (I've never slept so well) wonderful shower/vanity area and whats more, an amazing balcony view of the large ornate pool that looked stunning when lit up at night.
The location was perfect. A five minute walk to the beach and shops/bars/restaurants adjacent.
One of the best parts about the holiday for me personally was that you could hire a driver for 100,000.00000 rupiah (¬£5.77) per hour and visit as many cultural sights you can manage. Kintamani,volcanic city,along lake Batur was a breathtaking and atmospheric experience. Tanah Lot Temple, has to be seen to be believed.. Batuan Village, where famous craftsmen from the Ubud area paint beautiful pictures. Tegalallany Rice Terrace, with beautiful panoramic rice fields. The Spices Nature Plantation, where plant, herbs and spices are traditionally made by balinese farmers. A restaurant, close to the hotel that I would highly recommend is Sambal Shrimp (it's not just seafood).
I could go on but I have to save space to mention the hotel manager, John Woolley , who made our stay in Bali one never to be forgotten. I would also like to mention the staff, who had the warmest friendliest smiles and would 'bend over backwards' (well not literally!!) to help, and furthermore, the driver; of our two consecutive days of travel, Kumyang - a very patient, pleasant and knowledgeable young man. And finally.. the Marriott Courtyard Hotel, as sold to me by the manager, really did have the best breakfast in Bali amongst all else."
2601,Very nice resort in Semigniak,50,August 2016,Lovely place to stay.5 min walk to the beach lots of places to eat and shop outside the hotel. Pool access room great very good breakfast variety. Stuff friendly and accommodating .Food prices and quality in room service very good for a place like this .Will come back to Courtyard Marriot for sure.
2602,Suburban block of flats feel,30,November 2015,"Whilst this hotel is lovely, it's lacking Bali charm & character.
The long narrow pool is surrounded by the high rise apartment rooms, you can see directly into rooms opposite yours.
We had a ground floor pool access room which was nice to be able to sit on our little veranda close to the pool, however if you looked up, anyone on their balcony would be looking down.
It was a fight for sun beds as only half the pool was in sunlight, the swim up bar is almost non accessible (didn't even go in that pool)
The food/breakfast was nice, location great, added bonus was the private beach area & the buggy that would take you there or to other destinations.
We enjoyed our stay but unfortunately would not return, I'd prefer a more open/spacious hotel with typical tropical Bali gardens."
2603,Gone down hill,30,August 2016,I have stayed here twice now and unfortunately I feel the hotel has changed between visits. The staff are still extremely helpful and friendly however we had to ask for our room to be cleaned at least 4 times during our 8 night stay. It would get to around 4pm and we would still not have clean towels and fresh water. The entertainment for the kids around the pool doesn't seem to be there anymore where the kids could win prizes. I also feel the buffet breakfast has lost its wow factor as I remember our first visit having different options every day but this visit it all seemed the same every day. I feel the prices have also gone up quite a lot in the last 18 months. Also made it difficult for us travelling with 2 kids. I understand the rooms are small but if the clients are prepared and aware of that surely it's their decision. It's too expensive to upgrade to a larger room. It's suppose to be a family friendly hotel.
2604,"GOOD POSITION , CLEAN ROOMS , FRIENDLY STUFF",40,August 2016,"the hotel is situated in a very good place , 5 minutes walk to the beach of seminyak .
rooms are very clean but make sure your room is not facing the road , it is very noisy.
Half part of the pool is in shade all day . need to get a good seat early .
There is lovely nice guy by the name of Hariyanto in the gym , who is very helpful and kind .In general the stuff is very friendly !!
Make sure your deal is included breakfast !!
enjoy BALI :)))"
2605,Good location hotel near Seminyak Beach for surfing,40,March 2016,"This is a good location hotel very near to the Seminyak Beach for surfing. Especially for beginners, just hop down the beach there are surf boards and instructors for rental at a reasonable price for beginners. It was great fun trying surfing for the first time. About a 5min walk or the hotel has a golf buggie that transports guests to the beach back and fro. The pool is nice for a dip and suntanning with a drink from the pool bar inside the pool itself. Though I find the pool size a little small for any serious swimming. Lots of children when I was there so this is a children friendly hotel. Breakfast was great with good variety. There is even a free popcorn machine at the lobby for guests. The staff are well trained and attentive with good manners and attitude. I made some minor feedbacks which were attended to immediately and rectified with nice gesture. It is when a problem arises that you can see the true nature of the service. And in this regard, Marriott did not disappoint. The bathroom is modern with a good and large makeup mirror that my girlfriend absolutely adores. Only downside if I am picky is the lack of a bathtub to take a nice hot bath in after a long day out in the sun. The street the hotel is situated has a convenient store right outside and a string of bars, restaurants for some night life, and a little further down a whole street of endless shopping and more cafes and restaurants."
2606,Great location. Excellent staff!,40,August 2016,Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and had a great holiday with the family. The rooms were well appointed and the service courteous. Breakfast was interesting too and even a vegetarian like me would find good dishes in the Indonesian section.
2607,Worth it,40,August 2016,"Stayed here for 8 nights as we got a luxury escape voucher. The room, service, meals were all fantastic. The Luxury Escape voucher included: 1 dinner, 1 lunch, 1 hour massage each, 1 cocktail each night. The dinner we had was the seafood Buffett and the food was sensational, there is no complaints regarding any of the food served in the Seminyak kitchen, breakfast especially. All the staff at the resort go above and beyond to make your stay fantastic. The only negative I would have is the quality of the cocktails you receive with the voucher, but chat up some friendly staff and cocktails can be changed. Normally stay in Legian so was out of our comfort zone here which gave us a great opportunity to explore new areas. Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone to stay at the Courtyard."
2608,Right in the middle of Seminyak and great!,50,May 2016,"We have been to Bali maybe 14 times now and most of the hotels are ok. The Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak is fantastic. The manager John is seen around the premises and nothing is a problem for any of the staff. They are well trained and always want to please you. The kitchen dining is great and the staff are always accommodating in every respect.
We were in Bali only 3 months ago and stayed at the Legian Beach hotel - what a difference in terms of service the Marriott leave them for dead. The service level at the Marriott is 5 star and the prices are very reasonable. I take my hat off to John and his team you have a great formula.
We will most certainly be back!!!!
Clive and Diane Haddow"
2609,Good and clean hotel. Great kids club staff,40,August 2016,"Wen't to stay for a 3 night vacation with my 2 kids (4yo & 2yo). Stayed in deluxe pool view. Good and clean room, only the aircon was a bit uncomfortable blowing into the bed near the terrace. Tried to adjust the fan few times but still feel that it was blowing on one of our bed. Location wise, might be great for tourist wanting to walk and shop in seminyak. We didn't though and the traffic was bad in seminyak area during the week we stayed in. I personally like the kids club, clean and well taken care of and the staff was very attentive and nice. Prices of kids club, F&B was very reasonable. Overall a good experience :)"
2610,Downgrade service?,30,August 2016,"Stayed here for 3 nights. And that was my second time.
1. No welcome drink like previously i stayed before.
2. Bike rent price was different when i asked to the front office.
3. They gave me price IDR 36,000 for one bike; but when I rent it at spa section they gave me IDR 38,000 excluded service and charge.
4. They reduced for deposit value from IDR 1,000,000/night to IDR 500,000/night for Indonesian. But they charged IDR 2,000,000/night when my kiddos stayed here with his friends on july 2016 because his friends not Indonesian.
5. For parking, they didn't allowed me to park mycar by myself so everytime I want to go outside i have to wait the employee to get my car into the lobby.
6. When i checked out they cannot give me satisfied answer how long and how many days they need to return my money back.
Overall for breakfast still great and the taste never change, good hospitality. This hotel's concept for family and couple. I love it."
2611,Great breakfast buffet,40,July 2016,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom ground floor pool view room. I really liked that you could walk out the big sliding glass doors straight to the pool, there was also a private outdoor sitting area. The hotel is literally built around a pool courtyard. There are two pools, one with a swim up pool bar, that flows into a lower level pool with an infinity effect. I loved the beanbags around the edges of the upper pool. There are some noisy activities in the pool like water aerobics around 11am and at night there is live music at the pool lounge area (not the best voices). The room itself was spacious but felt somehow cold - not the temperature, more the generic, rather hard furnishings. Really did not like the pillows! It is a big hotel, good security which is appreciated these days. Huge buffet breakfast on offer with east and west style foods, with added bonus of being able to order a latte or cappuccino. Room service was good, taking about 45 minutes to arrive. The hotel offers a shuttle service to the beach where they have their own space and also to the top of Eat Street. There seemed to be a broad demographic, from young families to older couples, and groups during my stay. It was pleasant enough and what you would expect from a big hotel."
2612,Absolute Awesome Holiday,50,August 2016,"Having been to Bali more than 30 times over the years, this time we organised an 8 night holiday with Luxury Escapes & what a holiday it was. From the night of arrival to the day of departure & everything else in between the Courtyard could not have done more.
Seminyak Kitchen (the breakfast selection is unreal but the Eggs Benedict & the barrista coffee was a stand out). As were all the staff. Try the ""Bloody Mary"" burgers & chips for lunch.
Afternoon Lemongrass cocktails or an ice cold beer around the pool is also a great way to prepare for the evening.
Another must is the stunning Zanti Retreat for an oustanding massage. Couldn't get enough of them.
Thanks Courtyard, ""we'll be back""."
2613,Good value,40,August 2016,"Could not fault the service or amenities of this hotel. We booked through Luxury Escapes and were not disappointed. Rooms were not as big as other hotels we have stayed at in Bali but adequate and comfortable and clean. Security was very tight which was reassuring. Great location being only minutes away from the beach and less than a 10 minute walk to the main street and a 15 minute walk to ""Eat Street"" in Seminyak. Overall a terrific stay here and would book again."
2614,Simply WOW!,50,August 2016,"Stayed in this hotel on August 6th to celebrate our son's birthday. Based on that visit, we can honestly say that everything about this hotel is WOW!

Even though we have stayed in other Marriott properties before, We have never got the chance to stay in a Courtyard property. Consequently, we didn't really know what to expect from this hotel. At the end, this hotel exceed our expectations from all aspects.

We drove our own car to the hotel. During the security check at the entrance, flower petals were given to us as a welcome gesture. Just one example on many little good things about this hotel that made this hotel stands above the others. Even other ""more high-class"" hotels in Bali that we have visited before, didn't do this this when welcoming their guests. This small gesture really made you feel welcomed even when you were only at the entrance gate.

During check-in, we were assisted by the Front Office Manager (Daniel) himself. He was a very attentive and welcoming person. Cheerfully explained to us the different facilities of the hotel. His positive attitude really made you feel want to directly stay-in at the hotel to try all of the facilities. Welcoming drinks were also offered and to our surprise, they've had 3 or 4 different choices that include hot, cold, snd even bottled beer!

The Guest Relation Officer (Eka) took us to our room and also shared the same welcoming and cheerful attitude like the other staffs. Genuinly wished our son happy birthday. It really made our son happy as it made him feel special. Really appreciated it. Once we have arrived in our room, the bellperson (regretfully we forgot to memorize his name, but he was also nice and always smiled even though he single handedly brought 5 of our bags) have arrived at the same time. We didn't even have to wait for our bags when we enter to our room. Kudos for the room division management! Bear in mind we arrived on a Saturday at 3pm, which we understand is the busy check-in time. Really beyond our expectations.

The design of the room is a mixture of contemporary design and traditional Balinese elements. The room is well-lit from the natural lights came in from the window. The balcony is quite ample with a relaxing outdoor sofa for 2 persons and a place to hang your wet clothes. Really huge flat screen TV for the size of the room. The bluetooth ipod dock is really much appreciated. The bathroom (again to our surprise) is very well equiped. Hair dryer, iron with the board, and weight scale  are also provided. Now one thing about the weight scale. We recently stayed at other Marriott property in Bali, which supposedly is on the higher hotel class. That hotel didn't provide weight scale.

Contrary to some previous reviews that mentioned that the rooms in this hotel are not really sound-proofed. We actually experienced the exact opposite. Our room was located on the 2nd floor right across from the semi-outdoor hotel bar that features live-music every late afternoon. We wanted to hear our own music using the ipod dock and once we closed the window shut, we didn't hear the live-music from the bar at all.

We checked out the hotel's pool after we settled in. The pool is actually separated to three different zones. A more-adult zone located next to the semi-outdoor bar with the lounge music is located on the upper deck of the pool. The more family oriented zone is located on the lower deck and the kiddie zone is located next to it. This is actually a very smart layout since different guests can choose different sides of the pool based on their different preferences. For us who came with a 3 year old boy, wefeel more comfortable hanging out with other guests with families. While we are also sure that the guests who prefer more quiet pool ambiance also appreciated the fact that our son's enthusiasm and loud voice didn't bother them. By the way, the kiddie zone of the pool is equipped with plenty of beach pools and located next to the Kids Club.

We ordered some food from the pool bar. Cocktail's size was huge. The chorizo pizza was delicious and the fries presentation was cute (they served the fries on a mini deep-fryer container). Prices were ok and with this kind of presentation, we can feel the added values.

Now, my wife who've made our reservation has briefly mentioned to the reservation agent (Dwi) that we will celebrate our son's bday. Again to our surprise, a birthday cake was already being prepared in our room. Now we intentionaly say a birthday cake, not a slice of birthday cake since the cake was actually a huge size. A plate of macaroons, and a birthday present from the kids club were also prepared. This gesture really made our son happy and this became the highlight of his whole birthday celebration. Thank you so much Dwi! We also appreciate the hand-written birthday card from you and your team.

We ordered in-room dining for dinner. The Nasi Goreng was plentiful and has nice taste. As for the fish&chips, well if there is one thing that we feel can be slightly improved about this hotel is the taste of the fish&chips. The fish is a bit hard. But this is really minor, as they served really tasty tar-tar sauce. The portion was also in good size. We actually planned to go out to Seminyak area but ended up to just stayed-in enjoying the comfy bed with the music from the ipod dock. Again, no loud noises from outside even though the night was still young.

Breakfast was really really excellent and on a class of its own The varieties of the food offered is simply mindboggling! To name a view: 4 types of bagels, 4 kinds of fresh juices, 5 kinds of cold cuts, waffles&pancakes with different flavors of ice cream, an Indian food section, Indonesian food section, plenty of fresh fruits and so on. The list doesn't stop there. Also, fresh cappucinno also being offered. Taste and quality also matched the quantity. Simply one of the best breakfasts we ever had.

Upon check out, Eka from GRO was there to assisted us and she was able to remember our names. She personally arranged to get the valet team picked up our car. She also offered pop corn to our son to cheered him up (who was very upset because we have to leave the hotel).

Everything about this hotel is simply WOW from the very beginning right until the end. We will certainly return to this hotel the next time we stay in Seminyak area. Not only because our son has literally been asking us non-stop when we will be coming back to Courtyard Seminyak. But because we can't wait as well."
2615,Not impressed,10,August 2016,"If you like a lot of noise during the day and horrible screeching singing a night this is the hotel for you! Although check in is 3pm, if you would like to hang around in the hot lobby for a further 15 minutes and only then get a room because you kicked up, you will be very happy here. This is not for the faint hearted or fussy traveller. I feel sorry for the lovely staff because it is the management that have created the less than favourable stay for us."
2616,Fabulous Service and Friendly Staffs,50,June 2016,"It was our first time stayed at this hotel. Our first impression was the security check they do to all people who is going in to the hotel included their employees then the second thing was their welcome treat that we never expected at all.
We love design of the room, perfect size, large bathroom.
It is a Great Resort with a Great Services, Great staffs and friendly all the times, it was hard for us to leave with all these wonderful experiences we had."
2617,Great stay.,50,August 2016,"This is a great place to stay. Right near the beach and lots of good bars restaurants. The rooms are lovely.
The pool is really nice with a great pool bar and service. Staff are very helpful with arrangements.
It also has its own spot on the beach so people can't come and try and sell you stuff while you're there."
2618,Holiday,50,August 2016,"Great place to take a holiday staff are so friendly and treat you with greatest respect, staff members HARI PENNY ANGGA ALIT GAYA will make you feel more than at home.. Most defiantly will recommend this place to everyone looking for an amazing holiday !!!"
2619,Excellent service,40,July 2016,"This hotel is very thorough in security checking all vehicles and people into the resort. Service from the staff was excellent and they were very helpful and friendly making for a wonderful stay. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed.

We booked a package deal via Luxury Escapes and received all parts of the offer as expected. There were no issues at all in the bookings, airport pickup, or vouchers.

If you really love the sun baking around the pool, this is probably not a recommended hotel as the pool is in between the building and thus lots of shade at this time of year. On the up side, when you want to escape the heat and cool off, it was the perfect spot.

Breakfast was consistently pretty good. We had lunch a few times at the bar area. One day it would be excellent, the next, even though we ordered say an identical meal, would be less than average. It was very hit and miss and at one point had to send the lunch back...they did replace it, but we had invited guests for lunch so did not leave a good impression.

I would definitely book a pool view room at this hotel, as the rooms facing the street appeared to have a poor outlook.

The equipment in the gym was in very good condition so well worth a morning visit.

The hotel was very well priced for the quality of the facility."
2620,Fantastic Staff!,50,July 2016,"Great Resort with great food, but what set it apart from other great Resorts was its staff. From the front when you arrive to everyone you encountered when staying there they were excellent. Friendly, above and beyond helpful and always smiling."
2621,Love it .... Love it ..... and Love it,50,August 2016,"Stayed with the family for 4 nights during the 1st week of Aug. I kept my hopes low as I didn‚Äôt want to be disappointed but I have to admit its a GREAT place to stay.

We opted for a suite which came with a comfortable bed and clean room. Breakfast was great, pool was great (especially the kids pool) and even the kids club was impressive.

We had in-house dinner on the 2nd night (Seminyak Kitchen), took about 15-20 mins but food quality was great and taste like we were back in Sydney.

Security screens you every time you come back which I didn‚Äôt mind as it added peace of mind and beside the guards were pretty cool

They've allocated a small section close to the check-in counter which provides free popcorn and cotton candy, a delight for the kids

Location is fantastic and only a short stroll to the beach, its also surrounded by local shops and eatery so you still get that local Bali feeling

Staff are welcoming, friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this hotel and without a doubt would certainly stay here again"
2622,Great Hotel,50,August 2016,"Got a fantastic deal with Scoopon but would have booked here regardless. Staff very accommodating, well located close to beach for an afternoon stroll to watch the sunset.
Rooms nice and neat and great bathroom with good bench space. Scales were great as they said I was 10kg lighter than I really amüëå.
Really good breakfast and a great coffee each morning.
Pool area and seating very relaxing, also the pool bar area had a live band each afternoon really enjoyable. Lunch menu and drinks also very reasonable."
2623,Home away from Home !!!,50,August 2016,"This is my fifth stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak, and each time the service is consistently excellent. The resort is just 2 years old.
To start with, security is very thorough, then all guests and visitors have to go thru a security screening, I like the fact that the hotel is taking the guests safety and security very seriously.
The lobby is airy, bright and have a fun atmosphere and you will have the view of the courtyard and the swimming pool with a a sinking bar, which seems to be very popular. It's always refreshing to hang out and have a swim after a hot day outside, and we never have any problem getting deck chairs or bean bags to lay on.
The stars of the resort however is the staff. BEST service at any hotels I have ever stayed for both leisure and business. They are exceptionally attentive, nothing is too much trouble and they make sure you have the best stay. We were greeted with a smile every time we see a staff member from housekeeping, security or maintenance. Reception was always friendly, informative and helpful. The restaurant staff will know you after your first breakfast and remember your name. Special mention for Anton, Agus, Saih and Arja. And there's a freshly squeezed juice available.
Great locations within a very short distance to the beach, shopping, restaurants and bars, there's a free shuttle available at your request to the beach club located near Cocoon and the shopping street.
Wifi is free for guest, fast and strong anywhere in the hotel, and there's a decent gym with cardio and weights, and a great spa with reasonable price.
Will definitely recommend anyone to stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak and looking forward to stay there again when I come back to Bali."
2624,Not as good as expected.,30,August 2016,"We arrived at 1am in the morning and at checking in were told that the interconnecting rooms which we had booked 11 months ago were not available.We booked the rooms because we have two children aged 10 and 12 and obviously we wanted them with us.We were told that their room was 3 rooms away! Not happening! I was not impressed at all,so after requesting again for interconnecting rooms my request was granted.We were given rooms facing the street and waited until 3am for them to come and unlock the interconnecting room door.It took 2 phone calls and 2 visits to front desk for this to happen.The noise in these street facing rooms are terrible,we barely slept the first night and struggled with the second night.This is when i can say something positive,we spoke with Daniel at front desk and he changed our rooms to pool facing 6th floor,then it felt like we were part of the Hotel and started to enjoy our holiday.
Not what i was expecting as we have stayed at Marriott Hotels several times before.Will not stay here again."
2625,Pretty good but not amazing,30,August 2016,"Preferred Marriot Courtyard in Nusa Dua over this one in Seminyak. Overall the stay was pleasant, nothing out of this world as some people seem to be claiming. I really believe this hotel is overrated for the price and the name. I'm judging it on my families person experience and judging it against many other hotels I've stayed at on my numerous visits to Bali over the last 7 years as well as hotels in 35+ countries I've been lucky enough to visit over the years.

Positives

*Lovely varied food selection at breakfast time. Great service from Jesse and Jordy.
*Very clean and modern rooms.
*Good location near to the beach.
*Small kids club.
*Small gym (although very limited equipment).
*Security checks/xray your bags each time you enter the hotel grounds (Can get a bit annoying but needs to be done. Feeling of safety is worth it).
*Free buggy transport to eat street.
*Comfy clean beds.

Negatives

*Pool area in the afternoon is in the shade, making the water very cold for swimming (as others have previously mentioned).
*Sun loungers are all cramped in next to each other and there still isn't enough sun loungers to go around. You cannot move them as there is not enough space. No privacy to chat even quietly to your partner or family.
*Staff are hit and miss. Some very helpful, some are useless and very hard to understand. English communication was either excellent or very poor from the staff. I spoke slowly and clearly in my native English language. Dewri on the front desk was very helpful though.
*Food and drink is expensive then you have to add 21% for service and tax on top of this. Common practise in Bali I know but prices before tax were inflated.
*Marriot decided to have their 2 year opening/anniversary celebration on 12th Aug. This was inside the grounds of the hotel. This was for their staff. Hotel guests were not invited. Yes we were advised this was going to take place upon checkin but if I objected to it, it would have still gone ahead anyway, as it did do. Loud music, alcohol freely flowing, loud noisy, intoxicated staff members on their day off partying, all taking place inside the grounds which paying guests should be allowed to use. The music kept my young kids awake until approx 10pm. I think it was wrong of the hotel to use the area paying guests would normally use but were not allowed to while this event was happening. Why not book a venue somewhere else instead of disrupting the paying guests holiday? Unprofessional and bad customer service Marriot Seminyak!"
2626,"3 Star Motel Quality, Rowdy/Horrible Atmosphere, & Dirty, Really Dirty",10,August 2016,"This is a hotel of poor standards that is at best a 3 star quality motel, with a rowdy spring break-like atmosphere, and severely lacks any degree of cleanliness in the rooms.

There are no positive aspects to highlight here; the favorable reviews on trip advisor aren‚Äôt for seasoned or luxury travelers.

The first thing I encountered when walking into this hotel is a person vomiting on the way to his room because he has clearly had too much to drink.

I am not normally so harsh of a critic, but this hotel was so terrible that it forced me to change my plans and duration of my stay in Bali. My expectations of a Courtyard by Marriott weren‚Äôt high to begin with, but based on my previous stays with Courtyard in the US, I excepted just the minimum baseline expectation of any basic motel/hotel: room cleanliness, decent atmosphere, value for money, and location. I‚Äôll break it down below.

Housekeeping hasn‚Äôt failed so poorly as it has in this hotel. I changed 3 rooms and found each room to be extremely below the standards of cleanliness. I finally agreed to the third room because of how tired I was and the staff failing to understand that a toilet with brown stains is just not considered clean.

Failures of Housekeeping:
All 3 rooms had toilets with brown stains (aka haven‚Äôt been cleaned with toilet brush) along the toilet bowl
The bed linens (sheets, duvet cover, and pillow cases) are visibly dirty with makeup stains, pen stains, dirt, and/or hair
Table/desk and couch have stains of mugs, cups, and glasses and the desk/table in the first room has marker and pen hearts drawn all over, simply wiping it down with Windex could easily remove these stains ‚Äî how do you give a room to a patron like this?
Bugs, yes, to be expected in a tropical environment, but leaving ant/roach spray in the room? No one wants to see this
The sink area wasn‚Äôt cleaned and clearly showed makeup stains including liquid black eyeliner along the mirror
Fingerprints all over the mirror and sliding door (not just one) - come on, just use glass cleaner!

Rowdy/Horrible Atmosphere
Someone vomiting on the stairs is just disgusting and its just not meant to be okayed or downplayed by the staff who was assisting us to the room. This was followed by his loud friends who drunkenly walked behind him.
It‚Äôs very noisy, there are a lot of children and rooms are paper thin, so you can pretty much hear everything going on in the adjacent room.
I understand they take security very seriously in the hotel and in Bali, but going through TSA every time you leave and come back to the hotel, even if it‚Äôs for 5 minutes, is just too much. Some might like this, but after traveling so much, the last thing you want to do is come back to your hotel and completely empty out your pockets, scan your purse, and walk through a metal detector.

Poor Value for Money
This hotel is classified as 4.5 star according to TripAdvisor and appears to be a mid-range, value for money hotel, but it is not.
We booked the terrace room with a breakfast plan because I absolutely hate being on the ground floor directly in front of the pool, everyone knows that this is most likely going to be loud and busy area, the money/cost was not an issue - peace and quiet was.
- We received an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù by the front desk to the ground floor. How is a an upgrade going 3 floors down? An upgrade is considered to be a superior room, higher floor, or superior amenities ‚Äî going down 3 floors all over the world is considered to be a downgrade! The room quality irrespective of all the problems is just so poor it‚Äôs just not good value at all.
2. Breakfast is horrible. I am actually shocked by the standards which people found this acceptable. I usually eat a simple breakfast, a croissant and coffee. My croissant was stale, so I tried something else, which also turned out to be stale. I continued this until I discovered the toast, muffins, croissants, bagels, basically everything in the bread/pastry area was stale. It took about 10 minutes of waiting for coffee to be served, finally I got up and actually asked the waiter. This is no big deal though, but my patience at this point was starting to wear out.

Location
The location is close to many restaurants and bars, but it isn‚Äôt ideal for a laid back or peaceful vacation.
Directly adjacent to this hotel is another building and there literally just a metal fence dividing the two buildings, looks like a cage/jailed enclosure. No direct sunlight at all.

Lastly, the staff did try to apologize for our poor experience, but we had already made up our minds that we wanted out of this hotel as soon as possible. A manager, Mr. Young, was extremely understanding and really listened to our suggestions and complaints. He did make some compensation, but it truly wasn‚Äôt equivalent to our dismay or the cost to completely change our itinerary. Quiet frankly, our entire experience in Bali was tainted by the negative experience in this hotel."
2627,Very nice hotel,50,August 2016,"Stayed for 3 days with friend
Room is clean and spacious with good bed.
Have iron so if you need you can iron your cloth
Bathroom is large with great shower (standard and rain shower)
Food is very delicious and have many variety
Have big pool for swim

Locate neer mini market so easy to buy snack or something you need"
2628,VERY HAPPY!,50,August 2016,"STAY HERE!

My husband and I were very very very impressed with this hotel, we stayed here 07/08/16 - 12/08/16. Last year we travelled for 3 months and this is one of our favourite hotels we've stayed in so far.

- very clean room (560)
- clean bathroom (absolutely no sign of mould)
- comfortable bed
- cute little balcony seating area
- AMAZING breakfast
- security screening every time you enter premises
- friendly staff
- great location
Turn right and it's a 5min walk to the beach where you can find lots of beach front restaurants to pick from.
Turn left and you're close to a lot of local street stores, massage and more restaurants (also convenience stores right outside the hotel)
- 10 min drive to Kuta and the higher end of Seminyak where Potato head is located

- The only thing I can complain about is the pool area doesn't get enough sun, majority is only on one side and there's not enough sun beds to accommodate for guests

Overall a pleasant stay and would definitely return to this hotel :)"
2629,Great location!,50,August 2016,"Location : Great. 30 mins from airport. Hotel offers buggy drop to beach, eat street and shopping district.

Rooms : Comfortable and well designed. Like the extra storage in bath room.

Service - warm and friendly

Pool - Large and great for sun bathing

Food - Buffet restaurant is very extensive.

Super value for money. We will be back."
2630,Short stay holiday,40,August 2016,"This place is lovely, staff are beautiful and kind. It was fantastic for our child free trip, but don't think there is enough pool side room for the number of guest staying there.
We stayed in a room on the street which was very noisy.
We would stay there again, but next time request another room away from the street."
2631,Great getaway,50,August 2016,"Stayed here recently with some girlfriends in a 2 bedroom suite. The hotel was great, we loved the pool, great location, breakfast was amazing. Service was good, no drama bringing water, ice etc up to room. Activities were fun, we loved aqua aerobics, although cocktails at swim up bar was our favourite! Security was tight and sincere and appreciated."
2632,Awesome Hotel,50,August 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights in beginning of August and it was one of our highlights on a 3 week trek through Indonesia

We stayed in a suite and the room was very clean, and well maintained.

The breakfast was one of the best spreads and also dinner was very tasty and affordable.

The pool was a highlight and the kids loved the kids pool which gave us endless entertainment. The only downside of this hotel was the pool towels. They didn't smell nice at all and seems they weren't washed properly

Security in this place was good as you always had to be screened when returning with bags. I saw quite a few hotel visitors seemed annoyed but we thought it was great and added a piece of mind

Would definitely stay here again"
2633,One of the best!,50,August 2016,"I recently stayed here for 3 nights in August.
Not only is this hotel in awesome location (short walk to the beach, surrounded by restaurants and shops) but the facilities at the hotel are superb!
The staff are so welcoming and friendly and made our stay super enjoyable.
10/10 would recommend and would definitely stay here again."
2634,I Like it so much!! will come back this year,50,September 2015,"actually I supposed to review this hotel last year..because it's been more that a year..however better than late than never..This is the place That Me and my little family will definitly come back..the rooms was spacious, and have balcony, the pool was great with nice pool bar and only 10 minutes walk you can reach the seminyak beach..all the staff are friendly and helpfull and they are definitely work with integrity especially the HK team. the breakfast also great so many varieties and taste yummy..well overall I really like rhis hotel so much."
2635,"Modern, Sleek hotel with great service and amazing breakfast",50,July 2016,"Seminyak can be tricky to find a decent hotel when shelling out good money. We found hotels charging a lot of money but the finishing were not that great. Marriott was different as you would expect.

The service was good - even though we did not have a booking when we walked into the hotel, after some shifting about the manager was able to check us in right away - that was the only hiccup.

The location of the hotel is really good with shops and bars near by. 2 mins walk down the road to the beach with a buggy taking you to the private beach area offered by the hotel on Seminyak Beach.

This was the highlight for us as the beach was quite crowded. Having a small private area with dedicated sunbeds, free water and ice lollies was a nice touch.

Right outside the private beach area you can get surfing lessons from some really friendly guys at a good price (do haggle to get a decent price).

The breakfast was sublime - fresh coffee, all kinds of breads, eggs, pancakes - I could go on!

My girlfriend was too lazy to have breakfast in the dining hall on the first morning so I asked if I could take a couple of plates to the room - no problem at all - this is quite rare for big chain hotels.

The pool area was great but we didn't spend much time there as we prefer the beach.

A minor downside (but a positive also) is the extensive security getting in - airport style screening - but it makes you feel safe and the screening staff are so friendly that it takes the hassle away.

Staying at the Marriott also means that all the drivers know where to drop you off -but at the same time makes haggling a little more difficult. By end of day 1, it was the fun part.

You could get a similar boutique hotel for a cheaper price in Seminyak but you pay for the service and quality in a hotel like Marriott - something which we definitely were really happy with,"
2636,Thank you,50,August 2016,"Firstly, I would like to thank Rhio Saputra (Head Chef Extraordinaire) for the 6x‚≠êÔ∏èvariety, quality, service and friendliness at Seminyak Kitchen.

And then there is Maria and Chinta at the Pool Bar. Without their advice, guidance and help we would never have had the greatest holiday of our lives. This was the first holiday that my husband and I have had (without children) for 30 years and Maria in particular went out of her way to make us oldies feel comfortable, relaxed and special. Rhio, Maria and Chinta we thank you and because of you all we are now planning on returning next year for a longer period. Kaye and Tim Bray, Australia."
2637,Fantastic hotel!,50,August 2016,"We stayed here for a week, our 1st time in Seminyak, previously stayed in Kuta. This hotel is fantastic, very centrally located for the beach and local restaurants, bars & shops. Hotel provides a buggy to their beach club and eat street! All the staff without exception have been amazing and made our stay such a great experience, nothing is too much trouble, from the great service in the pool bar (big shout out to Chinta and all the other pool bar team who looked after us so well, always a cold drink and great food!) to the breakfast staff at Seminyak kitchen who worked miracles feeding everyone, always a smile and time for a chat! The cleaners who kept our room spotlessly clean, the lovely guys at the front desk and transportation who went out of their way to help with our airport transfer, thank you Hanri (sorry if I spelt your name wrong.) we have had an absolute blast, and can't wait to come back!! Hopefully before Christmas! See you then üòÄüå¥‚òÄÔ∏èüçπ"
2638,Nice hotel and great location,50,August 2016,"The overall was good and friendly staff. Housekeeping need some attention, Clean but kept forgetting to replace items in the room. Location is good, few mins away from beach and shopping.

Thank you for dropping off my birthday cake in my room. The hotel employees were very friendly and super helpful.

Fantastic location, fantastic people and we had a wonderful time."
2639,Excellent!!!,40,July 2016,"I am really happy to have chosen this hotel in our recent visit to Bali.
The best of the hotel is the people, because since we arrived they made us feel like a part of their family. The marvelous workers, always with a big smile are always ready to help you.
The room is big and confortable.
The swimming pool is good but you only have sun during the morning.
The breakfast is very good, you can find a big variety with high quality.
The Beach is next to the hotel, they offer you a free transport to the beach club, exclusive for the hotel's clients. In the Beach club you will have free towels, free mineral water and is open from 10:00 to 18:00. If you want to go by walk you can do it, it is only 10 minutes from the hotel.
In the beach club the kindness of the people continue because the guy that works there is fantastic.
In the main entrance you can book a private car with driver to go around the island. We have done it and we have had the good luck to have the best driver ""Ariana"" if you want to visit wonderful places ask for him. It is a little bit expensive but you will enjoy it.
The only negative thing is that the hotel does not have night activities, if you want to drink something, listen music, etc... after 22:00 you have to go out because the pool bar close.
I recommend 100% this hotel and we will be there in our next visit to Bali."
2640,Wonderful stay with outstanding service,50,July 2016,"Everything about this hotel was superb. Great variety at breakfast and a reasonable choice from the pool bar and the 'snack truck' near reception. Check out the tick menu at lunch as well, great value and quality. Room was fab as we had a ground floor room with a terrace straight onto the pool area. Didn't eat in the restaurant during the evening as we prefer to visit the local restaurants. Huge thanks to all the staff who were just wonderful, we were treated like royalty. Special mentions for Ari, Chinta, Maria and Penny. We had a magical time in Bali."
2641,Expected more.....,40,August 2016,"Having travelled extensively in Asia over the last few years we expected more from a $200/night hotel. Seminyak is an expensive area and the hotel is very good so maybe I am nitpicking but....
- No bottled water in the car when we were picked up from the airport,
- no welcome drink or cool towels on arrival,
- room layout is not convenient with nowhere to put your suitcases,
- blackout curtains are great but light comes in through the glass window in the bathroom door waking us up in the mornings.
- sound carries way too much from the bar and from the pool and the sliding doors seem not to seal well letting in a lot of noise. Our room was on the 5th floor on the north end of the hotel furthest from the bar and we could hear the music from the bar clearly. I could hear every word that parents said to their kids in the mornings at the poolside never mind the screaming ones starting before 8am sounded like they were right outside our room.
- difficult to get pool chairs,
- similar to many hotels in Bali, the pool is surrounded by rooms on all 4 sides which means there is not much of a view nor is there much privacy.
- I sent a message before our arrival to notify the hotel that we didn't want any feather pillows or comforter in the room as my husband is allergic to feathers but on arrival everything had feathers.
The good things:
Location is really good (this is why we chose this hotel) - 10 minute walk to the beach, 20 minute walk to the Marriott beach club, having access to the beach club is great, 20 minute walk to Eat Street, just steps to restaurants, massages and shops, staff are really friendly and all seem to speak English very well, room is modern and clean, great bathroom, free shuttle to the beach club and to shopping/restaurants is awesome. Breakfast had a good variety and felt like you were in a restaurant not a hotel buffet."
2642,Make sure you get an early night!,30,August 2016,"Just finished a weekend stay at the Courtyard Marriott. The real pluses of the place are the hotels location in one of nicest parts of Seminyak. Housekeeping was good and the room quality very good. There is enhanced security at the hotel both for guest arriving on foot or by car. However there are a number of real downsides. We arrived at the hotel just after 3:00pm only to be told our room was not ready. Check in time is 3:00pm. We were told the room would not be available until 3:30pm. We asked about the cost of adding breakfast but at Rp520,000 was just too expensive given the plethora of good bistros surrounding the hotel with much cheaper options.
But the real downside of the hotel is noise. We asked for a really quiet room and I honestly think we were given the best they had. But come 7:30 the crescendo of noise came from housekeeping, slamming doors, pulling trolleys, and chatting. The problem is the hard surfaces to the corridors where noise resonates freely. Add to this screaming kids at the pool from 8:00am onwards every morning means, despite the pluses we cannot take another stay at the Marriott."
2643,Lovely hotel 5mins walk away from Seminyak beach,40,August 2016,"I enjoyed my 2 night stay here thoroughly. This resort is tucked away a little distance away from the hustle and bustle of seminyak square.

The room was excellent. I booked a pool terrace room. Room was well kept and the bed was comfortable. There was no bathtub but the shower area was spacious.

The breakfast was mediocre and very crowded. The staff were friendly and helpful.

Other than that, I would love to return to this resort again."
2644,Very comfortable hotel with excellent staff,40,August 2016,We stayed for 8 nights and had a wonderful time. All the staff were so helpful. I would especially like to commend Hariyanto who works at the gym. He went to so much trouble to help me with exercises to help a back injury; even coming in early on our last day so I could have a final session with him.
2645,Fabulous hotel with fabulous staff!,50,August 2016,"This hotel just excels in all areas of customer service, facilities, cleanliness & location. Nothing was too much trouble for them even when we needed to stay longer due to the volcanic ash cloud. Its oodles atmosphere and class."
2646,Great family resort!,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the resort for 6 nights in July 2016. Everything in the resort was great. Good facilities and fantastic staff. The staff is the key to what makes this such a great resort. Our 16 month old son had a great time and was made to feel at home especially in the Seminyak Kitchen restaurant. Special mention to Agus, Sutiarja and Ede from the restaurant staff who were so good to us. Our boy loved seeing them every day. The best thing about the hotel is the breakfast. One area for improvement is the temperature control in the kids pool. Because it is under the shade the water is very cold. The resort is ideally located in Seminyak. The resort is perfect for those travelling with children of any age. In summary, we wouldn't stay anywhere else while in Seminyak."
2647,Big Tick,50,July 2016,"I stayed here for 2nts with friends at the end of July. It was a last minute change of hotel and I am so happy we moved. I was so impressed with everything at the hotel.

LOCATION: Great location. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping at their doorstep. 'Eat Street' is either a 15min walk away thought the back way (not good walking roads tho), or a very short cab ride (meter $30,000/$3). Another landmark in the other direction is Bintang Supermarket which is a 10-15min walk without stopping all on sealed footpaths. The beach is one block down so 2-5min walk max. The hotel also has their own beach section via shuttle (didn't do this). I give this hotel top marks for location!

RESORT: I have to say this place was fantastic. Not overly big just a good size with a great atmosphere. 3 pool areas that all connect - kids at one end, main pool in the middle and the pool/bar on the upper tier. Pool area gets more sun earlier in the day and late afternoon is shaded. Plenty of pool chairs around the pool, beanbags around the pool bar and a lovely grass area with more chairs and a great area for kids to run around.
The staff are fabulous, helpful and their English is extremely good.
Impressed with the security at the hotel also.
Visited their spa which was a lovely experience, but given its location, you could hear children tuning around outside screaming and the live music from the bar. The noise was the downside, otherwise great.
Wi-Fi was EXCELLENT!

ROOMS: I stayed in the Deluxe Room which overlooks the road - I didn't mind this as it felt more private than the Pool View Rooms. The room was fantastic! Nice and spacious and well appointed. As a female I was impressed with the little bench in the shower - perfect height to place your foot on to shave your legs! The small things I notice when travelling!
The balcony was spacious with a comfy padded bench/seat and a rail to hang your clothes to dry. Being I was roadside their was traffic noise, but this didn't start until about 9ish and finished around 1am. But it wasn't bad at all, and you can't hear it when the door is closed.

FOOD & BEVERAGE: Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen was great. Plenty of options where you could eat for days! All fresh and top quality.
Pool menu was great with heaps on offer (inc built your own salad). Pricing was very reasonable for a resort.
Drinks were great and friendly staff at the pool bar...love Penny.
A must try is 'What the Truck' located just out front. Best tacos (2 for $50,000/$5).

Overall I was really impressed with the resort and I wasn't disappointed. It is in a great location, the rooms, staff and food were fantastic and I loved the pool area. Would recommend to anyone - singles, couples, friends or families travelling.

I will be back!!!!"
2648,Excellent Resort!,50,August 2016,"Excellent everything in this resort, rooms were very clean! Even mopped the floors daily very happy. Satellite tv in the rooms, wi-fi was great, the zanti retreat was the best massage we have had, also great location beach at the end of the road 2-5 minute walk, mini mart and shops across the road and only short walks away, special thanks to Sutiarja in the seminyak kitchen for his great service alongside all the other staff throughout the hotel, food is excellent here ! 5 stars for sure.
Great facilities and also great for any age, also family's with the kids room. If I had to fault anything it would be the hotels do block a little of the sun for the pool on one side but other then that very happy, would return!"
2649,Fabulous,50,July 2016,"Have just spent 12 days. It was great. From the breakfast to the staff.
Will start off by saying that I have stayed at many different resorts and this was terrific.
John Woolley, General Manager takes the time to speak to you in the morning and even picks up dirty dishes. Grant Young, Operational Manager does the same and was fantastic when we had our flight cancelled. He took the time to help us. Well done Grant, fantastic customer service, that is what counts. You are a gem. The concierge, Wahyu
Pratama was absolutely terrific also trying to help us. Keep up the good work. Both spent over two hours trying to make contact with our airline.I would definitely return because of the service we received.Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. There are too many too mention but everyone had a smile on their face and they always said hello every time you walked past them, also asking if everything was alright.
Breakfast is great. Lots of variety and the Indian/ Indonesian selection is changed every day. You can order Latte, capuccino, smoothies, milkshakes and fruit juices and even have them as takeaway. If anyone complains about the breakfast you must be a person that is too hard to please. Only ate in Seminyak kitchen one night and that was very enjoyable.
There is Water Aerobics every day, free of charge.
Gym is complimentary together with two bottles of water every day in your room.
Popcorn and fairy floss are complimentary all day in foyer together with a table tennis table.
What the Truck Food truck is located at entry for tacos, snacks and drinks at reasonable prices.
Buggy takes you to The Courtyards private beach section, which has lounges, umbrellas, water and sometimes Popsicles. Scheduled pick up times from beach are 12.00, 2.00 and 4.00. The buggy will also take you to Eat Street where there are some great restaurants. It is only a $2 - $3 taxi ride back. It will also take you to the top of the street where it meets !egian Street.
Pool - There are three pools. A few people say that it only gets the sun one side. This is true, but who can sit all day in that extreme heat and that guests get up early and save the lounges. Yes this does happen but there is a policy in place and those people can have their towel removed by staff. Also there are a few lounges on the grass section. Everyone is happy.
Free wifi together with a business centre,
Rooms - We had an internal garden/pool view deluxe room on the 6th. Definitely no complaints. Become a Marriott Member before you book and you may receive an upgrade.
When I return, I would request same room type. The rooms are noisier facing the street.
The hotel is a 5 min walk to beach. Security is great. You feel very safe with thorough car/taxi checks and also all bags are scanned every time you re-enter the property.
This hotel ticks all the boxes for me."
2650,BENS BALI BIRTHDAY,50,July 2016,"I would have to say leaving this resort brought me to tears. My friend asked what would you change about the resort. absolutely nothing. It was an unbelievable experience. Beautiful staff could do enough for you, excellent entertainment, extremely clean, great facilities, interaction from the management team, kitchen staff and food were great. I have to mention one employee in particular who won my heart her name is Femi, she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was fantastic. (Maria from the bar xx) even from ""what the truck"" was awesome........ I miss you all so much and will be back sooner rather than later. Wish it would never end.
with love Michelle and Michael Borg xxx"
2651,Amazing,50,July 2016,"My time at Marriott was amazing.

They had free candy floss and popcorn on demand+they had the friendliest staff and the hotel had amazing facilities.The buggy was one I have to point out, the buggy has a service that brings you to the beach (they have their own cabanas with free popsicles if you feeling a bit heaty)-Note they have a pick up schedule that is at 12pm, 2pm and 4pm + the buggy has a service that send you to three points (no pick up).
In addition(Not part of hotel review), you should take the blue bird group taxis because they are honest and they are metered.

Thanks, Hope this review helped

Have a safe trip :)"
2652,Nigel and Gillian Robson,50,August 2016,"Stayed for 12 nights, the hotel is very well placed for the beach and nightlife, great staff and very friendly. The breakfast staff are superb especially a young man called sutiarja who couldn't do enough to help. Loved it all and will definitely return.
Nigel and Jill."
2653,Absolutely perfect family friendly hotel!,50,July 2016,"We were very happy with our recent holiday staying at Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak. There was nothing to fault whatsoever. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms (we had interconnecting rooms) were modern, clean and spacious -- and they have the best WIFI (in rooms, in restaurant, by the pool)!

The hotel pools are AWESOME!! We loved the big floating bean bag mats too! The buffet breakfast was the best we've ever experienced -- so much choice for every nationality! The hotel location is perfect to walk to shops and restaurants. A shuttle bus is provided to transport you to the hotel's own Beach Club (which is only a few minutes walk). There is also a kid's club and toddler pool.

This hotel was recommended to us and we definitely recommend it to others!! We hope to return in the future."
2654,Great place to stay,50,April 2016,"The rooms were big, nicely fitted with at you could need including iPod docking station, dressing gowns and slippers, various lighting levels and a comfy bed.
Staff were friendly, the food choice at breakfast was great, the pool food was good too. Added extras like staff offering ice lollies by the pool and free snacks of candy floss and popcorn and nice additions.
Had a great stay here, they have a buggy to take you to the beach where the have private sunbeds, offer towels and water if you want to be at the beach.
They have activities throughout the day, you can easily book tours or drivers. Only negative is the entertainment can be a little noisy but it doesn't go on late only during the day at reasonable hours"
2655,Awesome,40,July 2016,"Second time at this hotel.
Positives:
-breakfast is outstanding
-service is amazing, staff very friendly and always happy to help
- clean modern rooms
- zanti spa is beautiful

Negatives:
-half the pool misses out on sunlight
- music from pool can sometimes be heard during massage at the hotel spa."
2656,Location+Staff=*****,50,July 2016,"I enjoyed my stay, the staff were very accommodating and mad me feel welcomed 1000 miles away from home.

From check-in to check out my every need, want, and request were met.

The lodgings are comfortable, but the location to the beach, shops, and restaurants are the perks.

I enjoyed the entertainment and garden party as well."
2657,Quick trip to warmer climes,40,July 2016,"Just an 8 day stay with close family (all adults). Our stay was seamless with great service - always with a smile and a quick ""hello, how are you?"" from all all the staff throughout the resort.
Pool is nice, but does not get a lot of sun, so ask where is best to sit if you are wanting to tan around the pool. The resort is an easy 5 minute walk to the beach and you can also take the shuttle to the Marriott beach area. At this area you have day beds, towels, water and cold fruit kebabs as you watch all the people learning to surf.
The eateries in the street outside the resort are of a good variety and reasonable prices, as are the spas - $5 for a 30 minute back massage - so relaxing!
Rooms are a good size with all amenities - a pool view room on 5th or 6th floor."
2658,Wonderful place to stay,50,July 2016,"We stayed for 9 days and were greeted with a friendly smile around every corner by staff that could not do enough for us or be more interested in our well being. Chinta Maria and all bar staff were amazingly caring. Great refuge from busy streets of Seminyak.
Location perfect with short stroll to beach
Room overlooking pool very adequate and extremely peaceful
Breakfasts to look forward to and served with courtesy and clealiness.
The hotel is a great venue to stay whilst eating out at the superior restuarants of Bali. Cannot wait to go back. Graeme and Jill"
2659,Disappointing for Marriott hotel.,30,July 2016,"Stayed 2 nights with husband and 5 year old based on reviews saying it was ""family friendly"". I don't agree! Pool loses sun at lunchtime, large groups of young people partying up and arriving home at all hours of the night and loud music being played beside the pool all day-you can hear it from the rooms. Not great if you had a young baby who needed to nap during the day. Room decor is fresh and modern but not well sound proofed. Location is Ok but requires a taxi ride if you want to go to Eat Street. Staff were friendly and trying hard. Probably wouldn't recommend to others, which is a shame as other Marriott properties have always delivered."
2660,Ticked all boxes~ Fantastic stay,50,July 2016,"In short, ticked all boxes - room quality, restaurant, spa, pool, kids club, gym, Wifi

We had a great 10 nights stay at Courtyard Bali. John the GM is lovely, you will see him around the hotel, at the front desk and the restaurant during buffet breakfast time talking to guests.

We were in one bedroom suite (kids in roll away bed, I kept the king bed) with pool view, didn't feel cramped or noisy at all. It is wise to book a pool view room with what ever room type you book, away from the street noise.

Food was great - pool bar, Seminyak Kitchen even Room service has a high standard, both presentation and quality of dishes. We had a day we didn't get out of the resort. Kids were in the pool, I was in Zanti (spa retreat).

What The Truck ~ was my favourite. Love the coffee and snacks, (coffee ask for double shot as the standard coffee can be weak-ish).

Kids were happy on their daily dose of pop corns and candy floss. These are in front of reception desk.

Like others have pointed out - the water temp in the pool can get pretty cold. We chose to swim when the sun around. Other days you can get a buggy to Double Six beach to enjoy the sun and the beach.

Their buggy service can take you to two junction, near the EAT Street and one closer to the hotel. Hotel's security is good, dogs, x-ray machine. all there for hotel's guests safety.

We would return again."
2661,Security was A+,50,July 2016,"Wow is the best way to describe the Marriott, for me everything is 5 star. Would have be the safest hotel in Bali, where else do they check your bags and you have to go through a scanner EveryTime you enter the hotel. A novel idea I have not seen anywhere else, is the food truck parked at the hotel entrance, brilliant idea for some snacks and coffee.
From the moment you arrive you are spoilt, treated as you should be and the staff are genuine and care. Had many lazy days in the pool and at the pool bar, great cocktails especially at happy hour great value. If you prefer the beach it is just down the road, a nice 3 minute stroll. If you do not want to walk they have golf carts running to and fro all day. They even have their own private beach where they supply towels and sun beds free.
The breakfast is amazing, anything you want is normally there and tastes great.
We had a pool view room on level 6, nice and spacious and very clean. Plenty of activity down by the bar with some music and singing going on, but not to loud.
If you are travelling to Seminyak than look no further this the place, guaranteed not to disappoint. Many thanks to all the staff, you are what makes the Marriott special.
Perth Gang"
2662,Awesome if you prefer Western Hotels,50,July 2016,"We stayed in 2 rooms with an inter-connecting door that did not lock. 2 Adults 3 kids. It was a brand new hotel. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. Get a poolside room. Other people street side said it was noisy all night with traffic. Poolside the band by the pool and noise from the bar finished at about 9pm. Get a room as high as possible and away from the Lobby area to avoid the noise.The fridge in the room did not have ice but you could ring room service and they brought you a bowl of ice in 2 minutes - for drinks on the balcony.
Security was awesome - body scanners, xray machines for bags, sniffer dogs. The pools were good but the water was about 5 degrees cooler than the open resort style pools which are in the sun all day. This pool is only in the sun for half the day because it is in a quadrangle of 4 sides of hotel rooms.
The breakfasts were awesome American breakfasts and asian food too. In addition to all the bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles, icecream, pastries etc you could also get Bagels and smoked salmon, capers etc.
In the Lobby they had a popcorn machine and a fairy floss machine going all day and night. Our kids loved that.
Not many Australians stayed here - so our kids had trouble making friends in the pool and they subsequently bothered us all day. We stayed at the Padma the week before. The resorts are better and have more Aussie kids. Overall a great experience but we will be staying at a resort with open grounds next time. The staff were fantastic though."
2663,"Great Experience,,,,",40,May 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay. I went there with my friends the hotel location was great . There's a very convenient shuttle that drives you to the beach (you can walk there too). also we spent at night on the beach that has many lounges, great music and atmosphere. The swimming pool at the hotel is very nice, the writer/s also very welcome and friendly, The rooms are very comfortable, the Marriott bed is always a pleasure and comfort. really amazing experience while vacation in Bali"
2664,relaxing place to stay,40,June 2016,"had an 8 night stay and found that overall its a good place to stay. Problem with light coming through bathroom door from outside at night and sunlight at 6am. meals were very good and the staff were excellent. Best security i have seen any where, always felt very safe. great grounds and pool area and a golf cart to the beach or 5 min walk. Overall a good place to stay."
2665,PERFECT FOR FAMILY,50,July 2016,"My family of 7 spent 15 wonderful days at the Courtyard Marriot. It was chosen initially because my daughter wanted a 'private room' for her 16 mnth old baby boy to allow him to be a settled as possible. Very few places in Seminyak have this additional room.
Another reason for choosing this resort was its location - very accessible to most of the places we wanted to visit, shopping, restaurants etc. We could not fault the Courtyard, great amenities, great staff, fantastic breakfast every morning. The pool was great and very relaxing particularly after an afternoon of shopping. The rooms were great - beds were fantastic. The front desk staff were brilliant, nothing too much trouble. Would highly recommend to anyone visIting BALI."
2666,100% Happy with Courtyard Seminyak,50,July 2016,"We stayed at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for 5 days in July 2016 and it was faultless.
The staff at reception, room service, pool service and restaurants went above and beyond their duty to guarantee that we were happy and well looked after. On our last day I became unwell and the reception staff happily organised a late check out of 4pm. This was totally appreciated.
Congratulations to all the catering staff, as the food was excellent. From the room service, to pool and bar food to the restaurant. The breakfast was amazing, so much variety but most importantly quality food, not just mass produced.
A special shout out to the very friendly and professional junior sous chef, Bayu Sanubari."
2667,Five star,50,June 2016,Nothing much to say as expected its all about Marriott ..5 star service and quality! You can feel The warm welcome the moment you arrived to entrance .. Concierge will ask and suggest for your plans or any activities during your stAy they even provide those little maps and pumplets some info's what to do in Bali .. we enjoy everything specially the breakfast #seminyakkitchen .. Big Clap to Courtyard Seminyak
2668,Pool bar. chintz and staff,50,July 2016,"What a wonderful place. Chinta and the staff at the pool bar Wiki,Maria,Arggon and Chinta. Beautiful people and they looked after us excellent they knew what we liked and what we wanted. Nothing was too hard for them

Like to mention Tony at reception. He was excellent. From the moment we arrived and made sure everything was correct and even followed up on things for us and found us to advise. All the staff are beautiful and so friendly. Thank you"
2669,My teenage daughter and I,40,June 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard in Seminyak. I went there with my 19 year old daughter, great location to show her around and get a good feel of Bali. There's a very convenient shuttle that drives you to the beach (you can walk there too). Once in the beach the hotel has a small, private area with towels, lounge beds and umbrellas. We left our stuff there and went to take surfing lessons. At night the beach has many lounges, great music and atmosphere.
The swimming pool at the hotel is very nice, we sun tanned by the bar. Good music, drinks and service.
While staying there one should go for lunch or dinner to Ku De Ta. A hip place in Bali. Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. The sunsets are amazing.
The rooms are very comfortable, the Marriott bed is always a pleasure ;)
If you go to Bali more than once you should try to stay in different areas (Kuta, Nusa Dua, Seminyak, Ubud...).
I would recommend this hotel in the area of Seminyak.
I did not give it five stars because I stayed at the W, Westin in Nusa Dua, Sheraton Kuta and they are 5."
2670,Great pool and staff,50,August 2015,"We had a great time in Seminiak CY hotel, rest next the pool, free ice cream during day sunbathing and very close to sea. Also very helpful staff at front desk, who helped us to communicate with airline in Indonesian language when our flight was cancelled. Absolutely recommended!"
2671,Amazing!,50,May 2016,Quite pricey but well worth it! When you arrive you get welcome drink and greeted nocely. You have to go through security every time though! Rooms are super modern and so nice! Breakfast is AMAZING it's buffet and you need a good hour to eat! So much on the menu! They have a buggy that can take you a few different place which is awesome and its really close to little shops selling all the usual bali souvenirs! The pool is awesome and there is always live music at night. Swim up bar is great but pricey! Awesome service and reception all speak great english! They even call other venues to book for you! We stayed here for 4 nights and then came back for our last night because it was so nice!
2672,Awesome time,50,July 2016,"A large group of our friends have just had a wonderful weekend celebrating my husbands 50th Birthday at the Courtyard Marriott, what a fantastic experience staying there. The hotel rooms are outstanding, the staff amazing, breakfast was delicious and so much variety, clean, poolside was relaxing we all just loved it. We got a surprise upgrade, two birthday cakes with signed cards from the staff, special happy hour poolside just fantastic. thank you so much for making this weekend so special"
2673,Absolutely incredible!,50,February 2016,"Aboslutely incredible. Great cocktails, music and the other guests were so lovely!
Breakfast was amazing - great to relax, have fun and I felt very safe there with the security at the front as there was a few things going on around jan & feb!"
2674,Nice and safe,40,July 2016,"Hotel is clean and safe.

There's bag and body scan everything you enter the hotel lobby. So don't worry. Staff are friendly and helpful.

Room is clean and big. Lift is fast.

Breakfast is awesome. Wide variety. First time I see a selection of bagel for hotel.

The pool is also the main part excitement. It's big and long. They have floating beanbag!. Sun bed are mostly taken if you are late. But the staff can help you to take a look for guest who are leaving the pool.

They have very basic gym.

10min walk to the beach. They have buggy provided to the beach and small part of the beach is specially for marriot guest. But not a big a deal as it's far from the sea and it's not actually on the beach it's like way back near the street area.

10-15min to eat Street depending on traffic.

But my concern is that why no grabcar is allow. And why they didn't support grabcar."
2675,Nice stay,50,July 2016,"We enjoyed our stay but didn't really spend a lot of time in the hotel. For the time we were there, the staff was super nice and even arranged for a rental scooter when requested. They provide free parking space for guests.

The breakfast buffet was really good with a very good spread.

Our flight was at 10:00 PM and they allowed us to use the shower in the gym before our flight and provided towels etc.

No fault of the hotel but we did repent our decision to not take a beachside property. The sunset views were breathtaking. :) The beach is a good 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel."
2676,Nice hotel,40,July 2016,"This is more hotel than resort.
It's great for the location and had the best food in Bali. If your after a resort to relax, I recommend the Royal beach Seminyak next door. I've stayed at both many times and the courtyard Marriott is better suited for a group of friends or business trip. It only has one pool shared by all hotel quests and it gets very crowded and the staff don't police the few sun lounges they have and stop silly ignorant westerners putting one item like a hat on them then shopping all day to try to keep them reserved for when hey return in the afternoons.
More consideration needs he shown to other guests. The breakfast is by far the best out of any resort or hotel in Bali.
Just amazing.
The rooms are very clean and new.
There is a lot of noise from the pool area at nights and hard to relax."
2677,Happy hour,50,July 2016,"We had great fun at happy hour with Chinta tonight, great cocktails and music and games and Balinese dancing
.. A wonderful place to stay whether with friends or family, close to shops, beach and lots of restaurants I would highly recommend courtyard Bali Seminyak"
2678,Sensational,50,July 2016,"Highly recommend this place, amazing place, great service and amazing people, rooms were fantastic and food was great, relaxing, plenty to do, live music most nights, close to shops and general store, walking distance to beach, beach sun set fabulous."
2679,Bali break,50,July 2016,"Absolutely fabulous time. Beautiful friendly staff. Would come back here in a heartbeat. Thank you for helping create many, many happy memories. Happy hour from 5 till 8pm at the pool bar. After a busy day it's hard to pry yourself away from the bar."
2680,The Best Hotel Experience I've EVER Had!,50,July 2016,"Arrived on the 18th July 2016 - 26th July 2016.
The staff were Amazing, we were always greeted with a ""Hello, how are you?"" they all went above and beyond the 5 star rated service.

Recent events happening around the world led us to choose this hotel because of the Security. We were not Unimpressed and felt VERY Safe!

Our cleaner 'Tuti' was incredible! I was sharing a room with a mate throughout the Holiday and i have to be honest we were not the tidiest of guests, however Tuti meticulously folded our clothes, picked up fallen over water bottles and even went to the extent of facing said water bottle Labels, with precision on the bed side table. She rolled our charger cables that were in a pile on the bedside table.. She was in all honesty just an overall Amazing Cleaner!

The Seminyak Kitchen is an in-house restruant on the second floor. My Mate and i always had Breakfast every morning at this restruant as almost every other restruant we ate at in the direct vacinity just did not meet up with the standard set there. The waiters were all 'on the ball' and very attentive to every single guest eating in house. They were not at all pushy with up selling their food or drinks and remembered almost everyone by their first name.

We felt very 'At Home' staying at The Courtyard by Marriott and will Definitely be returning with more Friends!

P.s. The Air Conditioning is Amazing and the Cr√®me Br√ªl√®e is to Die For!"
2681,"Best hotel I've ever been to, by a long shot",50,July 2016,"Food was delicious and prepared quickly at the Seminyak kitchen, staff were lovely and the complimentary fire dancing was spectacular. We were blown away with how good the housekeeping in our room was, and would like to commend the cleaning lady. Her name is Tuti and she did such a great job, overall we had a wonderful stay."
2682,Hotel Review,50,July 2016,"We have just returned after the second visit to this Resort. This Resort is a great place to holiday. We found all staff were happy and friendly and they made you feel very welcome. They just couldn't do enough to make our holiday so enjoyable. I would like to mention as truly outstanding member of staff being Chinta at the Pool Bar. Chinta went far and beyond her normal duties. I have had two serious back operations and Chinta looked after me, treating me as ones daughter, I found Chinta a truly delightful person and her attitude towards guests left nothing to be desired. I can highly recommend this Resort. The Seminyak Kitchen was a great place to eat. Alit cooks really good omelettes, and his friendly personality makes breakfast time a treat. I must mention Parwati who was always brought our fruit juice and coffee with a smile. Thank you all"
2683,"Great Hotel, Superb Staff",50,May 2016,"Booked this hotel through Marriott website and got the room with member rate. This is the cheapest rate you can get. So remember to book through Marriott website with membership (Membership is free). Stayed 4 night here and we have very great time here. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They always seek feedback from customer to be better. SPA is very nice, it's a must. Breakfast is among the best that I have. Stay here will not disappoint you. Remember to try out the taco at the lobby entrance. It is affordable and nice. Definitely will be back again!"
2684,One of The Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,July 2016,"It's my second time I stay in Courtyard Seminyak.
Located in a strategic area in Seminyak. even they dont have private beach but if you want to chill at the beach it's 'walk-able', they also provide shuttle to the beach if you want.
The best part of the hotel is the WIFI, very vast!

one thing they need to improve is room soundproof. The balcony door cant muffle the sound from outside (especially street view room)."
2685,"Nice hotel, great staff",40,June 2016,"Arrived just an hour after booking online, our room wasn't ready but only had to wait a short while, were checked in quickly. Realised I had lost my mobile phone, asked if the hotel could help me, Melinda on reception, called the cab company & previous hotel, the phone was located and they sent a driver to collect it for me! Absolutely blown away by this, was gutted to loose a phone & all my photos and then within an hour have it back in my hand. Wonderful service. Cocktails by the pool were delicious, tasty food at the restaurant Seminyak Kitchen, big pool and nice rooms. Short stay but enjoyed it."
2686,Perfect stay,50,July 2016,"A wonderful place to stay with fantastic staff and clean, comfortable rooms. The breakfast is a must have, so include it in your booking. It's a great start to the day. It rained the majority of the time we were there and the courtyard made staying in enjoyable. I can understand why some can feel it is noisy, we had a pool view room and the sounds of entertainment do enter your room even with doors closed and blinds pulled - however it added to the holiday vibe and we enjoyed it. Plus it finishes at a reasonable time, so you still get quiet time. We enjoyed sitting on our balcony and listening to the tunes. Thanks to the staff. Such wonderful people and we will be back."
2687,Top hotel in Seminyak,40,July 2016,"We stayed in Courtyard Seminyak for the beginning of our 9 days trip in Bali

We booked 2 POOL Terrace Rooms,146 and 147 for 3 days. As a marriott member,I tried to stay in marriott properties wherever I can.

The Hotel size is not that big,also the room size is not that big also but functional and well equipped.

The Air Cond worked well during our stay.

The Staff are very friendly,especially the ladies at The Kids Club.

Our kids still talked about them even after staying in other more luxurious properties in Bali.

The reason we stay here is to get close to eating street and double six beach and must be kids friendly hotel,and courtyard delivers.

Breakfast although taste very very good,more varieties of soup is highly appreciated

We travelled as a group and stayed in Ritz Carlton Nusa dua and Sheraton Kuta,and the breakfast taste and services cannot match the Courtyard!!! Two thumbs up

Also I left my mobile phone and after 5 hours after check out,the staff called my other phone and organised my phone to be collected. Thank you for the honesty and effort.

The POOL was crystal clear and clean

Valet parking is complimentary + security was tight.

The only problems I encounter was the billing and lack of communication between the director of rooms and front desk,this caused half hour check out process + another phone calls after 2 days.

Hopefully it should be settle by now as I did not hear anything from the hotel anymore.

Also the buggy WILL not pick you up even from the beach,so they can only offer drop off, and its not enough to have just 1 buggy considering the hotel have over hundred rooms. There were times that I could not wait too long for buggy and get a cab to eat street,also I heard some guests complaining about this buggy waiting issue. For the management,you Should consider getting another buggy car.

Overall,I will be back and hopefully We can have better billing management in the future."
2688,Great family holiday,50,July 2016,"We stayed 3 nights here with out two children 5 & 8. The hotel location is great, a short walk to lots of shopping and down the road from the beach where all the restaurants are.
Our kids loved the daily popcorn and fairy floss in the lobby. The kids club kept them entertained with different activities and the staff were lovely.
Great buffet breakfast with so much to choose from.
Our rooms were nice and modern but the only down side was our balcony was on the road side which I found very noisy from traffic and music from across the road all night but in saying that it didn't bother anyone else I stayed with.
Definitely recommend this hotel"
2689,Decent family hotel,40,July 2016,"Seminyak is about surf and parties, but if you pick this beach for a family vacation this hotel will be a very decent option at reasonable price. Lots of kids at the pool, lots of couples and parents at the pool bar/cafe - but they seem to be managing it quite well. Fantastic kids club with playstaions for older kids and lots of toys and activities for younger kids, ultra friendly and fun nannies.
They have a shuttle to the beach club but it's s bit distant (next to double six hotel), we walked to the beach with a buggy and it took about 5 min.
The rooms are ok, cleaning leaves a lot to be desired, never changed the sheets despite ""change the sheets"" sign we left on the bed, did it after a phone call thou.
Great tacos at the food truck in the yard!"
2690,Top notch hotel,50,July 2016,Really hard to fault much about the Courtyard Marriott. Rooms are clean and modern and beds are comfortable. The breakfast range at Seminyak Kitchen is incredible. Probably the best I've ever encountered. Staff were friendly and attentive and security is thorough. Rooms were a little noisy on the road side of the building but that is a minor criticism. The only problem the hotel has is the pool. It is nice to look at but not user friendly in that it is cramped around the edge of it so it can feel quite claustrophobic and it is pretty much in the shade all day. If you're a Sun lover you will be very disappointed.
2691,Amazing!,50,July 2016,"We have just stayed here for a week and can not fault this hotel at all! Amazing rooms,food,facilities and service. We will be staying here again when we come back, the best hotel in Bali! Close to the beach and shops, great restaurants and a personal buggy service to nearby places. Fantastic :)"
2692,This is a terrific hotel,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the CY Marriott for a 10 day break. Initially (having been to Bali many times) we missed some of the more traditional aspects of Bali accommodation (ie the 'Bali style'), but after a day or so at this hotel, we were taken buy the outstanding way the management and the team at the hotel go out of their way to make the experience of staying there, rememberable.
It seems to flow very naturally but I would suspect that there has been a significant amount of effort that has been put into the training and selection of the staff, to make sure they are all delivering the max they can for their guests.
Most (a lot) of hotels/resorts etc., don't go overly out of their way to provide the guests with 'extras' to make their stay more enjoyable. This hotel does. They provide activities around the pool that you can join in on; they provide great music for those that want to sit and have a sunset drink in the pool bar; and on an on.
A WELL DONE to the entire team.
Particularly liked Mr Jakka who ran the water aerobics; the staff at the restaurant; the Pool staff; and the front desk team.
If you stay there, make sure you try the restaurant in the hotel. Some of the best food we had in Bali (and we had a lot of options).
If you were looking for a 'resort' style of hotel for a family (ie young children) holiday, then this is a great place to stay. Similarly if you want something that is luxurious without being over the top, and were not with young children, then stay here but out of School Holiday season."
2693,Such a great experiences to be here!,50,May 2016,"I stayed here for 3 nights. Comfort room. Excellent service. Clean. Friendly staff. Its swimming pool is nice. It's located in the center of the hotel and had pool bar. You can enjoy your liquor on the bench inside the water (your body was drowning for a half). The wine is good. Delicious breakfast (lots of choices). We could just walk to get beach, some restaurants, bars, convenience stores and gifts store. Well I'm sure i'll be back here."
2694,Great stay !,50,July 2016,Beautiful place with beautiful people! Couldn't have asked for more at the Courtyard Marriott. Rooms were pleasant and the buffet breakfast was incredible. Particularly enjoyed the helpfulness of the staff and the fantastic events organised daily by the hotel. Would definitely recommend the water aerobics organised by Suardana Recreation !
2695,Pool bar,50,July 2016,What fantastic service. Its a rainy day with not much to do so my husband and i headed to the pool bar to fill in some time. It was here that we were served by the lovely chinta. She went above and beyond to ensure we were well fed and never thirsty! Well done to team at courtyard marriott! Its no wonder we come here so often üòÑ
2696,Lovely couples getaway,50,July 2016,"First place we have stayed in our two week trip to Bali so thought we would stay somewhere lovely for first part of trip then cheaper for rest , this place suited our needs very much
Staff were always helpful and super friendly the rooms were modern and very clean . the location near beach and shops was perfect only short walk to beach where there are plenty of choices in bars and eats .
The pool was great large and clean with great beanbags around pool and some day beds in pool when was cool
we even had a laugh trying the aqua aerobics .
Our room had a little balcony overlooking the pool which was nice
Beds were large and very comfy ! Always a bonus in Bali .
Would stay again
Recommend for brekky the omelets
And if you like a strong coffee go for a double expresso with hot milk on side as lattes were not strong enough
Cafe moka about 6 to 8 mins walk had illy brand and good coffee if you like decent coffee . recommend sundari spa too will write separate review bit further to go but they do free pick up from hotel
Enjoy"
2697,New and easy,40,July 2016,"We stayed at the Marriott during our last night at the beach. Stayed in Ubud the whole time before. Convenient location and new property and all in all a good stay. I loved the breakfast buffet which was amazing ! We had a room towards the road which was a bit noisy but I guess they allocate these rooms to guest who only stay one night. If you are looking for a romantic place, then this is not the place to go. This is the usual Marriott hotel which you find around the globe."
2698,"Good location, decent hotel, ok service",30,July 2016,"This property is at good location, 400mtrs from beach and very near to shops, spa and restaurants. Hotel has high standards of security and Be ready for security check every time you walk/ drive into hotel.
They have reasonable size pool but generally crowded near bar area. Breakfast spread was ok and food options were limited as compared to some other hotels I have stayed.
While the staff is very courteous and polite their service is quite slow. I had to call few times to get additional blanket and had to personally walk to tour desk for some enquiry as they never answered my call or called back to my room.
They have spa facility but found it expensive as compared to other spas in near by location which are 1/4th the price with very good staff, facility and quality.
All in all this hotel has very good location but I didn't find value for money due to service level, food & other options."
2699,Fantastic Stay,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriot in mid June and absolutely loved it. From the moment you arrive at the hotel the staff are very friendly. Everytime I went to the front desk with a query I was welcomed by name and they knew my room number. We booked a driver through the hotel (Ketut) for a few days and he was very good. He was friendly, took us to some great place and was and very informative. The breakfasts are great with lots of variety. We also ate at the restaurant for dinner a few nights and the food was very nice. The pool is wonderful. There is a lot of shade by the pool area but I prefer that as I don't like getting burnt. The pool bar is fun - especially at happy hour - we ordered the club sandwich for lunch a few times and it was delicious. The location is also good. It is about a 5 minute walk to the beach. You can walk or get the golf buggy down. The hotel has its own area at the beach which I would recommend. They provide free water and bring out pineapple and watermelon to eat. You can also ask them to watch over your belongings while you have a swim. They are more than happy to do it. The golf buggy is also available to take you to Eat Street or the shopping. We walked to Eat Street one night and it was about 15 minutes away. We had a pool view room which I would recommend. The rooms are quite spacious and the bathroom is very nice.

I would love to go back for another holiday."
2700,Great Location,40,July 2016,I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 5 nights. I had a deluxe room but would reccomend a deluxe pool view room as our room overlooked a car park and was a bit noisy I didnt sit out on the balcony as it wasn't nice. The breakfast was good would recommend getting a table outside as it's a bit stuffy and crowded inside. The pool area was nice but did get a bit noisy at times lots of kids running up and down the decking was a bit annoying. The hotel is in a fantastic location and the hotel has a buggy transport service which was very handy for getting to Eat Street and the beach. Spa Bali is just around the corner and would definitely recommend them. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance. The staff were great very friendly. Would probably stay here again.
2701,Great hotel!!,50,July 2016,"Brilliant hotel :))) really loved the staff and the customer service - made our holiday that much more enjoyable :)
The pool bar staff are really lovely and friendly - Chinta & Ayu were really lovely and their customer service was amazing :)
We will definitely come back! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2702,Great Quality Hotel,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the Marriot in Seminyak for 8 nights. Firstly, the location is excellent it's on a good street which offers a variety of shops, bars and restaurants. It's a nice stroll to the beach and is central to visit Seminyak and Legian. The rooms at this hotel are very well appointed, ( they have thought of everything) clean, comfortable with lovely balconies overlooking the pool areas and a very comfy bed! The hotel staff are really friendly and are well trained with many international staff present as well. The hotel complex is well equipped with everything you could possibly need even down to an ATM and Money Changer. Very strict security is adhered to for everyone entering the complex which even though it's annoying it's reassuring. As you've probably already read the Breakfasts are absolutely AMAZING and we wondered whether the scales in the bedroom were to weight yourself after all the food you consume or to check your luggage weight! There were many guests of all nationalities staying at the hotel while we were there and it's a busy place so at first we thought we'd hate it having been used to smaller more boutique Bali style hotels, however we quickly warmed to the Marriot and felt very comfortable and relaxed while there. If your considering this hotel you can't really go wrong we'd highly recommend it."
2703,Best customer service 5 stars,50,July 2016,Our stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak was an outstanding and I attribute that to the exceptional customer service we received from 'Chinta' who works at the pool bar. Nothing was too much trouble and she went above & beyond everyday! You don't find staff often that can make you feel like you are number 1. Thank you Chinta for making our stay memorable and we will be back again next year! I would suggest you be recognized for your work as we have!
2704,great prices,50,June 2016,"centrally located property with a very relaxed feel about it, the prices were very reasonable, it is a modern hotel with great staff who are very helpful and friendly, a most enjoyable stay and we learnt a bit of local cooking while we were there."
2705,Courtyard Marriott Resort,50,July 2016,Amazing place to be Staff are so friendly and helpful amazing food the breakfast was my favourite. The pool bar is so relaxing and chilled definitely coming back and thank you to Mariani for being helpful explaining were to go for best shopping.
2706,"Modern, Central & Very Reasonably Priced!",50,July 2016,"A fantastic family friendly experience. Centrally located in between Legian and Seminyak, getting the best of both worlds. Activities everyday including yoga and aqua aerobics, as well as a whole day of kid's activities, including towel folding, painting, and more creative options to suit every child. Great pool and pool bar. Delicious breakfast with vast variety! Complimentary popcorn and fairy floss all day long. Although this hotel is not beachfront, they offer a free transfer shuttle to exclusive Marriott section along the Seminyak beach, which is just as good! Have stayed here twice so far and will definitely be back again!"
2707,Stay at Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort,50,July 2016,"I stayed with my family in this excellent hotel.
We loved the breakfast/brunch/meals at the Seminyak Kitchen
within the hotel.
The breakfast/brunch provided an assortment of fruits including the local dragonfruit and palm fruit, pancakes, an assortment of cereals, Continental breakfast and a host of choices like Bok Choi etc. I am a vegetarian and I found good meal options for me. Those customers who are not vegetarians would have a lot more choices.
The service at the reception or the kitchen or any other facility was cordial and courteous. Tourist cars were available from the hotel with English speaking drivers who were able to function as tour guides and also I was able to tailor our trips.
The staff were exceptional with regard to service and guidance. The hotel also provides good laundry service at affordable prices and free gym facilities.
We also watched a fire dance event at the hotel."
2708,Marriott Cooking Class,50,July 2016,"My friends and I did a cooking class. The group was 5. We learnt fish skewers, green sauce and red sauce a curry and a dessert. They gave you recipes and you got to eat all the yummy food. It was interesting, hands-on and entertaining."
2709,Great hotel,50,July 2016,"We really enjoyed our 7 nights stay at the courtyard by marriott. Warm welcome with drink, snack, popcorn and delicious cake for it was our honeymoon. The staff were really friendly, great service, new and clean rooms, great breakfast with lots of variety, fast wifi connection. Close to the beach, 10 minutes with the taxi to seminyak square. Unike other reviews there was not even a sound from neighbouring rooms. We had a nice view from the 6th floor, even saw the fireshow from balcony:)."
2710,Perfect place to stay,40,July 2016,"This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel. Great location in Seminyak, the complimentary buggy is helpful to get us to the popular spots nearby, Marriott's Private Beach, Eat Street and shopping. Staff are super helpful and friendly. Management often walk around asking if all's well and if they can do anything to help. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Pool is sparkling clean with poolside chairs and great service."
2711,Just love this hotel,50,July 2016,"Our second stay in 7 months. First time as a couple and second time as a family. Hotel is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. Great rooms, breakfast buffet and pool. Kids keept entertained with activities and close to the beach for a surf. Great to see some familiar faces on our second stay including Agus and Ayu in the restaurant. Welcomed us back with his friendly smile. Looking forward to coming back again. Highly recommend"
2712,Amazing hotel and staff!,50,July 2016,"This hotel is perfect, Cinta and the rest of the staff are happy to tend to every need. The rooms are beautiful and modern, the service is flawless. I must say that the kids club is fantastic, and the staff are so caring. Our kids (4 & 6) couldn't get enough to of it and we had to keep reminding them this was supposed to be a family holiday. The first 2 hours are free, with a minimal set hourly rate thereafter (about $9/hour). The restaurant is also brilliant-amazing buffet breakfast with lots of choice & lunch/dinner options, the gym is well equiped and the day spa lovely. Close to the beach, lots of good places to eat nearby too. Highly recommended, we will return!"
2713,First time in Bali did not disappoint,50,July 2016,"I have travelled extensively yet had never been to Bali. To be honest...I had no desire to. But as luck would have it I ended up here for a week.
I cannot fault my stay. The security is impressive as is the warm and genuine welcome when you arrive at the resort.
The rooms are spacious and well decorated. The airconditioning works a treat.
The pool area is a haven. The buffet breakfast wowed me with a bagel station. We actually had a few meals in the restaurant and they were all well priced and delicious.
The staff are friendly and helpful. Should an issue arise have confidence they will sort it smoothly.
The location was convenient to a beach, souvenir shops, salons and restaurants.
Most other guests all seemed calm and relaxed and there were often activities or entertainment on offer."
2714,Great place for a holiday,40,May 2016,Loved our stay at this resort. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Quick to attend to requests. Komang Suardana the recreation guy made water aerobics so much fun that we just loved to join in. It was fun and not too hard for us older folks. The Saturday night Sea Food Buffet was great. Free cocktails to enjoy at the poolside or just sitting at a table watching the footy. The breakfast buffet had all that you want and the staff were never too busy to talk to you. Even the manager had time to talk and make you feel welcome. With free Wi-Fi we were able to keep in touch with the family while we were away.
2715,Great value hotel in good lication,40,July 2016,"We stayed for 7 nights at the beginning of July in a 2 bedroom suite with our 2 kids. The hotel is great value for money & I think is in a good location for exploring both Seminyak & Legian. We stayed at a particularly busy time and the hotel coped well with the large number of both local & international visitors.
Pros
Room was huge with 2 big bathrooms both with baths. Large living area & private balcony.
Great buffet breakfast with lots of choices & lovely staff
Great buggy service to drop at beach or start of eat street but we did have to wait a while each time we wanted to use this.
What the truck tacos at the front of the resort was a hit - tasty tacos & cold bintang.
Security was good
Cons
One side of the pool is completely shaded for the whole day. If you are a sun lover this will be a deal breaker.
We got up every morning and went to breakfast by 7.30am & I kid you not ALL of the chairs in the sun were taken EVERY day by 7.30am!!!! Very frustrating. The hotel is trying to rectify this by putting chairs on the grassed area but these were taken as well during our stay.
The beach club area was not an option for us as the surf was big at the time we stayed and was not ideal to swim in.
Service around the pool was slow to non existent at times & it was difficult to get drinks as it was very busy.
Would I return? Probably not during peak times as I like to sit in the sun around the pool but I did enjoy my stay."
2716,"Excellent hotel, wonderful staff",50,June 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott with our two kids. Overall it was a fabulous hotel and we would definitely recommend staying here. The hotel is fairly new and is immaculate.

ROOMS: We booked two rooms, one for us and one for our kids who were next door but not in and interconnecting room. The rooms are tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was very spacious and clean and the balcony overlooking the pool was great. The room itself was a little small but perfectly adequate. The rooms were cleaned perfectly on a daily basis. Definitely recommend a pool view room. Bed was very comfortable.

SERVICE AND STAFF: The staff are the best part of staying at the hotel. They are always smiling and greet each and every guest whenever they see them. Special shout out to Bayu in the kitchen who helped us with gluten free selections for breakfast and dinner. Also the two young guys who drove the buggy were so friendly and cheerful. The young man who did the water aerobics was such a sweet guy. In fact most of the staff were delightful.

FOOD: The breakfast buffet was excellent. We required gluten free choices and they made us gluten free pancakes on request. The only criticism I have is that they need to sort out their gluten free choices by adding more to the menu and perhaps having a separate gluten free menu. The buffet had everything you could possibly want for breakfast, the usual eggs, toast, pastries, juices, yoghurts, plus lots of Asian foods and other hot menu choices. Even the fussiest eater would find something to please.

LOCATION: Location is about a 5 minute walk to the beach. There is a buggy available to take guests to the Marriotts private beach area or just to the beach. It will also take guests to Eat Street and up the street to the junction. The young guys driving the buggy were great. The hotel is too far to walk to Eat Street area really but a cab should only cost a couple of dollars or so. Try and get an official Bluebird taxi and ask them to put the meter on. Don't be conned by drivers lurking out side the hotel offering to take you for $10.00. You should not have to pay more than $5.00 and usually less.

Free WIFI throughout the hotel, and lots of little extra touches such as free popcorn machine for the kids. The pools is gorgeous and pool temperature was perfect in June/July, not cold at all. The staff would come around and give us free guava or pineapple iceblocks and cones of popcorn. Little things that add up to a great experience. Overall the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak is a hotel we would highly recommend.

."
2717,Incredible stay in luxury,50,November 2015,"I stayed at the hotel with a family of 4 in two rooms. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a wonderful experience, with our room ready immediately and our luggage taken up for us.

The hotel's pool was amazing and large with plenty of sun lounges on either side and great pool service at the touch of a button.

The highlight however, was the incredible buffet breakfast which included an egg station (eggs made to order), selection of fresh juice, a range of fruit infused waters, hot breakfast foods like bacon, sausages, potatoes etc, muffins/cakes, bread and spreads, waffles and ice-cream plus much more!! You could also order drink directly from the staff walking around and they would make it for you as you liked- we tried milkshakes, coffees,hot chocolates, iced drinks etc and they were all lovely.

We also tried the massages in the hotels spa and the entire experience from start to finish was lovely. The professional women made us feel very comfortable and the rooms were large and serene.

The hotel also offers 24hr room service and the reception staff are willing to do anything to make your stay more enjoyable! Spaghetti bolognese after midnight was a dream!

Overall this hotel was a wonderful experience and I've just booked again to return with a group of friends later this year!"
2718,Great place,40,August 2015,We stayed here last year and it was a really good hotel for everyone. Great pool. Wonderful bar area and good room with big balcony. Breakfast was great. Would definitely return. Also near beach which was nice and gado gado which is a fantastic lunch spot.
2719,Great stay at a great resort,50,July 2016,"We enjoyed our stay here centrally located in Seminyak and the hotel provides a buggy to take you to flea market etc and to eat street and the beach where they have there own beach chairs and many beach dining places.
The breaky was awesome so many choices my son loved the pancakes waffles and we both loved the freshly made omelettes.
Had spent a lot of time at the pool area which is great and had ordered from menu and food choices were very good.
Service was always good beds very comfy and large showers were nice thanks for a great stay will be back in the near future."
2720,RESERVATION SERVICE SECOND TO NONE.,50,July 2016,"I Have a booking to stay at the Courtyard Bali mid July and as usual screwed up my dates etc etc completely my fault.
Thanks to the wonderful reservation crew they, went to extraordinary lengths to sort out my problems. no fuss no problem.
Looking forward to our stay. and now my wife is talking to me !!"
2721,"Amazing service, great location",40,June 2016,"The location was great for shopping, spa visits, nice places to hangout. But what was truly outstanding was the service of the staff. Super friendly and helpful. For that alone, i would return. However, to get to the beach is abt a 5 min walk. but there's shuttle service by the hotel, so it's all good."
2722,Highly exceptional!!!!,50,May 2016,"Hubby and I spent 5 days in this location and 5 in Nusa Dua. After a 26+ hrs flight, we arrived to the Seminyak Courtyard early morning and we were treated like in no other place. We received a welcome drink and since my hubby is a platinum member with Marriott, we also had a room upgrade & we were able to do an early check in. We were starving and right away we went to have breakfast; which was one of the best breakfast buffets we ever had within the Marriott chain (including Europe, North America, Pacific & South East Asia). I understand the need to cater to ""tourists"" and making food more appealing to guests from different backgrounds, but I can honestly say that the food in the Courtyard tasted more authentic and flavorful than other restaurants we tried within the area and Bali. My husband was assisted by the executive chef Danang Wijanarka to make exquisite selections within the various foods (specially the soups). The service and the staff overall was amazing and made us feel welcome every morning. I wish I can mention everybody's name. Big thanks to Anton Setiawan (Restaurant Mgr). Anton welcomed us with a smile every morning and made sure we were well taking care and suggested many other things to do around Bali. Also, we were celebrating our 11th year wedding anniversary and had a gift in our room. We enjoyed the hotel location as it was a quick 8 minutes walk to the beach and we were able to run during the morning time on the beach. Another benefit we found useful was the private spot by the double six hotel to relax and go for a swim. They don't have a bar, however you are welcome to buy your own drinks, use the shower and get a ride back to the hotel. The hotel was very new and the room we had was very ample. We utilized the gym and took advantage of the spa. The spa was great, the only negative I would say during my spa was the loud music coming from the pool area. We found the hotel to be very family oriented and had very good security. We booked couple of tours with the help of the front desk and the experience was great. Be mindful that the traffic it's horrible, but enjoy the views. Overall, I can't say enough about the Courtyard. Location was great (in the am, 40 min away from the airport). Decent selections of restaurants & bars within reach. Fantastic guest service, modern decor, etc. Lastly, I would say after staying at the Nusa Dua location, I would go back to Seminyak just to visit the staff and I would switch the beach...(The private beach in Nusa Dua was a prime location and wasn't as dirty..sorry) I just wish I could be back tomorrow :)
Thanks for such a great stay!! Until next time!!"
2723,Nice place with good location,40,June 2016,"It was a good hotel with lovely pool. If you are travelling with 2 children as mine better choose the twin bed room as it can accomodate more than the king size room. My room (if I'm not wrong is 601) has good view to the street and the Breeze hotel across. My husband love to sit in the balcony while watch the street's situation.

Shuttle is provided for the guest to go to the Seminyak beach, and its really on time.

Breakfast was quite good, however is too pricey (around Rp. 300.000/ person) and I notice there werent much different in 2 days.

But the location is quite good, its near city center."
2724,Great place to stay!,50,June 2016,"We got a deal through Luxury Escapes and it was awesome. The rooms were very nice. Recommend getting to pool early if you want a beanbag in the sun as only 1 side of pool gets heaps of sun, but its not really an issue. Pool bar nice, food well priced. Happy hour 5-7pm with great live music. Good security every time you enter the hotel. Awesome TACO Truck out the front that runs all day long, with cheap tacos & Beer. Hotel in great location, only about 400m from beach. The staff were all very obliging. Really enjoyed this place and would stay again."
2725,"Terrific, terrific and terrific",50,June 2016,"This is the best Courtyard i have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. It exceeds other Asian courtyards (bangkok, China), and is nothing like the Courtyards in the US and Europe. It is almost luxurious, with decently sized rooms, great bathrooms and balconies/patios, and very friendly service that really goes beyond the high standards already in place in Asia.

The room is well outfitted, and although not large, it was well designed and had all the key necessities (safe, iron, water boiler, fridge), with a great bathroom. Alas, the bathroom had only the Courtyard standard amenities.

We had direct access to the pool, and this was very convenient, as the pools were super nice, and the water was very clean too. The gym doesn't have a lot of weight machines, but its good enough.

One highlight of the visit was the daily breakfast buffet, which has western, indonesian, indian, and chinese food, plus cook to order eggs. Well worth it and a good start to the day. We also ate one night in the hotel and the food was really good and reasonable.

My only complaint is that every time you enter the hotel, you and your belongings have to go through a security scan, which seems a bit excessive, especially after you check in. they actually showed me what they had confiscated, and it happened to be a swiss army knife (we all know how dangerous they can be right?) and a kitchen knife commonly used to cut lemons.

Please note that the hotel is NOT right next to the beach, its a good 7-8 minute walk. They offer a shuttle and although its availability cannot be guaranteed, every time i wanted to use it, it was mostly available within 10-20 minutes."
2726,Faultless accommodation and staff!,50,June 2016,"We stayed at the beautiful Courtyard Marriott for 10 nights and loved every moment!

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the beds were super comfortable and the rooms tastefully decorated.

The staff from every department were always friendly and welcoming. I don't think I ever saw a staff member without a smile on their face. This made our holiday even more enjoyable as the hotel had a very special feel to it.

The security is fantastic as all cars are thoroughly checked before they can drop off or collect passengers. There is also a metal detector and scanning check each time guests enter the hotel. We felt very secure during our stay.

The hotel buggy service was also fantastic. We used it daily to travel to Eat Street and down to Seminyak beach. The Marriott had it's own sectioned off part of the beach where towels, water, lounges and even icy poles were provided. This was very much appreciated!

As mentioned in many posts, the breakfasts were exceptional!! We loved sitting out on the balcony every morning with so many tasty choices offered each day. We also really enjoyed the lattes which they would also do as takeaways.

Our kids loved the free popcorn and fairy floss and we thought this was a really unique idea. We also enjoyed the daily water aerobics classes. There was a great vibe around the pool when these were held. The recreation team made great efforts to provide fun games and activities for all guests.

Thank you to all staff at the Courtyard Marriott, you certainly tick all the boxes for a relaxing and 5 star holiday. We will certainly be back!!"
2727,What a treat!,50,June 2016,"As a first time visitor and solo traveler to Bali I had no idea what to expect, but was told to stay in Seminyak by a cousin and then was excited to see a Marriott was located there just minutes from the beach. The positive reviews did not disappoint!! This is not your run of the mill American Marriott. The hotel and pool area are beautiful and the rooms modern and spacious. My loyalty to Marriott was recognized and I was upgraded to a pool side suite that was decadent. Service was always friendly and the security guards greeted me with a smile every time I came back from venturing out. The hotel is a 5 min walk to the beach and a 10-15 minute walk to their dedicated space on the beach. Make sure to have someone point it out!! The buffet as many have mentioned is fantastic with lots of varieties and I was thrilled when I realized I could get unlimited iced lattes at breakfast. I felt safe at all times on and around the property and will definitely stay again if I'm in Bali!"
2728,Great Hotel,50,June 2016,"Had a week in this hotel and loved it. Staff and cleanliness and breakfast first rate, obviously very well managed.

Booked through Expedia and no issues. Just a couple of things to be aware of:- our standard King room backed onto a road and was a little noisy for us with traffic/scooters, so ear plugs would be handy. On requesting another room, we were moved without any problems, very grateful. The pool area sometimes had a lack of sun beds with people reserving them and not using which can be frustrating, but never for long periods of time. There can be a lack of sun due to the shade from the building, but this didn't concern us as happy to sit & read under umbrella.

The Spa looked lovely but we frequented the one at Grandmas Hotel (5th floor), 3 minute walk away, for excellent couples massages.

It rained for a few days we were there so didn't get to use beach area as often as we wanted, though golf buggy shuttle handy.

Taxied to Eat St for excellent restaurants.

Overall a fantastic hotel üòÉ."
2729,Lovely,40,June 2016,We enjoyed our stay here for 9 days. The rooms were more than adequate. The location was very close 3-4 min walk to the beach. The pool was lovely however it spends a lot of time in the shade at this time of year and unless you go before 9am you may not get a lounge in the sun. I would stay somewhere else next time as a lounge by the pool in the sun in my idea of a great holiday. If that doesnt matter to you then this is a great place.
2730,awesome place to stay for our first bali trip,50,May 2016,"we left with a very positive impression of bali, definitely wanting to come back one day and i believe that is in part to staying at this great hotel. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, always with a friendly greeting... although i did find the security screening hard to remember and it seems a bit over the top, but i guess it's for the best! the rooms were clean and fresh and had all that was required. My only point to keep in mind is that if i returned i would only book a pool view room to minimise the disturbance from the road as it stopped me from sleeping well, the sound proofing between rooms is great but there seems to be none on the outside doors, strangely!! the breakfast choices are amazing, make sure you try the waffles!! the pool is a good size, the drinks are awesome as are the pool bean bags- the most relaxed i think i've ever felt in water. All in all we would return, just making sure we had the right room location."
2731,"Service plus with a smile and an appreciation of your choosing ""their"" hotel above all of the others.",50,June 2016,"The outstanding element for us was the service standards set by the Courtyard and followed by all staff, nothing was too much trouble. The service from all outlets was highly commendable, of particular note was the staff of the hotel's eatery, The Seminyak Kitchen. Always smiling and never too busy to personally attend to your requests. I have traveled widely and the staff at the Courtyard match it with the very best. Congratulations to all concerned you all contributed to a lovely holiday for us."
2732,Mostly Great,40,May 2016,"Stayed for 8 nights in May-great rooms spacious enough and always clean. Nice balcony overlooking the pool. Reception area very nice and the bar by the pool was good, although the music each night with the speakers blaring music out , i would not have liked a room opposite it. Way too loud.
The same goes for the lovely spa-tried to have relaxing massagw but couldnt hear the relaxing spa music because it was drowned out by the music coming from the pool bar ....turn it down or soundproof your spa ?"
2733,Slightly disappointed,30,June 2016,"1) we emailed them mentioning that we were there for my birthday but nothing was done ): they said they actually forgot about it! Quite disappointing.

2) we had a room facing the main road and it was so noisy. You can constantly hear the cars and people talking downstairs even though I was on the highest floor. Disturbed sleep at night and woken up way too early at 6 plus because of all these noise. Remember to book a pool facing view.

That being said, staff were super polite and always greeting us! Love it! Rooms were clean and spacious enough for 2."
2734,Perfect for travelers of all kinds,50,May 2016,"Having been to Bali numerous times and always staying in Villas, booking this hotel was a first for me. We chose it for its convenient location as well as amenities. We were not disappointed.

From the moment I arrived, I was showered with Balinese hospitality. Despite some issues with the room arrangements, the front desk really did their best to accommodate our requests despite the full capacity. While waiting, I was given a voucher for a welcome drink at the bar to start my holiday.

Breakfast was part of our booking and a must for all guests. Its the only place that serves waffles and ice cream for breakfast which is great for kids and big kids like me. The wait staff do make the effort to go around and speak to the guests and inquire about their well-being which was nice.

Poolside dining was on point too. We never waited more than 2 minutes to make an order and the food was delivered warm and fresh. They had pool exercises during the late morning which is a great alternative for those who wish to get some ""exercise"" in. I do wish they had more floats around the pool though. There are some guests who would come before breakfast and ""reserve"" the best sunbathing spots so if a tan is what you're after, go early.

The gym is small and does get a bit crowded in the mornings so if you'd like to workout a bit before breakfast, you'd have to be early.

The rooms were spacious and clean. I love Marriott beds so the only problem I had with this was the dilemma of choosing to get up and eat, swim or just stay in bed ALL DAY. Wifi was also on point! I could watch Netflix, do conference calls and whatever i needed ALL around the hotel, pool and room. Top points on that!

Location wise, super easy to walk out to the beach, close to the shopping streets, minutes walk from Warung Made and several spas and tons of convenience stores just outside. Getting a taxi from the front of the hotel is also really easy.

Overall, this was an amazing experience. I am definitely coming back for more. Safe to say that I would feel comfortable here even as a lone traveler. Its like being at home with the comforts of the hotel. This hotel is giving the W a run for its money."
2735,"Great hotel, awesome staff and 5mins from the beach!",50,June 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed here from June 13-22. After traveling for almost 40hrs, we arrived in Bali pretty late but check in was smooth and quick.(Faster if you do it through your phone!) I read other reviews about the security on this property so I wasn't surprised but my bf on the other hand was a little freaked out haha.

The hotel is very nice and pretty new. Our room wasn't extremely spacious but it was quite comfortable for the two of us. We got a room overlooking the pool area which was nice when we sat on the balcony but I will say it can get pretty loud around noon. The pool was really nice and relaxing. We went swimming a couple times and went night swimming once. When the sun goes down everybody leaves the pool but they don't close it until 9 so we had the pool to ourselves.

The staff was really amazing!! They were always so kind and helpful. The breakfast was awesome! So many choices to fit everyone's liking. From cereal, bread, western style foods, Indonesian food and even Indian food! They also offer made to order lattes and teas.

We also ate at the hotel a couple of times for lunch, dinner and room service. Honestly we weren't expecting much but it was really good! I'm not sure why they don't really get business during lunch/dinner but the food is awesome and compared to hotel food here in U.S., extremely affordable!

We also booked a couples stone massage which was AMAZINNNGGG!!! So amazing that we were going to do it again but time did not permit. Again very affordable I think about $100 USD.

The hotel offers golf cart rides to the beach but it is a 5min walk or even less. The location was really ideal for people who enjoy night life. Very close to bars and different restaurants.

I would definitely return to this hotel!"
2736,So much amazing food!,50,June 2016,"Huge breakfast buffet selection that conveniently goes until 11am. I loved the free popcorn and fairy floss machine they had every afternoon plus the tacos from their 'What The Truck' taco van in the driveway are seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had.
Perfect location - 5 minutes walk to the beach and a 5 minute taxi to all the trendy restaurants and shopping. Really fun and social vibe by the pool, particularly at the swim up bar. They even have giant bean bags to float on in the pool. The staff were also incredibly friendly and even got to know us by name. Only negative thing I can think of is the lack of lighting in the hotel bathroom, particularly difficult if you want to put make up on."
2737,Suited for family,50,June 2016,"this hotel is very nice for young couple of family who able to take the advantage of happy hours. Had a golf buggy service, nice pool, pretty good spa treatment. Very nice breakfast with plenty choices and great location. Just few meters to go the beach. Easy to find taxi services when you gonna out"
2738,Half way thru,50,June 2016,"So far my husband and I are about halfw the way thru our holiday and the weather has been very ordinary, quite the opposite to our lovely hotel the CourtYard Marriott.
This hotel has been nothing short of amazing. The food especially breakfast is absolutely wonderful for quality, service and choice. Room service has been excellent, the staff are all wonderlly helpful and friendly.
We have stayed at so many places in Bali including the four seasons Jimbarin, KatrikaPlaza Tuban, Ibah Warwick hotels together with quite a number more (too many to list) and this lovely hotel us right up there for us. Thanks to all the staff. It has been a lovely surprise üòö"
2739,"Good location, Disappointing staff",30,June 2016,"Spent 7 nights for a family holiday. Close to the beach and shops. Decent if sparse gym and nice rooms (pillows were great). Breakfast daily was a highlight, along with the friendly restaurant staff. However.....
1. The ATM machine in the hotel swallowed our credit card, and the lack of support and follow up from the hotel staff was poor and disappointing. This influenced how much money we could access for the rest of the week. We also just wanted confirmation that the card was destroyed and could not be removed and used by others.The reception staff promised to follow up for us though we had to keep chasing them and still, a week later, had no information given to us by the hotel staff.
2. We pre-purchased a 2 million rupiah food account. The amount purchased was non refundable so we rang on our last day for the balance to make sure we spent the full amount for which we had paid, On checkout we found they had been giving us non-updated tallies, so in trying to use our full pre-purchased amount we actually ended up over-spending. Not concerning huge sums of money, though just poor service with no apology."
2740,Surprise - Courtyard Marriott,50,June 2016,"When was the last time you stayed at a Courtyard Marriott? Bet it wasn't a resort ...

This property in Seminyak is one of two resorts in Bali and it's not yet two years old (the other is located at Nusa Dua).

Incredibly impressed with the very modern, contempory and stylish rooms - mainly two types - Deluxe room (city/street view) and Deluxe Pool View room of which faces in towards the swim-up bar and inffinity pool spilling over into another lower level pool which is quieter and a little less celebratory - all within the complex.

Incidentally the property is not too far from the beach area and walkable.

A beach buggy takes guests there as well on a regular circuit and welcomed by many who may wish to stay only a short while and return to the ease and access of this pool. Upbeat music was played all afternoon and then a more traditional exhibition of locals dancing at 6:00 pm really engaged the young kiddies who most likely had been out all day only to be in bed not long afterwards. The music was lowered again to an agreeable tempo and volume so it wasn't at all intrusive for those wanting an early night - considering the time difference at home was two hours later.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed with light fittings easy to find and operate, meaning they have an on-off switches instead of the myriad of high tech functionalities sometimes we're faced with in a newish hotel. TV screens are huge - front on and centre to a really comfy bed with a number of pillows to choose from when resting.

Ample cupboard space for long-time stayers to feel settled without being cluttered or stifled. The balcony has a settee with a small table to enjoy drinks and watch those down at the swim-up bar! Good wifi in the room which was fast and effortless to access - especially when it comes to connectivity. No hiccups at all.

Highly recommend this resort especially if you are considering a long stay. Breakfast was an assortment of all kinds of goodies, including Indonesian cuisine.

I really liked the fact the taxi had a security check before dropping me off and again we had to place our luggage etc through a scanner before entering the premises. Felt safe being here.

My advice to Marriott is to rebrand as this property gives a totally different perspective to the usual Courtyard look and feel."
2741,Good Visit,40,June 2016,"Quiet aircon, beautifully appointed room which has been well designed and included phone points beside bed. We had a ground floor, walk direct to pool room and it was great being able to access pool via the back door.
Cleaners did great job and place always looks immaculate.
Nice being able to order a selection of coffees for breakfast.
Good selection of items at breakfast with various locations to eat offering areas for noise, quiet, cold, warmth.
Staff all young and friendly.
Popcorn, candy floss, ice-block treats etc all little free perks which are lovely touches.
Gym well appointed and seemed to get alot of use.
Good atmosphere around the place and a mixture of ages.
Nice evening live music echoing throughout the resort.
Shuttle to beach fantastic and it didn't seem to ever be a problem just to rock up and secure a lift.
Only downside which everyone comments about is the cold pool as it hardly gets the sun - it is such a shame as it looks so inviting."
2742,Conference Training,50,June 2016,"Had a conference stay and its Awesome!! Having comfy room, delicious food (breakfast, lunch & dinner), awesome people serving! Good food, good bed and good people!! Is a must to have training and funs there! Thank you for making it brilliant guys!! U guys are awesome!!!! üëçüèºüëçüèº"
2743,Retreat at Courtyard,50,June 2016,"Stayed in Courtyard Bali Seminyak for 3 nights. Appreciated the cold towel and welcome drink even when we checked in late at night. Brand new facilities, beautiful and tastefully decorated rooms. Location has good access to shops, amenities, spas and 5 min walk to the beach. Interacted with various staff over the 4 days and they are always polite and accommodating, with reasonably good command of English to hold simple conversations and answer our questions. Specific mention of Mr Adi and Mr Ali who took the initiative to offer advice and assistance and was impressed with the attention to detail. Ideal as a conference or business retreat venue. Wifi access is hassle-free. : )"
2744,Nice but felt like a good business hotel rather than a vaction hotel,40,May 2016,"Expected more from a hotel using the Marriott brand and certainly not as good as other Marriott hotels we have stayed in. We stayed for 4 nights as part of a weeks holiday in Bali. Let down by a few minor things but overall pretty good.

On check in the room was not especially clean, the towels looked grimy and several of the amenities, including slippers, were missing .All were very quickly rectified by housekeeping. On the third day we realized we did not have a room service menu, when we reported this at reception the guy just stared at us blankly. Seemed like he had a hard time believing that we; a. actually wanted to eat in the room, or, b. were too stupid to find the menu. I gave up on him and phoned housekeeping when we got back to the room. They delivered a menu within a couple of minutes.

Room size is adequate but not particularly generous but was fine my my wife and I. We were on the second floor overlooking the pool so our room location was good. Bed and pillows were fine. Wifi is good and the signal was strong at all times.

Breakfast is a typical international buffet which was very good except the toast machine that produced warm stale bread rather than toast. To stop you playing with the settings they had removed the knobs from the dials so for best results flip the bread and put it back in. My wife went for a full range of foods, I had my usual egg on toast. I did shake it up a bit on one occasion and had scrambled eggs rather than fried eggs. Different types of coffee can be ordered (free of charge) and the cappuccino is pretty good.

On the last day we checked out early and left our luggage at the hotel. When we return to collect the suitcases the hotel were kind enough to allow us to use the fitness centre to shower and change before heading for the airport. This was really appreciated.

The hotel location is very good, close the beach and close to the shops and lots of restaurants.

So, fairly good hotel and value for money although not up to the usual Marriott standards. Good housekeeping service. Good location. Friendly and patient staff. It did feel a bit like a business hotel rather than a holiday hotel though."
2745,"Amazing honeymoon and best stay ever""""",50,June 2016,"We stayed at this hotel celebrating our honeymoon in courtyard Seminyak. The stay was memorable and amazing. The service was 5 star and super efficient! Room was clean, well equipped and what photos you can see on their website is true. The pool is very clean with a nice a pool bar.

The breakfast buffet was amazing, loads of choices. Location is great, 10 mins walk from everything. I would stay at this hotel every time I visit Seminyak. Hotel staff from reception to front porters/security are very friendly and cheerful.

Special thanks to the General Manager John Woolley for a memorable honeymoon. It was lovely to meet you."
2746,Excellent Experience stay in CY Seminyak,50,June 2016,"My first time stay in Hotel around Seminyak area (More review intan-kusumasari.blogspot.com). Luxury hotel with beautiful design interior. My fav pool view from balcony, sunbathing and enjoy my day. For breakfast and dinner so many selection of dish in Seminyak Kitchen restaurant in CY Seminyak. Lunch with Tacos in What The Truck CY Lobby, worth it! Delicious. After that are you Getting fat? Don't worry burn it in pool or fitness place, good moment. I never forget this experience, best hotel with good service."
2747,BEST OVERALL HOTEL WE HAVE EVER STAYED IN!!,50,June 2016,"Make sure you stay at this hotel as it is fantastic. Stayed with my wife for an 8 day Luxury Escapes deal, like most of the other ""Aussies"" we spoke to at the hotel. We were picked up at the Airport in style and a very quick check in to our beautiful poolside view room. Great bed, huge bathroom, safe, brand new room decor, powerful air conditioner and a large balcony with a comfortable outdoor lounge on it. Had a huge TV with lots of Foxtel channels, even 3 movie channels for free, which is unusual in most hotels you stay in.
The pool area is superb and the water so cool and clean, with plenty of lounges to lay on, all with umbrellas and floating beds in the pool. Nice swim up pool bar and music every night to go with the 2 hour happy hour for drinks. Free hot popcorn, peanuts and chips to eat while you sit on the lovely lounges in the pool bar. Terrific bar food served to pool lounges and bar area and very cheap in prices for a 5 star hotel.
The Seminyak Kitchen has the best food that we have eaten anywhere for a hotel. We had 6 dinners there and they were all fantastic, especially the Saturday night Seafood dinner for $25.00AUD. So much food and desserts and the only problem we had was when they ran out of Balmain bugs, but we were impressed when the Head Chef came to our table and apologised several times to us about the bugs. We had lunch by the pool several times and again all the food was top class and served nice and hot. But the breakfast at the Courtyard has to be seen to be believed, the biggest range you will find anywhere. Indonesian, Indian, fresh fruit, great egg station, waffles, ice cream, bagels, pastries,freshly squeezed juices,fantastic chocolate donuts and good coffee. Forget about the best breakfast in Bali, this is the best anywhere!! The staff and cooks make this restaurant very special and they are all a credit to your hotel. You can see the open kitchen while the chefs cook and you can eat in 2 balcony areas, a room facing the kitchen or a closed air conditioned room, which are all spotlessly clean by the army of staff who work tirelessly. Parwati, a young Indonesian girl who cleared the tables, had the friendliest smile I have ever seen, no matter how busy she was during our entire stay. Make sure you try the tacos from the""What the truck"" just outside the hotel, $5.00AUD for 2 and you can't stop eating them. All the food and drinks are such high quality and low in price, you do not have to eat on the ""street"" if you do not want to leave the hotel.
Hotel has very tight security as you enter the hotel everytime, a free shuttle to ""eat steet"" and has a free shuttle to it's own roped off beach area, where you receive free lounges with umbrellas, towels, cold water bottles and even ice blocks!! Has a well equipped air conditioned gym that opens 24 hours, where every machine actually works and are brand new. Plenty of fresh towels, cold water, fruit and even cold towels in the fridge, TV's on all machines and a great toilet and shower. Also has a beautiful spa area with massages and beauty treatments which you must try.
This is a special hotel, but it is all the staff that make this hotel, from the gardener, security, front desk, room cleaners, waiters, cooks, to all of the management that serve and acknowledge every guest in the hotel. In 8 days I never walked past one staff member who did not say hello to me, you do not find that in many hotels, if any. When you see the hotel manager and his junior management team (especially Grant who was fantastic) at breakfast, talking to guests and even picking up dishes when it was hectic, you know you are staying in a hotel that cares about their guests and their well being.
Even when you check out at 12.00PM they don't kick you out like most hotels do and check out was done very quickly and without any problems. We were able to leave our bags locked up in storage, spent the afternoon by the pool, had happy hour drinks and a final tasty dinner in the bar lounge, while listening to the duo playing music. We then went to the gym for a shower, dressed and weighed and packed our bags for our flight home at 10.15PM.
Thank you to everyone at the Courtyard for a holiday we will never forget and we will be back for sure, to stay in your beautiful hotel and country."
2748,Great value,40,June 2016,"We just got back today, The Courtyard Marriott is very classy, 1 year old and although all rooms have a pool view and are a bit on the small side they are very well appointed and well planned. Get rid of your bags, spare chair to the balcony and you'll make space out of nothing. We took advantage of a great Cudo deal, Evening meal (they will let you order one meal each of two nights if you get this offer) Meals are big and if you don't like over eating its a good idea. 16 Cocktails per couple 9you can get beer instead if it's your thing) The staff and service are great, they have a terrific breakfast and in my opinion fantastic location, 200 mtrs to beach, 10 minute beach walk to Seminyak Square, Eat Street and Ko Da Ta (or is it To Ka Da, what ever) They will give you ice if you like a balcony happy hour pre dinner. Really great place. The one downside for some may be that it's just like any 5 star Hotel anywhere. Not Bali Style"
2749,Above average with some caveats,30,June 2016,"The hotel is large and run like a well oiled machine. Which is the first caveat - I requested room as quiet as possible and paid a bit extra above the base price, yet I was automatically given a room facing a street. And it directly opposite a bar with live rock music, which would not stop every evening until 10 pm and the motorcycle rattling which would never stop. Yes, it was barely tolerable. I don't like to complain and change rooms, so I did nothing.

The breakfast was well, great, as someone already mentioned; the selection was varied and all tastes and whims except the very expensive ones may be satisfied. It was quite inexpensive for our family of three with a toddler having a free meal.

Yet, the dinner was not particularly varied and overpriced - with base meal price bloated not only by ever-present Indonesian tax, but also by ""service fee"" which is quite sneaky way to charge 25% above what is listed in the menu.
Evening meals were so-so, with distinctly too much salt in burgers and fish fingers - perhaps to encourage the drinkers to drink more. As I largely stayed away from alcohol, I found dinners rather uninspiring and would advise everyone to eat elsewhere, unless you are going to concentrate on gulping the beer (which is also pricey and not all the listed options are actually available - none of my favorite dark lagers nor ales! ).

The rooms (base size option) are OK, but a bit on a smaller side - so that the baby cot was just fitting in between the bed and the wall, or in the tiny entrance corridor. An option to have a baby sleeping in the same room should at least consider the room layout that fits the cot comfortably and leaves some floor area for children games. Good idea would be removing some unnecessary furniture, like chairs and tables, from the rooms designed for couples with small kids. Unfortunately this idea did not enter hotel managers collective minds. Fortunately they have dedicated kid's play room, with an optional paid baby sitting for toddlers.

The sound insulation between the floors is badly executed, so after the room above was populated with the guests later during our stay, we could hear every midnight toilet flush and shower of theirs as if it was executed right next to our bed. Sure this could be counted as another negative point.

Service was excellent overall; still waiting for the AU$400 to be returned to our account, but other then that all our requests - albeit very small and meek - were met most promptly graciously.

For those requiring some solitude and quiet time I would recommend visiting the gym. Oddly enough it was the quietest place in the hotel; apparently most of the guests prefer alcohol infused leisure around the swimming pool with shrieking children.

Portions of popcorn, fairy floss and shuttle to the local beach are all free, while the bicycle hire in the hotel is pretty dear compared to some European cities. Yet where else you'd find free fairy floss freshly made?

The security level in the hotel approaches one in the airport, i.e. there is a metal detector and guards to pass upon every entry. Which could be both annoying and reassuring depending on your personal attitude."
2750,Marriott Seminyak,40,June 2016,"We are half way through our stay at this hotel. It's a nice hotel in a good location.
The staff are amazing and make the hotel what it is this is our forth time in a Marriott
In both Phuket and Bali. The standards are always high. The main problem is beds around the pool it's like being back in Spain where people get up at the crack of dawn and place towels on the few beds there then either go back to bed, get breakfast or go shopping. Just not right.üò´üò´"
2751,"Great location, friendly staff",50,June 2016,"I travelled here recently with my mum and son. It's my second time staying at this hotel & it was better than the first. (I last came just as it opened in 2014) The first night this time we had a room with a balcony facing the street which was noisy. After paying an additional $40AUD per night we changed to a ground floor pool access room which was beautiful.
The staff were all lovely & helpful. The kids club came in really handy & they offer after hour babysitting at a really reasonable rate ($8AUD) per hour. Big shoutout to Santi who was always a friendly smiling face in the kids club & looked after my son son so well.
I was dissapointed that the hotel now charges for yoga/pilates classes where it was free before but impressed by additional things available - money changer, spa, food truck, ping pong, shuttle to 66 beach etc.
The hotel is close to the beach (5 minute walk) & 20 minute walk to Seminyak Square.
I would definately stay here again"
2752,Exactly what you pay for. Friendly service great rooms great location.,50,June 2016,"We are a well travelled family and this is one of the better hotels that we have stayed in whilst in Bali. We upgraded from the Deluxe pool terrace to the Suite pool terrace (room 153 worth requesting) at a fraction of the cost with no hassle (Deluxe room just not big enough with a 7 Year old), rooms are very clean offering modern Bedroom, lounge and seperate bathroom all spacious with great aircon and up to date appliances ( TV digital radio with ISB charging facility also wall power outlets are universal allowing all plugs to fit.
Sensational breakfast in the one and only hotel restaurant who also do great variety of evening meals at a reasonable price.
Staff are really friendly and happy to help this goes across the board in the Balinese hospitality industry.
The hotel offers a private beach club area which is not easy to find for those who like to worship the sun (beach access 3-5 mins walk away) as the hotel pool are is shaded for a good part of the day by the hotel, worked for us as the little one loves the pool.
The beach offers a great selection of bars and really large selection of bean bags to watch the sunset well worth it.
We had a late 11:30pm flight so we had a late checkout 3pm which works to a point, so we asked to extend if possible, they offered 1 days rate at $400 or move to a smaller room at $190. So we had the late 3pm check out (leave your cases at the Marriot) and checked in with a night bag at the Ping hotel across the road for $41 a night which gave us a small but suitable for its purpose room that had a King bed and bathroom to freshen up at the end of the day bargain and also great budget hotel. well worth thinking about."
2753,"Great service, good location, average stay",30,June 2016,"Stayed for 5 nights with my family. The rooms were pretty decent but ask for the rooms facing the courtyard as the traffic can be disturbing. Rooms were slightly small but clean. The toiletries were really basic - no shaver not comb provided. Wifi is good.

The hotel compound is small and there is nothing much to explore. Then again, you are likely to spend most of your time outside anyway. There is free buggy ride that will take you to the beach club. There is only one restaurant but it serves pretty decent food.

Overall, the stay was pleasant but not totally impressed. I am afraid it might be unfair to judge this against other resort hotels in Nusa Dua and not having stayed in other hotels in Seminyak. But I really struggled to rate a 4 as the great service provided by the staff probably deserve another point. Finally, I decided that the stay is just average for me."
2754,All you need and close to everything else!,50,June 2016,"We spent 3 nights in June at The Courtyard Seminyak to celebrate 26 years together and had a most excellent time! The Resort is new and clean, with nice eats, a spa, fitness center, three great pools and an excellent selection of cable TV channels to watch, even FOX News! The Resort sits east/west, so there is pool sun all day long. It is only an easy 5 minute walk straight done the sidewalk to an incredibly lovely beach, or take the free shuttle down.
The breakfast buffet is by far THE BEST that we have found during our worldly travels. The variety is exceptional, and the items were replenished frequently. The omelette was great, but it all was. The neatest thing is the fact that the chocolate ice cream (and other flavors) was available at breakfast!! Thanks for letting me have ice cream at breakfast~~~
The ""What The Truck"" is a wonderful little food coach at the front of the Resort that had GREAT food. The Babi (pork) or Ayam (chicken) Tacos were marvelous and a wonderful way to get thru a hungry afternoon before dinner.
The Courtyard is next to everything that you could possibly need during a Holiday to Bali, with many shops, restaurants and the beach all with in 5 minutes!!!!
THANK YOU. We WILL be back~~"
2755,Wonderful Stay,50,June 2016,"Just arrived home after a 8 night stay. It was my first time in Bali so i was a little unsure of what to expect however im glad i did stay here.

Upon arrival to the hotel your transfer is stopped for a security check , whilst to some this may seem as an inconvenience after a day of travelling it made me feel safe so i wasn't bothered by this at all.

Check in was quite an easy process , luggage arrived to our room in a timely manner, rooms whilst a little on the smaller side no big deal as you don't spend the day in the room. We had interconnecting rooms so this made it feel a little roomier. Yes the rooms facing the street can be a little nosy both day and night with the constant beeping of taxis and motorbikes up and down the street and night time having music from across the road at the restaurant/resort but by 10pm music was finished .

As for the surroundings the resort is quite nice, only issue being the pool position which doesn't allow for much tanning during the day. There is a beach within 10 mins walking distance to the hotel or if you prefer there is a buggy drop off service however im a little disappointed to find out from reading other reviews today that there is a section on the beach for guests of the hotel with sun-lounges and towels. i was unaware of this and had i known i definitely would have used this service and perhaps had a little more sun time. This information should be provided upon check-in maybe something to take up with staff on the desk.

Rooms were cleaned daily and amenities were provided , bottled water was replenished daily.

i found staff at all times extremely friendly and helpful , breakfast staff were always a delight and often would be amusing my baby while i was having breakfast , so don't be concerned if staff pick up your baby and walk around with them. i found they always asked which was nice instead of just assuming it was ok.

Breakfast was amazing there is definitely something for everyone so no complaints there.

Overall a great experience and would definitely stay here again."
2756,nice hotel....BUT,40,May 2016,"After spending 6 nights at the hotel it was a change to see what other hotels has to offer. The staff here are very friendly and as you would find in most places around Bali it just goes to show that these people enjoy us the visitors being here at their hotels. This hotel is very clean, the rooms are very well maintained with the air con working very well. the Seminyak kitchen has a good variety for breakfast and as there is only (1) dinning area at this hotel, this is where you go for lunch and dinner. The pool area and bar is good but there music, I think you guys who run the pool should really change that rubbish music you play!!! The only gripe I have about this hotel is the LACK OF SUN...I know its not the staff at the hotels fault but about 80% of the time the sun is covered by the hotel building. To be honest I think if you walk out on the main street you might get a lot more or you go down to the beach!!!! But all in all would give this hotel a rating of 7/10. Would I come back..most likely no!!! Cheers."
2757,Poor,10,May 2016,"After buying a package from Lavinia on OZ TV, I was bitterly dissappointed. This was a 5 star resort (according to TV) but more like a 3 star in real life! The food was disappointing - my Wife and I both had food poisioning (never before in 10 trips) the
package deal was desputed at checkout and the pool was in shade from early afternoon - not to mention that Breakfast was entirely populated by Chinese guests.
My benchmark of anything is ""would I go back there again and/or would I recommend to friends or family"" and my answer is HELL NO - stay well away unless you are Chinese."
2758,Love this hotel,50,March 2016,This hotel is really wonderful with the most friendliest staff! The rooms had fresh towels and very clean. Breakfast had a substantial variety and loved the breads! Pool bar.. 5 stars for it! I had the pool view room on the ground floor.
2759,Impressed,50,March 2016,"Went there to visit my friends stayed at that time. Great impression started at the gate. Security did check the guests or vehicles came inside the hotel properly,which is now very important nowadays. Then,by the time i reached the lobby,felt really cozy,great ambiance...then Daniel, introduce himself as manager there and showed me and my friend around while waiting for our friends got ready. We spent some time at seminyak kitchen...amazing staff to compliment fantastic decor of the restaurant. What a great hotel,absolutely with the Marriott brand within the name,quality would always be awesome...
Thank you guys for the time,would love to experience more in the future.."
2760,"Great Bfast, Amazing Hotel",50,June 2016,"Even for short stay i'm really enjoy for weekend gateaway in here.
Great breakfast, Great Location, Walking distance to beach. but to bad while in beach wish can find sign of this part of Beach access for Courtyard Marriott hahahah...
Really lovely had breakfast in here...
Pool is big n enjoy, hope can comeback soon again for stay longer."
2761,"Perfect, if You Don't Mind Being Away From the Action",40,May 2016,"We booked a Deluxe Double with pool view for 4 nights from May 21st to 25th.

The good:
- friendly and helpful staff
- felt safe due to strict security check at entrance
- free (strong) wifi
- room is modern and clean
- delicious food
- buffet breakfast opens till 11am
- amazing cappuccino at breakfast
- poolside and poolside bar's ambience was good (with good choice of music)
- not by the beach but a short walk to it

The not-so-good:
- fraps/non alcoholic drinks at the poolside weren't great (frap wasn't thick enough and tasted mostly of syrup)
- only one side of the pool gets the sun, so gotta go early to get a sun bed if you wanna tan
- water in the pool wasn't too clean (I got rashes after dipping in it on day 2. My husband swam in it and he said that although the water looks clean on the surface, when he put his head under water, he could see that the water wasn't clear, and there were particles floating in it. His skin didn't react to it as mine did though. Maybe my skin is just too sensitive.)
- smoking is allowed around the pool, on the balcony and outside the rooms
- room doors don't have much damping (close with a loud bang, which is not very pleasant at 730am in the morning)"
2762,Great hotel,50,May 2016,"I recently came back from staying at the Courtyard Marriott for ten nights. It's a gorgeous hotel.
The staff made me feel so comfortable - remembering my name at breakfast time or saying hello as I walked to the pool.
The rooms are styled perfectly. My only gripe with my room was the volume of the music coming from the bar but it wasn't like it went late into the night.
I highly recommend this hotel - it's 5 minutes walk to the beach, and the hotel even has their own section on the beach with lounge chairs, towels and bottles of water available.
There is a hotel golf buggy which can take you down to the beach or up to one of the main streets in Seminyak. It would have been great if it just went a little bit further but that's a tiny issue that shouldn't put anyone off from staying here!"
2763,7 stars hospitality,50,June 2016,"I was staying for my company event. My office is in Jakarta and all communication between the banquet team and me only thru email and phone.

All the banquet team were very helpful. No complain at all for the event management. All the concerns from electricity to internet connection were done perfectly.
The networking dinner was initiatively arranged outdoor by the banquet team, ended the event.

We even had free access to business center (1 hour usage meeting room and free printing). For these facilities, reservation need to be made.

I also made room reservation for my company management and my event guests. Even the last minute request were arranged perfectly, even in high season situation.

However, the check in process was disappointing, because of the long queue. Again, it was high season.
The check-in time was 3.00 pm. So you better put your stuffs in concierge area and walk around, till your room is ready.

The room was great. The bathroom and amenities were great. Room with direct access to pool is preferred.
Children friendly (free popcorn) and free event every day for all guests in pool area.
However, you need to pay for using bicycle.

The breakfast was great. The menu and all the service. Various fruits and ice cream everyday. You also could see the GM of Hotel collected the trash from the floor in breakfast area.
The only complain was the juice. It was not pure juice.

Overall, great satisfaction!
Will come again for family trip for sure."
2764,Amazing,50,June 2016,"Have just returned from 7 nights staying at the Courtyard Marriott.
100% perfect.
Location great. Walking distance to beach. The hotel buggy can drop you to the beach to a private area for Marriott guests. Water, towels and lounges provided.
Rooms great. Beautiful comfortable beds. Spotlessly cleaned daily.
Breakfast great. Huge variety. Amazing.
Staff beautiful. Shout out to Ari, Toni and Augustine. Lovely genuine people. Always greeted us by name. Great asset to the Marriott.
Pool bar fantastic.
Great duo on guitar 5-8 every night! Loved this. Nice touch.
Would recommend paying the extra few dollars per night to stay here! It won't let you down!
I will be returning in October and look forward to staying here again."
2765,Lovely Lovely Lovely,50,June 2016,"Great Hotel!!! Staff is veryyy friendly with lovely smiles on their faces all day long, be it the gardner, reception or just any staff member. We are honeymooners and were welcomed woth a beautiful piece of cake, so sweet of them. Breakfast is a killler!!!!!!!!!! You have the most variety you can ever possibly ask for. Rooms are always clean and tidy, ammenities are changed on daily basis.

You go to Seminyak You definitely have to stay at this resort!!! Trust me on this one!! Plus the shuttle buses available.. all in all justGREAT!!!!

Thank you #Courtyard <3"
2766,Staff & location are excellent! Breakfast is yummy!,50,June 2016,"We secured a group booking of about 20 rooms the first week of June 2016 for a destination wedding in Bali. We had a group aged 25-30 & also 50-70, had no complaints from anyone. This is not the average Courtyard Marriott that you'd find in the USA, it's MUCH nicer! All the comforts of a large hotel property without the price tag.

Rooms - A bit on the small end if you don't get a suite, but they're very clean & modern! Beds are comfy, shower has great water pressure, and a/c is cold.

Facilities - Awesome! The Seminyak Kitchen included breakfast buffet is the best (lunch/dinner is delicious too)! Room service is available 24/7 with a mix of Indo & Western foods. There is something for everyone! Pool is great and gym is sufficient while on holiday :) Transportation can be arranged immediately when you have groups that are too large for a taxi and the drivers are very courteous and prompt.

Staff - Fantastic! They're all so welcoming from check-in to check-out, any request for amenities sent to your room are done so in a timely manner. The pool bartenders & taco truck staff are very friendly. The staff really makes this place welcoming for all.

Location - Not on the beach, but there is a golf cart that will transport you 5 minutes to the hotel's private area on the beach. A little touristy, but basically you're right in the heart of Seminyak.

Highly recommended! Felt very safe & didn't have any issues is Bali belly while eating at the hotel. There really is something for everyone here :)"
2767,Perfect,50,May 2016,"We just spent 10 nights here and we found it to be a perfect location and an amazing stay with all the staff of the resort to be over and above our expectations. made our holiday an even greater one and would not hesitate to recommend to everyone. Very clean and the food was of a high standard.
Thank to all
Greg and Karen"
2768,Dream Hotel!,50,June 2016,"The best Hotel we have ever stayed at in Bali. Our new favourite! Literally best breakfast, best atmosphere at a swim up pool bar, best location, best shower.......my list could go on forever! Thank you Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak!"
2769,Excellent Hotel,50,July 2015,"A stylish and modern hotel. The views are amazing. Good location, not far from the beach. The hotel staffs are extremely friendly, clean room, and great food, lots of choices. Definitely will go back in the future."
2770,Great staycation,50,December 2015,"Another property under Marriott that I experienced on my trip on December 2015.

The room was great and spacious
When checked in, the staff served a super delicious drink (see on attached pic) and ice creams

The staff were very kind and helpful

Strategic location to discover many great cafes and restaurants at Seminyak road, Bali

Definitely gonna be back here again!"
2771,Excellent,50,June 2016,"With hotels, as in life, you generally get what you pay for. This isn‚Äôt the cheapest in Bali but after a whistle-stop tour of Australia involving 10 flights this was just what the doctor ordered for the homeward journey. A fantastic new hotel with lovely rooms, great facilities and an amazing breakfast buffet.The staff were incredibly helpful and it was a pleasure to meet John, the general manager, who came across as a thoroughly decent chap. We even saw him clearing and washing tables at breakfast and the staff genuinely seemed to like him which is always a good sign. About a 10 minute slow walk to the beach and a couple of nice restaurants just down the road. Not that it bothered me but I had a room with a lovely view of a brick wall so it may be best to ask for a pool view room if you are particularly fussy in that regard. That aside, all-in-all a great stay in a wonderful hotel. Thoroughly recommended."
2772,Awesome and safe hotel!,50,May 2016,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for a total of about 2 months for a business trip. I can't think of one bad experience I had during my stay. The staff were nice, friendly, and helpful. The breakfast was always fresh and delicious. The rooms are spacious and clean. The Wi-Fi is strong and fast. I was a gold member but they treated me like a platinum member. So awesome. :)

When you get to interact with the front desk, Nyssa, Melinda, Tony, and everyone else will ensure your check-in, check-out, key replacement (because I'm really bad at remembering to bring my card key with me) will occur swiftly and smoothly. And when you want to extend your stay because Bali is so awesome, they will do as much as they can to accommodate you.

The breakfast at this hotel has so many options you will never get tired it. Even with as many people as there are at times, the staff members such as Dewi, Saih, Sutiarja, Indah, Astiti, and many more will flawlessly execute their duties quickly and efficiently to ensure your breakfast experience is the best. The service is the most pleasant I've ever had at a hotel.

Even the room keepers such as Pradana will keep your room clean and looking new with courtesy and a smile.

If you need private transportation around Bali, Bunbun will get the job done whether you are at the hotel lobby or messaging him on WhatsApp.

I wish I could have stayed there longer. If I get the opportunity to go back to Bali I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks for the great service!"
2773,Great modern hotel,40,June 2016,"Myself and my husband stayed for four nights as part of our fifth trip to Bali. Having stayed at other hotels on previous trips, I can say this is up there with the best, especially for the price we payed. Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen was a particular highlight, they even had proper coffee made to order! The gym was clean and well equipped, and the pool area is nice but the sun does get blocked for a good part of the day. We loved the happy hour and acoustic music from 5pm-7pm, the singers we're amazing and it really added to the chilled out, relaxed vibe of the Courtyard. Would return for sure."
2774,"Hospitality, Comfort, and Great Location",50,May 2016,"I loved the hotel, the people, the food!- this hotel is centrally located making it a super convenient touch down to get to all the must-see, eat and experience hot-spots in Bali. It's only a 7 minute walk to the beach but just ask and they'll drive you in the cart to the beach section they have reserved for their guests. I travelled alone, so safety was a bit of a concern that melted away with the hospitality and care I received. Tons of space around the gorgeous pool, strong wifi signal, and fill your belly with an amazing selection at breakfast the breakfast buffet including specialty coffees and their soft tacos on the new 'what the truck!' food truck are so delish! I used the gym (clean and has everything you need) and did yoga almost every morning; didn't get to the spa but everyone I talked to said they were super qualified with the best massages. I really felt like the staff want to be there- like they love their jobs and that to me says a lot about any place I go. Have fun!"
2775,Holiday,40,June 2016,"Excellent experience. Very clean accessible amenities. Friendly staff & service.
Entertainment by Komang Suardana and water aerobics & Learning Balinese dancing.
Close to shops. Free shuttles to beach, shops.
Late checkout when available."
2776,Pretty/Safe,50,June 2016,"The only warnings I have for my fellow traveler is very loud rooms if you aren't a heavy sleeper, and there is no power unless you insert your room key. Other than that very clean and safe environment!! Love the pool."
2777,A great hotel,50,May 2016,"This is an excellent choice for this area. Affordable, close to restaurants and beach. The bed was soooo comfy. Loved the bathroom. Great breakfast, pool bar, love entertainment. Check in was quick but a bit odd because we were just pointed in the direction of our room and left to take our own luggage up there. I have never had that happen in bali before."
2778,Fantastic stay in every way,50,May 2016,"Have just returned from a 9 day stay with 11 family members and two grandchildren. This is an awesome resort. Every single staff member were friendly and very helpful including cleaners, bar and pool staff the ladies in kids club everyone service was fantastic. The pool was great for the little ones as well as adults and we always managed to get sun beds. The food was great and my hubby loved the guy at the egg station. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be coming back. Thanks again for making our holiday fantastic"
2779,Amazing 8 nights,50,May 2016,"The staff were awesome and very easy to get along with if you want to have a chat! Reception staff were very helpful whenever I had an issue. The bar and restaurant staff were great even though it got very busy!
The only problem I had was the tiles around the resort are very slippery, after it rained one night I was walking back to my room and slipped and fell on my back, I only got a bruised back but if it was my dad, who has had an operation on his lower back he could have been in trouble, and I guess I was disappointed that when I went to tell reception they didn't do anything at all except to say thanks for letting me know. So just be careful of the slippery tiles.
Other than that it was a great place, great food and great cocktails."
2780,Can't wait to return!,50,May 2016,"We can't rate this hotel high enough! Last week we stayed in a pool terrace 1 bedroom suite with our 20 month old son. From arrival the staff were excellent. Check in was swift & simple. I recommend using the ap to check in before you arrive. I checked in from my couch in Australia before we left home. We then had our own personal escort to our room. The pool bar staff are amazing & I believe are the best part of the hotel. They seem genuinely happy to be at work. They played with my son, had a chat with us & were always smiling and laughing. No request was too big & they anticipated our needs easily. the kids club staff were so friendly and gentle with the children. Our room was cleaned each day quickly & thoroughly. At breakfast the staff amazed me. They remembered everyone's names! How nice it was to be greeted each morning by my name! A special mention to Grant who assisted with an initial hiccup upon booking that was swiftly amended! Thank you to all the staff for making our holiday so relaxing! We can't wait to return!"
2781,Wonderful Bali,40,May 2016,"We spent 10 days in at the courtyard and are able to give the hotel itself and more importantly the staff a rap for their quiet efficiency, friendliness and competency. The rooms and facilities are not international five star but a very good 4.5 star which is the objective of the courtyard brand. We noticed that many of the customers were young families with the grandparents. The shrouding area is very safe and full of shops and restaurants with the beach a short stroll away. Very impressed."
2782,Great family friendly hotel,50,May 2016,"Lovely hotel, exactly what you would expect from a world class chain. The breakfasts were fantastic, the rooms were great and the staff were lovely. We upgraded to a pool terrace room which was worth the extra money. We had a hot stone massage which was to die for! Can't fault a thing at this hotel."
2783,A+++++,50,May 2016,"We stayed a week at this resort and would recommend it to everyone. It is amazing. The accomodation, every single staff member and facilities were A++. Not one fault.
The pool, rooms, restaurant, bar, service desk, gym have all been well thought out, nothing has been left out."
2784,Extended our stay,50,May 2016,"We have been to Bali a few times and struggled to find a place that caters to both my husband and I and to our 2 year old son. After reading reviews about this resort we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. From the check-in, they were very accommodating to us, allowing us to check in early and putting us on a higher floor so we didn't hear too much noise from the pool. They were helpful with all of our requests including helping us to find bicycles to rent with a child seat (this was a great way to get around). The location is close to the hustle and bustle of seminyak which is great for going out for dinner, exploring etc but when you are inside the hotel and pool area it feels private and isolated. The beach is walking distance but they offer a shuttle and the resort has its own spot on the beach. A tip for beach swimming would be to go late in the day when the water is more calm and the little ones can enjoy.

Our son enjoyed the pool so much that he spent hours in there every day and learned to swim on his own during our vacation. There is a kids club which my son enjoyed and that offer crafts and various activities each day. This was a nice touch as well and they were very sweet with kids. We were all having such a good time that we decided to extend our stay and again the hotel staff was very accommodating to our requests.

They accommodate late check out when they can and if not provide you a place to leave your stuff, take a shower and enjoy Bali for as long as you can before you need to take your flight.

The breakfast was great with lots of options and the food offered at the pool was great as well. The restaurant was not great outside of peak hours but there are so many options in and around Seminyak and there is even a taco truck at the hotel, so there is no need really to eat in the restaurant outside of breakfast."
2785,Beautiful resort,50,May 2016,Stayed for 7 days at this resort and it was amazing from the facilaties to the food to the personally service by the staff it was all 10 out of 10. Security was very high so you always felt safe. Travelled with family and we had a pram for our young grandson 3rd day their the tyre broke on his pram so 1 of the staff members parwhana took the tyre home after he finished his shift at 11 o'clock at night had it fixed and the next morning brought it back to us at a cost of $10 we were so pleased he didn't even want to take the tip we offered him. The resort is kept beautiful and extremely clean. Can't wait for our next visit 10/10
2786,Bliss at its best,50,May 2016,"Well where do I start? If you want perfection then the Courtyard Bali SEMINYAK Resort is the place to go!
Excellent location. Staff are amazing and the resort facilities were awesome. No need to leave the resort at all if you don't want.
Will definitely be back. Thank you again for your hospitality.
Oh, and I loved the idea of security out the front, so you feel secure 24/7."
2787,"Great hotel, great location",40,May 2016,"Myself and my wife stayed at the Courtyard in Seminyak in early May of 2016. Staff, room, location all very good. The breakfast was superb. I would have no problems in recommending this hotel to anyone."
2788,Excellent Service,50,May 2016,"Stayed here 2 nights for my honeymoon. Security was tight & you know you will be safe inside. Lobby area was super nice. I love the lobby view to the pool, very pleasing to the eye. Check in was fast, eventhough it's not check in time but our room was ready and we could go straight to our room. We were welcomed with honeymoon cake and it was nice.

The room is clean & spacious, we had a pool terace so we could go to the pool directly from our room. Some people would sit at the pool lounge in front of our room but the room was nicely soundproof so we can barely hear the voices from outside.

The breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen is really nice, lots of variety from Western to Indonesian, and ice cream! Who wouldn't want to start the day with ice cream? ;)

Don't forget to try the tacos & wrap from What The Truck outside the lobby area. The beef Rendang tacos are better than the Babi Guling one.

Overall we were really pleased with the services and the staffs were really friendly and helpful. Keep up the good work."
2789,Incredible stay,50,May 2016,"I'm satisfied with the hotel, every day room was cleaned, so tidy, very helping staff for a morning call. All is perfect. Lobby is quite wide, incredible view. Breakfast variative, nice kitchen. Humble staff"
2790,"Yes I agree, almost perfect",50,May 2016,"Taxis, cars entering the property will have to go through tight security. All guests and their belongings will have to go through the scanner each time you enter the lobby which I truly commend, this shows that the management is very particular about the security of their staff and guests. Their staff have given me a warm welcome as soon as I have come down the taxi, was given a welcome flower too. The staff greeted me with all smiles. Check in was quick. I was given a cold towel, iced lemon tea and a popsicle. How cool was that? Since I came in an hour earlier, I had to wait for my room to become ready. So the receptionist recommended for me to wait in the lobby, explore the vicinity or try their food truck ""what the truck"" just near the lobby which serves soft tacos and beers -- very cheap and delish!

I got the pool view room at 6th floor. Room is spacious, well maintained, with balcony and day bed/chair in it. Really fantastic view. Room service was quick to deliver the food we ordered. Really good food too! Housekeeping service was also quick in delivering the items I needed in the room like extra shampoos, new towels, bath math.. Marriott has an app also which you can use to send your queries and requests. They also respond to you real time.

Seminyak Kitchen for buffet breakfast has a wide spread also, this is by far the best buffet breakfast I have ever been into. Service once again is great. Not only they serve the usual brewed coffee but also have latte, cappuccino, etc..

Gym was also spacious and have the basic equipment. Big pool and a lot of day beds available. Was at the pool bar for quite sometime. A good one, 2 thumbs as well for this.

Overall, I am truly impressed with the hotel's customer service. Staff were all smiles and they greet you when they see you along the hallway. Experience was great and I will surely come back."
2791,A Courtyard Hotel on the scale of a JW Marriott,50,May 2016,"This hotel will be a real surprise for any American guest used to a Marriott Couryard, this is no ordinary Courtyard but one of two resort Courtyards worldwide. As a gold member I was treated to a suite upgrade upon arrival. The rooms are immaculate and the facilities are spectacular. The restaurant just had too much food and I will have to go on a diet as the breakfast was amazing. The pool and gym were very well maintained and there is a beach portion that guest can be shuttled to. It is located near many restaurants, local spas, and souvenir shops. The spas are very inexpensive with hour massages for six dollars. Enjoy!"
2792,One for all ages,50,May 2016,"Brilliant is the only word to describe this hotel, it caters for families singles, any age. Pools are divine, rooms great peaceful when it needs to be entertaining also.
Location is prime, shuttle is good. This is one you need to check out for yourselves."
2793,Almost perfect,40,April 2016,"Great modern hotel. Our room had 2 double beds, good-sized, beds were comfortable, impressive toilet/bath except that there was not enough place to hang towels. Room had a balcony that overlooked the pool, beautiful sight. Impressive pool facilities, our kids loved the mocktails. Great location too as not far from shopping and restaurants. Staff was excellent, friendly and helpful, specially when we are having breakfast. Breakfast was quite disappointing, the spread was very limited, and the jams were not in the little containers, but shared by all the diners, which I felt was not a typical Marriott standard. Their ala carte were above average and thought that the nasi goreng was one of the best I had in my life. The hotel has a private beach but we had to either walk or take a complimentary buggy to/from which was not very convenient."
2794,Modern hotel close to the beach,40,March 2016,"New (2014) and modern hotel just 5-10 minutes walk from Seminyak Beach. If that¬¥s too far for you, the hotel do offer a complimentary buggy shuttle.
Rooms are medium sized and have the amenities you expect from a hotel of this standard. The bed is very comfortable and the air con works very well (not too noisy).
Rooms have a balcony facing the pool area.
Breakfast buffet has a very nice selection and special coffees are served at no extra charge (cappuccinos etc.).
WIFI is fast and worked without incident during my stay.
Staff are all very accommodating and eager to help.
It¬¥s a nice hotel and I would not mind staying here again, but to be honest, it cold be anywhere in the World. You don¬¥t get that true Balinese decor and atmosphere."
2795,Karen McConnell,50,May 2016,"Excellent Hotel, everything was perfect , great location , fabulous food , choice of pools , service was outstanding, day spa was heavenly ,the list is endless 11/10 highly recommended the pool terrace worth that bit extra straight out of your room into pool , wouldn't stay anywhere else after finding this jewel üòä"
2796,Ideal vacations,50,April 2016,"I was there 4 days in April for holidays with my wife. Excellent amenities and perfect location. But, the best is its friendly staff.
The restaurant offers amaizing local food and the manager is always concern about the quality of the service. This is definitely a 5-stars hotel."
2797,May 2015 Visit 10th Wedding Anniversary,50,May 2016,It was a great hotel experienced. We celebrated our 10th anniversary in Marriott. Staffs are accomodating and i like the cabana area where I stayed most of the time while waiting for my little girl finished swimming. Best for family.
2798,Holiday of a life time.,40,October 2015,"Late last year we stayed at this this resort with family and had a tremendous time, the resort was excellent, the staff were absolutely brilliant, i could not speak highly enough about all facets of the place. This resort is close to the beach, if you dont want to walk there you can be taken by a buggy. The food in the restaurant was very good, service excellent and staff very friendly. There are also a number of very good restaurants close by. Finally my wife and i along with family members are going back this mid July."
2799,Compact Resort Hotel,40,May 2016,"Located 5 minutes walk to the beach . Opened in August 2014 with over 300 rooms . It has all the facilities of a seaside resort except not enough green and open space due limited space .
The staffs are very friendly and helpful.
Room is of descent size . Like the rain shower . Iron and hair dryer and in room safe are provided . Shavers on request basis . Nice big beds and comfortable pillows . Note that there is no bath tub so not suitable for family with babies .
Free 2 bottles of Aqua water .
Free wifi throughout the hotel . Very fast and stable .
Buffet breakfast is included . They are very nice with great selection
Worth highly recommend for business purpose and short trip travellers
All good except not enough space ."
2800,I felt like a friend as well as an important guest.,50,October 2015,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel not only for the accommodation, the facilities, the pool, the bar, the restaurant and great breakfast but also for the friendliness and help from all the staff.
I would have to congratulate the management on their attention to this important aspect of running a hotel.
I would not only stay there again but look forward to it."
2801,"Excellent Hotel, Location and Service.",50,May 2016,"We bought a voucher through Luxury Escapes for this hotel and we were extremely happy that we did.
It was so easy to book the dates we wanted via email and when we had to change a few dates and they were so helpful and flexible, it was not a problem.
We were delayed with our flight however the hotel transfer waited around for us to arrive.
On arrival we were wowed by how lovely the hotel was and how nice the staff were. The rooms were clean and modern. The breakfast buffet was great, the cocktails and pool service was fantastic, the spa treatments were amazing, the staff were all so helpful and happy. We stayed for 8 nights in total and were very comfortable the whole time."
2802,Awesome Hotel,50,May 2016,"The courtyard was the best hotel I've stayed in in Bali. Beautiful rooms, beautiful pool, gorgeous staff. The location was close to everything including the beach. We stayed with small children for 8 nights and didn't want to leave. Amazing hotel."
2803,Nice hotel,40,May 2016,"I came to this hotel with my family. Interior hotel is modern, the location is near seminyak beach (5 minutes walking) so you can play in beach. I love seminyak beach causeyou can run dan play sand there. Their room is good and comfort. I get room with swimming pool view, so stunning. The room also has balcony. They have 3 type of swimming pool and one of the pool is for kids. My kids love swimming there. In the afternoon you can swim and listen the music."
2804,Nothing to complain about,50,May 2016,"Very attentive staff, new and clean rooms.
Nice pool and poolbar, very professional checkin and check out process (something I have experienced differently on Bali).
Close to nice beach (+shuttle for the lazy ones).
Did not try restaurant or spa."
2805,WOW!,50,May 2016,"The courtyard Marriott was one of the nicest, if not THE nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. The Location is perfect! Right in the heart of Seminyak, it is very easy to walk to local shops and restaurants right outside the main lobby, and every cab driver knew exactly how to get there. I felt very safe staying at the courtyard, due to the high security on the grounds, every person and car is cleared before entering the courtyard, which I found very comforting. The Staff was extremely kind and welcoming, responsive and very efficient. room was beautiful and bed was big and comfortable! I found Great WI-Fi connectivity in my room as well as around the resort. The Breakfast was the best I've ever experienced in a hotel, there are so many options, everything is neat and organized, it is busy but not over crowded, plenty to go around! The pool is IMMACULATE, very clean and easily accessible. all in al i rate a perfect 5 for this hotel, I travel at least 4-6 times per year in my profession and I can say with confidence that I WILL be staying with courtyard upon my return to Seminyak. no criticism for the courtyard, excellent work!"
2806,"""Excellent Great Service""",40,May 2016,"The Hotel's Service

Excellent and Oustanding. We stayed here for 9 days in total and as each
day passed, I felt more and more at home. The front office staff is very
well trained, the F & B staff is always ready to see you to your table.
The concierge greets you every time you make your way in and out of the hotel.
What is great, is that they try to even remember you by name. I had a chat
with the Front Office Manager Daniel Philip Batholomeus. Great Chap, oh, and by
they way he is local Indonesian. At the lobby there is also free POP CORN.

Room Quality

You can't really fault very much with the room size although compared to other
establishment, it may be a little smaller and narrower in size. The balcony is a good
size that overlooks the pool. As a matter of fact, I would say all rooms have a pool
view. All the standard amenieties that you will find in a good hotel is to be
expected here in the Courtyard at Marriott and they surely do not fail to deliver.
Clean sheets, clean towels, clean robes and also daily make-up of room and
replenishing of drinking water. The only thing to take note is that rooms nearer to the Pool Bar and rooms that provide access to the main hotel traffic is going to be noisy as well. This can be especially so during happy hours at the pool bar. Do remember, the Courtyard only has one Bar and it servers the pool as well as the Lounge.
I had the opportunity one day in chatting with Fahrul who clean my rooms for two days.
I discovered that he had come all the way from Jakarta to work in Bali at the Couryard at Marriotts. He continued to say how happy he was working in the Marriott and how much he appreciated his Job even though he missed his family dearly back in Jakarta. Clearly see the pride in his role here in the Hotel which is fantastic.

The only fault with the rooms especially the adjoining rooms will be the noise coming from the room next door as the walls tend to be pretty thin. Where we stayed in Room 542 our neighbour Room 543 had a party nightly and the noise was obviously annoying through the adjoining door of the two rooms. Thank God they were very nice people and tried to keep the noise down to a minimum one night after I approached them about the door and acoustics.

WiFi and Signal

The internet is free, the signal is good throughout the hotel and the speed fast. In the
9 days I only encountered a few ocassions with slow connectivity other than that...SUPERB!

What the Truck Bali

At the entrance there is a old VW converted into a TACO and WRAP joint which serves awesome Tacos and Wraps for a reasonable price. There are also beers and other beverages that you can purchase over the counter as well. And if you take a photo and tag them on Instagram, you will get a Free bottle of Bintang Beer. I had wraps here at least 4 times in my entire stay so i guess that tells you how good they are. My recommendation is the be Beef Rendang followed by the Chicken Taco or Wrap. Babi is the third choice unless you are a fan.

The Awesome Breakfast

I will not emphasize and write too much as there is really nothing much to say except that I look forward to breakfast everyday in my entire duration of stay. The selection is wide and there is always something for every one. Anton the Manager, is friendly, Saih who always greets me in the morning by name, all the other waiters who bring me my daily freshly squeezed juices and also iced latte. Agus, my favourite guy at the egg station always cooking with a smile and breaking into a conversation even in the midst of all the chaos. Keep it up guys!! Oh,and not forgetting Anton and his encounter with the 4 Chinese Ladies with their reported lost scarfs in the restaurant. It was pretty hilarious!!

Free Shuttle to the Beach + Seminyak

As the hotel is not situated next to the Beach, They provide you shuttle buggy service to
the beach and back. They go anytime so just let them know at the front desk or the concierge. At the beach, there is private section for hotel guest and they have a scheduled return at 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm. Buggy to Seminyak main street is to Jalan Raya Seminyak and Jalan Laksamana but this is only one way, so you have to find your way back to the hotel.

Arts and Craft

And my wife had a great time enjoying how to make art sculture our of Coconut palm leaves from the talented Suardana at the open courtyard.

Cons

Just way too many Mainland Chinese Tourist which can kind of take the charm away
from the otherwise excellent hotel. They apparently have a contract with the
multi- level marketing Dreamtrips organizers which brings bus loads of Mainland
Chinese tourist into the hotel. When these groups are present, the hotel can get pretty
chaotic as well as noisy. (like a fish market) I therefore recommend if you want to avoid bumping into them, is to go for your breakfast after 9.30 am onwards. I would also not recommend this hotel if you are on a romantic honeymoon. (kids, loud tourist, design of building echoing noise )

Security and Peace of Mind

Like all the other hotels, the Courtyard at Marriott has very tight security policy. All bags are screen and x-rayed everytime you step in and out of the hotel except for Taco and Wraps. Cars coming in and out is also screened thoroughly! Very much for your own safety, if you understand what I mean but the security guys are well train, polite and friendly and make it pleasant for you even though there may be a strong underlying reason for these necessary checks.

Conclusion

Would I stay in the Courtyard at Marriott again in the future? That would be a difficult answer! If the intake of Bus loads of Mainland Tourist increase it would be and easy to say never again. However, I would pop in and say hello to my friends at the Courtyard and even takeaway a Beef Rendang Wrap."
2807,A gem.,50,May 2016,"Close to the Seminyak Beach this is a gem. The resort is intimate, clean and professional. We were impressed with the cleanliness, the security and the overall hospitality of the staff. There was an excellent restaurant with a fabulous breakfast. Each room had a waterfall shower, such a luxury, housekeeping was really good. The pool bar is a fun place to gather for a drink with entertainment nightly that ended at a reasonable time so as not to impinge on guests privacy or sleep. Highly recommend."
2808,Pleasant Stay,50,May 2016,"Excited to write this review for the first time visit. Came here on Saturday and i assumed this hotel was fully occupied (i can see from the people and bus in the lobby). So i am not expected early check in for me. I finally check in to the hotel on 1.30 PM.

Room :
The room was not too big (i have deluxe room) but the ambience and the view of my room is accepted. (Street view)

Facilities :
Went to gym, it has excellent facilities and equipments. Went for breakfast and this is it.

Food :
The Seminyak Kitchen serves mouthwatering food! Well done!

From asian (indonesian food, indian) to western (they served bagel every morning). All i can say, i dont wanna miss by breakkie!

Dont forget they have a bar outside the lobby. We ordered taco with pork, it was delicious.

Service :
Overall the service is great! They cleanup our room very well, they put back our laundry on time and all of them polite and friendly.

Thank you for this experience. Will looking forward to stay at Courtyard in other time."
2809,Best location !!!,40,May 2016,"You can't bypass this hotel and service, it's staff were all professional and always a pleasure to deal with, even down to the smallest requests. Will definitely be recommending and returning
The breakfast were first class"
2810,Excellent staff!,50,March 2016,"Stayed here one night before a flight to Bangkok for our honeymoon, and the hotel staff brought us a surprise cake. The pools were quite fun, especially the large soft floating beds. Food was consistent with those found at Marriott properties.

Rooms are great quality, ours included a living room and dining area. A short drive from the main walking areas of Seminyak, so the grounds were much more spacious. Great property for a more luxurious stay in Bali."
2811,Nice vibe - maybe better suited to couples than families,40,May 2016,"Smallish hotel in Seminyak on a busy street with lots of restaurants near by. The hotel does not have access to the beach, but is a couple of hundred meters away down a busy road (With a very narrow pavement). The hotel is arranged around a 'courtyard' with a swimming pool with pool bar. Otherwise there is not much landscaping. The athmosphere feels more 'busy' rather than relaxing. Rooms are good quality - nicely decorated and equipped, very clean and a good size. Staff are all very friendly and the breakfast is very good with a wide variety of food choices from bagels to local noodles. The taco truck parked at the entrance is also great serving cold brewed coffee, beer and beef rending tacos. I would recommend the hotel to couples who are looking for something in the heart of Seminyak. As a family, we would have preferred something with larger garden areas and access to the beach if we were to come again but are enjoying our stay here nevertheless."
2812,Nice Hotel in Seminyak Bali,40,May 2016,"Stayed for 4 nights with family and friends. Nice clean hotel, spacious and clean rooms.
Great location with the market and loads of restaurants just walking place from the hotel.
The beach is a five minute walk but their is a complimentary buggy ride. Happening beach with music, shacks and great food and wine.
The breakfast is ample with plenty of choices. The best part about the hotel is the staff, service with a smile, would love to come back."
2813,Great location and hotel in Seminyak,40,May 2016,"My husband and I booked via Booking.com for a 6 night stay.
We arrived at 3pm and our room wasn't ready yet. They charged an extra $300 on the credit card for incidentals. We didn't really get much information upon check it, would have been nice to be told about the daily activities and sun beds on the beach.
We were in a Garden View room on level 5 (Directly above the Seminyak Kitchen). From 6am everyday, all we could hear was the chairs at the restaurant being moved as people pulled them out. We were also just near the pool bar so you could hear the music that plays all day (if you want an afternoon nap, perhaps request a room away from the pool bar).
The rooms were good and had everything we needed.
The breakfast was your normal buffet breakfast.
There is free popcorn in the lobby which is nice after sitting at the pool all afternoon.
There is daily activities which is a great thing to get involved in and meet people.
We struggled for the first couple of days to get a lounge by the pool, we just turned up early to get a spot. As others have said, half the pool is shaded but it's a nice relief from the hot sun!
The What The Truck food van was amazing, we ordered from their alot!
The spa I would highly recommend, dearer than the street salons but well worth the money - the only criticism is that you can hear the loud music being played from the pool bar, bit difficult to relax.
We couldn't get a late check out (requested an extra 30minutes) as it was fully booked, however they did offer shower facilities before we caught our late night flight home.
It was a great stay and we will be back but in a room away from the kitchen and pool bar."
2814,Excellent stay!! 10 nights,50,May 2016,"Our first time to bali, and this hotel was perfect for us. Very welcoming, secure and excellent facilities!!
Our room was faultless, a great place to base ourselves for 10 nights. Very comfy king bed, balcony and nice bathroom. The buffet breakfast was first class with plenty of variety to mix it up over 10 days! Courtyards staff are very accommodating and were their to help with anything we needed, including booking restaurants and day spas.
We spent at least 3 hours a day in their amazing pool and swim up bar, having to drag ourselves away to go see bali was sometimes a challenge... great drinks and pool side food.
The location is perfect for Seminyak, about 200 metres to the beach and a block from eat street. Also the street courtyard is on has plenty of restaurants and bars.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2815,Best choice in Seminyak !,50,April 2016,"This hotel is the best choice to stay in this area. Even the hotel is not on the coast is the best choice.Very nice place close to everythig.Beach is just 2 minutes walk from hotel.There is also free shutle to the beach if u dont like to walk and also to the restorant area.Staff is very kind and will help u for everything u need to have a great holiday.Brekfast is amazing,great selection of food, like for the lunch!
Pool is great and much better then beach area i enjoy a lot..Hotel have private part on the beach also.Room are nice and modern.
I recommend this hotel!"
2816,Wonderful hotel,50,May 2016,"This is the third time I've stayed at this hotel in the last year. All aspects of the hotel are wonderful. The check in process was very smooth (I got an in room check in as I am a Marriott Rewards member) and reservations were able to give me the room I requested overlooking the pool bar. Numerous staff remembered me from my last trip 5 months ago, including the head concierge, the pool bar staff and the restaurant staff. One lovely waitress in the restaurant even remembered my coffee order from my last trip! That's the reason I keep returning to this hotel. The staff are simply wonderful. Nothing is too much for them and they are very attentive to ensure the guests have all they need. In particular, Hari, Santosa and Maria at the pool bar who always checked if I needed anything. The breakfasts are amazing and the food at the pool bar for lunch is very good too. The stand out for me is the new food truck. The tacos are amazing and the staff running the truck are wonderful, especially Hendra who always has a smile and engages with every guest who walks past. Housekeeping were also very efficient and always left my room spotless.
I will be back next time I'm in Bali."
2817,very convenient location,40,May 2016,Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights and the place was nice. The location is great for those wanting to explore the shopping and bars in Seminyak. Staff was friendly and the breakfast spread was pretty phenom!
2818,Wonderful place to stay,50,May 2016,"It was the first time when I was staying in this hotel. I was really impressed by the property. It is a real treat for the travelers. Its poolside bar is a real fun. At the entry of the hotel is a van called ""What the truck"" has fabulous foods. The breakfast is also nice at the hotel and it has good varieties. They do serve dinner but I think they do not have many cuisines to offer hence I went out for my dinner."
2819,Best in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"We stayed here for five days, the staff are so helpful, our room was kept absolutely immaculate, the bar and restaurant staff are top class. Free popcorn is a great wee treat! The pool bar, especially during happy hour, is a great place to hang out! So close to everywhere you need to be and you can even hire scooters around the corner. Oh and I nearly forgot tasty tacos on your doorstep. We will return!! Thanks Guys :)"
2820,Pleasantly surprised,50,March 2016,"We organised a weekend getaway last minute and found this place. We've been to Bali before and preferred Seminyak to the other more touristy locales.

Courtyard was a welcome surprise, from the friendly greeting at reception and complimentary ice block for our little boy. Staff were overly friendly and polite. The pool bar was a hit with my son and I and spent at least a part of each day by the pool.

We were able to get the buffet breakfast with our booking and it was good! Staff were attentive and kept our tables clear and our coffee cups filled.

The resort also boasts a kids club with 2 hours child minding included. Your child can stay longer for a minimal fee. Our son made use of the ball pit and toys. They also did crafts. My wife enjoyed massages from their day spa in between poolside lounging sessions.

Rooms were clean and spacious for a young family. We got a poolside facing room. You can hear festivities below but not troublesome with the doors closed and curtains drawn. View is great and gives an even more 'resort feel' to your stay.

Overall we were very happy with our stay and are looking forward to our next stay!"
2821,Amazing Stay!!,50,April 2016,"This hotel was amazing from start to finish, its beautiful and clean and so very stylish. The staff are so helpful and friendly, I celebrated my 38th birthday and the staff both in the pool bar and restaurant made it memorable with cocktails and signing me happy birthday with candle in a cake. The room was kept clean everyday and whenever we needed something the staff would happily oblige, which is what you want when away from home.
I would 100% stay here again if I went back and recommend it to anyone wanting a place to stay."
2822,New and great location,50,May 2016,"Just stayed there for a night and rush to the airport. Very nice hotel, clean and new.

But in the evening there are a lot of frogs making sounds! Very noisy! Took us a while to fall a sleep, almost want to call ays when they don't send somebody to catch that frogs away! The pool aren't so big!

The staffs are really nice and helpful. Around the hotel there are lots of restaurants, shops and bars! Great location! Will definitely stay again and hope those frogs are gone!!!"
2823,Nice hotel with a great location to stay in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"We picked Marriott Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort and we were very pleased with the hotel. With my silver status, I was upgraded to a nice suite with the pool access when I checked in and it was a very nice surprise. The hotel is not that big but it locates right in the heart of Semiyak, very close to everything. The hotel is very clean and the staffs are super nice and very helpful. The breakfast is quite good though the female host there was not very attentive to our request. The hotel facilities are quite good, there are two pools next to each other, the gym is quite small. I would stay in this hotel again!"
2824,Pretty good allrounder,40,May 2016,"This is a good base for anyone in Bali. Close to good shopping, easy walk to Seminyak beach and lots of good food choices.

The hotel itself is very modern with good facilities. Pool is big, gym is not big but got enough for a good workout, our son loved the kids club and breakfast was pretty good. Rooms are modern with good space. Issue we had was being on the busy road side it was quite noisy every night til about 10pm and then noise starts again at about 6am. So request a room on the northern side if a light sleeper.

We did have one other issue just as we were leaving. Having used uber/grab during our stay with no issue, all of a sudden when leaving staff took photos and seemed to shame out and maybe report our driver. This was the only hotel of the 3 we stayed at that we found out are anti uber/grab.

Overall we liked our stay and would happily return. If we did hopefully he above issue is no longer."
2825,A good choice hotel to stay in Seminyak,40,May 2016,"We booked Pool View room, got a highest floor. Thank you to Courtyard for this special arrangement.
The receptionist very helpful and gave us hotel map and surrounding area. He informed us on the shops and restaurants around Seminyak.
The hotel provided a boogy car for drop off to certain points in Seminyak and to the beach area. The beach can be reach by 5 minute walking only.

The room is modern, although the size is not so big but enough for two persons.
Breakfast has lot choices of food, located on 3rd floor.
The main activities inside the hotel is the pool area and having live music on certain day.
Fitness room is located at the basement, the equipment is good enough to burn out the calories during our stay.

The Courtyard Hotel by Marriot is a must stay hotel in Seminyak area."
2826,Mostly good!,30,May 2016,"We have stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for the last 7 nights, tonight is our last night!
Our experience has been mostly good!
Same old review about the sun over the pool only being on one side but there's not much that can be done about that, I believe anyway.
The breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen is amazing! Absolutely love it! Yeah there are some un controlled children around at times but I think that's more of a parenting issue than the hotels.
The massage at the spa was so ridiculously good! Really enjoyed it!
The only real complaint is the front desk at the front, their communication with each other is shocking! The amount of times we had to repeat stories to different staff was frustrating. Also the house keeping... Numerous times the room was cleaned and it was spotless! (personal belongings touched.. Made us a little nervous) dirty towels were taken but we're not replaced, nice surprise when you got out of the shower. Today we had to call twice to the front desk regarding this issue and an hour later we went down on our way out around 2:30pm and informed the desk again that there were no towels at all in our room and we were only delivered towels this evening at 9pm.. !
Water was also rarely replaced, little frustrating when you don't want to use tap water to brush your teeth!
All in all our stay has been pleasantly relaxing and fun! The hotel staff are extremely friendly and always smiling!
Oh and the taco truck out the front is a must go to also!
We would stay again!"
2827,Best in hospitality,50,April 2016,"Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in 2014 when they newly opened, the brilliant staff and service brought us here again recently. This time my husband fell very ill but the staff and the doctors on call were excellent. I felt like I had my family with me despite being on foreign land. They attended to all our needs and went beyond to help us feel at ease. We will never forget the car rides arranged by the hotel to and from the hospital, the calls we received to check on us and the genuine concerns from everyone. Also, I asked if the kitchen could reheat my dinner after i got back from the hospital, but they made me a new one - they were about to close up and get home! A special thanks to our friends Anton, Yeani, Ayu, Adi, Mega from the Seminyak Kitchen - you made breakfast even more special than it was. Lovely meeting you Chef Danang (he's so meticulous abt everything that goes on in the kitchen!) A special mention for Tony, Frisca, Wahyu, Prisi, Sila from the front desk - no matter how busy, they'd look after all the details. Aldi from house keeping - thank you for always smiling and keeping the room clean. Thank you also to Merta and Suyadnya for doing such fantastic yoga classes. Thank you Dr. Arta, you took so much time to explain everything to us. Thanks to John Woolley for the call, hope to meet you the next time around. Thanks again from the bottom of our hearts and we hope to see you all again soon!"
2828,Good Value,40,April 2016,"Overall good value for money. Rooms are nice and clean, service is attentive. Breakfast spread was fantastic, and the other dining options (bar, in room, etc) are great - western dishes are of western standard.

Upon arrival (3:00pm) I was told the room I had booked was not ready, and I was upgraded to a poolside room. These are typically charged our at a higher rate than those rooms on the higher floors. I found there to be a lack of privacy on the ground level, and whilst the sliding door does open out to the pool area, the door cant be locked from the outside - less than ideal if you can't get a sun lounge right at your door.

The main negative element for me was the lack of consistency with the security (full airport style security - baggage scanners, etc). Most times I would walk in off the street I would walk straight through to my room, however on the odd occasion (even without any bags) I would be asked walk around and go through the security (having to wait behind anyone else lined up in front of me). It's great that they are taking security seriously, but both a uniform and common sense approach would go a long way to improving the process.

Overall positive experience though, would stay again."
2829,Excellent,50,April 2016,"We stayed for eight nights, everything went smoothly from the airport pickup to our last day. We had a voucher through luxury escapes.
The staff are friendly and attentive. As said many times before the breakfasts were amazing there is something for everyone - including vegetarians! the breakfasts are available up until 11am - so there is no rush to get in. We found if we ate a late breakfast we didn't need lunch!
We also enjoyed our lunch and dinner - the prices are comparable with some of the more upmarket restaurants near by.
We had a room on the left side of the hotel quite close to the pool bar - with the door closed you could hardly hear anything from outside. the rooms on the right get afternoon sun.
there was live music every night until 8pm which was most enjoyable.
If you have booked through luxury escapes note you can use your vouchers to have bintang beer instead of the cocktails - we preferred the beers! and that you can use them any time of the day - we only discovered this on the last but one day!
the gym is well equipped but does get busy around 9.00am.
If you have booked through luxury escapes due yourself a favour and use all the vouchers - the massage in the spa were wonderful and so relaxing.
there have been a number of comments about the security and it did seem rather over the top - I walked to the food truck on the hotel grounds and was then asked to go back through security!!! But I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.
the weather while we were there was good - no rain at all!!! A number of people have commented that they couldn't get sun loungers, we never experienced that problem what ever time we went down to the pool - but there are inconsiderate people that reserve their loungers although I did see the pool attendants pick stuff up and move it if it had been sitting unattended for awhile.
the hotel does have a small reserved area by the beach - which is within walking distance of the hotel or you can get the hotel buggy down. I was surprised at how under utilized this area was - the hotel supplies free bottles of water and towels - its a great way to spend a day at the beach without being endlessly hassled by the beach hawkers - there was a few hawkers but not as bad as being on the beach front.
the hotel has free wifi which worked well through out our stay."
2830,The best Courtyard Marriott I've ever stayed in!,50,April 2016,"Stayed here during a work visit to Bali recently, and absolutely loved it. The property is simply beautiful and spacious. The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. The suites are superb. The property is less than a 5 minute walk to Seminyak beach, and the hotel also provides a free shuttle service to the beach and several other locations. The breakfast spread is massive. Great hotel, would love to stay here again on my next visit and will recommend it to anyone visiting Bali in a heartbeat!"
2831,WOW!,50,May 2016,"Thank you so much for an incredible experience. You leave no stone unturned. The new operations manager went above and beyond to help us when we were in a spot of bother (not hotel related!) great customer service, nothing is too hard and would definitely recommend to friends and family. Thanks for having us.. Can't wait for the next visit!"
2832,Quick drink or snack,40,May 2016,"The Courtyard is always great to drop in on your way to or from some where else ..... you can have a quick
drink or snack at the bar which is next to the pool ......... or stay a while longer its a great place to chat with other people who are staying there .......lots of Aussie there to have a chat with !"
2833,Excellent value for money,40,April 2016,"We stayed for 8 nights and bought this deal through Luxury escapes. We were initially given a 5th floor room but decided to upgrade to a pool access room which is on the ground floor. Room 136 was in a fantastic position with no noise whatsoever from outside. This did cost round AUD320 but well worth it.
The property is spotless inside and out and the breakfast was very good.
Position is very central with less than a $2 taxi ride to eat street.
Value for money and would certainly stay there again."
2834,Excellent staff and rooms,50,May 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The staff were terrific. We arrived at 11am and were able to get an early check-in.

No request was to much effort, and all the staff were so friendly, and very accommodating.

There is a free shuttle to the beach and Restaurants, which is very good. And you can arrange private bespoke tours with the staff too.

There is also a shack selling tacos and burritos. The food is actually quite good.

The hotel arranges entertainment regularly, we saw fire dancing, and my wife and I really enjoyed it."
2835,Fantastic hotel!,50,April 2016,"This Marriott Courtyard hotel in Seminyak was the best I have ever stayed in.
From the moment I arrived till the moment I left, the service was excellent.
The one bedroom appartment with a view to the swing pool was fantastic.
My room was well equiped and there were delicious French makarons to welkome me.
The restaurants and the food truck in front of the hotel served fabulous meals.
This hotel has a shuttle that takes you in 3 minuten to the beach where you can enjoy watersports and the sun set.
A special part of this beach is reserved for Marriott customers.
Furthermore there are enough shops, spa,s, tours and of course cafe's and haute cuisine restaurants in the area of this hotel.
Don't miss breakfast. It is fantastic and an international experience!"
2836,Wonderful!,50,April 2016,"Best hotel! Very good service everyone was so lovely and helped us to have a wonderful time! The pool is wonderful and has a bar as well, the views in the bed rooms were lovely with very comfortable beds!"
2837,Wonderful,50,April 2016,"A friend and me stayed at this hotel for one night. It was indeed a very good hotel. The services are 5 stars. Staff even provide us wet tissue and cold drind during our check in. Check in was very fast and easy. The room was excellent! It was way better looking than in the website pictures. The room amenities list are endless. Electrical plug is universal and thats very practical. The room very clean and tidy, just a few mark spot at the dining table. We had upgraded to pool view room :). The pool was great and big, big enought even if you are an Olympic swimmer. Breakfast was tasty and plenty of choice. We are sad to stay just one night at this hotel. Location wise, just 5 min walk to seminyak beach, theres a lot of high end shop around and few gay bars too. After all, this hotel was great, it was the best hotel i have ever stayed in my life."
2838,The best place I have ever stayed in,50,April 2016,"This hotel made our stay in Bali. There is not one bad thing I can say. Our room was so beautiful and clean and comfortable. The pool area is amazing and they even have water bean bags. The breakfast in the morning is to die for. Think of anything you want and it was there. The service was impeccable. Happy hour by the pool everyday at 4pm with awesome cocktails and live music. Some afternoons there were even games arranged by the hotel staff. My partner and I checked out at 12pm, however our flight wasn't till that evening. So we hung by the pool and we were advised that if we would like showers to clean up before we left that it can be arranged. They have this amazing Taco van out the front of the hotel - best pork tacos Ive ever had. They have a buggy that takes you to and from the beach of you dont feel like walking. Amazing security, close to shops and markets. We had the most enjoyable time there and would stay in this hotel again in a heart beat."
2839,Amazing,50,May 2016,"Fantastic place to stay. So close to the beach and heaps of shops it's a great place to stay, relax and explore.
The staff were amazing. They were very helpful and friendly. The staff at the bar, spa and restaurant were very good at remembering us.
The courtyard has a great spa, restaurant, pool bar, cafe area, kids activities, lagoon pool and great rooms.
I stayed in a deluxe twin room. It was great. Very clean, tidy and lots of room. The balcony was comfortable. The bathroom was huge. Everything was well decorated.
The pool was huge with lots of lounges and different depths for kids and adults.
Check in and check out was very easy. The desk staffed were helpful and was happy to help with anything.
Security was high. Bags checks every time someone returned to the hotel or checked in. Guards at the entry point and cars checked as the pulled up.
On arrival I was given a flower and very warm welcome. Bags were taken up to our rooms for us.
The price is moderately expensive but we'll worth any money spent.
I would definitely stay here again if I every travel to Bali again."
2840,Premium facility with the best service,50,April 2016,"Staying at this hotel gave me a great experience and made me want to go back there üòä. The facilities were the great, the room and bathroom are clean and nice, with the complete toiletries. We also got the room with the balcony. The swimming pool has a great architecture, the gym has a friendly and kind trainer and I didn't need to pay extra cash for him. The Seminyak Kitchen has nice staffs. Especially for Rhio, he made us special menu, egg benedict. I don't eat pork, and the original menu has pork in it. He made us the egg benedict without the pork, and it was so delicious. The staffs of the kitchen also gave the best service in helping my partner to keep the breastmilk in their freezer. It was a great experience staying there."
2841,"5 star resort, amazing food, staff and facilities.",50,May 2015,"We stayed here for our honeymoon last year, paid about 200USD per night and it was worth it. The rooms was not particularly spacious but roomy enough as we don't spend much time in the room. Comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom and spotlessly cleaned throughout our stay.
The pool area was huge and didn't feel crowded with a very full hotel. Great snack menu and very good prices with a happy hour each evening.
The breakfasts were amazing, just delicious with so many choices both indonesian and western style. We ate enough to keep us full for most of the day :-), also the staff will make you a take away tea/coffee when you leave which we just loved. The chef came out and met/chatted with guests daily which was lovely.
Great concierge, great location with a golf cart to take guests to the beach or anywhere reasonably close.
We will be returning in September this year and are looking forward to our stay."
2842,LOVE this hotel,50,April 2016,"We just completed our second visit here and are already planning when we can go back! Love the pool, atmosphere, rooms, breakfast, staff - everything!

Make sure you try the tick menu around the pool - the toasted wraps are lovely.

Strawberry mojitos are also amazing. Wifi is great.

Make sure you take the golf buggy down to La Plancha one night to watch the sunset.

My ONLY complaint is that they ran out of smoked salmon so I had to go most of our stay without the smoked salmon bagels :("
2843,Nice hotel,40,April 2016,"We have stayed in many Marriotts as they are normally our preference when it comes to hotels.
The service here was outstanding at breakfast!
The breakfast was also very nice and catered for all needs with friendly chefs on hand at the live egg station.
The service at the bell station was not really up to usual standard...
Small things like asking one of the staff for a recommended restaurant, only to be told he is unsure as he does not eat out and a few other instances that left me underwhelmed compared to usual Marriott standards.
We rented a two bedroom apartment which was great, views are certainly not one of the standouts either.
Pool bar was wonderful as were the staff at and around the pool, all fantastic!!
The live music each night was my highlight, amazingly talented performers with outstanding acoustic arrangements of many well known English songs as well as taking requests.
We tried the Spa for a massage and it was certainly nothing to write home about and a little less comfortable than normal.
We arrived early and we were accommodated with an early check in with no problems at all, this was a pleasant surprise.
Easy walk to the beach or complimentary golf buggy that will drive you down and pick you up.
There is a spot with beach umbrellas that is serviced by lovely staff down at the double six each which was nice as you did not have to pay for sun lounge, down side is we only found out about it halfway through our trip as the Internet went out and we were watching the TV channel about the hotel.
Overall an enjoyable stay."
2844,A different Bali,40,April 2016,"We booked the Marriott Courtyard knowing it was a not a traditional BALANESE designed resort. We were apprehensive about this modern office block style structure , after a couple of days we got over this aspect , staff were all very helpful and attentive and could not do enough to help guests.The rooms while on the small side were adequate all with balconies overlooking the pools. Even though there is a limited area the landscaping where it could fit in was very BALANESE .The food was normal resort average quality. One area they will need to address is when they have a function or play music at the pool bar it's very loud boom boom style that gets louder the further you are away from it because of the echo chamber caused by the building design that surrounds the outdoor area and the music bounces.
Having said that, the hotel management and staff do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable.
One thing that we really utilised was the unlimited free beach buggy shuttle to the hotels own beach lounge area with bottled water , towels and sun lounges
Would I go back ...possibly"
2845,Honeymoon in Bali,50,March 2016,"Stayed here in March 2016,for our honeymoon. 12 days of Bliss. Central to everything, shopping eating. The staff are awesome, couldn't be more helpful. Great pool bar. Buffet breakfast everyday...amazing. Stayed on 5th level. Quiet rooms, view to die for. Highly recommend The Courtyard."
2846,Excellent,50,April 2016,"Best breakfast , beautiful , clean , fast service and epic value for money . Here on the last part of our honeymoon . Easy to walk to main streets . Hotel staff are extremely accommodating and friendly. Great rooms . It doesn't matter where you stay here it's all nice !"
2847,Great Pool and breakfast - fancy room,40,March 2016,"Great Hotel, all very clean and 5 min walk to the beach , they have reserved beach sun-lounges (and provide buggy transportation to them - i recommend take the buggy .. i walked and took long time to find it) the place is not really pleasant due is not near the water it has the road behind with scooters passing by) but is better than nothing...
the breakfast was really good and excellent service from Staff. Pool bar snacks also very good. Is 3 min walk to the night bars in same street."
2848,Holiday,40,April 2016,"Good hotel, very good central location and close to the main beach. Pool accommodates everyone split into 3 levels one with pool bar, main pool and kiddies pool. Free shuttle service to Seminyak square for shopping and lots of bars , restaraunts."
2849,Comfortable stay with clean rooms,40,April 2016,Stayed here two nights in a holiday to Bali . The hotel is located at a very popular tourist road and seemed very busy . The welcome ice Lolly was brilliant and so was the music every evening at the pool . Clean rooms and pleasant staff . We ate breakfast and dinner in their restaurant and all meals were good . Particularly loved the ice cream waffle at breakfast
2850,Great Breakfast,40,December 2015,I went here for a gathering held with my office. good breakfast here.- The breakfast service at The Seminyak Kitchen was second to none. There was a large variety of foods available that I felt catered to the many different cultures of the guests staying at The Courtyard. Recomende for family trip also for office gathering
2851,Great hotel in Seminyak,40,March 2016,"We stayed here for 8 nights as a family of 3. The staff are, as stated in the previous reviews, very friendly and hospitable as you would expect in Bali. The breakfasts are very good, and suited to all tastes. The restaurant staff do an excellent job to ensure that dishes, fruits and juices are frequently replenished as some of the more popular items go very quickly. We found that it was better to go to breakfast at around 9am as the guests who were on the tour had finished by then, so it was less crowded and more peaceful.
The rooms are a good size, although I did find the bed smaller than anywhere that I've stayed in Bali. The bathroom is a bit of a squeeze as the closet is in the same area, so if you leave the closet door open, you can't get into the toilet and there is also no bath. Other than that, the room was clean and comfortable.
We used the gym and thought it was a bit minimalist, but what is there, is new and it does the job. There is also a daily morning aqua aerobics session held in the pool by the bar, and the beach is only 400 metres away for those who like to run.
The pool area looks very impressive and there is a small shallow area for children at the bottom end. The pool is the centrepiece of the hotel and the rooms are built around it. Our room was opposite the restaurant, so we didn't get any noise from the pool area but we could hear noise from the lobby in the mornings. The pool staff are very good at ensuring that food and drinks requirements are fulfilled.
We used the Kids Club, it's a very calm environment, you get 2 hours free per day and then there is an hourly charge. My son liked that he could just sit there and watch cartoons uninterrupted when it was got too hot outside.
The beach club is a small area on the Double Six beach where they have some loungers, there is no toilet there but there is a shower. Food and drinks can be purchased from the restaurants adjacent to the area. Towels and cold water is available at the beach club.
We enjoyed our stay, and would consider returning again."
2852,Thanks for a wonderful stay at The Courtyard Bali Seminyak,50,April 2016,"Dear staff of the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak, Bali
My husband and I have only recently returned home after a glorious one week stay at your hotel.
Firstly and foremost, the staff were pivotal in making our stay most enjoyable. I can honestly say that every single one of the staff that we encountered delivered their service in an outgoing, polite, friendly and attentive way. The staff sought to meet our needs at every available chance exceeding my expectations. There are many other reasons that we wanted to highlight about our stay.
- There was a high level of security including K9 and security officer patrols, metal detection and bag scanning which ensured us to feel safe within our surroundings at the Courtyard.
- The breakfast service at The Seminyak Kitchen was second to none. There was a large variety of foods available that I felt catered to the many different cultures of the guests staying at The Courtyard. The staff at the breakfast service were extremely attentive and efficient, with a special mention to Arja and Wina.
- Housekeeping kept our room spotless at all times and even on one day when we had the do not disturb sign on all day, they sent a message in the evening to let us know that we could have our room cleaned at any time to suit our needs.
- The location was ideal for us because it was 100 metres or so from the beach which was convenient for my husband who wanted to try a spot of surfing.
- The shuttle buggy that ferried us to the beach and the main eating strip of Seminyak was also very convenient.

Thank you for having us stay at the Courtyard. We will definitely be back!"
2853,Have stayed here twice and will stay again - excellent,50,April 2016,"Stayed here at Christmas and am here again. Staff are very helpful and the place is very well run and organized. The rooms are comfortable and well-equipped, the food is good, there is also a very nice double pool, spa and gym.

The best restaurants are a bit of a walk away but you can get a buggy up the the Corner House until 8pm, or just take a walk up there for some exercise. This is the best hotel I have stayed in in Bali."
2854,First time staying at Courtyard Seminyak....wont be the last!,50,April 2016,"I have just returned from the perfect stay at this hotel with my Wife and 5 year old daughter. What made our stay so special?
* The first class service
* The cleanliness of the hotel generally and the impeccable join of making up our room daily
* The pool happy hour (actually its 4 hrs!!)
* The live music at happy hour and the musicians getting me up to play a few songs
* The security at the front gate
* The location
* Our upgrade to a pool access room..... and right next to the Kids Club
* Great value for money and reasonable food and beverage prices
I could go on.......... Regards - Gary"
2855,Exceeded Expectations Over and Over,50,April 2016,"This was our first ever holiday to Bali. We booked the Courtyard Marriot through Luxury Escapes which included room, breakfast daily and a few vouchers for meals, cocktails and spa treatments.

We were a little concerned that it would be too good to be true. Upon arriving we were impressed straight away with the hotel. We had a transfer from the airport and all the staff that greeted us were very welcoming. Our room was lovely and much bigger than it looked on the Internet.

There were no catches - everything that was promised to us was delivered on. We were not able to find fault in anything during our stay.

The buffet breakfast selection was the best we had ever had. Zanti Spa was up there with top spas in Australia (I had a massage, facial and reflexology and loved them all), the lunch and dinner menus were great, daily cocktails in the swim up bar superb, the staff at kids club kind and gentle with their charges, all staff throughout the resort were so kind and friendly, welcoming us at all times. Our daughter Chloe took a really liking to Yeani in the restaurant who was great with Chloe when she was feeling a bit irritable.

We loved the large central swimming pool with 3 different zones (kids area, general area and bar area). It allowed guests to meet and chat with one another, which we did. This is a bustling vibrant hotel.

We loved the little touches like popcorn and fairy floss available daily from the lobby or the little cleansing juices given to us upon arrival or at breakfast.

Thanks Courtyard - we will be back for sure!"
2856,Best Ever,50,April 2016,"45 years coming to Bali this is the first time staying at this hotel for 6 nights. As the customer from hell and previous hotel owner/operator it was an absolute pleasure to stay. It is firstly and fore mostly very well managed with incredible staff.
We would definitely stay again but the price is a little more than we can afford so it would only be on a special package."
2857,"Hands down, the best place to stay in Bali",50,April 2016,"Marriott Hotel in Seminyak is hands down the destination for your stay in Bali. Not only is it in a great location, between the beach and shops, but the hotel's lobby is incredibly beautiful from the moment you walk in. Brilliant security, making you feel very safe during your stay. The staff greet you at every opportunity and make you feel special. During our stay over my birthday, the morning I awoke to a letter on the door saying ""Happy Birthday"" and during breakfast the entire kitchen staff came out to sing their own rendition of ""happy birthday"". Everyone who works there is so incredibly friendly and amazing, and all try their best to assist you and make your stay memorable. The food is brilliant, catering for a variety of cuisines and diets, the rooms are cleaned daily down to the very last spec of dirt while still respecting your belongings. Many activities are available throughout the day for kids, teens and adults, the gym is 24 hours for you to keep fit, and the complementary massages help you unwind after a long, hot day.The pool and bar are available around the clock, and ready for your use. This is the best place to stay in all of Indonesia."
2858,Best visit to Bali!,50,April 2016,"Where to start.. We were greated with flowers, a cold towel, drink and ice block and friendly faces. The room was fresh and the bed and pillows are so comfortable. The room is dark and noise from the pool is blocked out by the sliding door. For those who saw the negative reviews about the pool being shaded - that's the worst review! The pool gets plenty of sun! And yes it is shaded at parts of the day and on different parts of the pool but after walking around markets or out on a day trip, a dip in the shaded end of the pool was certainly what most people were after anyway! The lobby has fresh free popcorn and fairy floss which is such a cute touch, especially for kids! The drinks at the swim up bar were so good! The food in the Seminyak kitchen is amazing! There is a free buggy that takes you to the beach where the courtyard have their own little part of the beach set up with towels, day beds and water. The buggy also goes up to the Main Street to drop you off closer to shops and for easy access when getting a cab. I personally didn't try the spa on site however several people we spoke to did and said it was amazing!! The staff here are amazing and so friendly, they smile and are always making sure you are having a good stay. We will be back!! Only positive feedback we would like to give is another towel station at the other end of the pool :)"
2859,A good hotel in Seminyak!,40,April 2016,"The hotel was very centrally located in seminyak. The standards were very well maintained and the staff were friendly.

The pool bar was just too awesome but the rooms were very small and they should have better bathroom amendties.

The pool was very good and neatly maintained. The breakfast was quite good but could have more options.

Overall everything was good!"
2860,Scary experienced !,10,April 2016,"If you are looking for noise everywhere then go for courtyard by Marriott .. Room has tiny spider around.. Dirty .. Left behind bra probably from previous unlucky guest ..Run down .. Falling wall...If you get room 670 ask to change !! Hair dryer turn on by itself middle of the night.. Locked out at the balcony ( it's not even an auto door that will locked by itself) explanation by the duty manage was rediculous! No comfort was given but excuses & rude attitude..Luckily was only a two Night stay in this hotel. Will never ever want to remember my stay here!!
Though thank you all of the staff in seminyak kitchen !! And mr.Ari from the front desk for arranging ! transportation to the airport"
2861,Best Hotel Ever,50,April 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard recently and it was excellent. The staff are absolutely amazing and everyone is so friendly. The rooms are modern and cleaned daily and the pool area is absolutely fantastic. The service was great and quite fast and all the staff are always smiling. Whenever you arrive at the hotel, you are always warmly greeted by the staff who were always willing to take you to places or order you a taxi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard and we will definitely stay at the same place next time we come to Bali."
2862,Great escape!,50,April 2016,"Came here on a luxury escape deal and the hotel staff were so accommodating and helpful!

The pool, rooms and food were fantastic and the location is ideal!
The hotel had live music every night and we even had a fire dance and Bali dancing lessons!

Special thanks to the staff at our morning buffet breakfast! You're always greeted with a smile...
And the pool bar staff you are brilliant at making the day so much more fun!"
2863,Awesome hotel,50,April 2016,"Amazing hotel and absolutely amazing staff who just could not do enough for you and we're always happy to have a chat and always with a smile. Great vibe in the pool bar area and the live music was always a beautiful way to sit and have drinks. Great breakfast in the Seminyak kitchen. The rooms were lovely however they did lack a bit in the storage area, drawers would be good."
2864,The staff make this hotel - led from the top,50,April 2016,My partner and I recently returned from this hotel which we chose because of its location and value through a coupon deal for six nights. I travel extensively and have stayed in numerous hotels. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised by the airport greeting. Others waiting for taxis and rides must have thought we were royalty. We were greeted by a wonderful man who offered us a cold towel and a beer. A great welcome to Bali. We were offered another beer when we arrived. There was confusion about our voucher and we were told we had to pay again at the end of our trip. This was sorted out quickly though. Our room welcomed us with roses and chocolates for our 'Honeymoon' which was great because we are not yet married but the thought was there. The only minor criticism of the room was a soiled foot-stool and damaged chair. I bought a $4 towel and covered it so no problem. The bed was soooo comfy. The shower with its ceiling mounted fitting was a dream. A great bathroom and comfy bed with modern tv etc. What more could you ask for?? As a communication specialist and journalist I tested the staff on several occasions with questions and comments.They never failed to impress me and the reason is they are all top-class. I asked to meet the GM and John is a credit to the company. It's no wonder the staff are happy - I would be happy to work for John too!! The pool is great and chairs abundant. The food was good poolside but the breakfasts were sensational. All staff were great and deserve thanks - specially Rai and Agus. The chefs who prepared our Atlantic salmon deserve a medal. Beautiful. And the hotel has a fun atmosphere. The day we departed a truck arrived for the front entrance area (see photo) 'What the Truck' is a great idea and will add colour and interest for the locals and tourists alike. We will be back again as we felt very comfortable and at home. I found the room very quiet. Some say they hear pool noise - I heard nothing. The shuttle drivers were very sensitive. My wife was recovering from surgery and the driver was very careful and considerate. Oh and the happy hours are very happy - take advantage.
2865,This resort is fantastic one of the best we have stayed in (suite room 643),50,April 2016,"We are staying here at the moment with my family we can't fault this resort. The 2 bedroom suite was immaculate, spacious and clean. The staff could not do enough to make us more comfortable, they were so accommodating in every little way possible. So impressed with breakfast, the pool and the room. We will definitely be staying here again."
2866,"Perfect Location, Great Service!",50,February 2016,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed our time. The staff was friendly, the service was great and the location is excellent. 5 mins walk from the Kuta beach on one side and market and restaurants on the other. Many restaurants had great live music so all you have to do is pick your music genre and enjoy the evening. The best part of the hotel is their pool and the elaborate buffet breakfast.

Loved staying at Courtyard!"
2867,Jinx Irvine,50,April 2016,Spent eights nights in this hotel the service was impeccable. The staff are beautiful friendly and very well trained which is a big plus especially when they have to put up with rude holiday makers. The rooms are very comfortable and always clean and neat. A big thumbs up from us
2868,Loved this hotel!,50,July 2015,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at - stunning pool and the breakfast buffet had everything you could imagine. There were several chefs cooking eggs, pancakes and Asian dishes to your liking. The spa experience was beautiful and the service overall was excellent. The location was about 10 mins walk to Seminyak beach and close to shops and restaurants."
2869,Pleasant stay in Seminyak,40,April 2016,"We stayed in Marriott Seminyak as part of our 10 day Balinese Holiday.

My husband and I had a reservation at a Villa in Seminyak, after checking in, we were then advised that there was a construction site right next to the property. We quickly then made the mad dash, trying to find an alternate accommodation. After all, the Marriott is world renowned, I promptly told our driver to take us straight to Marriott and crossed our fingers that there was a room for us.

Now, Marriott staff assisted us straight away from arrival. They found a room for us immediately and next thing you know our bags were being brought in our rooms. The rate we booked had breakfast included. I found this was the best buffet style breakfast we had during our trip. Plenty of options, delicious and kitchen staff / Chef was approachable and friendly. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

We didn‚Äôt use the pool facilities, however I saw that it was always busy.

- The hotel was clean and our room was very comfortable.
- Staff were all friendly and helpful.
- Concierge staff are happy to make recommendations and called / booked taxi‚Äôs for us. There is a buggy service that takes you to the beach, which is approximately 5 minutes on the buggy to the beach and we walked in back home in 15 minutes.
- The famous double six beach / la plancha just down the road.
- Town Centre is a 5 ‚Äì 10 minute drive away with approximately $6.00 AUD taxi fare.
- Hotel is within close proximately to an array of restaurants, Seminyak boutiques etc.

I just want to thank the staff at Marriott again for being so accommodating during our circumstances."
2870,Pleasant and practical,40,February 2016,"Location is at the heart of Seminyak, you can easily go to the beach by foot, and go around for shopping by foot. If you are up for culinary adventure, then you might need to take transportation from to the hotel to the recommended spots.

The room was satisfactory. In my opinion, it is designed to be pleasant, but practical and not over the top. The attention to detail is pretty good.

Breakfast selections were somewhat"
2871,Amazing rooms and easy access with buggy service,50,April 2016,Nice rooms for family's and friends very good room size and goood value for money. Security is good and tight as well. A fairly new hotel as well and all the stuff is amazing and there's some activities around the hotel like a table tennis table and nice pool. Overall a amazing experience.
2872,Great Hotel,50,March 2016,"Excellent staff, breakfast and overall stay. Great location for Spas and a short walk to the beach.
Pool area is very nice and relaxing with good food and drink options. The number of beds can be low at times yet we always found a comfortable bean bag to relax at the pool bar. This was perfect for us, but may not be suitable for everybody."
2873,"Friendly, personable staff and an enjoyable yoga class!",50,April 2016,"i stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 4 nights and had an amazing experience with the personal attention of all the staff. At the very last minute, i decided to do an in-house spa treatment but was full. They put me on waitlist and i told concierge i will be by the pool with some friends. Luckily a slot became available and he came looking for me and booked me in. I was amazed by his dedication to hunt me down!. The next day, i had a yoga class and Komma, the instructor is an experience, trained yoga teacher. I do yoga regularly so he tailored the class to my level and then pushed me to do a bit more, helping me along the way. The one hour class went by too fast. I had a fantastic session."
2874,Best time!,50,April 2016,"I absolutely loved all of my 8 days at Marriott. Staff and facilities are amazing. I booked using a luxury escapes voucher, everything went smoothly from airport pickup to late checkout on our last day. Communication was great. The hotel care a lot about their guests enjoyment and it really makes a difference. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all amazing and exceeded all expectations. The pool is lovely, Can't wait to come back!!!"
2875,Beautiful Hotel!!,50,April 2016,Really regret only staying here one night. Originally booked it as it was close to airport and we were arriving late.. Left for gili next morning! Hotel rooms were gorgeous! Amazing en suite and balcony. Pool was beautiful! Had dinner and breakfast which were both lovely!
2876,"good location, nice warm pool, life music and very cleam",50,April 2016,"clean rooms, as a silver marriot member i got a free upgrade, all stuff is super nice.
good location with a lot of bars and restaurants near the beach as well. heaven
I also like the pool. The water in the pool is very warm, the pool bar and live music is just perfect"
2877,Too intense,30,April 2016,"The employees make this Hotel. Everyone was so friendly and kind. Biggest markdown for me is the intensity of pool area . Not relaxing at all. Struggle to get a lounge.
Major Plus is the proximity to the beach and other resorts to drink or party. I saw smaller intimate places that were half the price and just as good.
Wouldnt stay there again"
2878,Amazing stay,50,February 2016,"The room was amazing, fantastic shower and bathroom facitlies if that is your thing , it is mine.
Most of the rooms surround the pool but the sliding doors work well at blocking out noise if you go to bed early.
Breakfast was second to none, amazing staff so very attentive loved it best i have ever had
Staff overall made me feel very special , they have all been hospitality trained and it shows!
Close to some fabulous home decor shops which i loved, less hussle and bussle and fantastic restaurants walking distance."
2879,SIMPLY THE BEST,50,March 2016,"Stayed for 9 days over the Easter, cannot praise this place enough, it was amazing.
From the staff and all the amenities provided it was first class. The location was spot on as well, everything on your doorstep and the beach 2 min walk down the road. The hotel even has it`s own private part on the beach where they supply sun beds and towels.
The swim up bar was fantastic, especially happy hour. The rooms are very spacious and being a new Hotel was very fresh as well.
Anyone looking for a luxurious get away to Bali, look no further this is the place."
2880,Very enjoyable,40,April 2016,We stayed here 6 nights . Check in was easy our room was a good size and the bed very comfy. Pool was also enjoyable and their Seminyak kitchen breakfast was tasty with many choices. Dinner was excellent and we ate most nights at the hotel. The team in the hotel have been excellently trained . Yoga in the restaurant looked after us soooo well as did everyone.
2881,A luxury escape,50,March 2016,"Despite being a large resort the intimacy that the staff create makes you feel very special. Everyone, including the transport drivers, are helpful. Ensure your accommodation deal includes the buffet breakfast as it is outstanding.
We were lucky to be upgraded to a Deluxe Pool View room as part of our Luxury Escape voucher special.
Our only comment that would have improved our experience would be quicker service at the pool bar. Occasionally (often during happy hour) there were a number of staff hanging around but only one serving."
2882,Highly Recommended,50,March 2016,"This was our second stay at this hotel and it didn't disappoint. A great place to stay, staff very attentive and friendly. The pool area is great, caters for everyone (3 levels), from the swim up pool bar to the kiddies pool and a large pool inbetween.
Rooms are very clean, large variety for breakfast, pool bar and the hotel restaurant serves excellent food. Happy hour is vibrant and fun. Has daily activities like bingo, yoga etc and different weekly attractions (fire dancers).
We spent most of our time in and around the pool - you won't want to leave."
2883,Superb service and facilities such lovely people too!,50,March 2016,All hotel staff were happy to oblige - no request too much trouble and they made me feel both welcome and very relaxed. Our room was changed at our request without fuss and I cannot fault anything about the hotel. Concierge services were efficient and friendly. Cookery class was a delight and I would definitely stay again.
2884,"Love this hotel, best breakfast in town.",50,March 2016,"Have stayed here before when it first opened and it's still much the same. Great location away from the crazy. Easy walk or taxi to get to place's to eat and shop. The breakfast and service are the two best things about the Marriott Seminyak. Breakfast is amazing and the service staff are just superb. The pool is great and I love that they take away saved pool spots if you haven't been spotted for a while ( keeps it fair to all guest's ). The only reason I give it a small thumbs down is that the noise carries through the central space. I hate being woken to loud drunks at 2am and it happened twice this stay. Ask for a room way down the back away from reception, you may have walk to leave but much nicer not to be woken in the night."
2885,Good stay and good place!,40,March 2016,"We checked in with good front office. Her name is Floor and she was doing great. She can explain me all things I had asked. Her hospitality shows Marriott standard. So friendly and always smile.

You can go everywhere from hotel. Mini market, restaurant, bar.

The room is good to stay. The only issue is no ashtray in balcony. But overall... it's good to stay. I will be back to stay in this hotel again. Good stay... good place..."
2886,Average,30,March 2016,"I have stayed in Bali many times as a lot of Perth people have and as a result I have stayed in a range of different hotels and resorts. This property came recommend from friends of ours, a group of young guys about 20-25. They had stayed before and enjoyed it.

I to be honest did not dislike my stay but would not be inclined to stay here again. We paid extra for a pool access room , which was ok. The rooms are simple and as you would expect for a 4* hotel. The hotel has a swim up bar which is always a bonus. The staff were not rude but did not have that amazing service that you normally find in Bail hotels. Just average.

The layout of the hotel means it has more of a hotel feel rather than a resort feel. The pool is in the middle with the rooms around. The location is good just Down the road from the beach.

Although I did not eat- the breakfast looked amazing ! There was so much to choose
From and it had a really relaxed feel to the dining room which was half indoors / outdoors. You could even grab a coffee and a muffin just outside if you did not want to face the crowds for a full breaky.

Overall I think for the price we paid it was good value for money. It is a hotel not a resort style property with average staff service but great pricing."
2887,Relaxation,50,March 2016,"We recently stayed here late March and loved it.

I work in hospitality myself and to come here and to experience their hospitality was simply refreshing.

Everybody we came into contact with was so friendly, it was quite evident the employees were happy in their jobs as there was such a great vibe around the hotel.

I went away to go and relax and that's exactly what I did. The suite was modern, clean and very comfortable. The pool was fantastic, Zanti Retreat was exceptional

I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to many friends on their visits to Bali and I will be back in the future"
2888,great hotel,50,March 2016,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel and I cannot speak highly enough about the quality and service offered.
The staff are to be commended on their English and the fact that nothing is too much trouble, they all have been trained extremely well. I must congratulate the GM and his team for the work they have put into the staff performance.
I had the opportunity to meet the executive chef Danang his attention to detail is above and beyond, the waiting staff in the Seminyak Kitchen all shined and they knew their jobs well. The hotel is modern and clean, I would recommend to anyone to stay at this Hotel.
The location is superb not too far but far enough, the beach is close by as is eat street and the hotel has a golf buggy shuttle to get you there!"
2889,Really awesome place,50,March 2016,"Absolutely beautiful resort, with beautiful people working there, everyone always greets you with a big smile. The pool is amazing, the rooms are lovely, well kept and cool, The beds are so nice and there is a mini couch on the balcony.
Breakfast is super great, massive selection of all different food, including ice cream!!!! one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.
The room service and pool bar are a little expensive, but that is the only negative I have.
There is a shuttle that takes you to a few places around as the resort is not located near the main area. I usually stay close to the main areas but this didn't bother me at all, its a very short walk to the beach and everything is accessible. I will be coming back here for sure."
2890,Super place,40,May 2015,"I can only recommend this place to everyone. Great place, relaxed pool with good pool bar. Snacks are good but breakfast is amazing!!! We where here for our last nights at Bali and, easy to travel around but even better to also chill at the nice pool."
2891,Couldn't fault here,50,March 2016,"My Wife and I just returned from a 6 night stay here and loved our time at the Marriot courtyard.

This was our 4th trip to Bali and our first time staying here.
The staff were very friendly, always willing to make sure you are being looked after.

We stayed on the 6th floor in a room overlooking the pool. The room was great and always cleaned well daily.

We only had lunch in the Seminyak kitchen once but had breakfast there daily. Couldn't fault the service or food. Also the prices we thought were very good!

The location is great as not far from great hotels and shops. Also a very short walk (or complimentary buggy ride to beach club) to beach.

Well done Courtyard Marriott Seminyak! See you next time."
2892,Fantastic staff,50,March 2016,"This place is made fantastic by the exceptional staff and the service they provide. Everyday they went above and beyond to make our stay thorough enjoyable. In terms of cleanliness, this Hotel was immaculate. Great location and easily accessible to the beach and great restaurants of Seminyak. The Hotel itself offered great facilitates and in our opionion was fantastic value for money."
2893,"Great location, people, facilities and weather",40,March 2016,"We stayed here for 8 nights on a Luxury Escapes deal, which included a massage, breakfast daily, 2 cocktails daily, a dinner and lunch for the 2 of us. We were looking for a place where we could relax by the pool, use the swim up bar and do very little but also be close enough to the beach and Semiyak for when required and this place suited us perfectly. The staff were fantastic and always prepared to help. A vast choice at breakfast from traditional bacon and eggs to Indian and Asian selection set you up for the day. Zanti massage was fantastic, and yes you can get it cheaper around the corner but they were very good. My tip, use the golf buggy to get to their private spot on the beach"
2894,Wonderful Staff and Facilities,40,March 2016,"Stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 9 nights on a Luxury Escapes deal. This hotel has everything you'd need. The staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble. We used the gym and the Spa and enjoyed our cocktail, spa and meal vouchers. The Hotel is in a great location. It's close to the beach, Eat Street and shops.
We had pool view rooms on the 6th floor. The beds are so comfortable, and the room itself and the bathroom were spacious. Bath towels were a little worn and thin but I wasn't about to let that stop me from having a great holiday.
Only one thing missing from the bathrooms- a magnifying mirror!"
2895,Sensational!,50,March 2016,"An absolutely fantastic property only one year old that can't be faulted - accommodation is brilliant with a choice of many room types. Great value for money - wonderful location and superb customer service. Pool is wonderful, staff are friendly and attentive and can't do enough. Very good security as well and this place suits families and couples alike. Great breakfast choice as well. A fabulous 4 day stay and would highly recommend as a great choice for Seminyak. The property has a gym too and all the facilities you need. An absolute gem. Thank you for a wonderful stay - we will be back."
2896,Quiet & peaceful,50,August 2015,"Nice place, quiet & peaceful, even with many people stay together...enjoyed very much! It also feels at home, feels secure with 24 hours security & X-Ray. My last time was raining, but I enjoyed it & still thinking to visit again in future."
2897,Great hotel hope fire alarm fixed,40,March 2016,"Currently at the Marriott in a pool terrace room. The hotel is in a good location and is extremely good value for your money.
One little problem though is our daughter in the next room, has been woken up the last two nights with the fire Alarm going off at 4-30am and the security coming to check. It is good that they did indeed check no fire etc and our daughter was fine with been woken up the first nights do they checked and said needed new battery but when it happened again last night as well it really is not good enough not to have been fixed. We also heard it in our room next

Hopefully our daughter fire alarm is now fixed and she will be able to have uninterrupted sleep for the rest our stay.

The breakfast is as everyone says, great and plentiful and the staff everywhere very friendly and helpful, maybe could be a little quicker around the pool when you press for service but that us only being picky as they took 30mins and three presses to respond.

The rooms have everything you require with a large shower but no bath if you require one. Tv has lots of channels and I really like the reading lights as lots of hotels seem to get the lights wrong.

We will be back again"
2898,amazing staff,50,March 2016,"Recently stayed at the courtyard marriott through Luxury escapes package. My husband and i absolutely loved this hotel, the location is great walking distance to the beach,shops and restaurants . The hotel is spotless and modern with a great atmosphere. The food is of high standards and the chefs in the kitchen are amazing and so friendly. All the staff spoke very good english an were so friendly and helpful.I have stayed at many hotels all around bali and i will definitely stay at the marriott again"
2899,Fantastic resort,50,March 2016,Currently at the courtyard and cannot fault it. Best resort I have been to in Bali. The rooms are great and breakfasts are amazing. Spent many happy hours at the pool bar. One of the best things about this hotel are the staff. They are so friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back
2900,Still brilliant,50,March 2016,"This is the second time we stayed at Courtyard we're looking forward to our third visit! Staff are extremely friendly & helpful, location is perfect with close walking distance to everything. The one bedroom suite is spacious and overall the hotel continues meeting our expectations.

Can't wait to visit again and start the day with your fabulous breakfasts!!"
2901,Thank you Courtyard for a memorable first time holiday to Bali.,50,March 2016,"Room was great pool view 6th floor, staff could have not been anymore friendly or helpful. The best part is the entire staff was just as happy to help in and outside of the hotel security staff great, Concierge great, check in great, overall Fantastic.

Seminyak Kitchen was very reasonably priced if we weren't using the free vouchers we had been provided, Western, Eastern, Balinese food for all guests."
2902,A Touch of Paradise In Paradise,50,March 2016,"Having travelled to Bali once before and staying in a Private Villa I was apprehensive of staying at a hotel, however my cousin recommended to opt for a hotel with ammenties. I could not agree more now having stayed at the Courtyard Marriott. I was beyond impressed with the overall service, cleanliness and kindness of staff.

The daily breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen did not disappoint with a wide variety of options from bacon, eggs, cereals, fruit, bagels, waffles, pancakes, curry, rice to name a few. There is something for everyone. We had dinner one night and were very impressed. I had the Nasi Goreng and my cousin opted for the Beef Rendang which we were both very impressed with. All staff are accommodating and friendly, however there was a stand out named Arja who as well as his brilliant service took the time to chat with us and get to know us.

The pool/pool bar has a great atmosphere. You can tell the staff really enjoy working here which is shown through their service and the overall vibe of the pool. The staff are very attentive, friendly and make great cocktails. Having worked in both retail and hospitality you have a higher expectation of the service that should be given and the pool bar did not disappoint. We received some excellent service from Alit and Darsana, who seemed genuinely happy and interested in having a chat. The standout from the pool bar was a guy called Hendra who went out of his way to provide the best service to all guests. He seems very passionate about his work and always had a smile. He gave great recommendations for local places to visit and things to do while in Bali, which was very helpful as I hadn't don't much research. Hendra seemed to personalise each client at the bar and would seem genuinely interested in what you had done or had planned. If you are stuck for a drink ask him to make you his signature cocktail and you will not be disappointed.

The rooms were very tidy and the beds were super comfortable. I contemplated asking for the cost of their pillows. Its one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in.

We had a spa treatment at the Zanti which was amazingly relaxing, with the choice of 4 oils. The staff were friendly and applied a great pressure. A fantastic massage which was well priced compared to Western spas.

Overall it was a great stay, all of the staff at the Courtyard Marriott went above and beyond all expectations. I will definitely be staying at the Courtyard Marriott on my next visit."
2903,Wonderful stay with excellent hospitality,50,March 2016,"I would like to extend my thanks to Melinda for making our family vacation so special. She is very thoughtful and always make an effort to see to our needs to make our stay as comfortable as it can be. Tks Melinda for taking such good care of us during our 5 nights stay at courtyard seminyak.

In addition, I find that the staff at this hotel really put customer service as their priority and this is evident throughout the hotel be it the concierge, bellboys, waiters/waitresses at the restaurant, etc. This hotel-wide service oriented culture speak volumes to the strong leadership and I would like to congratulate the leadership for training up a great team exhibiting exemplary customer service on a daily basis.

Thank you Courtyard Seminyak for making our 5 nights stay so wonderful!"
2904,2nd time - still good,40,March 2016,"This is the second time we have stayed here. First of all, this is a REALLY nice hotel. Last time we stayed for 7 nights, and enjoyed it so much that we booked 2 rooms this time for 10 nights.

One thing though, when it rains in Bali this hotel can be dangerous. The reason I say this is because the footpath around the exterior of the hotel is made of these polished marble looking tiles. Yes they look nice, but when wet they are VERY slippery. A couple of us managed to slip on these tiles when they were wet while staying here.

The breakfast at the restaurant (Seminyak Kitchen) is really nice. Plenty of choice, and no need for lunch after such a big brekky. The highlight of our time at this hotel was the fantastic service by the staff. Two staff in particular were really good, and went above and beyond expectation. Their names are Agik and Jul, and we chatted to them every morning at breakfast. Agik was good with entertaining my kid, and Jul was very kind to my dad who unfortunately got Bali Belly early on in the holiday.

We spent quite a few days at the swim up bar, and it was great to see some familiar faces serving us (Bruno Mars lookalike is still working there). Also spoke to a friendly guy from Holland that works there too.

If you book this hotel, make sure you ask to stay in the rooms near the reception and restaurant. Last time we stayed at rooms near the reception, and it was really quiet at night. This time we were at the other end of the hotel, and because there are no exterior rooms blocking the noise, I would get woken up by either a barking dog or cats fighting in the middle of the night. This happened most nights, so I did ask to be moved, but was told there are no interconnecting rooms at the other end of the hotel (even though we stayed in interconnecting rooms on the other side last year). Not to matter.

We stayed during Nyepi, and the hotel staff tried very hard to accommodate everyone during this time. Will we be back? Yes I think we might. We really enjoyed our time here, and this hotel is good for young families. Plenty of kids in the kiddies pool. If you like a sleep in, probably don't book the poolside rooms on the ground floor. Kids are in the pool from pretty early on."
2905,"Good location, facilities and rooms; Free drop service to Eat Street",40,March 2016,"Its a Marriott property so i dont think you will be disappointed too much, every thing is standard and no nasty surprises. Rooms are spacious, toiletries, hair dryers and safety box.There is a good spread for the the breakfast buffet, large gym, pool, pool bar etc.
The taxi service / concierge desk has very good drivers at competitive rates. We used them for a trip to Tanhalot. I think it cost us 500k IDR for 5 hours. The currency exchange at the hotel is not competitive so would suggest you avoid.
The hotel is very conveniently located to Seminyak Beach and Eat Street, they even offer free drop services. Plenty of shopping, spa, dining options, around the hotel.
Its perfect if you think the price fits your budget. Kudeta, Potato Head, Saigon Street, Ultimo etc are all within a short drive away!

The only annoying factor was that our room was on the 2nd floor so you need to walk up a short flight of ~5-8 steps every time, coz the elevator doesn't go up directly. Else the other option is to take an elevator down first and then the same elevator to go up! ( strange- i know) and the morning light streams through the translucent bathroom doors and so its not really a black out room, should you want to lie in.

I have put in a separate review for the Bali Food Safari should you want to do that too. And yes also a review for a very good Car Rental service we used."
2906,Best Courtyard Ever..!!!! :),50,February 2016,"Best hotel that i have ever stay.. great staff, best service, nice pool, nice room,
Breakfast.?? wow..!!! amazing food, best breakfast ever, you can request any kind of coffee, tea, fresh juice, and milk shake,, my daughter always request for her hot chocolate.
Start from check-in till check-out, that was lovely.. thx to daniel, also weni or wena.?? for room service, lol
when i came for relax in the pool, staff was great,their polite, i just remember hari for my cocktail, ayu, and fitri..
dwi in restaurant, and also the man who incharge every morning ""tall guy"" i think he's a manager. all staff in restaurant was excellent.
Over all... GREAT, AMAZING, LOVELY."
2907,Nice place to stay,40,March 2016,"We stayed 8 nights in pool view room. The rooms are very clean ,comfortable and well appointed, serviced daily , all amenities in the room were in excellent condition . The only very small criticism is a lack of hooks or towel rails.

The pool is huge and lot of lounge chairs available during our stay.

We had breakfast daily in the restaurant as part of our stay. There was plenty of choice , staff were very attentive , food was very nice.

We only had 1 evening meal in the restaurant which was dissapointing, my battered fish was tough and my husbands steak was very poor quality . Entree and dessert saved the day though.

Drinks are very reasonably priced and staff are very friendly and helpful.

Its a short walk to the beach (5 minutes)
theres a shuttle service to take you to the beach or to eat street. The walk back from eat street is approx 20 minutes and can be a bit hairy as the road is thin and paths are in poor condition ."
2908,Nice hotel.,50,February 2016,"Great hotel, central to the night life and the beach. However you do not get disturbed by late night party goers.

The pool and bar look just like the photos. The singers in the bar in the evening were excellent, not heard a solo/ duet singers like that in a long time. And the entertainment put on by the hotel on random evenings like the flame throwers etc... Was an extra bonus.

The breakfast was spot on, only issue I had was they never seemed to offer me tea or coffee when I entered.

The rooms were excellent with a nice view of the inner courtyard and pool.

I would recommend anybody to stay here."
2909,great location,50,March 2016,"Arrived Bali eve of Nyepi Day. Taxi unable to travel to hotel so was dropped off some way from hotel. Motor bike came by and picked me up. (which was great and luckily I only had overnite bag). Lock down all of next day and even day after went into Kuta however, most shops still closed. I would never again travel to Indonesia over this period. Hotel location great, clean and staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfast include with room and good variety to choose from."
2910,2 Night Stay,40,February 2016,Room was nice and clean. Staff very friendly. Breakfast inclusion with room was very nice and good variety. However the room service food is quite average and nothing special. Would come back here again and recommend to others.
2911,Great for Relaxing with Family,40,March 2016,"The Hotel is located in a quiet part of Seminyak, Bali. It is approx 40-50 mins from Denpasar airport. Since we arrived in the afternoon on March 8, a day before Nyepi (Balinese New Year- March 9) most roads leading to the hotel were closed in preparation for the Oogh- oogh parade at night. We had to walk with our bags for about 25 mins to the Hotel.
One is well greeted on arrival. Has a security system in place is really good. The Check-in was smooth - Melinda - from Guest relations helped us with the check-n.
The room was large with a lovely large toilet. A very welcome place after the walk in hot & sultry weather.
The Hotel runs a golf cart to market area in close vicinity. This a great help for Seniors.
The food was well prepared that night. Amazing choice at Breakfast. Food prices reasonable. Drinks a tad expensive but fine due to a cozy & quiet environment.
Service efficient with a smile always.
Late Check-out requested. Both girls at the counter Laura & Floor) very helpful. Good place to unwind. Also if interested in a blast, it is close to happening places."
2912,Roasted on Nyepi Day,30,March 2016,"This hotel is far removed from any Bali experiance.
The pool area is a catchment for unbearable heat with zero shade.The pool is uncomfortably warm and doesnt offer any relief.The management would be doing the guests a great favor if they put up shade sails where the lawn is
On a positive note the breakfast was amazing . whatever you do don't get a room on the six floor where the air conditioning is situated. They cause a uncomfortable vibration throughput the night.The TV is amazing reception.Rooms are well appointed lovely bathrooms.Staff are attentive and warm.
Security is strict with imaging machines. Food is reasonably priced. Drinks are medium to expensive.
Wouldn't stay here again"
2913,Lovely rooms and excellent service,50,March 2016,Excellent service from arrival till departure! We were greeted with lovely frangipani upon arrival at the security check point even before we reached the check in counters. Every staff you see in here serves with a smile and ever so helpful and friendly. The breakfast spread is to die for! Who serves Egg Benedict on the buffet line?! Well they do! And it's pretty good. We got a Pool Terrace room with direct access to the lovely pool and I love how the staff comes by with complimentary popsicles in the middle of the day as one bakes in the sun by the pool side. There are also several food and massage places surrounding the hotel. Certainly my recommended and preferred choice of room the next time I return to Bali!
2914,Excellent Hotel - especially for families,40,October 2015,Sorry this review is a bit late - finally got around to writing a few reviews up. We enjoyed two stays at this hotel last year - with a trip to Ubud in between. The Hotel is right where the action is and has a golf buggy service on demand down to a reserved spot at the beach - otherwise there is a series of pools to enjoy centred around the hotel rooms. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and the hotel puts on a magnificent spread at breakfast - A credit to the Aussie chef!. This hotel would be best suited to families or young couples who could take full advantage of happy hours by the pool. The spa treatments are pretty good too.
2915,Fantastic Stay,50,February 2016,"Me & my wife stayed in a pool side suite 4 night's from 26/2 till 1/3. The room was very nice and just few steps from the pool. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice. Location is great.
We really enjoyed our stay."
2916,Delighful stay and vacation,40,February 2016,"I spent 3 days in this hotel with my girlfriend when we arrive at hotel all staff very kind and friendly welcoming us.
Check in process very fast we arrive at 12 noon after that we got the room key for our room we no waiting longtime for got the room key
The room is very nice and comfortable and also very clean i like the room concept and the breakfast is so yummy staff at restaurant very welcoming us always great every guest.
Overall i love staff and atmosphere from this hotel
i will give recommend to all my friend and my family
Once again thank you courtyard seminyak team for making wonderful vacation in bali"
2917,You shouldn't play game with guest.,20,March 2016,"I went to Bali for 4 days 3 nights for my special holiday. I was had a nice time with the nice room, almost staffs was helpful. But it was destroyed in last minute by the reception guy. We asked him 2 times about BLUE BIRD taxi to the airport because we had to leave at 3:45am in the morning. He told that he'll call, taxi ll be ready and he said that they work 24 hours, then my friend did confirmed again about taxi at late night just in case they forget. So, when we check out, he call for us taxi outside, it was not BLUE BIRD taxi as he said, this kind of taxi will kill you with the price because they have meter run very fast. I refused to get that taxi, then reception guy started calling blue bird and said that it was on the way. So, I have to wait for BLUE BIRD TAXI 15 mins but taxi did not appear. Finally, I had to get other taxi outside hotel with fix price as I know before because I did not want to miss my flight.
My point is: if you say you can do, you should do exactly what you say with the guest, you shouldn't play game with the guest like that just because the guest don't know about it. What happen if the guest don t know and trust you, then guest take that kind of taxi, then the driver give the guest expensive price. So, guest will have bad experience in last minute, and this bad experience will destroy all what you did during their stay.
That s exactly what I feel when the staff called ghost taxi for me. I was so disappointed about it and left your hotel in the angry. I was angry because they treat me like a fool as I do not know anything about local, as I travel first time in my life. I did trust your hotel because I thought that this is my family, when I'm here, it s mean I'm home."
2918,Lovely stay in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"Our stay here was very nice, it was a lovely hotel. We couldn't really fault it. Very good security, great location and lovely staff. The pool was very nice offering a number of different pool areas. They offered some free activities ie Aqua aerobics but some others had an additional cost. The gym was OK, only small and just enough to get by. The breakfast was very good as was the pool service. They have live music in the evening and happy hour. We extended our 4 day stay here twice, so ended up staying about 11 days. We only really left so that we could experience other areas of Bali. We needed to work while we were there and found the Internet very good. So many restaurants and the beach all so close by, great spot. Would definitely stay again."
2919,Lovely garden/pool view rooms for all!,40,February 2016,"It's not called COURTYARD for nothing! Though this Bali hotel is not really on the beachfront, all rooms come with a balcony deck with a view of the garden and pool, and a deck sofa for added relaxation. The beach is just about a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. It's near enough restaurants and some shops, though it isn't in the city center, being near the beach.
My husband and I checked in as part of a big Dream Trips group (100 people) but there was no problem checking-in. Everything went so smoothly. Our rooms were all clean, very nice with amenities including a hair dryer. Free wifi in the rooms. Breakfast buffet was good. Staff was very respectul, kind, helpful and friendly."
2920,Lovely place to stay,40,January 2016,"I really had a great time staying at this hotel.
Arrival :
1. The security guard (surprisingly) very friendly.. From the gate to lobby. Always greet me and my husband everytime we come...

2. The front desk.
Laura fernandez... She's superb! Greet me with her warmest smile.. Smooth check in process. Everything was explained in details.
Dan termasuk staff yang memberikan welcome drink and popsicle. He was a bit nervous but that was fine..

3. Bell boy/concierger
Quick luggage up to the room. Bell boy nya juga baik dan ramah sekali. Dia juga menjelaskan lokasi fasilitas dgn baik.

4. Restaurant/breakfast
Super friendly staff.. Love them. The food was great. But unfortunately the was some leaking from the ceiling inside the restaurant. But no big deal. And one last thing... The birthday surprise for my son... That was very lovely. Thank you guys

5. Room
I was staying at 360 (or 306).. Sorry. Reservation under Mr. Ryadi Budiman. Check in : jan 24 '16. Check out jan 28 '16. The room was very clean. Neat and spacious. Perfect for family with an active toddler like me.

6. Reservation
Mr. Fian. Answer every question very nicely, polite and details. He helped me a lot. Thank you very much Mr. Fian.

But after all the great stuffs.. There was one thing that really annoys me...
Masih terdapat salah satu staff pool resto/pool bar yang (sorry to say) ""BULE MINDED"". She seemed very nice to foreigners but not to me. I dont remember her name.. But she has a long hair.
Some of her low point :
- menjelaskan seperlunya dan terkesan malas just because im a local tourist
- no smile
- no greetings, no thank you
- not offering help.
I mean come on... It's hospitality business.. Attitude seperti itu harusnya sudah tidak ada lagi di hotel sekelas courtyard by marriott..

Selebihnya... Really a lovely experience to stay with courtyard by marriott..."
2921,Exceptional!,50,January 2016,"Stayed a night here to explore what Seminyak had to offer and had no regrets. I was welcomed into the hotel with exceptional service. The room was clean and well-maintained and had a great view of the pool from a private balcony. Well-located, the hotel is a short walking distance from the beach, shops, bars and restaurants. The pool is nice with access to the bar. And not forgetting, the breakfast buffet by Courtyard Marriott is one of the best I have ever had. Definitely would recommend Courtyard Marriott to anyone visiting Seminyak."
2922,"Amazing service, great location and nice hotel",40,March 2016,"We've just returned from a 2 night stay and we had a lovely time at the Marriott Courtyard.
The hotel is within easy reach of the airport and a 5 min walk from the beach, around the hotel there are nice places to eat as well as the usual Street markets.
The Balinese hospitality is amazing and we were really well looked after during our stay and I cannot speak highly enough of all the service we received from check-in to check-in.
I was slightly disappointed with the spa, although the treatment was amazing, you can hear all the noise from the pool bar including the loud music, plus it's a very basic spa with treatment rooms, no relaxation rooms or steam room facilities.
We booked a 1 bedroom suite and although the room was nice, I still found this quite small as we're a family of four.
The only other downside is the limited choice of food, there's the pool bar and Seminyak kitchen and the menus are similar at both including the usual satay, fish and chips or nasi goreng, there's limited choice for vegetarians.
All in all a pleasant place to stay in Seminyak."
2923,Just splendid!,50,February 2016,"Upon arrival, smiles are abundant.
Could not of asked for a more pleasant venue to relax and be spoilt.
Only a five hour flight from Melbourne.
Security is excellent and thorough...
We will most certainly be returning!!!"
2924,Simply the best,50,February 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights in February. Because we are Platinum members, we were upgraded to a suite. It was one of the best suites we have probably ever had. One of the best reasons for stay at this hotel, is that every day when you come back from excursions, you will feel like you're back in America! If we were ever to come back to Bali, we would definitely return here! Also, the breakfast buffet was one of the single biggest and most diverse breakfast buffets we have ever had. We got it for free as Platinum members. Also, the gym is decent and was never crowded. The pool looks really nice, but we didn't fly all the way to Indonesia to sit in the pool. The service was great there's an ATM on site and it is just the best. Also, the massages are very inexpensive and my wife really liked hers."
2925,Just what we needed,30,February 2016,"On our recent visit to Bali, we wanted to spend 2 nights in Seminyak, to explore the restaurants etc before going to a resort in Nusa Dusa. We decided to try this hotel as it was new and central. Courtyard Marriott did not disappoint, it met all our expectations. Welcoming friendly service, new, clean, comfortable, great breakfast and central to all the places that we wanted to visit. We had two interleading rooms on the ground floor, which was great as it was also easy access to the pools, although not direct access to the pools, in other words, the water does not come upto your patio. You have to cross the pathway and sun chairs before reaching the pool.
We did find the rooms were not very spacious ( a bit snug)and the bathrooms only had showers and no bathtubs, however for our 2 night stay and the fact that we were out in Seminyak, exploring most of the time, felt that Courtyard was perfect for what we needed."
2926,The best of Balinese hospitality,50,February 2016,"We stayed here for 11 nights which might seem a long time to be hanging around Seminyak but the staff here have made it nigh impossible for us to contemplate another Balinese hotel.

Impossibly friendly and helpful, they took a genuine interest in us and the other guests about recommending and suggesting things for us to do. In the end, we did a lot of nothing but lounging around the pool and a couple of days of shopping - just the kind of escape my husband and I needed from our everyday stress-filled lives.

The hotel guests were a good mix of young and old alike - we were concerned that there would be endless amounts of loud music blaring from the pool since we were given a room with a pool view but were assured that the music (they had 'live' music playing every night) would end at 8. I'm glad we took that room because the view was pleasant and the noise was really minimal. In the evenings when the music was playing, we sometimes sat outside in the balcony and enjoyed the evening without ever having to step out.

All facilities felt new and well-maintained. Our rooms were thoroughly cleaned everyday and we often returned to 'towel art' on our freshly-made bed. We've had swans, an elephant and a duck. Cute!

The pool was warm so not as refreshing as we would have liked after sitting under an umbrella for 30-60 minutes but this is the tropics and warm water is inevitable.

There are some activities to be had in the hotel throughout the day - Aqua aerobics, yoga, Pilates, kids club, cooking classes - so something for everyone if you are so inclined.

Breakfast never got very boring even after 12 days and the staff there are all wonderful. A particular shout-out to Arta whom we would have a regular morning chat with. Thank you to all at Seminyak Kitchen for taking care of us!

Location-wise, it's about 7 minutes to the beach and 10 minutes to Jalan Seminyak. Could it have been more central? Yes but they do have a golf cart at your disposal in the daylight hours should you need a ride. We did use it fairly frequently just because the Balinese heat and humidity is absolutely killer!

What would I change? Not a thing really. Perhaps they could run more promotions on their food for lazy 'ol guests like us who are oftentimes too lazy to go out for dinner. Aside from that, it'd been a wonderful stay with them.

Thanks once again for the hospitality! We hope to see you again next year!"
2927,Why would you even leave the hotel?,50,February 2016,"Stayed here Feb 22 - 24 and it was INCREDIBLE. The rooms were clean and well furnished. The exterior / gardens / pool, etc. were all phenomenal. The on-site restaurant, Seminyak Kitchen was amazing as was the breakfast. Highly recommend and will absolutely stay here for sure on my next trip to Bali."
2928,Top quality service,50,February 2016,"We spent 9 nights at the Coutryard Marriott and cannot praise the service highly enough.

Two friends sharing a room with twin beds was easy due to the size of the room.

The pool viewed from most rooms is sectioned into 4 areas. One with the pool bar and a couple of ""toddler"" size rooms. We spent a lot if time in the pool and with the press of a call button was able to revive pool side food and beverages.

The breakfast budget was an absolute feast with so many choices even the fussiest of eaters would find something to eat.

Shuttle service anytime you ask up to the main Seminyak ""eat street"" and close to the beach and plenty of eateries nearby.

My last day was spent. Early unwell and that was when we saw amazing service. From calling a local doctor, extending our check out so I could continue resting until our flight departed and even having the kitchen prepare some rice porridge because they thought that might help. I cannot thank them enough.

This hotel and all of the staff come highly recommended."
2929,Outstanding,50,February 2016,"Beautiful place, truly an outstanding place. So clean,,, close to the beach ,,, close to shopping ,, the breakfast buffet was so amazing ,,, I would recommend this place to everyone ,,, the help get 5 stars for being friendly and so helpful ,,, Kudos to you , Marriott hotel :)"
2930,Consistently great,40,February 2016,"Spent five nights here for a relatives 40th. Great pool, really friendly and efficient staff, very clean and huge breakfast selection. Stayed in a poolside King terrace suite. Very roomy. Pool gets busy, but if you are on the ground floor you can hang on your terrace."
2931,Luxurious but very touristy,50,January 2016,"I enjoyed a free night here using Marriott points. Room and hotel are what one would expect of a 5 star place, including a bar with in-pool stools. It is just that is is light years away from the essence of Bali, which I concede is hard to find anywhere along Kuta-Seminyak beach. But if one likes to be knee deep in western tourists and pay the fancy rates, this could be a place for you. Facilities are first class, staff is friendly , the pool is wonderful but the hotel is located a bit far from the beach. I advise using their free shuttle to get there rather than walk it. Shops and several restaurants in the immediate vicinity.
Absolutely nothing wrong with the place, just that I prefer to stay in places where I can get more in touch with the local people and culture."
2932,"Good, not quite great",40,February 2016,"We booked our trip for just a week in February. Easy checkin process and it was impressive from the start that as it was raining, they had a number of rainy weather activities.

Great walking access to Seminyak Beach (or a hotel golf buggy ride), and good selection of eating spots in the same street. Bonus was having a mini mart right across the road for water, snacks etc. Hotel is within walking distance to Raya Seminyak where Bintang Supermarket etc is, and to spots lime Ku De Ta via the beach. Eat Street proper (Ultimo, Char Char) also in walkimg distance, just.

Rooms are good size with a couple of comments: no clothes horse to hang wet clothes/togs, only a very small hand rail, so wet clothes must be hung over the balcony. Toilet is within the bathroom and has a lovely see through glass door, which prevents you from any privacyif someone else is usimg the shower. Plenty of electicity outlets and an alarm clock with iPhone/bluetooth capability. Good sized in room safe (big enough for a DSLR camera case plus more).

Room service menu is limited (the pool bar menu is bigger!!) but good serves. Buffet breakfast is huge and if you can't find anything to your likimg you're hard to please. Everything from bagels and smoked salmon to donuts, the usual suspectslike scrambled eggs plus waffles and ice cream. Great selection of local and Asian cusine, as well as fruit.

Drinks are subject to the usual Bali 'sin tax' with a Bloody Mary setting you back AUD $15 once you take into account the ++ taxes.

Pool set up is great with practically all rooms overlookimg the pool. The poolisno more than 1.5m deep which is good for all. Ther is also a kiddies pool at thr southern end.

Zanti, the inhouse spa, is great, though located too close to the pool bar so you might get that noise.

Overall a good hotel which could have a few little improvements."
2933,Decent location walking distance to many restaurants,30,March 2015,"Hotel and room were nicely decorated. Close to restaurants within walking distance. Beach was walking distance, but this beach area needed some tlc as it had plenty of litter. Good enough for enjoying a cocktail on the beach. Morning breakfast was nice, but very crowded every morning"
2934,"Great value, new hotel",40,May 2015,"This beauty is in an excellent location. Walking distance to Seminyak beach and the shops. Perfect for families (especially if you can get a suite with a connecting room), the staff are caring, helpful and happy to help out with anything you need. I had a highchair brought to my room, things put into the microwave for me and a cot put in the connecting room. Kids club is fun for older kids, the three pools allow you space to feel alone or part of a group. Nice gym and relaxing massages."
2935,Fabulous.....,50,February 2016,"Everything about this hotel and the staff I cannot praise highly enough.
My daughter and I stayed here for 10 nights (8 of which were booked with the luxury escape deal, excellent value for money)
Special mention of a few staff that stood out (Cinta and Fitri in the pool lounge area & Bayoe from concierge who drove the complimentary buggy to Eat st several times during our stay.
But all staff were excellent in all areas!
We had a massage ( included in package ) and wasn't sure what to expect, it was the best we had while staying in Seminyak .....and we had one every day outside of the hotel.
The rooms while small are beautifully appointed and housekeeping great.
The only downside is there is not enough storage space (very small negative).
Breakfast options were endless and could not be faulted.
Food around pool and in restaurant also very good, the few times we ate there. Great ap you can download on to your i phone poolside which enables you to order meals drinks etc or if you prefer just press the buzzer, very efficient.
A great choice for us this trip.
We usually stay in traditional Balinese hotels so quite different from what we are used to. But would definitely recommend this hotel ......
Excellent !!"
2936,Fantastic resort,50,February 2016,"Do yourself a favour and book a stay here. Absolutely fantastic from the moment you arrive. The security is high and you feel very safe. The staff are incredible, the food is delicious (and very reasonably priced). Highly recommended."
2937,Disappointing customer servixe,20,January 2016,"I stayed at the Courtyard for 5 days on a trip with friends. Unfortunately, there were issues both with check in and check out. Check in was disorganised, rooms not ready, all of us left waiting for an hour and rooms that were booked (eg. 1 bedroom suite) not actually available. Credit/reimbursement was offered, which was appreciated. Unfortunately on check out, the offered credit was denied and myself and companions accused of fabricating the offered credit, and delayed in checking out and catching our flight. Disappointing customer service when you are expecting smooth check in and check out. Also note, rooms can be noisy as they are all facing at pool area, with music playing there most of the day. Nice breakfast and grounds, unfortunate that reception staff were not more professional or customer oriented."
2938,‚ÄúLuxury Beautiful Hotel in the Best Location Ever‚Äù,50,January 2016,"This is a Luxury beautiful Hotel located in Seminyak Bali. Simply Walking distance from everywhere. Shopping, Beaches, Tons of excellent restaurant. I loved staying at this hotel. Everything was just great. Breakfast Buffet is quite good with a good selection from Indian cuisine. Staff is extremely helpful all the time. Overall experience is superlative and i suggest its best hotel to stay with in BALI.

Thank you Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak and all the staff for their Great Hospitality."
2939,"Good place, convenient, and westernised area",40,February 2016,"Rooms are smaller as expected like most marriott hotels. The pool is nice but isn't the biggest or roomiest. There are heaps of people in the hotel at the one time so the pool can be crowded.

Service is exceptional and everyone is very friendly and willing to help.

I would prefer the bathroom doors to be frosted or at least sound proof.

The area is convenient and walking distance to most shops and food places but this area is extremely commercialised. So if you are looking for more of a cultural place, stay in a different area like Ubud.

But overall, a good experience and would come back again."
2940,Fantastic holiday,50,February 2016,"We bought the Luxury Escapes voucher for 8 nights. Amazing value for money, will be looking out for it again!
The hotel is amazing - from the great sized room (there were 4 of us in it!), gorgeous pool, fantastic buffet breakfast, to the helpful and super pleasant staff. We d t want to leave!
Super location..."
2941,Very relaxing,40,December 2015,"A very relaxing experience. My only complaint is that this is completely westernised so if you are looking for a more local/cultured experience, then you are in the wrong place. The bar pool is quite good, especially during happy hour."
2942,Fantastic location and friendly staffs,50,February 2016,"It is situated at a very convenient location with massage spa, supermart, restaurants, eateries, pubs, shops, telephone top up and 24 hours minimart.

Superb security with sniffing dog and airport scan machine. They have a buggy to send you to the beach or restaurants nearby. Friendly staffs from all levels of management.

Great spread of breakfast.

Would be even better if they could secure a private portion of the beach for hotel guests."
2943,Highly Recommend!,50,February 2016,"We loved our stay at the Courtyard Semniyak. We were so impressed by the excellent service. I would highly recommend a stay in the hotel.

The facilities are very clean and spacious. The courtyard faces inward to a beautiful pool and lounge area.

The breakfast is amazing - a selection of Indonesian, Indian & Western breakfast options. Fresh fruit and juices every morning. The variety and quality are unmatched by anything else we tried.

My first day I tried a Balinese massage at the hotel spa. The prices are very reasonable and the service incredible. I would highly recommend a massage with Annie. We tried another spa during our time, there was no comparison with the quality of the massage. The facilities are spotless.

As a platinum Marriott members we enjoyed an upgrade to a spacious suite. We appreciate all of the efforts made by management to accommodate us during our stay.

The hotel is walking distance to the beach, a great way to enjoy the sunset.

Also, this hotel was very safe and secure. On site security screens vehicles entering the property.

If you are in Semniyak, plan a stay at the Courtyard Marriott."
2944,Great family outing,50,February 2016,We're in Bali frequently and wanted a moderately priced hotel near the city center so we could host visiting family from the US. This is perfect. Very nice pool in the middle of the courtyard. The restaurant overlooks the pool offering a very wide selection for western and Asian tastes. Just a few minutes to the beach with a private section.
2945,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,February 2016,This is the best hotel that I have ever been. The hotel is so beautiful as well as the staff and service. The service of all staff are so consistent and excellent. All the staff are so helpful and attentive. The location is convenient and hotel provides buggy service to nearby mall. It's really amazing and I will definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Bali.
2946,A veracious Hospitality modern hotel,50,January 2016,"I recently visited Bali for my honeymoon and luckily happened to stay at CY by Marriott Bali Seminyak.
To start with, we were picked up at the airport by the Courtyard Marriott chauffeur with my name on a placard visible easily. He drove us to the hotel very safely keeping in mind our comfort zone inside the car.
Hotel is located in a close proximity of the main market and seminyak beach.
We were warmly welcomed at the main porch by the security staff and were given a welcome flower too. Our luggage was taken care by the bell boy, meanwhile we were escorted to the front desk and were assisted for check in.
A nice pool view room with a king bed was given to us and guess what awaits inside our room was a wine bottle along with a cake. We were completely astonished and overwhelmed by now.
Our rooms were very nicely done.
The room also had a private balcony and huge bathroom.
We thoroughly enjoyed the pool bar during that day.
Next day a huge and lavish breakfast spread awaits you at the coffee shop.
We were full energized after that. Each and every staff member at the coffee shop was hospitable.
In the evening we enjoyed the Spa in the hotel which is also a must visit.
Overall, i would strongly recommend every traveler to Bali should must stay at Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak.
Thank you."
2947,Good value and best of beach and shopping,40,February 2016,"I stayed with family including a child and seniors during Chinese New Year. It is worth paying for the 1br suite if you have a family of three with reasonable additional cost for extra bed. Much roomier and choose a high floor with pool views. Hotel buggy will take you to the beach which is 5min away. Lots of shops outside the hotel and taxi ride to main road peppered with eclectic designer shops cost ard rp15k per trip by bluebird metered taxi. There are 2 main pools so spacious. Cocktails and snacks by the pool are delicious. Buffet breakfast offers sufficiently wide spread. Service is very good. You feel they are trying to meet your needs and they do not say no to a request! I would recommend the hotel for its value, service, quality of rooms and amenities and accessibility. Worth a visit and re-visits."
2948,Great Place,50,January 2016,"Great place to stay, tasty food and wonderfull staff. the pool was
the highltight of this hotel.
staff were very friendly, rooms are very clean
location is just perfect for my young family.
away from all the busy streets but close to all the aminites"
2949,"Secure, friendly & affordable.",50,January 2016,"As the hotel is new most problems seem to have been ironed out. Location just 5 minutes walk to the beach is perfect for walking to all the best shops, restaurants etc. The staff especially housekeepers are great, even leaving towel animals on the bed. Swim up bar was a bonus as well as nightly happy hour drinks. The breakfast food selection is awesome and caters for all tastes. Security screening on entrance is good for your mind. My only negative is to avoid any room number ending in 63 as they are opposite the housekeeping storeroom which gets a bit noisy around 7.30am but is not really too much to bare."
2950,Great hotel and location,50,February 2016,"Great hotel and location. We stayed here for 4 nights and loved the hotel. Staff are really friendly and genuine. Pool is lovely and the swim up bar is great. Happy hour is 5-7pm and cocktails are 50,000 rupiah.... Try the Seminyak colada - delicious!! Tried yoga in the morning at 7am which was great ... Very relaxing, appropriately challenging and great instructor.

Great breakfast with loads of fresh food and choice. Freshly cooked waffles with caramel sauce and ice cream ... Not very healthy but delicious! Great variety of western and Asian food -croissants, bagels, bacon, sausage, egg station to cook eggs as you wish, loads of fresh fruit and juice options etc etc. Only negative was breakfast staff trying to get us to book taxis from their friends - you get this all day when you're on the street and don't want to be asked about getting a taxi when in the hotel."
2951,An oasis in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak Bali,40,February 2016,"The room was your typical hotel room, it failed with a couple of stains on the furniture but nothing to drastic. the buffet breakfast was excellent and covered most cultures. As for the staff they are excellent very friendly and go out of their way to help. In this day and age people all over the world are a bit on edge after some incidents, the Courtyard Marriott hotel excellent security for people entering the hotel, allowing guests to relax and enjoy the hotels amenities, that included free popcorn in the foyer."
2952,Excellent value for families,40,September 2015,"Friendly resort style hotel, great pools and rooms. Excellent breakfast. Central location. Great pool bar and cocktails. Poolside entertainment, live music and got to see the Aussie rules grand final pool side. Recommended..."
2953,Fantastic holiday,50,February 2016,"We are staying at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak at the moment and what an amazing hotel this is. The staff are absolutely beautiful throughout the hotel, the pool is magnificent, the breakfasts are to die for, the beds and pillows the rooms everything about this hotel is magnificent.
Will definite stay here again.
Love the pool mattresses as well brilliant idea"
2954,Family of four had fabulous stay,40,January 2016,"My family(Husband and 2 boys aged 12 and 14) stayed at the Marriott in the first week of January 2016. We stayed in a two bedroom suite on the top floor. Great for our size family - and plenty of floor space if you needed to fit a trundle in the lounge. The hotel was fabulous. The rooms are large, tasteful, clean and well appointed. The beds were comfortable and the balcony was large. I probably would have preferred to have a table and chairs outside and a larger couch in the living room - but not a major issue.

The staff were all friendly, helpful and quick to act. This included all staff, whether they were on reception, cleaning our room or round the pool.

The Breakfast was nice and my boys loved the variety and volume!

The pool is large, was never crowded and unlike a lot of pools in Bali - it was a nice temperature. Each evening they had live music around the bar.

We also felt really safe and secure - which was really nice with boys our age as it meant we could pop down the street without them and not be worried.

The only negatives I had was
- people hogging the sun chairs ( the hotel has signs up - but guests ignored it)
- the hotel could be anywhere - it does not have a strong Bali feel
- the location is great -but it would have been nice to be on the beach.
To be honest none of these issues are really the hotels fault and I largely comes down to personal preference."
2955,Maintained the name as great hotel,50,February 2016,"One night stayed between connecting flights. Nice hotel, comfort bed, tight security give you secured sleep.The breakfast served with a lot of choices. Form airport is 30 minutes travel in not heavy traffic."
2956,Fantastic Stay,40,December 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard for 6 nights over New Years.

Fantastic hotel, large comfortable bed with fantastic clean and comfortable linen, big shower with bench, super cool air con, very clean. We had pool access room upon check in we discovered we had been allocated a room, in front of the kids pool and beside the kids club not ideal when you are on a romantic holiday and do not have kids, however the staff we obliging and after 1 night we were moved to a room in the middle of the pool on the side perfect location.

Whilst the pool is large it did get extremely crowded and you could not get a sunlounger after 9am, there are signs everywhere to say 30 minutes and that staff will move belongings but I never saw this happen and in fact one day when I was by the pool majority of the day I saw sun loungers sit empty for hours whilst guests were not even in the resort. This needs to be better policed. Pool was quite warm also during our stay so not overly refreshing but we found that everywhere I think it was more due to the time of the year.

Being the busy time of the year the pool was constantly busy and full of people happy hour was very much party time, and I was quite put off by the amount of people in the swim up pool area who did not leave the pool for the entire 4 hours of happy hour. I can only assume how much pee was floating about with all the bintangs being consumed.

If you are looking for a relaxing quite hotel I don't think you would enjoy the atmosphere in this hotel as its very much music, drinks alot of drunks in the pool.

Loved all the extras like the fruit icy poles whilst you are swimming in the pool, free ice cream, fairy floss and popcorn at reception. And the reception staff are lovely always smiling and happy to offer advice or assistance one in particular even remembering our name.

Delicious breakfast definitely in my top 5 buffet breakfasts, food always hot and constantly replenishing so much variety and love how they keep the juices in the fridge meaning you can always have a cold juice (if you want something else just ask, they will make smoothies or lattes etc), the only small complaint was that the breakfast room is hot the air con doesn't do much to cool it down. Definitelydo not recommend dinner in the Kitchen though expensive, most expensive diner we had whilst in Bali for 4 weeks and not at all enjoyable neither my partner nor I finished our meals.

There is a free shuttle to beach and start of the shops however alot of the time you are told its 30 minutes wait so we opted for taxis which are extremely cheap if you can get one on the meter. Just walk out onto the road and down a little and hail one.

My one main concern and the reason I have given 4 stars instead of 5 was the Marriott 'private beach club'. My partner and I took the shuttle and headed down to the beach club it was later in the day and we were the only ones there, the fellow manning the beach club was starting to pack everything up as I think it was close to closing time. We were swarmed with local beach ladies, they surrounded our chairs 6 of them and would not leave trying to grab our feet for pedicures and rub our shoulders, they kept telling my partner you buy something we leave it was extremely overwhelming I looked over to the guy manning the booth hoping for some assistance in getting them to leave the 'roped off private beach club area' he just laughed. We ended up purchasing a few things we did not want just to get some peace and quiet the whole experience was quite scary. The ladies then told me they were friends with the guy working for Marriott! after they got our money they stayed for some time talking and laughing with him. I would only assume he got some kind of commission share from the ladies.
I do not believe this was appropriate and it stopped us from returning again to the beach."
2957,Wonderful Hotel !!,50,May 2015,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Seminyak the Marriott was a truly magnificent place to stay. The breakfast (as well as the restraint in general) was delicious and some of the best food I had during my trip. The pool was also just completely amazing. Within walking distance of great bar, clubs, restraunts, and a nice beach."
2958,Service and Quality Beyond Measure,50,November 2015,"I've never given a review before and this hotel is the single reason why I've decided to start.

My wife and I got married during this visit to Bali, and in the months leading up to the special day we were looking for a hotel to suggest to our guests. We'd stayed here before and couldn't think of a better place to suggest after our first experience. Among many things, our selection criteria included; walking distance to the beach, swim-up bar within a large pool, close proximity to shops/bars/restaurants, a kids club, and of course all at a reasonable price. The Courtyard by Marriott provides all of this and more!

We reached out to the General Manager (Brad) for assistance considering the amount of people we needed catered for and the significance of this trip for us. Brad and his team were more than accommodating and helped coordinate all the bookings, secured a fantastic room rate, and made us all feel special.

Our stay was impacted by a volcano ash cloud that closed the airport and left many tourists stranded in Bali. What really stood out for us was the care and consideration the hotel provided to all guests during this time. From the regular airline updates, to the ease of cancellation or extension when required, the staff and management really stepped up in a tough time.

Oh... and the breakfast buffet is amazing!"
2959,Modern hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2015,"We loved staying here for the week we were in Bali. The hotel has been built recently so all facilities are clean and great! We spent heaps of time by the pool. The breakfast had such a great variety and the rooms were spacious and clean! The staff are attentive and so helpful!
If you are a couple looking to relax this may not be the best spot. The pool area can get quite loud with families but that didn't bother us too much.
They also had a function one night at the hotel and we heard the music until 1am but we had only just gotten back to the room so again it didn't bother us.
I would definitely be back!"
2960,Terrific!,50,January 2016,"My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott for four nights in January. The customer service was wonderful, arriving by myself into Bali i was greeted warmly by the driver and the service continued when I arrived at the hotel. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to many restaurants and the beach. The pool area is very big and we were always able to find a spot. We would stay here again!"
2961,Top quality!,50,December 2015,"Me and my partner stayed at the marriot over New Years, and I can not fault the hotel. From the rooms being cleaned daily to the happy smiles from the staff walking Down the hall ways, the marriot was the best place I've stayed at! The location was great with plenty of restaurants, shopping and taxis in the area. The beach is a 200m walk.
Massive buffet breakfast every morning that caters for everyone!
Plenty of sun beds and pool side bean bags to relax on. With pool side service all day. Swim up bar was a bonus as well.
They had water aerobics every afternoon which was a bit of fun too.
My only request would be to have a happy hour drink special at the pool around 5-6 :)

Can't wait to come back!"
2962,Nice hotel with friendly staff,50,October 2015,"Recently stayed here on a Luxury Escapes voucher. The staff were friendly. The property was very clean. Had a small issue with the room and the staff assisted in resolving it very quickly with a room change. The rooms are smaller than most in Bali but then again, how much time to do you stay in your room with so much to do. The pool was good and even though seating is limited, the staff are diligent in ensuring sun loungers are not being reserved. Great option to pick up a sun lounger down near the beach from the hotel also. Spa team was great and even the gym is worth a visit if you are inclined. I would stay here if you are looking for a more relaxed pace in Bali. Legian is only a 30 minute walk away if you feel active. The restaurants around the hotel are still a little limited on variety but i expect this will change with time. Check out the breakfast though, the food, the team are great. Oh and i should mention that this hotel takes security very serious so expect to have your packages checked, it may seem like a nuisance but its all about your safety and takes less than a minute."
2963,Four star,30,January 2016,"We purchased two luxury escape vouchers , we had two children so we paid for an extra bed. The rooms are very small as they have a desk in the middle of the room. This hotel is more for couples or a business trip. We tried to change our voucher after eight days to get two rooms for 4 days but they were not interestered and gave us a 40% discount on a suite which had a lounge to put the spare bed in and refunded a couple of nights on the spare bed fee. We paid extra for a food and beverage package which is not worth it because if you don't use it no refund.
They basically were only interested in getting extra money , the hotel has a contract with a china tour company dream trips which is there major clients and luxury escape. Check before you buy a luxury escape voucher because they have rooms cheaper on line , the escape voucher comes with a couple of dinners , lunches and cocktails that's the only benefit. Their breakfast food is good but the airconditioners don't work so when it gets busy it is hot. The dinner and lunch vouchers are a set menu and you can not order off the main menu.
When you arrive for breakfast the girl at the counter is so rude and bossy. This hotel is still trying to improve as the staff still need a lot of further training to meet five star rating. I think that is why they have so many discount vouchers , because we did meet many return guests. The beach section they have is a few lounges on a small section not even on the beach .
They were disappointing for a Marriot hotel and couldn't care less if your a marriot member. We will still stay at the Marriot group hotels but never at this four star and won't recommend this Hotel . The Hotel , facilities and pool are five star , the management are not up to five star standard , we left one day early but no refund and no one even made enquires why , not good customer service if you want repeat customers.
There is conditions relating to these luxury escape vouchers, but does stop the Hotel offering good customer service , we never ask for anything free just to change a one room 8day voucher to a two room 4 day voucher."
2964,Wish I was still there!,50,January 2016,"What an amazing place to stay. Everything was so perfect for us! From the friendly security guys, to front reception, to our immaculate and comfortable room, to the amazing breakfast, to the enticing pool...thank you everyone for creating such a special experience. The location was great too, not on the beach but just a short stroll away. Perfection!"
2965,Whole. Hotel,50,January 2016,"It was amazing, room excellent, staff same, couldn't been happier,
Breakfast and all other meals amazing, the Health area for massage was terrific also, I was unwell and to my surprise the The Manager of that area came to me personally to see if she could help me in anyway, so much unexpected, but so lovely, Lisa was her name what an addition to a hotel. What an addition. Thank you ,,,, would never hesitate to recommend this Hotel and we will return and recommend"
2966,Great location,40,January 2016,This hotel have a very good location !! Not far away from the beach and walking distance to the main night market and resturants !! We hire a car one afternoon to the near by waterfalls and temples !! Also the staff at the reception was very helpful and friendly to give us advise for our day trip !!
2967,Stayed here 9 days--best Courtyard ever!,50,January 2016,"I have to give rave reviews to this Courtyard! It is superbly managed with great staff, wonderful facilities & so many nice touches. As Platinum members, we realize we got a little extra great pampering, such as free Wifi, free breakfast buffet, free upgrades to suites for 9 nights, free transportation from the airport to the hotel & back again, and a manager's reception, which turned out to be great (free drinks, free appetizers & free entertainment by the astonishingly great singers Arie & Angelica (with Arie playing some of the best guitar we've ever heard, and Angelica's voice rivals Eva Cassidy's; his is sort of like Bob Seger's). They also play in the hotel bar 4 days a week (Thu-Sun.) -- well worth scheduling around. There is a great 3-level pool, with kiddie pool area, & beautiful fountains & a pool bar (swim up). There's a high-quality gym & spa (used the gym, not the spa) & good restaurant. The breakfast buffet is terrific, varied & high quality. Shashank & Melinda & John were very good in management; special shout out to Shashank. Room cleaning is thorough & fast. Laundry service is good & well priced & clothes come back nicely wrapped in clean plastic & they pick up from your room & deliver back to your room. There is a free popcorn machine & free cotton candy machine (floss) in the lobby and on rainy days, there's free hot chocolate in the lobby & free bingo & other good stuff. While it's in a very busy area, the hotel itself is very quiet & they restrict noise after 8 pm. All rooms have balconies or patios & we loved our balconies. The transportation to and from the airport was in an air-conditioned van with massage seats for all of us, nice after long flights! :) On arrival, we were given cool wipes & fruit juice & iced fruit pops. There are lots of shops & restaurants nearby. The hotel van is also available for rental with a driver for a reasonable fee for the day. Security is excellent; everything you carry will be scanned on entering not only the first time but every time you return to the hotel. You will go through a metal detector every time. But we never had lines or a wait & it is nice to know that they take security seriously. We never felt unsafe here or in the area around the hotel. The beach is gorgeous -- very long & wide & clean, great for taking a long walk. It's a short hop from this excellent hotel. We wholeheartedly recommend it & would stay here again in a heartbeat. We hated leaving & felt sad. The Balinese people are incredibly warm & friendly & smiley & all the staff was great! This IS the best Courtyard we've ever stayed in, and we've stayed in a lot of them along with lots of Renaissance Marriotts, Marriott hotels, Marriott resorts & other categories. I think it is easily as nice as or nicer than most of the Renaissance hotels we've visited."
2968,"Excellent hotel, Amazing people",50,September 2015,"Stayed here with family. We were treated with sincere hospitality without any faking from the start until we departed after 3 nights. They were very professional and were ready to correct their mistakes and acknowledge when pointed out and went an extra mile to serve customers. Overall, it was one of the most unforgettable stays all over the world. The pool was clean and child friendly. There was a children's club were we can leave kids for hours as they were entertained with activities. The beach was nearby and we used the free buggy service to and fro to the beach. The hotel car was also reasonable. We are longing to get back to Bali just for their hospitality! There was free popcorn for children round the clock and a welcome drink at check in. The breakfast buffet was the best in terms of variety and service. The Chef personally went around asking for opinion. They also prepared vegetarian food specially for us."
2969,A second visit did not disappoint.,50,January 2016,"We had stayed previously at the Marriott 12 months prior. It is still an excellent venue in the south Seminyak area of Bali. Rooms are comfortable and spacious, with quality bed linen and bathroom accessories. The hotel restaurant serves one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in Bali with quality food, that is well presented. The pool area now contains many more lounges which was a shortcoming from our previous visit. We also made use of the gym, which though small is adequate. We were also invited to use the gym showers prior to our late afternoon departure. Staff were helpful and proactive to our needs. A good place to stay!"
2970,A very ordinary start ... But it was all up hill from there,40,January 2016,"We arrived about 5pm after travelling all day and after waiting in a lengthy queue at reception, we were told ""sorry your room isn't ready"" - what? Isn't check in a couple of hours ago?

We had to wait until about 6.30pm before we could get into our room and we weren't the only ones - on talking to other guests, several others had the same experience. The ""we are very busy at the moment"" excuse just doesn't cut it - needless to say I was not happy, I asked for discount on the first days rate since I wasn't getting what I had paid for - ""sorry that's not possible""

We were literally told to sit and wait in reception and they would tell us when our room was ready. We weren't feeling very happy about the situation so rather than sitting there fuming while we waited we went and bought ourselves a couple of drinks at the pool bar so we could chill out and relax and get the holiday started.

When we finally got to our room things improved. We had a pool access room and it was lovely. Clean, comfortable and a great bathroom. Good aircon and great rain shower. The room was a little tight for luggage storage but apart from that it was very nice.

We probably wouldn't choose this type of hotel (ie lots of kids) with a central pool if it were just my husband and I as we prefer a little more peace and quiet these days but we were meeting up with our daughter, son in law and granddaughter to spend a week together. They opted for a suite which was very spacious and also lovely except for the very stained soft furnishings. It showed that this type of room accommodated families with children and for a newish hotel the seats were actually pretty grubby. They also got a kit Kat out of their bar fridge as they arrived late and the little one was hungry so while they waited for room service they went to give her the chocolate and when they opened it found it was completely mouldy - yuk - we expect more from a 4 star hotel.

For some reason we only had one tea cup and one glass in our room for the whole stay - Really??

My husband kept leaving a tip and a note with an arrow pointing to the cup hoping for another one - the cleaner took the tips but never left another cup LoL - we also left 50000 tip on the bed each day and our room was kept immaculately apart from being a cup and a glass short.

Having said that - in many respects It is a great family hotel and we spent many happy hours in and around the pool with our little 5 yo granddaughter. She also enjoyed the kids club and made some little friends. We found the other guests very friendly and the place had a nice vibe.

Breakfast was really very good with a huge amount of choice - we follow a paleo diet and found enough options (which isn't always easy when travelling) and staff were very friendly and accommodating, both in the restaurant and around the pool. The rest of our week was relaxing and we enjoyed the pool and the beach club. We couldn't fault the service for the rest of our stay.

Our flight home was at 12.40am so we had booked an extra night as we didn't want to be hanging around for 12 hours after check out time and it meant we could go back to our room and shower and pack after dinner - when we went down at around 9pm to check out we were offered a complimentary shuttle to the airport to apologise for not having our room ready on check in. We appreciated the unexpected gesture from the hotel (because by that stage after a great week we had forgotten about the rocky start) and well done to them for sending us away happy."
2971,Luxury Escape Deal,40,January 2016,"We bought an 8 night deal from Luxury Escape and it was worth its value!!
Great location only door step away from beach, shopping and some great restaurants and bars.
All staff made a genuine warm welcome when we arrived. We had some issues with our room and it was dealt with straight away!! The room are little small for deluxe pool size though the bed was comfy and bathroom clean so we didn't mind.
Happy hour from 5pm till 8pm was amazing listening to beautiful live music while relaxing in the water!! If you are going to stay there you must try the chicken schnitzel burger!! Yummy!!!
The hotel was never short on staff alway happy to help amazing service!!!
Thank you Marriott Courtyard Seminyak for a lovely holiday!!"
2972,Our home in paradise Bali,50,January 2016,"We stayed here during our trip in Bali and we could have not picked a better place. We got an upgrade, which landed us in a great suite with pool view - for which we were very grateful. This really was our home for the nine days we were in Bali. The elaborated security checks really make us feel very safe here. There is a convenient private beach section, the room was always clean and neat, pool was great - the pool bartender makes some great mean cocktails ;) - enjoyable live music every night, breakfast buffet was delightful and of course kudos to the amazing staff for being so kind, friendly and helpful!"
2973,Pure luxury and great location,50,January 2016,"Stayed just for three nights as a long weekend getaway and had absolutely fabulous time. Book directly through the Marriott hotel website - they guarantee best rates (yep, better than Expedia or Booking.com etc) and you can cancel without penalty right up to the last minute

Enjoy happy hour in the pool bar, lazy days by the pool and the gym has great facilities too - free weights, weight training machine, treadmills, cross trainers, foam rollers, skipping ropes

Close to great restaurants too - only a short taxi ride away. Make sure you only get a taxi that uses the meter, otherwise they overcharge you. Just say ""meter"" when you get in the taxi"
2974,"Great hotel, great location, great pool... Bliss",50,January 2016,"This us one of those hotels that you love from the moment you arrive. Warm friendly greetings, quick access to your room, great location, only minutes from the beach, and adjacent to shops, restaurants and nightlife.

Close enough to Kuta and Legion, but far enough away that it provides a peaceful ambience.

Rooms are comfortable, bathrooms beautiful, cable tv with 60 odd channels, and the Buffett breakfast is amazing! Nothing us too much trouble in the restaurant, and the wide range of breakfast items is the best I gave seen in any hotel. Aircon in room is delightful, necessary in the warm climate.

Take the free shuttle to Seminyak Square for an incredible array of restaurants and shopping, or walk to the beautiful beach for some tanning or just enjoy yourself around the pool, with a reasonably priced pool bar.

Free popcorn and candy floss during the day are another delightful treat for the young and young at heart!

Get used to security with full airport like security every time you enter the hotel, with all bags xrayed.

Easy access to taxis at the front door, which will cost you between $3 and $5 into Kuta. There is also the Bintang supermarket about 500 metres away offering a wide range of essentials, or you can use the mini marts nearby, but check your receipt and change.

Overall, great hotel - you'll enjoy your stay."
2975,Relaxing stay at a well run hotel,40,January 2016,"Excellent customer service from Marriott through booking to checkin to ordering poolside Martinis. Marriott offers a price match offer on their website where they will beat an advertised price by 25% if another website is cheaper than booking with them directly. I contacted them to request this on the Expedia rate of about $165 AUD per night, and they promptly responded with an offer of a booking of about $125 per night (including taxes).

Service was always prompt and efficient: Upon arriving in a taxi which the security team thoroughly inspected (inside, boot, under bonnet and under car). Luggage was x rayed before proceeding in hotel. Check in was smooth and efficient with a welcome cold towel. Poolside, staff responded quickly to the electronic buzzers and delivered food and drink quickly. Bar staff were very willing to create drinks not listed (request a strawberry dacquiri and you won't be disappointed!).

Pool area was fantastic, although get in fast to reserve a sun lounge. Water is warm, sun lounges comfortable and well shaded by umbrellas. The hotel leaves some large floating cushions in the pool which are a delight to float around on. There are also some novelty pool floats for hire. I travelled in Australian school holidays (and the vast majority of guests sounded like Australians) which did mean some noise from children playing around, but I imagine outside this time the pool area would be quite serene.

Breakfast was a good buffet assortment of juices, cut up fruits, cereals, indonesian food, indian food, ice cream, waffles, toast, bagels, eggs etc.

Room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed. Flat screen tv with around 40 channels, a good selection of toiletries (including toothbrush & toothpaste), waterfall shower, bathrobe & slippers, quiet air conditioning, heavy curtains.

Well located and easy walking distance to a variety of bars, restaurants, beauty parlours, shops etc.

Stayed for just 3 nights and would happily return."
2976,Best place to stay in Seminyak,50,January 2016,"This was our second visit at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak, Myself , Husband and 2 children. The rooms are fantastic and clean. Best beds and pillows. The service is very prompt and very friendly. The location is perfect, mini supermarket across the street, markets and day spas along street with Beach 2 mins down the road. I love the high security at hotel too. Theres 2 huge pools with pool bar which we loved. Kids had fun with some water activites and the Gym. Loved the restaurant at hotel, food is delicious and fresh. The staff are so professional and friendly especially Adi (food & Beverage Manager) Hari , Hendri and Maria (pa swim up pool Bar) Donni,Jul, Dewi (restaurant) Bagus, Laura and Maria at Lobby Reception. Room Service Fahur who brought me a bunch of fresh flowers in my room. Cant remember everyones name but simply brilliant service. Very sad to leave. Highly recommend and we are already planning our next trip there for a 3rd time! Thank you for making our stay enjoyable and memorable!!"
2977,Great & Easy Stay!,50,December 2015,"My brother and I stayed here for three nights and had a great time. We were upgraded to a pool access room on the ground floor and had our own little patio that led to the main pool. The staff was very helpful and our room included free breakfast which was awesome. While the weather wasn't the best (that is what we get for visiting during the rainy season) I really enjoyed hanging out by the pool. This hotel has a beach club and they will take you in a golf cart if youd like. It is also a very easy walk. While there were a lot of other guests we never felt like it was crowded and never had any issues finding a spot by the pool, restaurant, or bar.

Overall the hotel was very nice and new. Had a great time and would definitely recommend it/stay here again.

All in all this is a very family friendly hotel. It was not a party scene."
2978,Hot hot hot,50,January 2016,"The hotel was fantastic! The rooms were beautiful, clean & updated. The pool was fantastic & the restaurant was very good. The staff was amazingly friendly, accommodating and very helpful when we were trying to book some excursions. The location was perfect, right in the heart of Seminyak. The hotel also has a shuttle to their small area on the beach where they have chairs for the hotel guests. They also have a shuttle to go to a different part of Seminyak.
We would definitely stay here again & I would recommend this hotel to everyone."
2979,Nice stay in the city,30,December 2015,looks new. Breakfast was very good. The chef made sure I got something vegetarian to try out of my liking. The beds were nice. We got a pool view . The only problem was they had some music playing till late night which got a lil difficult to sleep. Never used the hotel ammenities as we were out all the time. Very close to the main shopping and night life.
2980,Fantastic Xmas stay,50,December 2015,"Wow! A credit to this hotel & staff at Christmas time. We had an amazing stay. The staff are super friendly, professional & playful. The complimentary breakfasts were sooo good to start you off for the day, caters to everyones needs & tastes. The pool bar staff were very professional, especially when it came to Cocktails. Pool was fantastic, the Aquarobics was fun in the mornings, there was always some sort of activity or entertainment on the daily timetable, catered for all age groups. Our room was beautiful, facing the pool a few floors up. Clean and lovely to come back to your room after a hot day out to find the room made up, fresh linen, clean & lovely. Security was tight when entering the hotel everytime, made us feel secure & relaxed. I have been to Bali a few times and I cannot fault this hotel at all. We will be certainly staying here again. Thankyou for making our holiday relaxed, safe & comfortable!!!!!!!!!"
2981,Great stay! Amazing service,50,January 2016,"Stayed here with my mom for three nights and we had an amazing time. The service is very high quality- all the staff at the bar restaurant, pool service, spa service and breakfast is incredible. We felt very well taken care of. The breakfast offering is really quite amazing, many different options, freshly made eggs Benedict, fruit, juices, Asian style, breads etc.
The hotel is in walking distance to the beach, all the shops and nice restaurants of Seminyak. The hotel has high security check when entering the hotel which I thought was fine, very nice security guards.
The rooms are very spacious, great quality pillows and blankets.
Would highly recommend.."
2982,Fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel!,50,December 2015,"We had an amazing stay over Christmas here! The staff are uber friendly and go out of their way to help you. In particular, I noticed a member of staff run to help a lady wheel her suitcase across the garden to the lobby - really nice to see! Another day the staff went out of their way to assist a child who had slipped and grazed her knee and was making a huge commotion. (It appeared that the family insisted on getting a wheel chair for her and the staff were seen happily obliging - ridiculous, I know!! But the staff were fantastic throughout and should be commended.)

The food for breakfast & lunch (we didn't dine here for dinner) is second to none. I have never had better pool food in my life. If you order off the 'tick' sandwich/wrap menu the chef cooks everything in front of you in the pool bar. The nasi goreng is HUGE and delicious. The variety at breakfast is outstanding and there is fresh food being cooked in front of you constantly throughout.

When the hotel is busy they put extra beds in the garden, so we were never stuck for a sun lounger even when we got down late in the day. The staff came around numerous times with free ice lollies or a cold glass of water. There is also free popcorn and candy floss for the kids...and big kids! in the lobby.

Rooms are immaculate and well equipped. Free wifi throughout the hotel and it never drops.

A friend sent us over a bottle of champagne as a gift to celebrate our honeymoon, which the hotel presented beautifully along with cheeses, crackers and dessert. The hotel also provided us with a beautiful bouquet of flowers upon arrival.

Thanks CY Mariott - we will be back!!"
2983,Comfortable,40,January 2016,"Great staff. Efficient, clean, prompt. Good room service menu. Pool bar quite good. Rooms beautiful appointed. Great location: near DVDs, replica bags, clothes, sunglasses. Taxis always available. Great security ie bomb car screening and xray bay for entry"
2984,Classy,50,January 2016,"First off, let me tell you about the Seminyak Kitchen. My goodness what an awesome feed at any time of the day. Breakfast buffet includes a huge range of food including local and international styles. Lunch and dinner menu was awesome and I highly recommended the butter chicken.

Room was top notch quality and I was lucky to get a nice quiet corner of the hotel in 642.

Staff were always friendly and accommodating to any needs and felt quiet safe with the hotel security in place.

As said in previous comments, the hotel is in the middle of Seminyak with shopping in all directions. You'll find the little stores are fairly expensive so either haggle desperately or move further out maybe in Canngu."
2985,Memorable Stay,50,January 2016,"We spent 5 nights with friends ( 11 people) to celebrate a milestone birthday and had a great time throughout. The location is great, close by to the beach and they have a courtesy buggy which takes you to their reserved area and beach chairs. Their pool is excellent with a somewhat unique pool bar. Breakfast was excellent and covered lot of different cuisines. The staff particularly at the Seminyak Kitchen (their dining/breakfast area) were really very good. It was a trip not to be forgotten for a long time."
2986,Minggu and Nyssa made our stay memorable,50,November 2015,"Had a wonderful visit at Marriott, the check in was so nice. It was my birthday so the lovely lady (Nyssa) sent me a cake to my room with a handwritten postcard.
The breakfast was much better that the other hotel we stayed in in Kuta Beach. Minggu at the breakfast help me through on what i could eat since i dont eat everything.

There is shuttle bus to the beach (that isnt that far away walking either)
our room had a view over the pool which was nice.
Overall a great stay in Bali (we stayed in Ubud, Kuta and jimbaran and this was the best)"
2987,New hotel in a great location,30,December 2015,"I can see why many people would love this hotel, it's in the heart of Seminyak and a 5 minute walk to the beach. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean however more on the small side. I only stayed here for 2 nights and found it to be fine. I guess the downside is the clientele. I'm an Aussie and I found myself surrounded by other Aussies at this hotel which makes this holiday feel less international if you get my drift. Overall an ok hotel for a quick pitt stop."
2988,Very Stylish Hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2016,"We spent only 1 night stay in Courtyard Seminyak during New Year, It was a great experience. The room is very stylish and clean, everything you need is there. I personally like the upside down Christmas Tree, decorated on their lobby.

The pool is the highlight! perfect for relax, laying on the floating bag. The location is excellent, you can easily find top notch restaurant & shopping district.

Will surely be back for another vacation!"
2989,"Great hotel, close to the everything, amazing breakfast buffet and service",50,January 2016,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 8 nights and found it a fantastic place to stay. The buffet breakfasts were amazing, offering great variety. The restaurant staff were so friendly and always went out of their way to please. One chef shared with us his recipe for the delicious soto ayam and another went so far as to print us out some Indonesian phrases to help us with our Indonesian. The pool had a great vibe with a great pool bar and we loved the daily happy hour with live music every night. Great location, close to the beach and shops. We will definitely stay at the Marriott again."
2990,I will be back! 5 stars for R&R,50,January 2016,"Just spent 8 fabulous nights at the Courtyard and loved every minute. Purchased the LuxuryEscapes special anniversary deal and could not be happier.

The room was spacious and opened right onto the pool. Plenty of day beds for R&R and with pool side bar service, you've got no excuse to have cocktails in the pool! We spent our days swimming, reading, feasting on delicious food and daily massages (AU$8ph) at Angelina's Spa next door.

Could not fault the staff. They even knew how we had our coffees by day 2. Always smiling.

It was a pleasure spending my first trip to Bali with the Courtyard. Thank you."
2991,Fantastic hotel for everyone,50,January 2016,I can not find fault with this hotel. The staff are attentive it doesn't matter what department they are in they all have the same can do attitude. Nothing is too much trouble. Housekeeping went out of their way to find the perfect pillow for me. Rooms are very clean. The restaurant staff were fantastic how could you pick just one person for excellent service when every interaction with staff sees them making your day and meal the best it can possibly be. The Chef's were very accomodating to my dietary needs I am a coeliac/gluten free. Nothing was too difficult and all requests promptly delivered. Pool service is great and once again food and beverages were great.
2992,Amzing accomodation in a great location,50,January 2016,"Stayed here for 6 nights and i couldnt fault any aspect of the stay.
Even the little touches like complimentary iceblocks and water by the pool, the hotel exceeded every expectation i had.
From the amazing friendly staff to the modern spacious rooms, the experience was great and will definitely be staying here again when in Bali."
2993,"You get to sleep with your child! The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly ...",30,January 2016,"Stayed here as a family of 3 for six nights in Jan 2016.

The Good: Breakfast was fantastic. Huge quantity and great quality of Asian, English, Muesli, Omelettes, Waffles and Cakes buffet. This ranks among the top breakfast buffets of many hotels I have stayed at. Kids club is good for 3-10 year olds, and our 8 year old enjoyed it. Pool is reasonable and relaxing. Wifi worked very well and was fast.

The Bad: DID SOMEONE SAY IT WAS NOISY??? BECAUSE IT'S NOISY! Our room 580 was above the restaurant, and every morning you are woken up by heavy wooden chairs sliding back and forth, back and forth, back and forth across the floor. This lasts about 2 hours. This happens at dinner time too. Also, if you don't like listening to music from the courtyard ... tough luck, you are listening to it. The doors that face onto the balconies are sliding wooden doors that do not cut out sound. This is not a 'restful' hotel.

Sleep with your child: We booked a room for 2 adults and 1 child. Upon arriving we were given a room with one king bed. I explained the booking was for 3 people, showed a print out of the booking - but the check-in assistant insisted that we were to have a room with one bed. I asked ""Where should my child sleep?"". The reply - ""He can sleep with you"". Do you want to sleep with as husband and wife with your eight year old in the same bed?

The only suggestion the hotel could give me was: Pay an extra $60 per night for a rollout bed. Not happy about that AT ALL. The kid slept on a chair and some cushions. We even had to ask for extra linen and pillows for him, because they can't think of that themselves. On the 4th day of our stay, my wife complained and we got a rollout without extra fees ... albeit begrudgingly. Kid slept well after that.

The Ugly: I love my wife. We've been together for 10 years, so we have nothing about our bodies to hide from each other. But WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA of putting a GLASS DOOR ON THE TOILET in the rooms! I don't need to see my nearest and dearest doing their number twos. Oh ... and the door isn't sound proof either. You wanna hear machine guns firing into a basin in the morning ... ?

And thus you can see why this ""5 star"" hotel earns an objective 3 star rating.

It's not bad, but it certainly isn't the best 5 star hotel in Bali."
2994,Nice but would have preferred a private villa,40,January 2016,"We have just got back from staying at the Courtyard Marriott for 10 nights over New Years. Overall it was a relatively pleasant stay with many positives. Unfortunately there are some negative comments I need to make also.

First of all the staff are amazing, very lovely and always had a welcoming smile and ready to help us if we needed. We requested a room in a certain area of the hotel and they were very helpful in trying to accommodate us with that.

Our bed was very comfortable, and the aircon in the room was a pleasant relief after a long day out in the heat. The room was more cozier than we thought so it wasn't a great size for long stays as there wasn't much room to store our luggage. Also the big desk chair wasn't suitable for the size of the room and it made it quite difficult to get into the one wardrobe comfortably.

The other thing that annoyed me, which again is a design problem, is while they had wonderful block out blinds they then had a glass bathroom door so the light just shines through that and defeats the purpose of having block out blinds. The other thing that I do have to mention was that often our room would be filled with the smell of cigarette smoke, so I don't know whether it was people below us (even though we had the doors shut most of the time) or it was coming through the vents.

I also have to mention that the people cleaning our room and delivering mail was great however there was one particular day after receiving our letter that they hadn't closed out door properly so our door was left open the whole afternoon possibly whole day, anyone could have gone in there. I know it was probably an honest mistake but one we weren't too happy about.

The walls do seem thin so it can get a bit noisy but I didn't find it annoying most of the time and we were on the 3rd level, even New Year's Eve when I was stuck in bed with a fever from getting Bali belly the noise wasn't that annoying.
However there was one night when a group were playing in the pool until 11pm (even though the pool hours close at 9pm and we always respected the times) they were making lots of noise but when we rang and complained the staff were very apologetic and even left a sorry note with chocolates in the room the next day which was lovely.

The restaurant Seminyak Kitchen where you have breakfast is very warm and sometimes we just wanted to eat quick and go back to our room coz it was so uncomfortably warm, it would be good if it was air conditioned. But the breakfast buffet was yummy, especially the waffles, icecream and chocolate sauce which I would never have at home for breakfast but it was nice to treat myself while on holidays.

Unfortunately I can't give the same praise for the New Years Eve dinner. The restaurant was set up really well with great detail having our names on each seating place with also NYE decorations everywhere and there was a great atmosphere around the hotel. Unfortunately the food was very disappointing, we were not happy at all and this was by far the worst meal we had in the whole 10 night trip in Bali, glad we didn't have dinner there any other day. But for the $50au (500,000idr) each it was disgusting. The meat was cooked terribly, over cooked and dry. There really wasn't that much variety. There seems to be more variety at breakfast. There wasn't even much of a dessert selection and what was there didn't even look nice. I tried some ice cream and it was so soft it wasn't enjoyable at all and unlike at breakfast there was no Choc sauce or anything. I know it sounds like I'm being fussy but for the price we paid it was very disappointing as I was really looking forward to it.

On a positive note we did like the location of the Marriott. It is close to yummy restaurants our favourites Mozzarella and also Dustys. Also good massage places are close, our favourite is LV Spa across the road from the sports bar.

I've read lots of negative comments about the extra security at the Marriott but both my partner and I preferred it. We felt safe and it was never a bother having to go through the scan everytime we came in as it really didn't take much time at all and they were very lovely and welcomed us back everytime.

Even with some of the negatives thankyou for making our holiday a very enjoyable one."
2995,Clean & Comfortable Hotel at Good Location!,40,November 2015,"The hotel is located at the busy streets of Seminyak, which was very convenient for us - walking distance to beach, eateries and pubs. The area is very vibrant at night. The hotel also provide buggy car to the beach if u don't wish to walk.

The hotel staffs are friendly and smiley. The rooms are good, very clean, new and modern design. However there was one night where the cleaner forgot to replace new towels for us. The wifi connection is very fast! Thumbs up for this.

The negative points are the swimming pool and breakfast dining area. The water in the pool is not very clean - low visibility, should improve on this as the pool layout is nice, it's a waste if the water is dirty.

Breakfast spread is good, however the taste is so so, especially the egg benedict and the waffle, need to improve on those two. The dining area is also very hot, not enough ventilation and air con.

Overall this hotel is good, I would recommend my friends here."
2996,A few highlights...,40,December 2015,"I do not usually write reviews; however, I would like to mention a few people who made a difference in my stay @Courtyard.

Seminyak kitchen is lovely. I will definitely miss the fresh passion fruits, the star fruit and the infused water too. But when a warm atmosphere comes with the delicious food, it exceeds expectations. Ms. AGIK discreetly observed us during the first two days. On our 3rd day, she greeted us with a genuine smile, as usual, then she said: 'I know: two ginger teas.' Me and my mum started laughing. Most of the time the restaurant is full and the staff is always busy so how could she remember these details? Many times she anticipated our needs and she is very attentive regarding her customers' comfort (e.g. the location of the table). I noticed that guests looked so joyful when she was attending them. I don't know what she does or says, but it seems like she is spreading happiness all around the Seminyak Kitchen. Simply adorable and a beautiful personality, I hope to see her again on my next trip.

Apart from this, some upsetting and a bit stressful situations handled with care and solved with a good judgement and professionalism by Mr. MUFTAH (who would always apologize and come with a plausible excuse, even though it was obviously not his mistake; having a brilliant personality, he did not put his colleagues in a bad light) - either by himself or together with the duty manager, Mr. CINKO - both of them the kind of people one would like to see at the reception of a 5-star hotel. They had the right words and actions at any point of time.

Since these few people add a lot of value to your business and had a major impact on my decision to choose this hotel again next time, I hope you will at least extend my compliments to them because great talents should not only be recognized but also preserved. Thank you."
2997,Amazing stay,50,January 2016,"Had a great time staying at Courtyard Seminyak.. Very comfortable hotel, strategic location & very good service especially at the pool bar.. We spent hours enjoying the pool & drinks.. The room are nicely design, pool view, soft beds and great amenities.. Will definitely comeback!!"
2998,10 out of 10!,50,December 2015,"Stayed here for a week and I have to say the staff is their best asset. I have stayed in many similar or higher star rated establishments and can honestly say The Courtyard is one of the best when it comes to service. Absolutely every single staff we encountered were well trained with a very genuine smile and greeting wherever you go! It is an eye opener to see management, especially the Director of Ops, Mr Shashank Sinha, wandering around chatting to guests like old friends and handing out his card for personal contact if guests encounter any problems. He leads by example.

The hotel is new and has very modern decor. We stayed in a deluxe pool view room and our room was spacious and had a balcony with outdoor seating. The king bed and 4 pillows are very, very comfortable. The housekeeping team did a fantastic job as our room was always clean and towel supplies always right.

From what I can see most of the rooms overlook the beautiful pools. There are no shade in the swim up pool, some shade cast by the building in the middle and children pools as the day goes on. There is plenty of sun lounges with umbrellas. They even provide large floating cushions in the pool for guests to lay on. I love the fact that they establish a rule that if you vacate your sun lounge for 30 minutes or more, your towels and belongings will be cleared away to make allow other guests to use. This prevents some inconsiderate people from ""reserving"" seats.

There is pool aerobics around 11:30am everyday and you get complimentary cold water and homemade ice cream in the late morning while you laze by the pool too. What a nice touch! There is a swim up bar as well as a call button system if you are too lazy to go up to the bar to order. Even though the hotel was extremely busy, during our week there they never ran out of fresh towels at the pool!

Like all the reviews posted here the buffet breakfast is to die for! The variety is wide ranging, there are local delights, Indian dishes, the usual bake beans, sausages, hash browns, continental cold meats, salads, fruits, French pastries, egg station and even ice cream for breakfast - what more can you ask for!!! There are chefs behind the food station and they keep an eagle eye on the food and they replenish supply often so everything is freshly made, no matter what times you walked up for breakfast, nothing seems to run out! They even make you ice coffee or ice chocolate if that is what you prefer. Being lactose intolerant, they could even make drinks with soy milk - nothing is too much trouble at all. After day 1 the wait staff remembered what our drinking preferences were. That is A+ for customer service.

Wifi at this hotel was stable and fast which is a rarity in the busy, congested Seminyak area. The free pop, fairy floss corn and ice cream at the lobby everyday is a lovely touch!

You have to go through a metal detector every time you enter the lobby of the hotel which made me feel very safe. There is a free shuttle (golf cart buggy) that takes you to their beach club on Seminyak beach, to eat street (Lakasama) or the end of the street at Jl Raya Seminyak - from here it is only a few hundred meters to Bintang Supermarket.

We had two spa treatment, both times we had the Balinese massage. The team at the spa are very professional and friendly. The treatment rooms were clean, smells nice and well decorated. The only minor issue was the loud music from the pool, it kind of detracts from the zen, peaceful atmosphere.

We were extremely well looked after by everyone at the hotel and special mention goes to Cindy who checked us in, restaurant staff such as Mega, Donni, Rai, Anton, Sutiara and chef Minggu and many more others who we do not know how to spell their names.

If you are considering The Courtyard Seminyak, think no further, just book it!"
2999,The Best,50,January 2016,"Have a 8 night stay with luxury escapes coupon. Have been here 4 nights and just had to get onto trip advisor to write this review. The facilities, food (quality and price), service and friendliness are second to none.
This has to be one of the best places I have ever stayed."
3000,Great value,40,December 2015,"Had three nights here. Lovely rooms with pool views. Great buffet breakfast, well equipped gym and a spa. Very comfortable and clean. Very good security also. They had afternoon movies for kids and families with free popcorn and a very nice pool bar. Staff performed nightly dance or traditional music which was great."
3001,Honeymoon Stay,40,January 2016,"Booked my honeymoon stay with Marriott for the One Bedroom Suite. Every part of the room was amazing! Loved it to the max!!

However, I was a little disappointed in the service though. The staff were all very nice and friendly, but there was no WOW factor which amazed me. I had very high expectations of the hotel as it is under the Marriott branding, especially when I am in the hospitality industry myself.

I have emailed to Marriott to request for early check in as well as high floor, which of course I do understand that it will be subject to availability. When my hubby and I arrived at approximately 12.30pm to check in, the front desk staff actually told us our room will be ready in 30 mins time or less, so we just had to wait at the lobby or the business center. Although I was quite hungry, but I decided to wait since I was quite tired too. But after 40 mins, no one came to inform us that our room is ready, and I had to approach the reception to check again, which now said it will be ready in another 10-15 mins. So we continue to wait, and only got our keys at around 1.45pm. We had to wait for about an hour instead of the 30 mins mentioned earlier. I am fine if we cannot check in earlier, but at least inform us of the exact waiting time so that we could have done something else first. We were being assigned on the 2nd floor instead of a high floor requested, which I am also fine, but the staff could have informed that the high floors were taken thus they are unable to meet our request. However, this was not mentioned as well, so it was as if our request was not taken note of.

In my email I have also mentioned that I will be on a honeymoon trip with my hubby. I was expecting some surprise from the hotel, such as decor in the room with towels folded into swans on the bed with some rose petals, as well as some welcome honeymoon amenities such as perhaps fruit platter, or chocolates, and perhaps some complimentary items as well. But all we received was just a small plate of cake of about 6 small pieces? As well as a card from the front desk, which was a general card as it states ""Dear Guest"". Minibar was also not complimentary although we paid for a Suite Room, and there was no kind gesture to offer it as complimentary since we are here for our honeymoon trip. I have friends who stayed in other properties in Bali for just anniversary trips, and it seemed that an anniversary stay could be better off than a Honeymoon stay.

The housekeeping service was great I must stay as they can turn around and tidy our room very quickly. But I was puzzled with why they only replaced 1 glass in our room from the 2nd day onwards, when there were actually 2 glasses in the room when we checked in. Did not want to ask the reception about that since it was nothing big, but it was indeed a mystery.

On the overall the stay was nice and pleasant, but definitely under expectations for a honeymoon trip. I felt we were just on a normal leisure trip and we are like any other guests to the property. The management can perhaps look into the amenities they can offer for guests who are staying here to celebrate a special occasion, especially honeymoon. I am sure Marriott can do a better job with it.

Nonetheless, I will still recommend Marriott to my friends if they were to travel to Bali for their own leisure trips."
3002,Perfect stay!,50,December 2015,"The Marriott was a perfect start to our trip in Bali. Walking distance to the beach, a free shuttle to other parts of town and an fantastic pools with a swim up bar.

The staff was very friendly. They helped us arrange activities and transport and were very nice.

The breakfast was surprisingly good, with lots of tasty options. The pool food and bar was also good.

The room was very clean and nice, we stayed in a pool terrace room. The facilities also had a gym that was small but great to have a gym."
3003,NIce Hotel to party,40,December 2015,courtyard is a nice hotel big bed and very clean. The pool is very fun with a swim up bar and DJ's and live acts. However this is also a drawback if you want some peace. The whole hotel surrounds the pool and entertainment and the rooms are not soundproofs so the going ons are resonated into the room very loudly. This can be enjoyable or a pain depending on your view. I'd stay again though
3004,"Nice hotel, but not for a quiet rest!",40,January 2016,"Located just 3-5 minutes walk from Seminyak Beach with lots of places to eat and give entertainments around the hotel.. Great location indeed!

Smiley staffs all over the hotel.. But a bit slow in service. Need to follow up 2-3 times to get what I needed, perhaps also because of the high season!

I stayed there on my bday too, and I got a tastey chocolate cake with a card handwritten from the front desk team.. That's so sweet! :)

2 cute litlle pools, but not enough pool chairs, so make sure you go early or ""chope"" the chair first.

Very nice foods, lots of selections for Vegetarians and Gluten Free choices too.

Important notice:
For you who needs quiet place, or having jetlag, or travel with kids who needs to sleep well.... you may need to ask the high floor and in the corner! Because the room is not sound proof at all!

I could hear people were chatting outside of the room, or from the pool, or from the loud noise of the doors being closed! Even in the spa when i had a massage, i could hear very well the music from the pool.. Duh!"
3005,Tastefully designed rooms with good location,50,December 2015,"We arrived at the hotel at night. Security check was strict. All our luggage had to pass through their scanning machine! Checking in was fast as we were the only one arriving at that moment. But the lobby doesn‚Äôt impress me. It was simple and open. It could be quite hot while waiting to be checked- in as it is not air-conditioned. Nevertheless, it has a nice view as it is facing the garden and swimming pool.
Room is big and spacious. It is well and tastefully designed. In fact this hotel is quite new. The bath room has a see-through glass window to the bedroom. But I find this a bit annoying as when you go to the toilet in the middle of the night and turn on the light, you may disturb the other person. The room provides all the basics like drinking water, beverages, safety box etc. Wifi is free and it is quite fast. There is a balcony facing the courtyard and swimming pool.
Swimming pool is big. However the water is not very clear with visibility around 1 meter.
There is a gymnasium and a kid room. Both are well maintained.
Breakfast is not bad with wide variety of food especially fruits. They also provide specially made coffee like cappuccino, latte etc . The food is mostly western with a few local dishes. However the cafeteria is hot and uncomfortable especially when it is packed. Staffs are friendly and helpful.
Locality of the hotel is good. There are a lot of eateries, massage parlors and convenient stores within walking distance. For those who prefer some night life, there is no short of night life spots near the hotel. In fact there is the famous Frankenstein Pub about 15 minute walk from the hotel. You can indulge yourself with a couple bottles of beers while enjoying the rock music at this pub.
A five minute walk will take you to the Seminyak Beach. This beach is famous for catching sun set and also surfing. The hotel also provides free buggy ride to the beach.
For your information, for those who prefer a quiet and peaceful environment, this hotel will be ideal for you. But for those who prefer vibrant and want some happenings at night at the hotel, I would suggest Hard Rock Hotel in Kuta where they have live band every night at the main lobby!"
3006,Brilliant once again!,50,January 2016,"This was my second stay this year at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak and it was even better than the last one.
At check in I was promptly greeted and checked into my room quickly and all parts of the process were explained to me. The reception staff always said hello and even remembered my name, which was amazing since the hotel got quite busy during my two weeks there. The concierge staff were always happy to help with booking cars and restaurants and organising the buggy to take me around the local area. I managed to visit the Marriott section of the beach this trip and it was nice to have sun lounge that you didn't have to pay for and also staff to bring you water and spray you with cool water when it got too hot. The breakfasts and the team in the restaurant were amazing. I managed to bring some friends over my trip for breakfast and they loved the food and also the staff. Housekeeping were excellent and left little notes when it was raining and also to say thank you for staying, which was a really nice touch. The spa was once again amazing. It's more pricey than the cheap massage places just down the street, but it really is worth the cost. It's still way cheaper than getting a massage in Melbourne and the girls in the spa do an amazing job.
My favourite part of the trip was relaxing in and around the pool. There is a good variety of reasonably priced food and it was all really well done. Compliments must go to the head chef who has really done well with the team. The best part of the pool experience is definitely the staff. All of them made me feel welcome and looked after me the whole time I was there. When I arrived before Xmas, it was quite quiet so my friends and I got a chance to really get to know the staff. As it got busier over the next week or so, the staff were always attentive and always made sure I was looked after. While all the staff were amazing, I have to give a special shout out to three in particular. Hari - he always made sure I had a drink and always served everyone with a smile. Admiral - he remembered me from my last trip and took the time to make sure I was as happy as I was back then, he was one of the reasons I returned to this hotel. Lastly, Hendra - this young man is an asset to the Marriott brand. Nothing was too much for him. Every guest loved interacting with him and he was always so happy and friendly with everyone he came across. He made a special effort at the start of each shift to see who he knew from previous days and made sure he acknowledged them. I would hope that the brand recognise his potential as a future leader as he really is a great example of what customer service should be.
One small suggestion for the pool bar area...I know the hotel caters to families, but it would be nice if this part of the pool was adults only after a certain time? It became a tad frustrating to have to tell kids to stop splashing when having a drink at the bar. That said, some of the adults were quite rowdy and it may not be the best place to have kids around.
All in all, you've outdone yourself this time guys. I will be back, hopefully again this year. Thanks so much to everyone at the hotel for making my 2 weeks there so special."
3007,Good hotel but not a good location,40,January 2016,"Pros:
- Nice and clean rooms
- Breakfast buffet was excellent. Big selection of local and american breakfast. Lots of fresh fruits and juices
- Close to shopping area of Semiyak, lots of good food around the hotel
- Good gym

Cons:
- Seminyak beach was very dirty, noisy (music blasting, maybe because of new year celebrations) and good for surfing only. Not good for relaxing and lounging. You are better off going to Nusa Dua.
- Marriotts private beach section is a far. It takes 15 - 20 minutes to walk there or 5 minutes by buggy.
- Limited lounge chairs by the swimming pool. If you are late, there won't be any place for you. Swimming area can be noisy."
3008,Good hotel,40,January 2016,"We stayed in this hotel checking in on NYE. First impression is that the hotel was modern, large and clean. You can't fault the rooms or the grounds for cleanliness and looks. Negatives - check in was confusing, you have to put credit on your room which you use and then when you run out have to pay cash or top it up so you need to check your balance often. They had mixed up the reservation we made for the dinner but they sorted it out. It's also out of the way of main part of Seminyak and it's a long walk or a taxi ride. Other than that, we had an enjoyable stay, pool is amazing, customer service is excellent."
3009,Wonderful holiday,50,January 2016,"Words cannot describe sufficiently how well we were treated by the hotel staff from the beginning to the end of our time here. Things could have started dreadfully. W@e had made the booking via ebookers and there was miscommunication with the hotel. However, they handled everything really well and gave us what. We had reserved.

The hotel is excellent, well located and with all amenities. We made a day trip all organised from the front desk, and the rest of the time we chilled out by the pool or in the vicinity.

If you plan to stay in Seminyak, I can honestly say that I cannot recommend a better place to stay, and I am a seasoned traveller for over 20 years. Bravo the local staff!"
3010,Excellent Staff and great Rooms,50,September 2015,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights and loved our time here. The staff was incredibly friendly and the property itself was excellent. Rooms were spacious and clean. Plenty of bottled water as well. Rooms by the pool can get a bit noisy but things calmed down at night. The location isn't too far from the beach but if you're looking for a beach-property this isn't the right hotel for you.

Breakfast was fantastic and they were able to create healthy smoothies for my wife and I.

Would def. come back here again!"
3011,Great stay!,50,December 2015,"Great hotel with super-helpful staff in the middle of Seminyak. Perfect for beach, shopping and close to some really good restaurants.
Breakfast buffet was delicious.

Shuttle to their own little beach club which gives you some privacy on one of the most frequented beaches in Seminyak."
3012,Wonderful hotel and staff,50,December 2015,"I thought for a long time and still could not find out one bad thing about this hotel. Decent rooms, clean, good breakfast, well maintained, good location and most of all a very good staff. Will directly go there next time too."
3013,Fantastic,50,December 2015,"This hotel is headed and managed by one of the best hospitality professionals I have come across. The chauffeurs, porters, receptionists, housekeeping attendants and pool bar servers are doing an OUTSTANDING job. I would like to recognise the below individuals -

Airport pick up chauffeur
Vido - A very warm and welcoming gentlemen, something you always want when you visiting a country for the first time on your honeymoon. Clean and great smelling car, loved the beer on arrival :)

Day tour chauffeur
GD Jayeng - very helpful and helped us see a little of Bali through his eyes, respected our privacy and kept updating us about placed as and when we passed by it.

Housekeeping attendant
Agung - Very courteous in his approach towards customers, asked for feedback of the room cleaning and apologised for the delay in servicing the room one of the days (not at all a big deal, completely understandable)

Pool bar associates
They did an awesome job in orchestrating our experience everyday. They are very knowledgeable about the menu and great at suggestions. The cocktails were brilliant, surely going to try them at home one day. Although it was hot and a lot of guests to serve, their interactions were always a 10/10 experience.

Seminyak Kitchen associates
Took great care of us during breakfast and clearance was spot on :). Keeping in mind the number of guests the hotel has during peak season the seating arrangement of having 2 hosts attending and making note of guest room numbers is a great idea.

Lastly but not the least Shashank Sinha (Director of operations) at the hotel made great arrangements for our stay and exceeded all expectations. His eye for detail, pre-planning,sending across honeymoon amenities totally helped in enhancing the experience at the CY Bali Seminyak.

I would like to thank the entire team for taking care of us, wishing you all a successful year ahead."
3014,Perfect Gateway in the heart of seminyak,50,January 2016,"Staying 2 night after new years eve. Got room 526 deluxe pool view. It was superb! Love love love this hotel. All the staff are super helpful and friendly. Check in and check out process at no time. What I like most was on Friday night, there was an event fire juggler üòÑ quite entertaining. You gonna love the pool as well. Breakfast time is the best, from Nasi goreng to egg Benedict, from infuse water to espresso, are here. To me this hotel is the perfect gateway from hustling bustling life. Going to the beach? Worry not, they will take you to the beach with buggy anytime you want. Definitely staying here again."
3015,Perfect stay !,50,December 2015,Me and my sister booked this as a last minute New Year's Eve holiday. Everything was perfect - staff were great they were so helpful with everything we asked. I can't give praise enough to Hari in the pool bar staff he looked after us everyday and always had a smile on his face. We had breakfast included and it was a full buffet every morning which was amazing. The beach was close by and you could jump on the hotels buggy which would take you down the street for free we went and watched the sunset almost everyday on the trendy bean bag bars they have set up on the beach. My only suggestion would be if you do go around New Years find places close by to walk as Bali gridlocks with traffic. All in all fantastic hotel - tip is ask for a pool view room and high if possible as it gives you that extra escape from the hustle and bustle outside on the street. We will be back again :)
3016,Courtyard Seminyak has turned it over successfully,50,December 2015,"I travelled to Bali for the first time with my family, my dad, my sister and her family with altogether 9 people in the group. I booked the hotel through a local travel agency and ordered three rooms. When checking in, I was told that the three rooms I order is on two difference floors and this was the case because I did not specify that the rooms had to be on the same floor when I placed my order with the local agency. I asked whether there's opportunity to change my room, I could feel that the staff had tried his best to accommodate my request but he still failed to make any change due to the already packed booking during peak season. I kept trying my luck the following day and the day after and finally got my room changed for the last two nights (I stayed altogether 4 nights in this hotel). The first room I stayed was on the 5/F floor, facing the street. It had no view at all and the noise from the street in the morning was so loud that I could not stay on bed for any longer. Staying in the first room, I did not feel like staying in a 5-star hotel in bali and did not feel like I was actually have my holiday. The noise and light insulation of the room and worse than my own room at home. And you don't bother to walk out to the balcony of the hotel room even though there is one (for every room).
The situation got turned over 180 degrees when I was switched to another room which was facing the pool. There, you can really enjoy the night sky in the balcony and you are no longer susceptible to the street noise, which means you are really having your true bali holiday which was meant to be.
The hotel serves long buffet breakfast between 6:30am and 11:00am, which allows flexibility for our daily activities.
Kids' club is available so that you can let your kids play there if you wanna have a spa nearby.
To conclude, the service of the hotel was excellent and had successfully turned around my bad impression when I first checked in. So well done, Courtyard Seminyak!"
3017,Hotel is good however seminyak is repulsive! !,40,December 2015,"Hotel itself was very good no complaints there but I must write this review as seminyak is basically australian chav city. Men and women averaging 5 tattoos each, men wearing singlet tops which are 2 sizes too small. Seminyak beach was filthy. You have been warned."
3018,They really care about their guests!,50,December 2015,"We are so impressed by this place, it was perfect!
ALL the staff were awesome, kind & happy (it shows, they must all love where they work) and they made our stay wonderful.
The room was spotless, luxurious and comfortable. The breakfast was the BEST ever that we have had in Bali. Any requests were acknowledged quickly. Security is top notch. Wifi is super fast. Poolside is relaxing and fun.
Absolutely recommend and will return... Please don't change a thing."
3019,"Good Place, Good food",40,,"Generally quiter atmosphere, nice pool, good ambience. Staff behaviour is good. Breakfast has good variety. Lunch and Dinner menu has European, Indonesian and Indian dishes.

The Seminyak beach is within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The same beach extends till Kuta, so you get access to a beach atleast 6km long.

There are many good food and shopping options adjacent to this hotel.
Convenient place to stay in Seminyak."
3020,What a place!! New Year's Eve is a Must,50,January 2016,"Most memorable nye ever. So much good clean fun.
Everyone in the pool having drinks some r dancing -some r just watching.
Even the staff were very festive.
Room was so cold and bed -slept like a baby.
Would definitely love to do this annually"
3021,"Great room, food & services",50,December 2015,"Very comfortable room, nice food and great pool. Great food variety in the breakfast (ask for fresh juice). Great place to get some rest and relax. The wireless connection works very well. Loved the free popcorn, fairy floss and ice cream! Very polite staff."
3022,Perfect sanctuary In the madness of Bali,50,July 2015,"Stayed two nights as we are trying out new hotels this trip. Courtyard Marriott would be one I would definitely come back to. Service was excellent, lots of smiling faces and ready for any request we had. Room was lovely, it's a new hotel so not much you can fault really, had everything you could possibly need. Happy Hour 2 for 1 cocktails were a hit as was the buggy which took us down to the vip area of the beach which was roped off so you could get a rest from the beach sellers. Pool was clean and large, separate section for the kids. Liked that the day beds had a buzzer where the staff come to bring you food & drinks as you need. 5 stars for me."
3023,Modern Clean Friendly,50,December 2015,"It's the another island in Bali. Here is full built in the hotel such a pool, gym, massage, restaurant, food & drink, etc. I wanted to stay here only, didn't want to go out. The room is clean, enough space and modern style. Specifically, room colour, Beige, gives comfortable things. Breakfast provides high quality. Marriott staff are outstanding kind and friendly."
3024,Great staff!,40,December 2015,"Overall, it was a good trip. No complaints about the room and the staff were friendly and helpful. However, the beach is a slight walk away. Try and catch the buggy to the beach to cut down the walking time.

Buffet breakfast included in the room was also good. Variety and quality is good.
However, the hotel only has 1 restaurant with a somewhat limited menu.

But, the best part about the hotel is the staff, from the front desk to the security to the restaurant wait staff, everyone was cheerful, helpful and attentive."
3025,"Great rooms, food and location",40,December 2015,"The hotel is well located in seminyak. The room and bed was great and the pool was awesome. The breakfasts have wide range to choose from and the quality of food is great. The also have a free shuttle to 3 other points within semiyak however, they only do return pickup from one of the three locations."
3026,Modern Hotel in Seminyak.,40,July 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in room 310 (Deluxe Pool View) July 2015. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children aged 6yrs and 4yrs. We had previously stayed in Kuta prior to our stay. The hotel is very new and very modern and common areas are extremely clean and well presented. Because we had just come from another resort it kind of felt like walking into the USA and it took a little time to settle in.

Check in is really the only thing that really bothered me. I had made a reservation directly via email with reservations at the hotel. Because I am an ex travel agent I always print everything out (I‚Äôve learnt). I had my reservation paperwork at check in but I also had a huge lot of paper I‚Äôd printed out hoping I‚Äôd not need it but knowing better I always do this. When making the reservation I was told clearly I had breakfast for all 4 of us and a ‚Äúfree‚Äù rollaway‚Äù bed included. While checking in I was then advised we had 2 breakfasts included and the rollaway was at a fee. It sounded like the girl said something like USD50 per night for the bed. I must have heard wrong as it must have been $15per night per bed?. It‚Äôs not on their website so my first suggestion is to put how much the rollaway beds are on there. However I didn‚Äôt even check what the price was because I had written confirmation it was free. So I had to go and get my print out of my proof. I have to say I hate doing this. Doesn‚Äôt start the process off nicely of checking into a nice hotel with an extra cost that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be and have to prove it by showing emails from their staff. Anyway they were gracious and checked my paper work of the chain of emails and it was no problem. It‚Äôs a pet hate of mine with reservations for this to happen. If I hadn‚Äôt have printed proof I would have up for the fee or I would have been trying to sort through all the emails to find it..... Not a nice way to start...

Our room was lovely. Not huge but very comfortable and the roll away bed fit no problem after they put the chair on the balcony that was in the corner.
I think we actually had the best view of the hotel. We were at the grassy end of the hotel and looked out over the pool and the bar. We were on a low floor but I actually think in this instance it was a better view. Even the man showing us our room said we had one of the best views of the hotel and he was right. We were never disturbed by music. A couple of afternoons we sat on the balcony and listened to the music at the bar. I never heard anything once we shut the door. So for us and our children the room was perfect. It was actually a great ambiance sitting out on the Balcony.

Nice bathroom. These rooms are very new but I suggest they need to take action on cleaning the corners of the shower out as they are already (in our room) getting built up with grime. However cleanliness of the room is excellent. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve seen in other hotels as well in the same area.

Breakfast was an extravaganza. If you can‚Äôt find something to satisfy you then you must have problems. I didn‚Äôt think the Nasi Goreng was authentic tasting. They changed the region of it daily but it was tasteless. The second time I tried was like plain rice with a few vegetables in it. This is a dish I look forward to in Bali but didn‚Äôt eat it after two attempts. Everything else was superb.

The bar area didn‚Äôt have any Bingtang Radlers ‚Äì If they don‚Äôt stock these I really would recommend they should! I heard a couple of other people talking about that to.

The hotel is back from the beach but not far and we were able to either take the buggy down (which the kids loved) or walk down no problem. We do prefer to be closer to the beach with small kids like we were at the previous hotel. We did say to ourselves whilst there that they needed a beach club area down the beach for hotel guests which I see on facebook they have now opened.

The pool is nice but it was too cold for me when I was there as it is shaded most of the day. In the normal hotter weather I imagine this isn‚Äôt a problem but while we were there it wasn‚Äôt hot enough for me to get in. Kids loved the bean bags in the pool. We went to the beach where I could be in the sun. It is true that the sun lounges in the sun get taken but there are signs that if you leave them vacant for over half hour they will move your stuff for other guests to use them.

The thing I‚Äôd like to give a huge praise to is the kids club. Both of my children loved the kids club. In fact to the point where my 6 year old did not want to leave and only wanted to be at the kids club. We actually did not want our kids at the kids club as we wanted to take them out and about but they desperately wanted to go and had so much fun. Hats off to them for running it so well. We went to another resort after due to our flight cancellation for 1 night (we changed hotels after 1 night and went to Nusa Dua Instead). The kids asked to go to its kids club and my 4 yr old cried when we picked him up and said I don‚Äôt like this kids club. So the Courtyard Marriott have excellent staff and facilities at the kids club and I highly recommend it. You get 2hrs free per day per child and if they stay longer there is a chargeable amount that is reasonable.

I would stay at this hotel again if I got a really great deal. It‚Äôs not my favourite hotel in Bali but I can see why people really like it. The price we paid it was good value. It‚Äôs really is like its own secluded club in the middle of a busy city. I would recommend it to others."
3027,Seminyak's heaven on earth,50,December 2015,"Stayed for three nights in one of the suites, so beautiful! Loved the hotel breakfast, many things to choose from. The most friendly and helpful staff! Very clean room and big pool (good for kids also) close to the beach and some very nice spas and restaurants."
3028,Nice...,40,September 2015,"I stayed there last year September 2014. We stayed at the Pool Access Room. On the first two nights, the floor of the room was all wet. We were thinking it's because we went out to swim and made the floor wet when we came back in. However, when we woke up, the floor was still super wet, so we complained and asked to change to another room. Apart from that, the hotel was nice. The food there was great. Staff was very nice too. Pool was big. Location was convenient too. Walkable distance to the beach. Many restaurants around. Not very crowded area. Enjoyed the stay very much."
3029,Not your US Courtyard,50,December 2015,"A great Marriott facility - not your typical stateside Courtyard. Attentive staff, outstanding pool side rooms and fabulous buffet breakfast. Very secure setting. Close to shopping for your spouse who needs nothing but finds a must have."
3030,Good choice for comfort stay,40,December 2015,Great facilities offered by this hotel. Swimming pool gym and even buggy service as shutle to beach or you may chose a 5-minute walk. Room comes with comfy bed but can be crowded if additional bed is. Only downside is sweaty smell on the pillow which can be quite disturbing.
3031,WOW!,50,November 2015,"I came with my boo on end of november. Even we just redeem the points for stay as Gold member we got upgrade to Junior Suite direct to Pool, and the room was great! huge living room and bathroom but it would be best if the hotel set bathtub inside. Got free breakfast too for 2pax. When we requested some amenities the housekeeper send more and so fast. keep your great service guys!"
3032,Great property,50,November 2015,"Stayed at the Courtyard Seminyak on early november 2015, a new property within the Seminyak area and very near to the beach (they also have a beach club and hopefully the management can extend the operation hour in the near future ;) )

The person that did the check in for us were very efficient and friendly, luggage were delivered to the room extra fast, the room were great looking at the pool. Breakfast spread were enormous and the extra things that they have is pass around canap√© during breakfast which is nice.

We would like to also thanks Sashank the hotel's operation manager and Chinko the duty manager which is very helpful during our stay, will definitely be back should we have the opportunity to go to Bali again

Keep on doin the excellent job!"
3033,Awesome and perfect stay !!!,50,December 2015,"There are too many choices of hotel to choose in Bali but we decided to try out Marriott Seminyak because of the excellent rating by travelers and indeed our choice was absolutely perfect üëç .The mobile check in was surprisingly easy and worked wonder!! When we arrived, we were amazingly greeted by your super friendly and most gracious staff, Ms Melinda . She escorted us to our room and we were so delighted with her excellent service.

We loved the room deco , the furnishing and the bed was so comfortable. The spacious shower area is definitely welcoming in hot Bali . Everything in the room was in perfect condition and room amenities were complete . Housekeeping service was fantastic and service calls for requests were promptly attended to.

Breakfast spread was excellent - lots of variety and range of fruits . The 2.5 hrs of spa treatment was really worth !! My 8 yrs son had so much fun at the kids club üëç

Thanks to all the staff for their friendly and excellent service. I was amazed that Mr Ari from the front desk could even recognize and address me with my name without even checking my details

Our 6 days' stay in Courtyard Marriott Seminyak was awesome ! Almost everything was perfect ! Great hotel ! Fantastic excellent service from all the super duper friendly staff made our stay and holiday a memorable and ejoyable one .

Thank you Courtyard Marriott Seminyak üëçüèÜüëèüéñüèÖ!!"
3034,Relaxing with friendly attentive service,50,December 2015,"We have stayed in Bali many times, usually in Seminyak. This was our first time at the Courtyard Marriott having watched it being built on our trips in the past. The location is great and though further away from the beach than we normally stay, it is an easy walk. If you are not feeling energetic the hotel provides buggy transport to the beach. The hotel is located in the same street as our favourite local and affordable restaurants and spas/massage spas.
The hotel rooms are quiet, modern and clean. All toiletries are replaced regularly, most on a daily basis.
The staff in all areas are exceptional. They are extremely friendly, attentive, extra polite and nothing is too hard to accommodate. This applies to wait staff, chefs and pool staff in particular, however I cannot fault any of the staff. We were very impressed with service in all areas.
The hotel is modern and what it lacks in the traditional style we usually like, is made up for in the clean, well maintained modern surrounds. We found the pool area a relaxing haven. It was low season so not sure how easy it would be to find a sun lounge during busy times. A huge plus was that one side caters for non smokers only which many hotels don't allocate in Bali. There are also smoking and non smoking areas for dining at all meal times.
We decided to try cocktails at happy hour which were reasonable and we found that they certainly don't skimp on the alcohol so beware!
Breakfast was amazing every day with a huge range of western, Balinese and Asian options. If you request freshly squeezed juice as opposed to the wide array of standard choices that are already offered, or if you favour a latte or cap, staff are happy to make these at no extra charge which is another great inclusion.
We also tried a dinner and lunch at the hotel restaurant. I found the chefs to be top notch. Food presentation was fine dining standard.
We also visited the spa ...Very relaxing and professional.
The gym is clean and equipment is a good standard and well maintained. Water and towels are provided,
OK enough said...We were pretty impressed with all areas and will definitely stay again."
3035,Floored by the amazing hospitality,50,December 2015,"Having heard from so many people about this Hotel we had very high expectations even before we reached Bali and I can assure you of one thing, it lives up to its reputation!

On our arrival, we were met by a lovely associate Melinda. She was warm, hospitable and extremely genuine. She had everything it takes to make someone feel comfortable. We had a lot of questions and she was more than willing to help answer them. What's more is she gave us a lot of local advice and told us about places that she visits. All the recommendations she gave us were amazing!

Being associates of Marriott, and having stayed at other Marriott properties we have seen a lot of people who take fellow associates for granted but this is an absolute exception. Everyone is just so nice! The associates at breakfast and all over the property when you walk around on are so welcoming.
It's like staying at home.

The hotel is situated in the heart of Seminyak and everything is literally walking distance away. It is flanked by some local shopping on one side and The Seminyak beach on the other side.

If you're looking for a quaint place to stay with amazing food and even better people then Courtyard Marriott Seminyak is where you should be."
3036,A good option,40,December 2015,"Recently stayed 3 nights here which I was lucky enough to win. Very happy and pleased to have done so and be able to stay here. The staff were incredible...could not do enough for you and always happy. Very strict security which gave you a good feeling that all was well inside the hotel. Lovely and clean, modern style. The breakfast was great with plenty of options and we had dinner once too which was very nice. Location very central - the golf buggy took us to the end of the street and then a 10 min walk if that to Double Six Rooftop bar and La Plancha on the beach. Personally I like the older Balinese style resorts but if you like a very modern vibe this is the place for you."
3037,Really good place to stay,40,December 2015,"First of all we want to compliment the services of Nyssa Ferlita. Her service is really first class since we arrived. Our booking has yet to arrive at the hotel but she let us check in before the check in time.

When she heard we were on our honeymoon, she immediately congratulated us and without us knowing she had arrange for us late check out & a cake for us.

Before our check out, she was there to check on us before we leave. She is also very patient, making sure all our needs are met.

Overall it has been a pleasant stay even for a night."
3038,So glad to be back,50,December 2015,"Arrived 4 hours ago, how nice to walk down to the pool bar and have the waiter recognise you from a year ago! Meant to write on here last year when we visited but got slack. This place is beautiful, the rooms, the pool, the food, the drinks (not to mention 4 hours of happy hour everyday 4-8pm) wish we were here longer and we are only at day 1 of 8!"
3039,Very family friendly,50,December 2015,"We stayed in the hotel for 8 nights. It is absolutely AMAZING. Breakfast was good. Staff were so helpful and they speaked English very well.

On every Friday night (around 5:30 pm) they have a very nice show, my kids loved it !!!

The daily fresh popcorn made by a popcorn machine located next to the reception.

On arrival they served us cold drinks with frozen ice-cream which were really amazing especially that we were so exhausted after a long flight.

I highly recommend the hotel."
3040,An ease during busy time,40,November 2015,I think this one of the first hotel who understand how to treat their customer with a very good service and leaving a peace of mind during my stay. Eventhough we arrived with big group they are consistent in delivering their services.
3041,Good Location,40,December 2015,"Beach and shops are readily accessible to the hotel. The beach is easily walkable, but there is also a free shuttle that takes the guests to Double Six/ Seminyak beach. Bikes are also being rented out for just 20000 IDR per hour. The complimentary breakfast buffet was great."
3042,secure And safe with lovely staff,50,November 2015,Stayed for 3 nights but wish It was for longer. The security at the hotel was fantastic AS well AS the staff always smiling And friendly. breakfast was fantastic with so much to choose from.They let us Check out later And stay at the hotel AS our Flights were later in the night.
3043,Great Plcae to Stay in Bali,50,December 2015,"Stayed for 3 nights at the Courtyard. I read some of the negative reviews but I am glad I did not take them to heart. This is a good hotel in a great location. We got free breakfast by shopping several travel sites to see which one had the best deal. It wasn't too hard to find. The room was tastefully decorated modern Bali style. The bathroom was big and the balcony was cute (admittedly I did not use it much). As far as the property it is very clean and well kept, the staff is friendly and attentive, the wifi is good and the breakfast was yummy.

The hotel while not on the beach, but it has a reserved spot about 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel which provides beach chairs, towels, water, popsicles and a safe place to leave your stuff while you splash in the surf. They do have a shuttle that runs on a schedule which kind of stinks since makes you wait for the next time and the drive really isn't that far. Never had the patience to wait so always ended up walking.

The drinks at the bar are pricey, but definitely take advantage of happy hour. Cheapest way to drink in Bali. Have a happy hour cocktail 2 for 1, freshen up and then have dinner or hit the night life. Stick to the local Indonesian beer off the hotel property. Cheapest way to get a buzz. Plus on many nights the hotel has live entertainment which is pretty good. Bar singers and fire twirlers that did a great job.

The location of the hotel is also good. There are some decent cheap dining and shopping choices nearby. Since I prefer the gay nightlife, the gay scene in Bali is literally less than 5 minutes away. Close enough to walk to but far enough to make sure the noise stays at the bars. The hotel is on Jl Camplung Tanduk street which a fun street and admitted a tourist trap but a modest one and very affordable when looking for places to eat, drink, shop, massage, etc. It is about 20 minutes walking south of Jl Kayu Aya which appeared to be the Rodeo Drive of Bali. Over-priced shopping, one sad expensive mall and way too western whitewashed for my taste. I didn't come to Bali to experience that. Jl Camplung Tanduk caters to tourists, but also remembers you came to Bali to see Bali. Found out how good the street was on my last night exploring.

Would definitely make this my Bali place on my next visit which will hopefully will be soon."
3044,Everything fantastic until the end but will prob still return,40,December 2015,"Hotel security was tight - which was good. 2 sections to the pool which was quite fun - upper deck has a pool bar and they run certain pool activities eg aqua aerobics which my friends tried (was ok); lower deck pool is more for swimming, sun bathing on the massive pool pillow the hotel provides and also beach balls and goal posts for water polo. They have a section on the beach which is specially for hotel guests with beach chairs and umbrellas and there's a guy who tends it so we can leave our stuff in peace while in the water. There're buggies that shuttles people to & fro the beach and the hotel approx 7 min drive or 15/20min walk. I'd stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was great & spacious, and their rooms all come w Bluetooth speaker which was heaps of fun for room parties! Breakfast spread is aplenty and the Caucasian chef speaks Bahasa which amused me. My only gripe was they messed up my groups' (35pax) hotel invoice, Promised us late check outs but forgot to update in the system and we had 35 stranded & upset people at the front desk trying to get our key cards renewed, walk back to our rooms only to realize the staff had renewed the key cards but not updated the system which resets the room doors. So they had very angry 35 people at the front desk, again. It was a very unpleasant finish to a great stay especially cuz I was the organizer and had to deal with their slip ups. But overall I think if it's a small group of people it shld be fine. Will consider going back again."
3045,Service Location Amenities = Perfection,50,December 2015,"It was my first trip to Bali and as everyone knows Bali is well known for all these high end eclectic resorts which at first I entertained for my stay. I am a budget conscious traveller but loves high end amenities and services for cheap and so I opted to stay at a Marriott. I know... why a Marriott when Marriotts are a dime a dozen. Well here's why I absolutely loved my stay here:

Pros: I am a silver elite with Marriott and usually that does not get you much perks in the states but in Bali it does. Trust me. They treated me like a king right from the moment I stepped through their metal detectors (I will discuss this later). I got upgraded to a top floor suite (next time I will opt for a first floor which is closer to the pool), my stay included breakfast and the breakfast was superb which included local fruit, local Asian breakfast and western breakfast with all the carbs such as donuts and pastries. The service from the restaurant, front desk and the bars is impeccable and very professional they even gave us a free shuttle ride on the day of our departure which is 4am and sent us off with a pastry to-go box because bfast will not start until 6am (silver elite perks). The grounds are clean and the rooms are modern and comfortable. The noise is very minimal even though the street below is very busy. The location is probably the best in Seminyak because it is walking distance from the beach which is about 3 blocks away (they have a beach house and a shuttle that will take you there if you don't want to walk). If you walk east from the hotel you will stumble upon street stands for shopping, restaurants of all kinds, the best Gay bars in Seminyak all in one block and last but not least the street of all streets for shopping Jl Raya!

To me this hotel was perfect but there is one con that you should be aware of:

The security is very strict because of the bombings in Bali years ago. Each guest has to go through a metal detector much like the ones in the airport and all the bags must be scanned prior to entering the property which is an inconvenience but the employees are very nice about it and after awhile you get used to it because it's better to be safe than sorry.

I loved my stay here and I hope you do too!"
3046,Superb,50,November 2015,"It is a nice hotel and a big one. I guess it has some 200+ guestrooms. Breakfast served was very nice. We were vegetarians so nothing much for us except fruit juices ,cereal and ice cream. Staff is courteous. However that is everywhere in Bali. I mean Balinese people by nature are very friendly, polite and loving. One thing they can improve on is the shuttle to Seminyak. Very good hotel still."
3047,First day review,30,December 2015,"It's my first day staying in CM with my family. Upon arrival security was very tight which is good which makes us feel much safer. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Had a problem with my room and they managed to take care of it right away.

My family loves the pool very much we had a good time today. We stay in deluxe pool view room, room is good except for the balcony sofa and pillow doesnt look clean at all which is a turn off. Aside from the stain you could see thick layer of dust on it.

Here comes the best part of my first day.. Which turn me off totally.. As i return from dinner, we drove back to hotel and at the entrance, the guard was staring at me as though i was here to rob the hotel or something. No greeting no smile nothing and just deep staring at me and speak with high tone unlike the morning shift. I never expect to be treated this way especially by a hotel staff of Marriott Standard. No offense, I know mostly foreigner stays in CM but that doesn't mean we Indonesian can't afford to stay there. I believe we do deserve equal treatment even though I don't speak english to the staff doesn't mean i couldn't.

I didnt experience this when i stayed at The Stones Hotel (by Marriott as well) during my previous trip to Bali. I didn't write to ask for respect. Just equal treatment.

Aside from that incident everything was quite perfect and maybe from tomorrow we better start speaking english to be appreciated a lil better.

Looking forward for a better tomorrow. Bed is very comfy we love it very much. Good night."
3048,Beautiful hotel,50,June 2015,"Amazing breakfast, pool access room, well appointed room & bathroom.
Spa was amazing. Treatments so relaxing.
Gym small but adequate
Swimming pool large
Staff were amazing
Best cocktail & snacks from the bar
Beautifully lunches & dinners"
3049,Another outstanding stay,50,October 2015,"We stayed at this property again this year after spending a great time last year already. Brad, the GM is doing an exceptional job with leading his ladies & gentlemen. Everyone is genuine friendly, service is anticipatory, breakfast is great and front office team is doing an outstanding job. An amazing hotel to explore seminyak."
3050,"Great value, clean and amazing breakfast",40,August 2015,"I really enjoyed the hospitality. Rooms were very clean and modern. Plenty of bottled water. The breakfast buffet was amazing. Every culture catered for. Maybe not Eskimos. Pool area great and bar. Only one downside, concierge appear part of the scam for inflated taxi fares."
3051,Disappointing stay,30,November 2015,"We thought a Marriott would be a safe-bet - if a little sterile - but, actually, thought our stay was fairly disappointing. The food - aside from breakfast, which was good, and the pool-side food which was great - was average. Service was fine overall, but we had an issue with the cleanliness of our room and it did take a few requests before it was fixed.

The pool was OK, but heavily chlorinated, and the tall rooms surrounding it made us feel like we were swimming in an apartment complex, rather than a hotel in Bali. The music was so loud that, although fun when you wanted to have a drink at the pool bar, was never relaxing.

The gym was good, and the location is central. The buggy service to various locations is a very helpful and convenient service.

I wouldn't stay at this Marriott, or perhaps any, again."
3052,Best buffet breakfast in beautiful hotel with awesome staff,50,December 2015,"Enjoying a week long holiday here - cannot fault the hotel. The pool and gardens are beautiful and lends itself to relaxation - best lychee martini I have had is served at pool bar!! Daily breakfast in Seminiyak Kitchen is exceptional with good choices of Indonesian , Indian and traditional western buffet - the coffee is as good as any coffee served in cafes IN Melbourne."
3053,Perfection for every type of traveller,50,November 2015,"From the moment of arrival, our stay was superb, you could imagine not needing to leave this reasonably priced hotel for your whole stay!

The Receptionist spoke perfect English and it was an easy and quick process to check in. We upgraded our room in a matter of minutes. Asking whether a fruit platter was included,( it wasn't), however, we were sent one within an hour of arrival - delicious and welcoming.
The room was 554 (twin beds), it was clean, attractive and provided a good sized table and chair. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.

Dining: Fantastic! Whatever your dietary requirement, the head chef and his team were happy to help. A great array of Asian, Western and Vegetarian food was available. The dining set up was modern with dark washed timber finishes and well thought out, I particularly liked that the fruit was kept in clean and clear tubs in a fridge. Small portions were laid out and replenished often, keeping the offerings fresh.
The staff: A +. Helpful, kind and very professional.
Decor of Hotel: Modern, cool architecture, with wide walkways, beautiful tropical gardens and a suprising feel of privacy throughout the hotel.
The pool: Spectacular, 3 sections; the party section with the bar, the relaxing lagoon pool, and the children's pool. Large, sparkling blue and clean, with enough lounges for everyone.
A 24/7 gym is available along with a spa. Well equipped and yoga classes available every morning.
Activities provided every day and concierge helpful and happy to book experiences.
All in all, I will be back! A perfect stay."
3054,Great improvements,40,November 2015,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel when it first opened and we have now returned about a year later. I have to say that the improvements are really noticeable and it is so much better then last time.

We arrived fairly late and was pleasantly surprised to see a familiar face from our last stay. Check in was so much smoother then last time and I absolutely loved the welcome drink, a cold Bintang :) It would be the best one in Bali and just what I felt like arriving late at night.

The room was nice and clean, bed as comfortable as I remember it. The room had a view over the pool and the layout a bit different from the last one we stayed in.

The bathroom was at the back of the room, with a frosted glass door. Unfortunately with the windows in there it meant that the room got brightly lit up early in the morning at sunrise. We have been informed by management though, that this is being rectified at the moment.
I loved the balcony towards the pool, even though it could get a bit noisy during the day it was just a lovely space to sit in during the evening.

Housekeeping services were really great, room was clean and everything replenished properly. Room service was really fast and well presented. Breakfast is so good and I just love their granola.

The only think I was missing was a suitcase valet. There was a padded bench in the middle of the room, but if I wanted to sit there I couldn't as I had to have my suitcase somewhere. The hotel is lovely and it is in a fantastic location. Favourite restaurant up the road, cold beer on the beach 5 minutes away, several great massage places around and if you want to go anywhere else, there are plenty of taxis around.

Its the perfect spot to relax and enjoy."
3055,Outstanding stay,50,November 2015,"Although Thailand is known as the ""land of smiles"" I think the Courtyard Seminyak could give them a run for their money. I've never been at a hotel where every single person, from the grounds staff to pool staff to waiters and front desk had such a warm and genuine smile all of the time.

Upon departure my flight wasn't until the evening so they allowed a late 3 pm checkout and told me that I was welcome to use the facilities for the day. Taking a shower in the fitness center at 7PM made my evening flight a lot more comfortable for me (and those sitting around me).

The Courtyard is a great hotel. I'll be back."
3056,"Courtyard Seminyak, A Perfect Hotel in Bali",50,November 2015,"Entering this hotel , it was a very friendly atmosphere . A spacious lobby with sofas lined up neatly adds to the friendly impression . Especially after swiftly receptionist to help all the needs that we want .

Strategic location of the hotel ( near the beach ) and many facilities in the vicinity. Including a mini market just 20 meters from the hotel . Fancy restaurants , Seminyak Kitchen on the 3rd floor , the more calm us if stomach hunger . Hahaha....

The rooms can also be transformed into a mini office . Where we can work comfortably at all times without being disturbed something . Even if it will receive guests , provided a special room outside the rooms are quite spacious and comfortable .

So, like thinking much less to stay here ? A luxury hotel with perfect service ."
3057,Lovely hotel,40,October 2015,"This hotel was great. Our room was nice and comfortable, room service food was good, breakfast was great. The only downside was our room was quite noisy as it was right near the restaurant.

I would definitely recommend this hotel."
3058,Great all-rounder,50,November 2015,"The courtyard Marriott was such an amazing, beautiful and relaxing hotel. Firstly, we were greeted and checked in super quickly upon arrival. The staff spoke great English and were super accomodating and helpful throughout our stay. They really went out of their way to make our holiday great.
The entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous, green and open with a beautiful large pool and lots of space. The hotel always felt super safe and secure. It was also very clean and tidy. We also experienced no noise from adjoining rooms.
The facilities supplied by the hotel were some of the best I have experienced. The gym was very well stocked with new equiptment and a good about of space and privacy. Also open 24/7.
The buffet breakfast was also perfect. It had something for everyone. A massive variety of fruits, vegetable/salad ingredients, drinks, cereals, traditional Asian foods and other traditional breakfast items such as:eggs, baked beans, potatoes and tomatoes. They also had, pancakes, waffles and ice cream. Impossible to disappoint. The chef was also super accomodating and friendly, asking if we had any requests.
Location was also amazing, close to everything, but safe and away from the noise.
Overall, it was a pleasure to stay there and would 100% return."
3059,Best hotel ever!,50,November 2015,"We stayed there almost 2 weeks and enjoyed every single day. The rooms were great, hose keeping visited us 2-3 times a day. The pool was also nice, there were like sections for pool bar, kids and just for relaxing. We had a pool view and recommend it, because as we walked outside the hotel, the street was very noisy, yet being by the pool or on our balcony, you couldn't hear the street noise at all.
We also visited the hotel's beach club, where you can enjoy the beach and you have the sun beads and service provided by the hotel. Very convenient!
The hotel staff was excellent and made our stay so enjoyable! Definitely recommend!"
3060,Very comfortable,50,October 2015,"I have previously stayed at this hotel a number of times and certainly each time I stay here I feel more at home and this is one reason I return. The location is great, close to restaurants, shopping, supermarket and spa facilities. Now with the added bonus of the buggy ride down to the beach, one cannot complain about the location being away from the beach (you can actually walk). The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive, they were happy to make changes when required regarding meals and location of the room. Any concerns I did have were rectified immediately which is to be commended. I was privileged to meet the manager of the hotel who I must say is one of the very few managers of hotels I have stayed in Bali who actually speaks with guests and is seen around the hotel on a daily basis. This is to be commended and speaks a lot of the kind of man he is and the attitude he takes towards the hotel, guests and what is in the best interests of the owner company, Marriott. My only suggestions (which have been made by several others and I do believe are being looked into), are:
- lack of sunbeds during busy periods however I do believe there will be some placed on the grass areas in the future
- guests leaving towels on sun beds often for hours at a time to 'reserve' them - I appreciate this is difficult to police however perhaps there is an option
- unfortunately the waterfall area has become a 'kid attraction' and although the supervision of children remains the responsibility of the parents and signage does point this out - is there some way of making this area difficult for children to access as this is an accident in the making

In saying this, these are just suggestions and do not detract from the wonderful time I had at this hotel and the fact I will most definitely be returning in April 2016."
3061,Love this hotel,40,November 2015,"I really wanted to give this hotel a five star comment because all the facilities they have, including a battery car to take visitor to a couple of places for free. Serious security check makes tourists feel safe. Good selection of breakfast. My problem is that in the first night, four pillows on my bed were all damp and smelly. I didn't realise that in the first instance until the next morning trying to find out the source of smell. It was disgusting as one of them even had water stains on it. But I do believe this is a mistake by accident."
3062,great breakfast,40,January 2015,"had a nice time here which was helped by the upgrade on arrival to ground floor rooms. The convenience to just walk out to the pool was great.
Rooms were nice and clean with good bedding.
Staff were wonderful.
the breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts that we have had.
My only gripe would be the limited amount of hanging space in the bathroom and slippery outdoor tiles.
Yes I would stay here again but would definitely hope or pay for a ground floor room with the direct pool access."
3063,Feel at Home feeling ....,50,November 2015,"Went to Bali for a special birthday occasion and stayed at this wonderful property for 2 nights .Staff are very warm and friendly who try to make your stay very comfortable by being as helpful as possible.Good location , clean rooms ,excellent service ,good range for breakfast and pool was perfect water temperature.The only thing did not like was the happy hours drinks which had a limited variety and the cocktails were too diluted maybe because of too much ice or not properly mixed(margarita should be included in the list) ,thus settled for beer which also needed to be colder .On the whole a good experience and would rate this property a 9 on a scale of 10.Definately going back to stay there for a family trip after few months.Will give a second review after that stay ........"
3064,Nice Seminyak resort,40,November 2015,"I arrived at 1 pm and the receptionist staff pleasantly allowed me to have early check in and accommodated my request to have a room with the pool view at 6th floor as I come early as a part of a large group with different arrival time.

The hotel itself quite new with sleek modern design, surrounding with chic local boutique and pubs, while the room is spacious enough for 2 people. I personally like the way the table is located in the middle of the room near the entrance door rather stuck it in the side of the wall, made convenient to work in the table without the feeling of being pressed into the wall.

Breakfast was superb, not much selection, but they do provide you with the best selection of food such as egg benedicts & bagels. Sometime the staffs offer you with special dish and special veggies drinks that not available on day today menu to guests, made a feeling of ‚Äònot 100% buffet & being served in restaurant‚Äô ‚Äì I found it great gesture of how the Hotel try to serve guests. The chef also come to the table and ask whether you are satisfied with the food and welcomed any feedbacks.

The security check was very tight, but reminding that it was a US chain hotel and past bombing experience, it was understandable. There were past Tripadvisor review saying that the security dogs frequently panting, I noticed that the hotel provides the dog with drinking water at the side of the dog, so the only challenge for the dog is to handle the heat of Bali‚Äôs sun.

One of the conveniences is that you cannot park your car directly to parking lot in the basement, but rather do a valet parking with no charge, so we can drop directly at hotel‚Äôs lobby.

The only negative thing I can found was the water in the swimming pool was rather cloudy, when you dive, you had difficulties to see the surroundings inside the water, the Hotel should do a water filtration.

Overall I am glad to stay in Courtyard Mariott Seminyak and will plan to go back next year."
3065,Great location,40,October 2015,"We stayed here for a week with 2 friends (2 couples) we got a fabulous deal from Groupon and thought why not!
Rooms had all we needed, modern, with a balcony overlooking the pool. Staff were always friendly and attentive.
Food was fantastic at breakfast but found that lunch was pretty poor, we had 2x lunch vouchers included as well as 2 dinners, after our lunch we decided to forfeit the lunch and dinner ones, I'm not sure why it was so bad but as there are so many amazing restaurants in Seminyak we didn't want to risk wasting a meal there again.
The pool was good, liked the beanbags but on the opposite side of the pool bar there isn't a lot of space and it's on a ledge so didn't feel too comfortable sitting there unless you can turn them horizontally. Cocktails were of an average Australian price between $12-15ish but were awful, we tried several and they were all just sugar syrup and not much else.
We also had spa treatments, although the treatments themselves were great, unfortunately both days we had them were about 5pm, this is when there is live music on, there's no sound proofing so it wasn't relaxing, there was also a group of rowdy people drinking at the bar so it wasn't good, even when the music stopped for a break you can hear people's conversations around the pool, such a shame.
Overall a great time was had, I would stay here again, hopefully the bar will up its game and the spa will get sound proofing!"
3066,Great Expectations Fulfilled,50,November 2015,"Complimentary upgrade (checked), pool view (checked), great breakfast (checked), lovely and friendly staff (checked), complimentary buggy rides to the main roads to minimise walking under heat (checked), tight security (checked) and above all, most refreshing welcome drink at concierge (checked).

This is above and beyond the fabulous facilities including a splendid pool, mini kids club (well thought of) and entertaining live music by the pool bar. Oh, the aquatic aerobics in the pool in the morning too ! It is very hard for us to say goodbye but we will surely be back.

Keep up the good work, folks :)"
3067,Great Place,50,November 2015,"Really Great Place, very comfort and great hospitality. The food was superb delicious, the presentation also awesome. Been here for seminars, also great service from the staff for the seminar requirements. have valet parking. great pool."
3068,Great hotel,50,November 2015,"We got unexpected upgrade.... Maybe because Bali was so quiet at this time. The front office staff were very friendly and offer us the upgrade. We stayed 3 nights and breakfast were amazing. They always changed few items in their menu. My only complaint is the juice. I wish they could offer less selection but replace it with fresh juices. Room attendants, front office, concierges are very friendly and quite helpful. We definitely coming back here."
3069,Lovely and Attentive,50,November 2015,"Though not on the beach, the hotel does have a beach spot that they will take you to, and it has lounges. The beach is lovely with plenty of space to walk and collect sand dollars and shells. Breakfast at the resort is wonderful (free). The pool has little call bells to call the waiters to bring you food/drinks. How convenient. You have to pay for the food/drinks but still very now. Rooms are nice with great AC and wonderful showers. Close to shops and restaurants."
3070,Best breakfast buffet!,40,November 2015,"The check in was pleasant in which the staff brought us a welcome drink and a fruit Popsicle. Our room was situation right by the restaurant and faces the pool. Room size was a bit tight for two people-but the bathroom was huge. The room smelled musty as we walked in-however it dissipated as the air conditioner was turned on. The sheets needed to be changed as there were black marks on it (black mold?) I have travelled through Asia many times and this is the best breakfast buffet I have ever had. It had the Asian items I liked (noodle soup, congee) along with the western items such as bagels, waffles, ice cream, sausage,eggs. Location was great as it was close to the beach and many different massage places and restaurants."
3071,Return guests,40,November 2015,"My husband and I arrived at the Courtyard Marriott to a beautiful warm welcome from Melinda de Vos the public relation officer. Due to being a Marriott Gold member we received an upgrade to a beautiful suite overlooking the pool. This hotel is one of the friendliest in Bali and the staff our brilliant. I would like to make a Special mention of Brad the General Manager for making us feel welcome and also to Hari the Poolbar Attendant, to Widy the Aerobics Instructor, Dede the Poolbar Waiter. These people were responsible to making our stay memorable. Thank you all at the Courtyard Marriott and we certainly will be recommending this hotel to all our family and friends in Australia."
3072,Excellent hotel,40,October 2015,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a little bit of class and a hotel that has been built recently. The staff were excellent and even room service / housekeeping was very punctual. The rooms were very big, as was the bathroom with a shower that could fit in at least 6 to 8 people. The breakfast was outstanding and the best we have had in Bali with 13 previous holidays there. If you were lying around the pool at about 11:30 a man would bring around fruit juice icy poles for everyone. The hotel also had a golf buggy type shuttle that would take you down to Double 6 beach which was opposite the Double 6 Hotel and roof bar to watch the sunset or any time of the day. The shuttle would also take you up to the top of Eat Street in Seminyak, but only up to 6pm."
3073,Wonderful Experience - Pity about the architecture,40,September 2015,"Firstly the negative. This is very a personal view. I'm guessing the amount of land this hotel is based on has a reflection on the type of structure. I found it austere and somewhat reminded me of a gaol or government building. That aside, this is a first class hotel. THE FACILITIES: First class across the board including a kids club. So for families this is a welcome change from mega hotels that lack real service in the Tuban/Kuta area. In particular the kids pool area is terrific. There is a first class gym. THE ROOMS: I upgraded to a ground floor room which was based at the extremity of the hotel. Initially I thought this was going to be a disadvantage but turned out to be advantageous. They're well presented with all the facilities you'd expect in this kind of hotel. THE STAFF: Having visited many 5 star hotels in Bali, this one is a stand out. They're helpful, friendly and efficient. Hats off to HR for their training regime. I didn't experience any of the usual ""When in Bali expect Bali service"". THE LOCATION: Well, it's Seminyak which used to be the ""elite"" end of the destination strip. There's plenty of hustle and bustle however whilst in the hotel you don't get roosters crowing and day break, vehicles racing around or construction noise."
3074,"Good Gym, Breakfast & Pool, Quite Busy",40,November 2015,"We stayed at the Marriott for 6 night when delayed due to the Volcano in Lombok. They were great, we came from Jimbaran with nowhere to stay and they booked us in straight away with a fairly good rate. If you want a quiet relaxing place this is probably not the best as its very busy with australian tourists, and in a very busy street however its very convenient and has great facilities and poolbar if you are after a more lively holiday. The breakfast was great, I dont usually liek buffets but it was done really nicely and so much to choose from. The gym and spa were really great, nice spa atmosphere and great to find a hotel gym with good equipment. The reception staff were obviously a little tired / over so many tourists as usually the locals are so so welcoming and beautiful and they (some) were quite snappy and over it however they would have had to deal with a lot with all of the stranded tourists."
3075,Great surprise!,40,November 2015,"Stayed for 4 nights on a business-leisure trip.

First room was unacceptable, not because it was noisy (facing the street), but in the morning when the locals burned garbage in an empty lot across from our room, the smell and smokes came through the bottom part of the sliding glass door!
Obviously that was a faulty design of the door, allowing evening street noise and smells from the outside, in!
Second night we were moved to pool view, much quieter at night, and no more burning garbage smokes in the morning!!

Bed is comfortable, room is a good size, cleaning crew did well every day.
Breakfast is expansive and good varieties, although the coffee 'team' could've come around more often to check if anyone needs refills or not.
Pool bar staff was efficient and friendly.
Concierge and Security teams were always friendly and helpful.

The 'bomb-sniffing' dogs look a bit bored and tired.
The Goldens were panting excessively, probably due to their long hair and the heat.
I made sure I visited them 3-4 times a day while they're on their shifts, just to say hello..."
3076,Fantastic Hotel,50,October 2015,We recently stayed at the hotel during the caos of the volcano disruptions. Mum and I had a great time and will definitely return to stay here when we return to Bali. Seminyak kitchen is wonderful for buffet breakfast and it was a relief to know that they also make espresso coffee. I would like to commend and thank Brad (Hotel Manager) and his his beautiful staff for making us feel comfortable during our 3 night delay.
3077,Great Hotel but room staff need a shake up,40,October 2015,"Hotel was in a great location, breakfast was great. Only complaint was that we stayed 7 nights and 6 of these nights when our room was made up we had no towels every night we had to rang house keeping was were told we are very sorry and the towels were delivered but it kept on happening. Not sure what happened there. Would stay gain"
3078,Nice hotel in a lively location,40,October 2015,My friend and I had a pleasant 4 day stay here at the Courtyard. The rooms were very comfortable with a nice bathroom. We had a balcony with views of the pool and garden. The alternate view (which I wouldn't recommend) is a busy street view. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The hotel also serves a pretty good buffet breakfast. It's a quick walk to the beach and even nearer to shops and restaurants along Seminyak. Hiring a car and driver is quite easy for other sightseeing destinations.
3079,Girls trip to Bali 2015,40,November 2015,"We checked into the Courtyard on Sunday, 1 November. At first my room seemed to have a damp smell and when I contacted reception about it they did everything they could to help find me another room on the same floor as my friends. When we were unable to find a room the staff offered to have the room sprayed with sanitizer/deodorant, which did wonders. I was very happy with the prompt service! Thank you!
Otherwise, my room was very comfortable and clean.

The hotel has an amazing pool, great breakfast buffet, convenient and is in a central location in Seminyak. The staff are very helpful and friendly and the driver service offered at concierge was very helpful - 100,000IDR to take you to almost anywhere you want to go.

Due to the Rinjani Volcano eruption during our stay, we were able to keep our rooms for an extra night and were only charged 800,000IDR, half the nightly rate, when we didn't need it. We got to check out at 7:30pm!

I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a luxurious experience for a fair price!"
3080,Busy Hotel with great staff & BIG pool,40,November 2015,"I returned to this hotel after an amazing stay with them last year. Since it is a new hotel, everything is new and great. The room is good and there are 2 different sizes although they claim to be the same. The first room was terrible and nothing like the one we stayed last year. We ask for a change and the staff was quick to attend to our request and everything was back to normal. Asking for high floor will be a wise choice as the pool can be quite noisy with lots of music. Lunch at the poolside bar is also very good. Spa is good value for money with monthly promotion treats at INR550k for 2 hours, a great steal with excellent ambience. The breakfast place serves good food and coffee.

I love the big pool but it is getting so busy when many has discovered this gem. It is situated in a convenient location, but traffic is extremely busy. Spa Bali is just next door and there are so many eateries and breakfast place nearby, within walking distance, which means it is not necessary to have breakfast in the hotel. There is a supermarket about 15 mins walk away.

To conclude, room is above average but everything else is well above expectation. So rated very good."
3081,Very impressive,40,November 2015,"Seminyak is probably not the ideal place to be if you're looking for the tranquil Bali experience and we would definitely stay in a different location if on vacation. However, I stayed at the hotel for a week on conference and was really impressed. The room (pool King suite) was spacious, very functional and extremely comfortable. Although previous contributors have complained about the level of noise from the pool late in the evening, the hotel staff definitely seemed attuned to the issue so no problems there. Quality of food is high and service is friendly and efficient. Security is obviously a big concern in Bali, but again it is dealt with at the hotel in a very friendly but efficient way. All in all, pretty faultless."
3082,Modern & good location,40,October 2015,"Close to beach and shopping. Courtesy shuttle buggy to the beach and centre of seminyak if you don't want to walk. Breakfasts (buffet) are fantastic as is pool area. Rooms are spacious and very nice (must get pool view). Staff at reception, breakfast and pool bar (Hari) were welcoming, helpful and friendly. Good spot to stay if looking at seminyak."
3083,"If you love sunning by the pool, choose another hotel!",30,August 2015,"We booked this hotel and airfaire on a wotif package deal, which was pretty good
Cant complain about the price, or even the hotel
Its located just one block from the beach, a 3 minute walk, and close by everything
They have a golf cart that will take you to Eat Street if you dont want to walk
The breakfast included was vast and plentiful
The room was all it needed to be
Everything was very clean and modern as this hotel is only about 2 years old
The main reason why I wouldnt stay again, is the pool is in the middle of the three blocks, like a courtyard, and it only gets sun on one side for the morning, and by 2pm its pretty much gone, with the buildings obstructing the sun

This is a deal breaker for me, as i love the sun, and love to lay by the pool, or in the pool bar, not in shade but sun

So, if that doesnt worry you, by all means book this place. Nothing else wrong with it
Me the sunseeker, I wish i had stayed at the first place I considered, The Pullman in Legian, walked past it, and it has an awesome full sun rooftop pool!"
3084,Everything you want in an upmarket hotel,50,August 2015,"This is a new hotel in Seminyak and represents a good value option for someone that wants to stay in exciting Seminyak but doesn't want to pay the high prices charged by beach front resorts. That said - the beach is only a five minute walk away & Marriott does have beach chairs opposite double 6 resort (12 minutes‚Äô walk) or a quick buggy ride away. Marriott is also very close to a wide selection of restaurants, markets, trendy shops & mini-marts
Check in was easy & we used the Hotel transport from the airport which was safe & quick. Our room was a one bedroom on the 5th floor and we had no complaints. It was spacious with a comfortable bed and a great bathroom area. The lounge area was also usable & had a small but practical balcony with a comfy chair. The fridge was tiny & for a one bedroom should have been larger I thought. The air con worked well & was not noisy.
Most rooms face in to the 2 pools & this is a better option than rooms facing the busy road. This does come with some noise from the pool (mainly kids) & pool bar at times - but this did not worry us. Of more concern was that the walls did seem to carry sound easily, we only realised this on the 5th night when a small herd of elephants moved next door & banged & crashed around for 2 nights. (For this I blame next door - not the hotel).
The 2 swimming pools were both excellent. One had a great swim up bar & was used for a bit of water aerobics or yoga daily. It was surrounded by bean bag chairs but also many lounge chairs in the sun on a large grassy area at one end. The other pool is long enough to do laps & is surrounded by greenery & lounge chairs. It also has a kid‚Äôs pool at the far end, slightly separated & next to the child center. Chairs catered to both sun worshipers & shade seekers equally. I thought the chairs were a bit close to your neighbour for personal space comfort - but on the whole, the pool area was pleasant & very well attended by staff. If you left your pool chair unattended for more than 30 minutes pool staff would remove your belongings - this stopped most chair tagging. The free ice blocks mid-morning were also a great idea.
Breakfast was top quality & always tasty & room service was possibly the best we have ever had. Our first night dinner at the restaurant was also a success.
Overall this hotel should not disappoint & we would stay again."
3085,Super staff,40,October 2015,My favorite staff member is definitely Hari-Yato (I'm not sure of the spelling) He is a Javanese guy who took us for a couple of the complimentary classes in the fitness center here. Cruiser guy who's flexibility and strength is not immediately apparent. After the class he gave me some personalized stretching exercises! Everyone else is fantastic. Staying on the ground floor is fun as courtyard doors face the pool
3086,Amazing service!,50,November 2015,"Amazing people! Every single staff we met were so thoughtful since the very first minute!

We only stayed 5 days, and on the 4th day we wanted to go to do water sports in Nusa Dua, went to the lobby downstairs at about 2pm and ask the staff to help us book a blue bird taxi. The staff didn't only just call the taxi, he called places at Nusa Dua to make sure the water sports was still open! And turns out they weren't! If it wasn't for him, we would have wasted a day! He also helped us plan our water sports for the next day.

Another example is that we went downstairs and asked the staff for a recommended restaurant, after about 5 minutes, not only did we get out recommended restaurant but they also helped us book whatever we wanted to do i.e. The lunch place, spa and the drivers to pick us up!

Wouldn't stay anywhere else! This place is the best :)"
3087,Fantastic hotel highly recommend,50,October 2015,"To Brad and all the staff at the courtyard Marriott ,what a fantastic time we are having at your hotel will definetly be recommending to all our friends and hope to return ourselves thank you Brad for the fab welcome we got on arrival and all your staff are terrific xxx Kay and Bobby Buckley"
3088,Great stay!,40,September 2015,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel, buffet breakfast was good (although we did get tired eating the same stuff by day 4). The pool was great, too. My only complaint was the kids by the pool, some were really obnoxious and didn't really care about other guests and were screaming and splashing water, etc. Loved that they had a buggy that took you to Seminyak Beach and there are lounges catered for hotel guests only.

Overall, lovely stay and would definitely be back!"
3089,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service",50,October 2015,"We only stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 1 night, and I wish we could have stayed there for many, many more! The hotel was beautiful - very modern. The pool was fantastic, and there was plenty of seating around it - including seating down by the swim-up bar. All the staff members we met were very friendly and helpful. All of the meals and drinks that we had there -- ordered lunch poolside, enjoyed happy hour drinks by the pool, and indulged in the incredible breakfast buffet -- were amazing. (The breakfast buffet in particular was far and away the most sumptuous spread I have ever seen.) We would definitely return!"
3090,"Great resort, possibly the best we have ever stayed at.",50,September 2015,"We stayed for ten days on the 6th floor our room was excellent, we did not hear any noise. The staff were absolutely marvelous, nothing was to much trouble for them, they were always happy. Meals & service in the dining room were first class. The front of desk staff were always very helpful. We were also close to a lot of first class restaurants near the resort. We would have no hesitation in returning to this resort."
3091,Modern and in good location,50,October 2015,"Stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 7 nights. A beautiful hotel if you just want to hang out by the pools and relax, which we did a lot. There are several pool areas, one with a swim up bar. Great breakfast restaurant with almost everything you can think of. Service was excellent. One suggestion - there is a pool near the kids club for children, if you are not travelling with children ask for a room not overlooking this area."
3092,Cracker,50,October 2015,"Great place to stay , deluxe pool room , great facilities in room . Super helpful staff . Awesome breakfast / kitchen . Pool bar is fairly steep !! The only prob is this place has heaps of families with kiddies who love getting in the pool at sunrise, so sleeping in is not an option ."
3093,Miss,50,October 2015,"Friendly staff. Well spoken. Professional and pleasant. Welcomed with an ice tea, a Popsicle and a cold towel. Fairly new resort. Room was very nice. Neutral decor. Calming colour tones. Air conditioning In the rooms was excellent. Comfortable beds but pillows way too soft. Love the bathroom with its natural light Windows. Very spacious. Shower was amazing. Perfect water pressure with two types of shower heads. Pool was lovely, although the hotel does not police or enforce the 30min rule use of the pool chairs so selfish guests hog the chairs all day even when they are not at the pool. The security upon entering seems a little bit of a farse. They make you put your bags through a security scanner everytime you enter the property but no one is checking the screens so what's the point. The security dog seems overheated üò¢. Poor thing. I did tell the hotel staff about this and they said a lot of guests mention this. They need to look after the animal given guests from other countries love dogs and get distressed looking at him panting. The Spa rooms (used for spa treatments and massages) at this resort called Zanti Spa were EXCELLENT. Very clean, calming, private, professional. They use good quality products and the treatments are reasonably priced. Would rather pay extra and have a massage in clean facilities like this as opposed to cheap massages on the street. Had a lovely body massage. Each spa room has a bath tub, shower and toilet. Would highly recommend."
3094,"Great hotel, noisy families!",40,October 2015,"Just stayed here for 4 nights. Lovely hotel, very close to the beach (you can take a buggy if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk to the beach club) and close to shops/restaurants. Staff all very friendly and helpful and our room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet had a huge range of different foods, was delicious every morning. Our room was on the 6th floor, overlooking the pool which was the only problem, noisy families swimming in the pool at 6am with their screaming, shouting kids. Unfortunately we could hear it up in our room. Not the hotels fault, just inconsiderate people. Other than that, can't fault our stay!"
3095,"Good quality, just far enough from the hustle and bustle.",40,October 2015,"The quality of service is what you would expect from a Marriott. The rooms were well maintained, the grounds neat and tidy, and the quality of service was very good.
The hotel is built around a central set of linked pools, and while this offers a nice view, it can be a bit noisy once everyone returns from their day trips.
The staff were very helpful, and were able to answer any of our questions, and accommodate our requirements.
Breakfast and Wi-fi were part of the deal. Breakfast was quite busy, and you did need to be patient a little. The selection for breakfast was fair, with a mixture of western and Asian choices, and while filling, was a little limited. Lunch and dinner options were also a little limiting, but offer choice for a few days - the quality of food was quite good.
The hotel seemed to cater for the families and up to middle aged crowd, and the location was just far away from Kuta and Legian, while not being to far, and was an easy 5 min walk to Seminyak beach with a number of restaurants to cater for your needs.
The Marriott meet all our needs, was reasonably priced and a good location, we thought it good value for money and quite comfortable."
3096,It's a pity I only have two thumbs ...,50,October 2015,"... or I'd certainly be giving the Marriott Courtyard 5 thumbs up! We came for a school break and what a wonderful getaway. From the minute we arrived the staff was warm and welcoming, including offering us welcome drinks and cool towels. Our room wasn't ready yet when we arrived so they seated us comfortably at the pool bar to relax and enjoy a drink - a nice start to a wind down break. When our room was ready they brought our keys to us at the pool bar and we found our room clean, spacious and comfortable. The cotton candy and popcorn offered daily in the reception area was especially popular with our daughter. The generous breakfast buffet was very comprehensive with fresh juice, fruit, cheeses, meats, salad, many baked items, hot dishes and made to order eggs. Amazing value for money all around. Would love to come back again. A special shout out to Laura at the front desk for her cheerful, smiling assistance throughout our stay!"
3097,The Suite is FABULOUS!.,50,October 2015,"I stayed there for just a (unfortunately) nite, so that I unable to stroll around the hotel and its surrounding.

However, at a glance, I can say that it is a very beautiful hotel and not to say comfortable suite I stayed in. The pool is intriguing, breakfast so great.

The staff is really helpful in a way as I dont have that much time to interact i cant say much. But I can say as well that Daniel the manager is really courteous yet humble.

Will def go back there!."
3098,Nice for a quick stay,30,October 2015,"The hotel is fairly new and the rooms are on the small side. Our room was on the sixth floor overlooking the pool and every morning at 5.30am screaming kids were in the pool making noise which echoed up into our room, not ideal. I was concerned for the kids safety as no parents were in sight......the hotel staff were obviously not concerned as they let this continue every morning of our three night stay. Overall the hotel is not our cup of tea, the pool was full of yelling drunk parents while the kids ran wild and that's just not our thing. The breakfast was fresh and tasty and the staff were very nice and polite."
3099,Would definitely return,50,October 2015,"We had a great stay at the Marriott. Well appointed rooms, great service and value for money. The hotel is well taken care of, clean in all areas and lovely gardens very well maintained! The room was well thought out, with a great big comfy bed, balcony overlooking the pool and an amazing shower. We really did love the huge walk-in shower! Lots of staff around who were all friendly and attentive. Greeted every time we left or returned to the hotel. The pool area was very relaxing, 2 pools + swim up pool bar and comfy loungers around. Not too noisy during our stay despite children around. 2-for-1 cocktails during happy hour and good service poolside also. Food & bev was very reasonably priced throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet had a great variety also. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and wished it could have been longer!"
3100,A real find...,50,October 2015,"We stayed prior to this at the karma resort for a 2 nights in Nusa Dua which was a real haven of relaxation. We arrived at the busier and noisier Marriott hotel expecting the peace to disappear and be stuck in a brash family hotel.

Over the 5 nights we can only share the most positive of experiences and would highly recommend anyone wanting a holiday of real value with a touch of modernity, relaxation, family orientated (but not confined to) and proximity to the hub of activity but far enough away to hide and an all round great experience in Bali.

Service was absolutely outstanding from the start and all through the week. The staff were absolutely lovely, all had a smile and actually wanted to work here. I would come back just for this (so hard to find).

The room was wonderfully relaxing and well designed and the general design of the property was well thought through and of high quality.

Kids club was one of the best - again well thought through, well 'stocked' and the staff - Santi thank you - were awesome.

Food was varied and of good quality both by the pool and in the restaurant. Evening entertainment was available but not over powering. Lots of transport options to the shops and restaurants and walking distance to others. The beach was also in very easy reach which we hardly used. If you are interested in fitness in any way bring your kit and enjoy the beach early in the morning with the locals, expats and holidayers.

The only downsides were some (I feel old saying this!!) rowdy groups in the pool (only a couple of days) who hadn't worked out that excessive sun and booze don't really mix and perhaps the music being a little loud and heavy than suited the ambience... A little more Bali chill out please then techno dance music.

Will happily come back here as it was incredible value and amazing service to the point where you didn't need to think. Thank you to all especially Santi in the kids club, the sous chef and the customer rep (sorry forgot the names üòî)"
3101,Mcfc.uk,50,October 2015,"Stayed in this great hotel for 10 days. Fantastic rooms, great pool
and fantastic staff. From Melinda at reception, farhual in housekeeping to putra in the seminyak kitchen, a consistently high level of service from each and every member of staff. A credit to the marriot name."
3102,No need to bring your toothbrush,40,October 2015,"We stayed here on a Luxury Escapes deal. Very nice hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms had everything you would need and it was a real pleasure to go into the bathroom. Toothbrushes and paste provided. Bed was very comfy.
The breakfast was probably the best I have experienced. The waffles with ice cream, fruit and sauces were a real treat. We had a lunch and dinner included in the deal and both were excellent..
It could be a little difficult to find a lounger by the pool at times but there is nothing to be done about this as there is no room for any more. Pool was perfect as there was no real deep end. I was surprised that there was no shade at all around the kiddies pool. I really think that it is needed there more than anywhere.
On the whole we had a great stay. The hotel is also in a convenient position within easy walking distance of the beach and restaurants.
One issue was that on 2 occasions our room wasn't serviced until after 4pm which was not really convenient."
3103,Great hotel with a happening atmosphere,50,October 2015,"Got a great deal on travel asia package the hotel ran. Included a upgraded from regular room to a full suite at check-in, US$100 in dining credit, and bucket of beer. My status also got me a 15% discount on all food, drinks and spa. So great value overall, I was quite impressed!

The suite itself was awesome -- everything we needed! I loved the large walk-in shower and the bluetooth sound system in the room.

The pool area seemed to be the happening area in the afternoon, which was busy but not so busy you couldn't find a chair / umbrella. The pool was divided nicely with kids area at one end and the adults bar at the other end. So even though there were a few screaming children -- they were far enough away that it could have sounded like a bird cry in the distance.

The pool service was great too! There was a button next to each seat to call for service, so you didn't have to wave someone down. Very reasonable prices and good quality drinks/food. We ended up eating and drinking by the pool most days.

I really liked the breakfast buffet as well. The service was excellent and they had a great variety of high quality food. Didn't know they had specialty coffee like cappuccinos you could order as part of breakfast until the last day, damn!

The check-out was confusing a bit because the 15% discount I got was super confusing. Some of the dining they took off the discount before posting it to the room, some of it they did after it posted, and some they forgot to take it off. So I spent a good half hour at reception having them print out every bill so I could check it over. I guess there system is limited in how these discounts / promotions work. I also had to request them taking off the $100 dining credit, as it didn't come off automatically. So for check-out I'd have to say it should have been more seamless, but I'm glad the front desk staff were very helpful in making sure I was happy with the final bill.

Bottom line: great hotel, loved the atmosphere, and would for sure come back if I'm in the area again!"
3104,You pay peanuts,30,October 2015,"It's relative. The CM offers great value deals. Subsequently the quality of the hotel is commensurate with the price. Average. The place is like a thousand other average hotels. Big breakfasts where you queue up for milk , eggs etc. Noisy, lots of kids, good location. No complaints really but there is no 'wow'. One nice aspect is the live musicians in the late afternoons. The staff are lovely. The security X-ray machine is a bit over the top"
3105,Awesome Hotel!,50,October 2015,"I expected less when looking at this hotel at the first time i arrived, then it turned out to be a great stay! The hospitality is awesome. I checked in on 3pm, but the room wasn't ready. The receptionist told me that i had to wait for at least an hour. And she gave us drinks complimentary at the bar by the pool. And they always knew your name anytime i call to receptionist or room service. It was a nice gesture.
The hotel and the room is modern, nicely decorated and clean. The breakfast was delicious. The pool is big enough and clean. They have this tight security check and it is okay.
The location is fine. I have good shopping time at the store nearby. Just turn left from the hotel, then turn right. Many good stores there.
I had a nice pool view room at 3rd floor with balcony. The bed is very comfortable. No bathtub but it's okay. I booked big breakfast deal at Agoda and it turned out to be value for money. I would definitely coming back! :)"
3106,Much Better Than Expected,50,October 2015,"Stayed here several days with friends from Hong Kong. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite room on the 6th floor. Although a 4-star property and not exactly situated next to the beach, we left pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the stay we had.

With our upgrade, there wasn't really much to complain about the room. WIFI was free and easily available in all parts of the property. If there's anything at all, it's very minor. For example, although there were three of us in the room, housekeeping only left one small shower gel for our use, which is sufficient if no one went to the beach/pool/gym.

Breakfast was good with the usual choice of offering as befitting a good hotel in Asia. Despite the occupancy levels, food and beverages were replenish regularly. We can tell that the Executive Chef is really on the ball, personally inspecting every day that we were there. Kudos to him.

The negative for the Courtyard Marriott? It is not situated by the beach although it is less than 500 meters away. The hotel tries to remedy this by having buggies available to bring guests to the beach and the little ""beach club"" it has near the Double Six Resort. The buggies are also available to send you to the shopping and dining areas of Seminyak although they don't do pick up for the return journey except from the ""beach club"".

One small suggestion to the hotel would be to locate a small washing area to wash off sand from the slippers/feet after coming back from the beach. Right now, you will have to walk towards the end of the pool area to find the shower area.

And also be warn about the tighter security as befitting a US-based hotel chain. Food-wise, there's plenty of choices around but we do suggest giving the Chez Gado Gado opposite the Anantara and right next to the beach, a try.

So, will we return? You bet. Despite the distance from the beach, it is still just a short walk and the sunsets are truly divine here."
3107,excellent experience (only) if you book during a school term,50,October 2015,"Once again, the pictures and website tell the story. Marriott have gone with the local idea of building an enclosed space so that you can live well inside and away from the external world. The hotel is modern and the service is excellent, as is the restaurant (both breakfast and meals).

Because of the location that is not central, the management has two golf buggies that you can use to go to Seminyak high street or the beach for free. You can also walk 10' to the beach or take a cab to 'trendy Semi' for 30,000 ruppies ($2). There are a number of good beach breaks and the crowds have spaced out since Kuta.

The trick is : Marriott have a very reactive pricing policy and Bali is Australia's backyard. As a result prices shoot up during kangaroo holidays, which sadly is most of the best season but you can get a very good deal if you book directly with the hotel for the off-peak season (large restaurant credit, free beers, room upgrade, airport pick-up etc)."
3108,Courtyard Marroit Seminyak,20,October 2015,"The Hotel its self is lovely check in efficient, staff friendly, breakfast excellent. We had a pool side room but thats where the hotel is let down . Approximately only 50 sunlounges to cater for all the guests. So in the morning people get up early to secure a sun bed this leads to friction between guests. The Hotel appears to have pitched its marketing towards young families (nothing wrong with that ) but if you are passed the days of children running & screaming all day maybe reseach a quieter venue."
3109,Great overall hotel,50,October 2015,"It was our first stay in this hotel. The service is of a high level and staff very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and clean and the the mattress we found very comfortable. Because of the lay out and structure of the hotel there was always a nice breeze, therefore we sat on our balcony may times. The hotel grounds are well kept and there are plenty of beds in the pool area. The hotel is in a quieter area of Seminyak, but still close to many great restaurants and close to the beach. We found the breakfast at the hotel one of the best we had in Bali."
3110,wonderful experience in Courtyard Marriott,50,October 2015,"I spend my holiday here for two days, I only need 5 minutes to check in since I already check in via mobile apps. The managers gives me a herbal drink when I wait for taking my key and also offering me sweet mango ice. The staff are nice and friendly. When I forgot to bring my medicine the staff takes initiatives to drop me using boogie car to nearest apotek nears laka laka. They have 2 boogies to pick you to the beach and places near hotel but you should be patient because in rush hours 5-6pm people want to see sunset in the beach and I have to wait in lobby for 45 minutes and sometimes you get cheat by other visitors who already impatient to queue. But if you want to walk it only take 10-15 minutes of walking since the beach is 500m from hotel. I also tried the beach lounge, it safe enough to left all your belonging there since there are staffs who taking care of yours. I would recommend that Marriott also pen restaurant or small bar there. Overall I really love the experience in Marriott and oh.. especially the food for breakfast is very delicious ! however I only notes two thing slightly need to improve : First, the staff will pay attention more on foreigner tourist rather than local tourist proven by when someone cut the line when check in and when queue for boogie. Second, when I want to check out though apps I just want to check my bill first but it's directly count as check out, then the receptionist call me and told me to packed my bag soon."
3111,Wonderful!,50,October 2015,"We (wife and I) arrived early on Tuesday October 13, 2015. The hotel accommodated us with an early check in and we appreciated it. The hotel is situated nicely and just five blocks fromt he beach. The hotel is very clean as are the poolside rooms. The breakfast was wonderful as was the pool bar food and drinks. Staff very nice. A truly wonderful place to stay."
3112,Cody home away from home,40,October 2015,We Stayed for three nights and left satisfied. Rooms were spacious with attached balconies and bathrooms with all amenities and even grab bars for seniors. Special mention of the bed quality .. just so comfortable we slept well every night. Front desk staff extremely polite and efficient and housekeeping done regularly with change of towels. The restaurants Seminyak served wholesome breakfast. Everything you can expect in a four star accommodation fitted the bill. Wish they would have some extra frills like happy hours or complimentary tea and snacks at specified time to become more customer friendly. What I loved was the security arrangement though annoying to walk through the scanner every time you returned to the hotel. But safety is important!
3113,"Great rooms & service, short walk to the beach",40,July 2015,"Stayed for 8 nights and loved it.
Great room although not a lot of storage / hanging space in the wardrobe.
Breakfast buffet was sensational and lunch served at the pool was excellent but would not recommend having dinner here. Massages were great and gym is perfect for a quick workout.

Short walking distance to the beach.

We were offered to purchase hotel credits at check-in and purchased 2 credits each worth AUD100 for AUD80, so effectively got a 20% discount on drinks & food we consumed.

Only negative things we found were the pool being way too cold as it wasn't solar heated and the cocktails being very average (especially in view of the price tag)."
3114,Lovely modern hotel,50,September 2015,"We stayed here with our two young children in a connecting room. We were very pleased and would absolutely come back in a heart beat. Amazing value and beautiful rooms.
The buffet breaky was amazing too!

The only negative, was the location says seminyak but to me its more legian. So just be aware if you think you will be in the heart of seminyak its still a 10-15 min cab ride away. :)"
3115,"Elite customer service, Luxurious rooms and pool!",50,October 2015,"From the time you come in to the time you leave, from the guard, the front desk officer, the bell boy, excellent customer service was just overflowing. They will remember all the small details of your requests

My 1 small thing about this hotel is that a bath tub wont come with a superior, deluxe or a junior suite. I'm a Marriott rewards member and would typically take Marriott hotels, I kinda have a perception that a bathtub is pretty standard with deluxe rooms these days.

Other than that, this hotel is like every other Marriott. Top notch quality, food, service and amenities."
3116,Great Stay and Service orientation,50,September 2015,Had a great stay at Marriot...the staff is very helpful...and good location just 2-3 min from seminiyak beach....pool is awesome and had a grt time....would highly recommend this hotel...only food variety for indians can be included...
3117,Excellent hotel service!,50,January 2015,"I have only had a chance to write this review after our stay in January 2015. I just wanted to say a HUGE thank you to all the staff who's made our holiday so much more enjoyable! I have stayed in a lot of Marriott Hotels including Courtyard and other luxury hotels and this is by far the best hotel ever stayed all because of the service we received the entire stay. All the staff in each department (housekeeping, room service, restaurant, front office, bell) were always consistent with offering the genuine hospitality that you don't always get from other hotels. Nothing was ever too hard or too much with my constant demands (due to my 2 year old being sick with gastro) and it was only returned with a kind smile and a genuine care. What was supposed to be a not-so-fun holiday turned out to be one of our best!
Thank you Mr Brad Edman!! You should be an inspiration to all the hotel general managers! I truly commend all the staff for having the passion in what they do! We will definitely return soon.."
3118,Luxurious Rooms and Pool,50,September 2015,"The Courtyard Marriott provides luxury at an affordable price. The rooms include a safe,balcony and a huge bathroom. Most rooms overlook three incorporated swimming pools where children are safe and active people can swim laps. At one end is a bar which can also provide meals. Adjacent is an open roofed area that provides nightly entertainment. At the other end of the pool is a play room for children.
The breakfast buffet, which is included in the tariff, provides a wide choice and you can have it delivered to your room. At your cost lunch is a smorgasbord and the evening meal is an A'la Carte Menu.
There are a range of free activities provide each day such as Yoga and Tia Chi.
The beach is within walking distance but you can also use a shuttle service provided free by the Marriott. The beach has some outstanding restaurants and similar quality restaurants are available up town. Nearby in Seminyak Road are some outstanding and varied shops that will keep the most ardent shopper occupied for the duration of their stay.
There are a number tour outlets or you can hire a driver for the day at about $50 US a day.
Except for shopping, ocean swimming and a change of restaurant you do not need to leave the hotel just have a relaxing holiday."
3119,8 Nights in Paradise,50,September 2015,"Me and my partner stayed at this resort for 8 nights and i can safely say after much research and reading reviews on so many hotels and resorts that we made a great decision. First time travelling to bali we didn't know where to stay and taking advice from our friends just confused us on where to stay even more. Definitely worth the money!! The pool and bar is great always had a sunbed available, and the buffet breakfast was excellent with much to choose from and always cooked fresh!! we had a seafood buffet one of the nights at the kitchen which was also AMAZING!! We will definitely stay again if we come to bali and will also recommend our family and friends!! if anyone has questions or queries i will be more than happy to answer where i can!!"
3120,Great value and service in a hotel that offers more than expected,40,September 2015,"Certain brand categories carry certain expectations and staying at the Courtyard by Marriott certainly is one example where those expectations are far exceeded! This is a wonderful hotel property that is nicely located --- meaning that the location is good for close proximity to the beach as well as other things of interest in Seminyak. The room and the public areas are very nice and well maintained.

I have to commend the staff as they were extremely helpful prior to and during my stay! In advance of my arrival, I arranged for transportation provided by the hotel to pick me up at the airport. Similarly, I booked a driver for a six-hour day excursion through the hotel. In both cases, everything was scheduled and handled very well! I also was surprised at how the front desk staff always seemed to know my name, as they greeted me as such when I'd approach with a question. I was very impressed with that level of attention to detail!

The pool area if very nice and the breakfast buffet was definitely far beyond what would be expected in this hotel category. On some level, it rivals what one would receive in a hotel/resort category that is 1 or 2 levels higher.

All in all, if one doesn't mind a location without beachfront access, the Courtyard in Seminyak is highly recommended! I must add here that a walk to beach is only about ten minutes and the hotel does provide a one-way (to the beach) shuttle - at no charge - via what they term a ""buggy"" or more commonly looked upon as an extended golf cart."
3121,"Loved the pool, yoga and buffet breakfast",50,December 2014,very enjoyable stay. The pool was a great size and our balcony was a nice size. Massages at the spa were amazing yoga before breakfast was a good way to start the day. The buffet breakfast was a highlight.. Loads of variety ;)
3122,Double Standard Services - Concierge is not honest,10,September 2015,"I stayed here few days back. I am a Gold Member for Marriott. Not a white people, looks like local.

I was told by the reception when checked in that there is buggy service to Beach Club by Marriott at Seminyak. We went to request for the service, but the concierge instructed the Buggy Driver not to send us to the beach club, instead just drop in front of the Seminyak Beach - near Anantara Hotel.

i also observed that the staff at the marriott courtyard is practising racism in their services, they will smile jovially to the white people but will stop their smile and lower down their service offering when they see locals.

as a marriott gold member and soon going to be platinum, i felt that i was being cheated big time by the irresponsible staff at the concierge. he is not qualify to work in the hospitality industry with that kind of attitude. please remove or transfer him to another department, or terminate his service.

no apologies accepted"
3123,Everything we hoped for,50,September 2015,"Our experience was excellent from start to finish (except the beach area but the hotel can't do much about that!)
We were lucky enough to deal with Brad the General managerial email to make our booking - he responded very quickly and answered all our questions with no problem and helped suggest the best rooms for us. Unfortunately we didn't make it to our original booking because of the volcano but Brad helped us re book for September and everything went well.
Check in was fast and efficient.
We had rooms 146 and 147 which interconnect and had access to the shallow end of the pool - the perfect suggestion from Brad. Our kids loved it and the rooms were also very close to the kids club. The rooms were spacious and clean with a small patio/ sitting area which was nicely shaded. Wifi worked well in all areas.
The pool was fantastic and the pool staff fast,efficient and friendly, and often brought water and Popsicles . The buzzer system works well for placing orders and the floating bean bags were great. Pool was lovely and clean.
The gym was excellent, well equipped and clean.
The day spa was also fantastic, we had facials and massages- all of a high standard.
Breakfast was outstanding, we loved the fresh juices and the chef was always out checking to see that customers were happy - they coped well even when it was extremely busy.
We ate at the Seminyak kitchen and decided it was so good that we didn't need to attempt to find food outside the hotel at night( after one average meal up the street at mozarellas). The Aussie BBQ night was excellent value. Some nights we just ate from the bar menu at the pool bar and enjoyed the breeze and entertainment - club sandwhich excellent. Drinks priced well and bar staff fantastic.
Checkout was smooth and efficient. The hotel transfer also excellent. We also enjoyed the availability of the buggy to go to the shopping area( we used this to get to MamaSan for a lunch.... Very good Can recommend this restaurant)
The beach - not for us. The hotel has some lounges etc, but we just went for a look - too many vendors bothering us.......so back to the perfect pool.
We also appreciated the security at the hotel.

We went to water bom park and were very impressed.
Outside of the hotel there were plenty of shops etc. in easy walking distance - we got some supplies from bintang supermarket.
We ate at Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Kuta and it was good ( ate at his restaurant in Nottinghill in jean and the Bali one is just as good)
Went to beach walk shopping plaza - lovely but prices no different to aus....also did discovery mall which was pretty good .

The courtyard marriot is the reason we will return to Bali . thanks to Brad and staff for a fantastic stay. This is the longest review we have ever written....we travel extensively and can't offer our praise enough!"
3124,Third visit in 11 months!,40,September 2015,"There is so much to like about this hotel!
From the moment you arrive there are friendly staff ready and willing to help you and I arrived at 1130pm!
My room was fabulous, a 2 room suite.
The pools are great as is the service around the pool which has improved. The call buttons placed by each sunlounger are a great idea.
There were quite a few children jumping in and out of the pool who were a tad annoying. It would be nice if parents were actually supervising their children.
I would choose dates further away from the school holiday period.
The actual area the hotel is in is fabulous. 5 mins walk to the beach and plenty of shops, restaurants and massage places in the same street as the hotel, all very convenient.
The one thing I would like to see improved is the selection and quality of white wine at the Courtyard. It was $16.00 AUD for one glass of wine which was outrageous as it was like paint stripper. My advice is to stick to Bintang.

Well done to the lovely staff, especially at breakfast!"
3125,Very nice,40,September 2015,"It's the birthday girls weekend getaway.. Haha.. Literally.. Our bdays was on 25th and 27th. It was a really nice hotel! We really like it there! Very clean and comfortable and enjoyable. Breakfast is superb!
Though a bit lack of information from the hotel staffs. I only found out when I was checking out that the hotel has a nice spot at the double six, seminyak beach! I would love to go there if I knew it. Because it was so hard to get a sunbed by the hotel pool. I managed to only get a beanbag bcos all the sunbeds were occupied. Therefore I went to other places for a swim and sunbathing. But overall it was really enjoyable!"
3126,Excellent Hotel,50,September 2015,"Wonderful beautiful hotel in the centre of Seminyak. The staff are exceptional. Shops and restaurants within walking distance. The breakfast is incredible.

I'd suggest getting up early for a spot by the pool however."
3127,Wonderful Stay,50,September 2015,"We stayed in Courtyard Seminyak for 8 nights prior to our wedding with families and friends. Great hospitality from the fantastic team, made us feels like home from day 1. Stayed at the suite which has direct access to the pool, good size of room and great amenities. Plenty of options and varieties of food for breakfast with wonderful service from Seminyak Kitchen. We also had fun times by the pool bar with our friends and families, live acoustic made it all perfect. Location is superb, plenty of this to do on the same road full with crazy entertainment :)

The GM Brad, goes beyond expectation, helping us in every way, specially when we need assistance for my wedding dress and all problems solved right out.

We will be coming back for sure!"
3128,A marriage made in heaven,50,September 2015,What a magical location with incredible staff. We held our wedding ceremony at Courtyard Seminyak and we could not have been happier. The accommodation (one bedroom poolside suite) was luxurious and could not complain about anything. The ceremony was all we had dreamed it would be. Perfect place to get married with outstanding staff. An absolute credit to the Marriott group.
3129,Great family resort and location,50,October 2014,"Courtyard by Marriott is one resort that I have been highly recommending since my stay.
It is located walking distance to the beach close to where you will find the famous Chez Gado Gado restaurant and La Plancha.
There are markets on the street so you can just walk out and get amongst it yet when in the resort you wouldn't know. The resort is peaceful and everything you can need.
MUST- have a spa treatment!"
3130,Super Stay!,50,September 2015,"Stayed at the Courtyard in Seminyak in September and had a great stay at a very affordable rate. $109 for B&B + $200 to spend on F&B, one dinner and drinks by the pool.

Reception staff were courteous, fast and efficient.

Restaurant staff were great and handled a busy breakfast without any hassle. Kitchen team were top notch, always interacting with their guests of all ages. Baristas make a mean espresso, just what you need!

Staff were excellent in all departments, pool bar team was attentive and always ready to help. Housekeeping left nothing to be desired.

Great to have the option of sun loungers on the beach. Transportation to the beach dead easy.

Getting a bluebird cab from the hotel was easy as (trust me, this is a BIG benefit).

Lots of options for a few bevvies and food within walking distance.You'd be hard pressed to find a more convenient hotel and better value for money proposition in Seminyak.

It was excellent to see how the GM interacted with all his staff every morning and how the staff mirror his upbeat and can do attitude at all times. It really shows that if you look after your staff then the staff will look after your guests."
3131,Honeymoon and friends trip all in one!,50,September 2015,"This was our first time in Bali and I am extremely impressed with The Courtyard Marriott and their impressive staff.
Our stay was made so much more enjoyable by the many friendly faces amd greetings we had everyday.
The staff are people you could imagine becoming good friends with and we were extremely impressed with our daily chats and smiles from the lovely Maria (pool side and bar). We are going to miss her smiling face everyday.
Our first night saw a friend fall after having a few too many drinks and the amazing Cinta (pool bar) was there attending to her head within seconds. She was extremely professional and even helped me take my friend up to her room. Wonderful service.
My husband and brother in law made quick friends with Hendri (pool bar) with their conversations about travel and his quick and friendly service for their many many bintangs and cocktails.
We enjoyed lazy days by the pool, the buggy that drove us down to the beach by the staff, the Zanti Spa was amazing and extremly relaxing after a couple of days travelling around.
I cannot fault the staff, the hotel or anything that comes with it. We will definitely be returning as soon as possible and I recommend this hotel highly."
3132,"Come to this hotel to stay, you would love it",50,October 2014,"This is such a wonderful hotel in our trip. Our room were spacious and pool view. We have had sweet experience to enjoy the pool bar for one of our evening in there. Great for family, friends and even couples.
Also, it is a great location for a walking distance to the beach area for surf, shops around to your left, restaurants around the hotel.
The breakfast buffet are the top so far for us."
3133,A Great experience and stay,40,September 2015,"Stayed in this hotel 12 days ago and had such a wonderful experience. From Security to house keeping. the staff are humble and very professional, they made every effort in making my friends lastmin 40th birthday( her sister join the live band and song some lovely hit songs) celebration amazing. The only thing that i would moan about would be the pool gets shaded pretty quickly due to its position, but hey you can easily get a golf bugger to beach which is a 3/5min drive

Just to mention a few of my favorite STAFF members: CINTRA (pool bar)
ADJTI(front desk) YOGA & RIO (waiter & chef) REALLY lovely people.. And breakfast not worth missing;)

room tips : 613"
3134,"Good Hotel , Great Breakfast ,",40,August 2015,"As you would expect, good chain hotel, room good, good seletion of sports and tv channels, Breakfast really good, staff provided excellent service and even made dim sum for my wife, pool is too small for teh size of the hotel and its difficult to get a bed to relax.
Also for me the location is not as good as other locations in Seminyak, The best resturaunts and bars seem to be the other side of town, its only a small cab ride, so no great shakes"
3135,"Good value, excellent service",40,September 2015,"This Marriott Courtyard is a great choice if you want to be in the heart of Seminyak. Service standards nearly 5 star, from helpful check-in support (Agustina was very patient and accommodating), to speedy service in the restaurant, and a very good barista. A welcome addition to the range of accommodation choices - many substandard - in Seminyak. Was perfect for long weekend escape from Jakarta. Would go back."
3136,Wow!,50,September 2015,"We just dropped in for a poolside meal and were blown aesthetic the service, food, drinks, price and atmosphere..

Suggest you try the ribs or the burger! To die for!
We have stayed in Bali 3 times in the last 8 months and this is one of the best places I have been to. Very impressed!

We will stay here next time we are in Bali and write a hotel update!"
3137,Pricey (for Bali) but worth it!,50,September 2015,"Stayed here with a couple of girl friends early September. Not usually one to stay in Seminyak, normally opting for Kuta central but I was pleasantly surprised with how calm and quiet Seminyak was in comparison. When we arrived we were greeted with a frangipani, a welcome drink, a welcome popsicle, aaaand a cold towel. Safe to say I was in my element :) They also offered free wifi with a unique password that was valid for your whole stay and worked through out the entire hotel grounds.

The hotel was very clean, cool, modern, and had super friendly staff. Breakfast in the mornings was amazinggggg with a really cool buffet spread that differed from what i'd experienced in the past; they did these delicious little ""help yourself"" Eggs Benedicts that I happily filled myself up on, and a juice bar of many different fresh juices. Rather than just offering tea or coffee around by the jug, there was a barista who could freshly make you any coffee you desire (latte, cappuccino, etc) and the wait-staff served you at your table.

Having not researched the hotel before we arrived (one of the girls had previously stayed here & booked it for us) I didn't know what to expect but the pool area was definitely a huge selling point and a component that would definitely make me consider coming back. Pool bar - check, Infinity pool - check, Food & Beverage service while you tan - check, Floating bean bags - check. UGH take me back, they just went above & beyond what was needed and really went the extra mile. It made such a difference to the experience making it feel so much more luxurious.

They were celebrating their 1 year anniversary when we were there and hosted a luau, complete with lei's, instagram backdrops, dancers, DJs & lights. It looked like a lot of fun but not all of us ended up making it there... :) Not only that, but free popcorn & fairy floss was there for your taking 24/7, constantly being freshly made by a staff member in the lobby.

Each time you entered the hotel, your bags were put through the machine & you had to walk through the security checks. This obviously wasn't ideal but it really shows how safety conscious they are and they only want their guests to be safe. Also, the staff would always greet you with a smile & stop for a chat no matter the time of day.

When it came time to leave we were VERY upset.. Having only spent 5 nights I would definitely be tempted to pay the extra and stay here again. Courtyard was walking distance to local shops, restaurants, bars, massage parlours, a short scooter ride to Kuta central, and it provided us with a lot more than we could have ever expected!"
3138,Great hotel,50,September 2015,"Stayed at this hotel last week and had a wonderful experience. Everything from check in process to the breakfast was great. The staffs were very helpful and friendly, many thanks to Rio at the restaurant for the help during breakfast and Maria at the front desk for the local advice and suggestions."
3139,Good Resort BUT breastfeeding mother becareful!,30,September 2015,"Was here for 3D2Ns for a friend's wedding with my husband. It's a comfortable hotel where you get most of the nice amenities (swimming pool etc.). Our room was a decent size. We like their buggy service that drops you at a few stops nearby. Breakfast was pretty decent too, although their Asian selection can improve. Don't think a lot of people were taking their plain pao. Overall, it's a good hotel as expected by Marriott.

It's just that I am a breastfeeding/pumping mum. I left my little one at home so I had to pump throughout the trip and prepared for it! (Mothers would know how much preparation it is!). There is a mini fridge in the room but it doesn't come with a freezer so I can't freeze the milk. So i kept my expressed milk in the fridge and waited till the night before I check out to ask the hotel management to keep in the freezer. When I made a call for this request, I was half worried they wouldn't know what to do but the person on the call sounded like it was something they have done all the time. I breathe a sigh of relief! I specifically told them I need to freeze my ice packs and breastmilk. Someone came and picked it up and again I told him that it needs to be placed in the FREEZER. There was no look of confusion so I thought great! I should have the milk frozen ready for the flight the next day.

When I called the next day, the hotel didn't seem to know where the milk has been placed. First warning alarm. And when they finally found it, the package was not placed in the freezer at all!! So basically my effort was pretty much in vain. Imagine the disappointment. So, if you are a breastfeeding/pumping mum, please make sure they know what they are doing."
3140,Cant wait to return,50,September 2015,"Loved this hotel. The most comfortable bed ever. Great breakfast, great pool area and good value for money given they often have good sale prices. Also liked the endless popcorn for the kids and the fred electronic buggy to drive us around the area. Great location too..."
3141,Good resort,40,August 2015,"This resort is no better or worse than others rated at same level. Breakfast was the same as other resorts, good to talk with Australian chef in charge.
Service from all of the staff throughout the complex was excellent - far better than other resorts we have stayed in !. I fall asleep when having a Balinese one hour massage. On the second occasion my gold wedding ring somehow mysteriously disappeared from my finger ! It was never found !

THE LESSON LEARNT was secure ALL your jewellery before taking a massage !
Part of the massage is the masseuse will massage your hands and fingers with oil and then systematically 'stretch/pull each finger - this, I believe, was when my wedding ring disappeared !"
3142,Good hotel for MICE,40,August 2015,"Went here with some colleagues as part of annual off site meeting, spent 3 days.
Smooth service from airport pick up to check in. Room is spacious and filled with all necessary amenities, I love the rain shower.
Location is about 8-10 min walk to the beach and there are plenty of restaurants and bars around the area. The hotel also provides golf carts to transfer guests to beach or restaurant.
Lots of varieties of food at breakfast and lunch.
Meeting room are spacious as well and the pool + bar + garden are good for outside activities during or after meetings üòä
The only issue is they only provide one coffee machine during our meeting (30 pax) thus there was a good queue during break..
All and all this hotel is nice for MICE, for family I would say ok as well, only location is not on the beach.

Recommended to visit Frankenstein's Lab for a night out with colleagues to close the trip üòä. Just down the road."
3143,It is good but......,40,September 2015,"This hotel is in a good location, has nice rooms, great shower and good bed however it is expensive when compared to other similar hotels and the service was only average. Upon check in (at midnight after flying in) I get the hard sell on the ""drinks"" package which I can only accept on check in. It was probably a good deal but all I wanted was to get to my room and not think about how much I was going to drink over the next week. In addition I had paid for my stay in advance but get told that my stay has not been paid for and that I now need to make payment. So after logging in to my bank app I show the clerk when the payment was made and he agrees to look into it further but still wants further security on my credit card. In any event in went on from there with no apology and no explanation. Bottom line is that I would not stay here again unless the deal was really good."
3144,Super friendly staffs!,40,July 2015,"At first I was bit concern with the surrounding area, but after checking in, such concern disappeared. The hotel has nice pool and the rooms are well appointed. We got the Deluxe Pool Terrace which provide direct access to the pool. Staffs are tremendously friendly and helpful. They remember our names! Breakfast quality was pretty good with plenty of options. Overall satisfying experience!"
3145,"Great hotel, great location",40,September 2015,"We stayed here for a week in September.

We had a great time, upon arriving we had an extra guest and the staff were happy to our booking at the last minute and offered us a beer while we waited.

The breakfast was delicious. Rooms serviced daily.

Only negative would be that in the afternoon from 3pm there is less sun on the pool. During peak times in the morning it can be hard to get a sunbed.

Would definitely come back to the Marriott."
3146,Perfect place for our first trip to Bali,50,September 2015,"This place was a delight. Exceptional staff, great breakfast serving everything from Asian to western, good room, good pool, great happy hour with live music, private beach, buggy transport to eat street and beach, close to Gado Gado fabulous restaurant - we could not fault our time here. Sit on the balcony for breakfast but allow plenty of time as there is so much choice including espresso coffee. Unbelievably friendly and professional staff. We would love to return and bring our family. Our one complaint was the winter weight doona on the bed - need a lighter option."
3147,Excellent hotel,50,September 2015,"I have been stay in different hotel chains, Sofitel, Hilton, Marriott... They all five star hotel, but service level are different.. I don't normally write a review, but after staying in Courtyard Seminyak, I just want to write something as I am really happy with my stay. They certainly know how to provide good service to their customer. All the staff I talked to are really friendly and helpful! I love to see the smiles on their face. and Try the food in the Seminyak Kitchen!"
3148,Excellent!,50,September 2015,"Very welcoming hotel with very convenient location! Beach, cafe and restaurants is within walking distance. Nicely designed, love the bedroom space, very comfortable bed and nice shower room as well. Stayed at room with swimming pool view, can see people enjoying the pool and also good sun light. Arrived early and they assisted for the early check-in nicely. Also, happy first year anniversary!"
3149,Descent stay at courtyard marriott seminyak,50,August 2015,"I spent 3 days last august in courtyard marriott seminyak for summer break. I was impressed of their lost and found team whose very detail on checking every car and guest who visit the property, i feel very safe during my stay ‚ò∫
The room was clean but the size of the room was a little smaller than courtyard in bangkok, but you hv all you need in the room..
The breakfast just superb üòçüòçüòç
They provided a very tasty and lots of variety for your breakfast choices... Event ice cream for breakfast, it's not normal yeay?? But one scoop of ice cream during your holiday wouldn't hurt anybody, right?? üòÇüòÇ
The staff so helpful and they were showing what hospitality really is..even the executive chef was so nice and helpful..
Gonna be back for sure to this hotel if i ever visit bali again üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
3150,2nd check in stay is better after feedback to duty manger,50,September 2015,"The first time check in in Sep 2015 was good, the hotel was at a good location near beach and good restaurants in few steps walk aways. but after 4 days of stay. i found out the service wasn't up to standard which people post online. during check out, the duty manager was on the front desk and my wife make a lot of complain. since we are member of Marriott club. 2 days later after some business trips back to another native country. I check in back to bali again to continue my vacation. thsi round everything is good and will continue to observer since today was the first day."
3151,"Excellent hotel - clean, modern, convenient",50,September 2015,"Rooms clean, modern, comfortable and practical. As you would come to expect from a new hotel, most things you care for are taken care of.

Breakfast is superb. Service was a little lax at times, but it was busy and the chefs and waiting staff seemed a little stretched. That aside, excellent food, cool trendy restaurant and every cuisine catered for.

Pool - lovely. A little crowded perhaps during peak hours, but usually able to find space.

Proximity to beach: 5mins walk max. Literally turn right out of the hotel and it's straight in front.

Reachable to many of the bars, restaurants in seminyak either by foot or by short taxi ride.

Definitely recommended for a short weekend stay or longer."
3152,Good Hospitality!,40,August 2015,"It is an excellent hotel with super hospitality and quick service. Close to the beach but the location is not that very great.

Not many vegetarian options and certainly nothing from Indian food perspective!

Security is super tight and breakfast menu is very good. Pool is also quite good though they have limited Sunbeds and always occupied during peak hours.

They also have a separate kids play area which is very good. My 3 year ild daughter enjoyed it very much. Its free if one of the parent is willing to stay with the child!

Overall a satisfying experience."
3153,Excellent Hotel,50,June 2015,"This review is a bit delayed but I couldn't not say how wonderful this hotel is.

The lobby and pool are so inviting and there was never a time where it felt crowded. The check in was efficient, friendly and informative. The room was spotless and a perfect temperature when I arrived. The pool bar staff were so friendly and obviously happy to be working at this hotel. They are definitely a credit to the Manager of this hotel, who was helping serve behind the bar, which the staff obviously appreciate. The breakfasts were amazing. I've stayed in some nice hotels around the world but I have to say this was my favourite breakfast spread I've seen. I also had dinner in the hotel one night and a couple of meals at the pool and the food was exceptionally good. Although prices are higher than some of the cheap restaurants down the street, they really weren't too expensive. The location of the hotel is great. It's very close to the beach (although I did use the buggy when I was lazy) and there's plenty of shopping and massage places around. I also had a couple of treatments in the Spa and the ladies in there are amazing at their job. From the welcome drink to the beautiful rooms and the extensive packages they offer, it is a wonderful experience. Yes, the security seems a bit full on when you first go through but I'm glad they are there. The security team were always friendly and happy for a chat. I loved this hotel so much that I've just booked to go back for another 2 weeks over Christmas and I can't wait!"
3154,Great hotel,50,September 2015,We love staying here. Extremely friendly staffs and very welcoming. Convenient location and the beach is within walking distance. Excellent food. We really enjoyed the complimentary breakfast buffet. The hotel has private beach area within walking distance. We will come back again

3156,"Amazing, Memorable Experience",50,September 2015,"Our last visit to Bali was 8 years ago and our experience was not memorable. However, in saying that our experience this time was very different. From the minute we arrived at Courtyard by Marriott we were greeted by good security, smiles and very helpful and polite check in staff. Thank you to Priscilla at reception who assisted us in organising all our restaurant bookings and checked in with us the following day to hear about our experience - a lovely employee who is an asset to this hotel.
Accommodation is at a very high standard and cleanliness exceptional. Our room was situated on the third floor so eliminated a lot of the pool noise but also gave amazing views of the resort.
Breakfasts were fantastic, lots of fresh fruit and juices and eggs could be ordered to your liking. All food served by the hotel was of a very high standard. The seafood buffet was amazing.
We ate regularly at the pool bar which had a great variety and enjoyed happy hour every day - the live music provided most nights was very enjoyable. Our overall experience of food quality, variety, service and friendliness at the pool bar was enhanced by Kesawa, Linda and Cinta.
The spa was amazing and we enjoyed three massages, prices very reasonable and the staff just lovely - loved the ginger tea after our massage, best I have had in Bali.
Highly recommend this hotel, it was a 5 star experience - and we will be back."
3157,Great hotel and staff all around! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,50,August 2015,"We frequent Bali almost yearly, arrived with wife and friends on the 25th morning and the receptionist were superb in accommodating us an early arrival close to midday, very welcoming and friendly attitude. The security officers at the various gantries and entrances were polite, full of smiles yet doing a good job when security screening of the cars and guests coming through the security gantries.

The rooms are well well appointed, spacious, functional - equip with working desk, large bathrooms, balcony and detailing customers needs were well thought of such as the multi wall sockets, mirrors, good lightings, 50+ TV channels selection. Balcony and the pool view excellent!

Very nice to relax and chill by the pool. Great pool facilities and activities, nice acoustic music and staff serving are jovial happy doing their jobs. The pool menu food and drinks are good with varieties of selections.

Love the breakfast concept, engaging food stations with the chefs and staff. Excellent coffee and great latte!

Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room and respecting privacy of room. My jogging shoe sole came off slightly, called for engineering team to assist and glued the sole, the technician came soon and did a great job! I think it was on the morning of 28th Aug.

We'd like to thank Mr Shashank and the wonderful operations team for a great job well done and taking good care of us during our visit. Congratulations and happy first year anniversary which could only get better!"
3158,"WONDERFUL Staff, Room, Experience... Everything!",50,July 2015,"I am so late in reviewing, but better late than never!

Can't say enough GREAT things about this wonderful place where my spouse and I spent 2 nights in. We stayed in the suite, over looking the pool. We were really looking forward to this Bali holiday as we were both burned out from work, at the same time, it was a post-birthday treat for me since my birthday was spent swarmed with work.

Here goes:

Service: the staff was polite and constantly wearing a smile on their facea. They never failed to greet us, not once! I remember hurting my hand one night before dinner. At the restaurant, my husband asked the staff for a glass of ice for me to soothe the pain. The staff noticed I was placing my hand against the cold glass, he came to me and offered me a napkin (fabric) to place the ice into. I was thankful and touched for his kind gesture.

Room: Our room was extremely spacious, comfortable and clean. I am very particular about cleanliness. the fact it passed my test says much of the level of cleanliness. I love the huge bathroom and additional amenities such speaker for iphone. Most of the time we were playing music from our room while doing our reading and catching up on work. Though it can be noisy since we are by the pool, but that is only during the day.

Breakfast: there is a wide range of selection for breakfast. We love it! the (head) chef took time to go around tables, chatting with guests and finding out how the food was. he also took the chance to allow guests to sample new menu and gather feedback which we thought is great.

We couldn't bear to leave this wonderful place and Bali. We will definitely be back!"
3159,Fantastic caring staff and incredible service and support.,50,August 2015,"My wife and I have just returned from 2 weeks in Bali.
We originally purchased a Luxury Escape 10 day holiday package to enjoy with friends.
However 3 days into our ""Holiday"" I beacame quite ill and had to be admitted to hospital where I spent the next week. Brad the General Manager of the Hotel advised my wife which hospital to take me to.
The staff at the Hotel took great care of my wife organising transport and support in every possible way.
They even sent fruit platters and freshly baked biscuites (which were very welcome).
Upon my discharge from the hospital I was unable to fly staight away so it entailed us extending our stay by another 6 days.
The Hotel was marvelous they let us stay in the same room and did not take advantage of our situation with the room rates in any way.
I could not recommend the Courtyard by Marriott highly enough.
Thank you for everything that you did.
We will be back.
Brian and Ann"
3160,Great location and service!,50,August 2015,"I was staying at Marriott Courtyard Bali Seminyak for 7 days. Location was great, about a 10 mins walk to the beach with plenty of bars to choose from. It's near to the shopping stretch of Seminyak (about a 10 mins cab ride) without being crowded and noisy. What impresses me the most is their pool and the rooms were all (well mostly all) having a pool view. There were plenty of float lying around for one to chill in the pool after getting a nice tan at the deck chair. Service was great at the pool; staff was regularly checking that guest gets served and they upped the game by placing a 'paging machine' at the press of a finger that we can get the staff attention without having to even lift our head (while tanning)! Another thing worth mentioning as this is probably the 6-7th time Im in bali, that every other resort that I have been to, I'm used to getting bitten by the mossies. This is one hotel that I am very happy to say that I have zero encounter with those pest! Well done Marriott!

Daily international buffet breakfast is something I always look forward to. Eggs benedict is always done perfectly with that beautiful cuppa latte. If you want to try something local, their porridge taste really good with that fiery sambal chilli. I like the fact that the head chef always walks around the restaurant helping his staff to attend to the guest whenever they are busy. There was one morning I had to get the chef to prepare a customized eggs Benedict without bacon for a muslim friend and because it was a weekend, the kitchen was really busy. The head chef just walked over and serve me instead!

This is one quality hotel that you want to stay in without breaking the bank. Thumbs up to all the staff who makes guest feels at home."
3161,Happy First Bi rthday,50,August 2015,"Here I was back 12 months later hoping it was going to be as good as my first visit, well I wasn't disappointed. I was lucky enough to be there for the ""birthday party"" which was a good night of entertainment, dinner and drinks around the pool. Although it had more people staying there this time, at no time was it felt, by the pool or at breakfast. The staff do an amazing job, attending to all of your needs.
The rooms are modern,clean and extremely comfortable, housekeeping did a great job.
The pool is as big and as relaxing as it looks in the pictures. The pool staff were always on hand for a cold drink or food. The large pillows in the pool, are a hit with everyone for a relaxing float around the pool.
This is a great hotel for all types of travellers from families with young kids to the elderly.
Brad and his staff are so friendly, attentive and approachable.
I hope yo return again one day soon."
3162,"Friendly Staff, modern Hotel",40,August 2015,"Stayed in August using Luxury Escape Voucher. Good value for the price but the rooms are the smallest I have ever stayed in whilst in Bali. There is a small wardrobe but no drawers. Bathroom was large and very modern. My husband and I had a king bed room and our daughter had a 2xDouble bed room for 2 adults and 2 children. The room was so small, totally unsuitable for a family, so we had to pay for another room. The pool area is only sunny on one side, and as others said it was hard to get a lounge chair in the sun. Having said that, the pool area is lovely. Great kids pools and lots of floating bean bags. Only a short walk to the beach. And a $3-$5 taxi ride to Seminyak Square. Mini mart across the road. Breakfast was good, restaurant fine and staff lovely. Spa was gorgeous and made use to the free vouchers from Luxury Escapes. Kids club was great. Would I stay here again? Probably not because I find the courtyard type of hotel, not so much appealing to us and prefer on the beach and a resort with bigger grounds."
3163,Perfect location to enjoy Seminyak,50,August 2015,"Reluctantly after 12 years we decided to go back to Bali. We were travelling with our daughter and her family so wanted to make sure we stayed in a nice hotel, take no chances. Previous experiences with the Marriott have been good. To our pleasant surprise Seminyak was lovely, footpaths (almost complete), great little shops, lots of good coffee, plenty of restaurants offering variety, quality and value. Taxis metre on are very cheap and day rates negotiable to around $40 per day. We were disappointed at Ubud which was a nice hinterland experience, now a traffic and people melting pot. Weather was fabulous, and a pleasant change from our cold winter.
Our hotel was in a great location and facilities excellent. Staff spot on and breakfast one of the best. A treat for dining as well. Spa first class. Security a bit tiring but I guess necessary. Pool excellent as is the gym (although an extra exercise bike wouldn't go astray). Manager seems omnipresent which is great! Beach just down the road, a nice bike ride along the paths there take you up to Legian and Kuta. If you want abundant gardens and space around the pool this is not your hotel. If it's all the things above its a recommended choice. Just ask my grandchild! BTW we had two poolside rooms and noise is not an issue, even if you were near the front."
3164,Central Location hotel,50,March 2015,"We got a regular room.

Staff at Marriott were friendly as expected from Marriott. It was near good restaurants too and you could park your motorcycle in the hotel for free

Wifi was fast and free as well.

The hotel was not in the area of the crowded and traffic kuta but is very near kuta which makes it nice.

The beers for happy hour were cheap too, cheaper than most bars.

The pool was the best with the pool bar where you could order food and stay in a pool bean bag."
3165,Winter Break,50,September 2015,"From check in to check out (10 nights) everything was perfect from the food to the small extras like free ice pops, occasional cold flannels around the pool and a help yourself popcorn machine as well as fairy floss. The staff were extremely helpful and always wore a smile for the guests. The spa gave good service at a reasonable price. The kids club was a hit for all the children. The bars happy hour Buy One Free One was a hit with the adults in the evenings. Shuttle bus to a private beach ( about 1.5 kms away) plus enough restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. Would we come back? Oh Yes!!"
3166,"Amazing stay, cannot recommend enough!",50,September 2015,"We arrived at Courtyard by Marriot Bali Seminyak after a (relatively) simpler and rougher few days on Nusa Lembongan, so it was a huge relief and somewhat heavenly to see the modern facilities and experience the impeccable service at Courtyard. We got upgraded to a suite by Nyssa who was absolutely wonderful, as was the entire staff who was all smiles all the time.

The breakfast was amazing from the environment to the setting to the food itself, not the biggest selection but a very refined experience. The pool was great with floating beds, which was a big help as the sun wasn't out the whole time and sometimes it got too chilly to be in the water. Excellent pool-side service. Our suite was wonderful as well as all rooms enjoy the pool view (I think).

The location was great, a five minute walk to the beach where one can enjoy the beautiful sunset at one of the bars, and within walking distance to many shops. Wifi was consistent and reliable, and available in both public areas and in the rooms.

As the third hotel we stayed at on this trip to Bali, Courtyard by Marriot Seminyak was a perfect ending to our vacation and we've made a promise to ourselves to stay longer next time."
3167,Cozy resort,50,August 2015,"A super decent hotel at its reasonable price, about 500m from the beach. Cannot forget its wonderful breakfast buffet included with the room package. Not a large resort, but cozy enough to enjoy a several day trip there."
3168,Nothing too hard,40,September 2015,We have been here 2 of 9 nights. Rooms are beautiful & the hotel is only 1 year old. 5 min walk to the beach. Great pool & happy hour cocktails that are 2 for 1 is a great deal. Big pool & beautiful surrounds. Good location with shops & massages right out the front. Highly recommend
3169,Wonderful place to stay,50,August 2015,"We stayed 9 nights in a pool view room. Great size room, lovely and clean. The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and the cocktails a treat. We had an amazing stay and the hotel offered a wide range of activities if you were interested. Happy hour with the band playing was a great way to unwind at the end of the day. One major complaint is that there is not enough pool chairs and what ones there are often have towels on them and then left for hours at end with nobody being able to use them. They need to monitor this more often as we witnessed this everyday. We were also lucky enough to be there when there 1st anniversary was on and got to help celebrate this event so a big thankyou for everything on that night. Overall but a great stay with very friendly helpful staff and a great hotel. Would highly recommend to anyone to stay here."
3170,Great hotel,50,August 2015,"We stayed in August 2015 in a pool view room, from the pick up at the airport with massage seats to all of the staff 10/10. The breakfast is the best in the area, staff are always smiling and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The afternoon music was unobtrusive and meant you could sit on the balcony and listen. Great to see the GM and Executive chef always around and talking to the guests. To those who complain about the security we were impressed by the professionalism of the security staff, if 30 seconds or if travelling by vehicle 3/4 minutes is too much out of your life, find somewhere else to stay and you will see what you have missed by not staying at this great hotel, just the right size and fell. 10/10"
3171,Outstanding service,50,August 2015,"We stayed 7 nights in a pool view room. Good size, immaculate, nice view from balcony. We could hear the afternoon music, a good mix of cool classics, not intrusive, just pleasant for a few hours. But the main bonus was the staff. I have never come across such excellent service- every staff member was smiling, eager to help and seemed genuinely keen to ensure we had a nice stay with them. Maria and Desi in the pool bar were particularly friendly. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely, the chef happy to offer something special for our gluten free friend. Nice pool but the usual problem of not enough lounges available because people reserved them early. Only a short ""hotel buggy"" ride to the beach and again, only a small area for chairs. However,overall a wonderful place to stay."
3172,Very good experience,50,July 2015,"We travelled in December 2014 when the hotel was quite new. Service was excellent - concierge was very helpful, room service was prompt.

Rooms are clean, comfortable and modern. Bathrooms are nicely done. We stayed in a pool facing superior room.

Breakfast spread was good - as can be expected of a similar standard hotel.

The sunken pool bar is a nice touch.

The location in Seminyak is very good. Shops, restaurants are all within walking distance. They offer shuttle service to the beach. The beach in Seminyak is very nice - far better than Nusa Dua where many of the luxury hotels are located. Taxis are readily available.

On the whole, a very pleasant stay - exceeded our expectations in every way. Totally value for money."
3173,"Good, but some small annoyances",40,August 2015,"Having stayed at Marriott hotels before, we knew the quality of the hotel would good and the Courtyard Seminyak did not disappoint. The hotel is clean, classy and professional. There were many good points about our stay and some not so.

The Pros:
Polite, well spoken staff
The breakfast and food in general excellent
The rooms, well designed and quite roomy
The gardens beautiful
The overall cleanliness of the whole hotel
Spa treatments, heavenly

The Cons:
Pool lounges always shaded on one side
Pool too cold
Pool bar shaded by mid afternoon
Tiled corridors, very noisy
Noise from pool area radiates up into all rooms
No privacy glass on toilet or shower in bathrooms
All prices ++. Why not Net?
Told we couldn't use vouchers for Theme Dinner, when other guests, told ok?

Most of these cons are really very small and would not stop you from staying at this hotel. The pool in August is an issue and would probably suggest staying later in the year if your like us and like to spend a lot of time using it.

The hotel is very busy with an assortment of guests. When we stayed, there were many children, so this contributed to the noise factor."
3174,Yeah it's ok,30,August 2015,"Hotel is what you would expect. Decent rooms, decent facilities, all round good choice - Marriott standards are always good. However, to be on an island with so much character, Marriott seems a little anonymous. If you're looking for security in pleasant surroundings, it's your place but if you're looking for something with a little more 'Bali vibe', plump for a local villa or funky hotel."
3175,Location and value,40,August 2015,"So I wanted to be in Seminyak. After visiting bali for over 30 years and having many friends in the area I decided this time I would stay in Seminyak. The trendy area. To get on to the beach areas was quite ridiculous. Over $1k per nite
The Marriott fits the budget well. Only 2 min walk to the beach and rather new it fits the bill. Good facilities nice breakfast and comfy rooms. With great staff"
3176,Rocks it...,50,August 2015,"We have stayed at the Courtyard Seminyak a few times already and always enjoy our mini vacation:

Amazing and very attentive staff with tips for great restaurants and bars.
Our kids love the ice-cream at check in and the everlasting supply of popcorn and candy floss in the lobby.
The breakfast selection is huge and my husband especially likes the variety of bagels and the coffee specialties.
The rooms are sleek and modern but with some interior design twists still let you feel that you are in Bali.
The beach club is a great addition - lovely touch to serve watermelon to the guests.

We will definitely be back soon..."
3177,Very happy with my stay here,50,August 2015,"I just got home from the courtyard Marriott in Seminyak and was very impressed, I stayed in a pool view room which was very clean and well set out. And was cleaned every day even rolled up my headphones for me.
The pool and swim up bar was very refreshing and live entertainment was awesome.
Probably my favourite part of my stay was the kind friendly staff always smiling and willing to do anything for you.. Also a awesome 4 hours of happy hour every day..
Highly recommended I cannot wait to get back there.."
3178,Too noisy,30,August 2015,"We were shown to our ""Deluxe"" room....couldn't swing a cat in it. One chair and a bed and small table. Smallest room in any hotel we have stayed at in Bali. Not one drawer in the room. We changed over to a suite the next day. Cost quite a bit more :-( Bedroom same size but we had a sitting room at least. Pool in the centre of complex so the noise reverberates throughout the hotel Children swimming early in the morning sounds like they are in your room. 5 o'clock terrible singers scream into their mikes. Not a very relaxing place.

However, breakfast was great but dinner was bad news. Mushy prawns and very sad looking seafood buffet. Decided to go elsewhere. Much cheaper and far better.

The staff were lovely and tried their best. All in all, would definitely not stay again no matter how cheap. Might be o.k. for young families but not for older people look for something a little more restful."
3179,This is the way hotels should be run . .,50,August 2015,"We recently stayed 11 nights, 4 of which were unplanned due to cancelled flights caused by volcano. Reception staff most helpfully accommodated us and we were able to keep our room for the extra nights. We travel overseas a lot and have to say the staff attitude, without exception, in this hotel is the best we have encountered anywhere in a very long time. The 'hands on' management style is apparent everywhere from the front desk to the restaurant where the sumptuous buffet breakfast is the also the best we have enjoyed in many years. Well earned congratulations to Brad and his team."
3180,Amazing staff and customer service,50,June 2015,"I am a Platinum Elite Lifetime member with Marriott so I stay in a lot of hotels.
When I arrived in Bali I discovered the airline had lost my luggage so I informed the Bell Captain, Mr Wahyu. As I didn't speak the local language, over the next 24 hrs he called the airport several times and when my luggage arrived 24 hrs later he even sent a hotel car to the airport. The hotel driver made sure that my bag cleared customs and Mr Wahyu delivered it to me personally in the hotel. This is an example of the top level of service at this hotel. Without the assistance of the hotel staff I am sure it would have been another day before I got my bag.
I also want to add the breakfast was excellent. The Executive chef came around and talked to guests to make sure they were happy and if they needed anything. I don't remember his name but he was a young Australian guy.
Thank you for making my stay very comfortable."
3181,Very relaxing,50,August 2015,"We have been here for 5 days now and thoroughly enjoying ourselves. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast is very comprehensive, it would satisfy the fussiest of eaters, I know because my adult daughter is one. The pool and all amenities are very nice. Location is also great, short walk to the beach or you can get a ride on the buggy. I wouldn't want to be right on the beach because at night it turns into a giant noise party, all the different restaurants and clubs try to outdo each other in loudness of ""music""."
3182,Bali Bliss,50,August 2015,"My partner & I returned today after 10 wonderful days at this beautiful hotel. We could not fault the hotel and its wonderful staff and General Manager Brad Edman. The level of service was exceptional and always with a smile. Brad showed superb leadership always helping staff and guests and all the staff seemed so happy.
The positives are too numerous to mention here but some stand outs include great location, only 5 minute walk to lovely section of beach with lots of beach bars/restaurants & live music. Happy hour at hotel that went for 4 hours each afternoon with live music. Best breakfast EVER, enormous pool and lovely gardens, golf buggy that takes you to main restaurant street or beach. super comfortable beds and pillows like clouds in well appointed suites, luxury spa, fast wifi everwhere and hotel is suitable for all ages.The list goes on and on . We couldn't find any negatives :-)
Julie & Mark"
3183,Fabulous stay,50,August 2015,"The staff were amazing from the airport transfer, check-in and all the way through to checkout. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was spacious and modern, the pool view room was great. The bathroom was HUGE, clean and the shower was awesome. The pool and bar service was great, however, i would have appreciated more food options that didn't involve fries! The golf buggy shuttle to the beach and eat street was a great option."
3184,Amazing group hotel,50,June 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott, Seminyak for a few days in early June and then a week mid June with a large group of our friends and family for our wedding. Most of our guests stayed at this hotel, and they made the entire process so easy as our guests were able to book the group rate but then pay directly to the hotel! There weren't many hotels in Bali willing to do this for us. The rooms were beautiful, they upgraded us to a suite when we returned to stay here after checking out of our wedding villa in Canggu. The breakfast was a highlight for most of our guests staying here, they have a huge variety!"
3185,You can get better elsewhere with same price,20,August 2015,"Rooms are small. If you pay this price, go look for other choice. 5 Star hotel price only gives 4 stars facility and experience.

If you are spending vacation with family, this is not a good choice. Suite size is half of other brand's standard suite. It is the smallest suite we lived in Bali.

One swimming pool with sun shines during noon only.

I left my kids at kids club. The time when I collected my kids, they say there was a charge because I left them there for more than 2 hours. I don't mind there are charges but you should let the guest know in advance. This is also the only hotel will charge guest for this in Bali.

I am a frequent client and a Marriott gold member. I had great experience with other Marriott hotels except this Courtyard. I stayed in Stones (Marriott Autograph Hotel) in Kuta, much better.

For house keeping, there was dusty under table. Missing shave kit, vanity kit, lack of small towel.

For bell service, I was asked to change room because my another booking was not booked by a Gold Elite Account, so that I was not entitle for upgrades even the gold member is an accompanying person. Well, that's fine. I ask the bell service to help for moving baggage to another room, I told him to wait for 5 mins. He was just disappeared. Then I move the cart MYSELF from room to room. Staff saw me but didn't realize the bell boy was missing! For other 5 stars hotel, my only experience was that staff would rush to me for helping.

So, for luxury or for family, stay away from this hotel"
3186,An excellent stay,40,August 2015,"After a few hiccups trying to make a reservation we were really glad we persevered... We really enjoyed our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite (from a 1 bedded) and the room was fabulous.. Huge, clean and it had 2 baths (we were so glad to have one with 2 young kids). The breakfasts were very very good. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was up there with the best. The kids club was good and it even had a napping room which I thought was a good idea.
All of the staff were helpful and lovely. Food and drinks were very reasonably priced and of good quality.
If I had to mention any negatives it would be lack of beds/bean bags around the pool.. They were full by 10am. The pool was quite chilly as it didn't get much sun this time of year. Overall I was very impressed and would definitely stay again"
3187,Brilliant,50,August 2015,"After initial hiccups booking through a Luxury Escape Deal was all sorted out, everything went smoothly from pickup to checking in and room allocation. This hotel and its staff could not be faulted. First class service at its best. Will definately be back again. Highly recommended.
Thankyou."
3188,Amazing Hotel,50,August 2015,"The hotel is great with very welcoming staff, very close to the beach and our room overlooked the street . breakfast is excellent with great variety. room service is fast and even the hotel doctor is available 24/7. very secure hotel"
3189,Outstanding service!,50,August 2015,"I am currently staying here at the moment and have been here for 5 nights - 2 to go! Usually in Bali I stay in private villas but as I am traveling with my mum and sister decided a hotel would be a better option!

I have been extremely impressed with the service!! It is outstanding! Gym is great I have been every morning! The live music each night is sensational! The private beach area is awesome and love the little touch with a cold towel!

Food is great, especially the breakfast and Mexican night on Thursday - that has been out favourite night! I spoke to the executive chef at breakfast and he said I can even get gluten free bread (which I was shocked about as I am ceoliac and can always be a pain for me traveling) and can't wait to have some tomorrow for my breakfast!

I also had a 2.5 spa treatment yesterday and the ladies were professional... I have rebooked!

The only negative has been its a bit colder than normal, pool is very chilly unless you are in the sun. But I am aware this is everywhere in Bali at the moment and nothing the hotel can change - better than Melbourne!

I am going to rebook when I get home to come back with my husband in April 2016 and already can't wait!

Thank you"
3190,Good value hotel,30,June 2015,"This is a great centrally located hotel in Seminyak. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach and is surrounded by shops,bars and restaurants.

My kids loved the check in process as they got an iceblock,popcorn and fairy floss!! It's a nice modern well-designed hotel and I think it is excellent value for money.

The breakfast is really worthwhile as there was loads of choice and the kids loved the icecream option for brekky!!

My only really gripe with the hotel is that it is on a long narrow block with the pool in the middle so even though we were in tropical Bali it was freezing around the pool as the building blocks the sun and the pool was too cold for me but the kids still managed to have a great time splashing around in the pool. The beach is only a 5 min walk away so I got my time in the sun down at the beach. The beach is also fantastic at sunset-the beach bars are all set up with bean bags so we could sit down with a drink and watch the sunset while the kids ran around on the beach.
We also walked to Made's Restaurant (10 min walk) for dinner one night and this was fantastic-terrific value and the kids were mesmerised with the Balinese dance performance.
We got the Hotel Concierge to book restaurants for us and he was super helpful, as were all the staff."
3191,Great Stay,50,August 2015,"Just got back from our trip to Bali staying at the Marriott. We were picked up by the hotels car with a baby seat which was great. The breakfast was amazing with a great range of food, I just loved those donuts and my son loved the ice cream. The staff are very friendly and helpful at the restaurant even when we had our ""Hangry"" little one who was desperate for food but they were still nice to her. The pool looks great, the water is a little cold at the moment but we also visited the Sofitel and W retreat for lunch and a swim and the water was also cold at these hotels but once you get in its not so bad. I loved the music by the pool and the live music at night we could put the little one in bed and she couldn't hear it but we could enjoy it from the balcony, it was sad it finished at 8pm. Our little one also really liked the kids club where they organised baby sitting for her. We also used the spa for treatments and really enjoyed this. The buggy is useful to get to eat street and the beach, although one trip we had to listen to a couple winge about the buggy not taking them exactly where they were going, still unsure how you can winge about a free helpful service and they obviously can't drop you off everywhere! Our little one will miss visiting the friendly popcorn man who she went to see a few times everyday!! The free wifi was good too. You can see into the other rooms so you have to remember to close the curtains when changing but the guys across from us enjoyed flashing people a little too much on purpose,with not much to see.......We had a great stay and really enjoyed the trip and the hotel and staff are great."
3192,Nice hotel with good friendly staff,40,August 2015,Staff were very good throughout the hotel and a special mention to Putra in the restaurant for whom nothing was too much trouble and always had a smile. Very noticeable all of the managers pitching in and showing leadership. Room was s bit small and lack of a bath in this standard hotel were the only negatives. Pool area was good as was the service to the beach club. Spa was also very good and total package was pretty good value
3193,Great Hotel,40,August 2015,"Having a lovely stay with my family. Very family friendly, staff our very friendly, kids club is fantastic keeping our kids occupied ever day. Lovely pool, buffet breakfast is great. One bedroom pool view suite was a great size to accommodate my husband and two boys.
They provide free popcorn and fairy floss for kids and on first few days we got fresh guava icy poles. A lovely added gesture/novelty for kids.
Location was perfect, easy walk to beach and to restaurants and shops. Highly recommend."
3194,Good value for money,50,August 2015,"A very good choice if you are not spending lots of time in the hotel.

The room size is reasonable, the room is new, clean, friendly staff, good breakfast.

Make sure pick a room with pool view, as I think the rooms close to the street side could be very noisy.

Stayed August 15 as couple"
3195,Exceptional,50,August 2015,"We had a week at Marriott and could not fault it, everything was simply perfect! The staff were outstanding, the customer service was excellent. In New Zealand I train people in customer service and I feel that the staff here are very customer focused, congratulations!
From the check in with receptionist Ray to the beach buggy service, the wonderful breakfasts, Agik in the restaurant, the pool bar, the spa staff, the room service ......far too many to mention. We had a wonderful time. Our special mention has to go to Prisi, she was very attentive and is a very genuine young lady and I'm sure management must be very proud of her.
We will return, without doubt.
Gary and Tracey."
3196,Excellent! Will be back!!,50,August 2015,"Just returned from staying here a week. Breakfast was amazing with lots of variety. We also had lunch and dinner at the hotel and this was just as good. We hung out at the pool bar quite a bit and were very well looked after by all the staff. Particular thanks to Agus, Desi & Anton who ensured we had a great stay. Bloody Mary burger was fantastic!!"
3197,Great place!,50,August 2015,"Stayed with family here for a week, its great because its a luxury hotel so you can have a great leisurely time in the hotel and when you feel you can go out and have some adventures. As most large hotels, things are not cheap but they are super easy and its pretty worth that. So close to afternoon sips at the beach and just a $2 cab ride back in from town (buggy will take you in)!"
3198,Very good hotel,40,August 2015,Staffs are really friendly and helpful. The hotel is in good location and we really enjoyed the wide variety of breakfast offered. Very tight security check when entering the hotel. might offended other but i do really like it that way.
3199,What a gem,50,August 2015,Just had 3 nights at the courtyard what a gem ! Great breakfast great staff really is terrific value for money . All the rooms are built around the pool for a busy pool with a hectic pool bar you can still relax and unwind . This hotel has the right ingredients !
3200,Lots to like but not for everyone,40,March 2015,"I have rated very good as did find service excellent. I requested a quiet room away from kids club ) as had booked pool access room. Great as you can walk straight out of your room to pool but offers little privacy if you want to sit outside in your outdoor sitting area . I found best to have swim early as by 11am almost impossible as busy. Lots of activity in pool -aquarobics and music. Also seemed to be popular with conferences. If conference make sure you get up for breakfast early. Breakfast was good. Very good fitness centre & most helpful trainer there. Room was very comfortable and shower area large. Toiletries of good quality but no cotton pads or buds supplied. Had an enjoyable spa treatment but expensive compared to some of my other treatments in Bali. If you are after a quiet, peaceful hotel this hotel is not for you. But if you like a hotel with lots of activities would probably like."
3201,Incredible service,50,July 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak on our honeymoon, and had a fantastic four days at the hotel. The manager, Brad, is to be commended on the team he has assembled at the hotel. Every single member of staff we encountered, from check-in to check-out, greeted us with a genuine, warm smile. There were so many little touches that gave the impression we were staying somewhere really quite special - from the cool welcome drink at check-in, to the free popocorn and candyfloss in reception, to the free ice lollies handed out by the pool, this was a hotel that really invested in service. The location is very good, just 5 minutes from the beach and perhaps 15 minutes walk from Eat Street. And the breakfasts.....wow! The offering at breakfast every day was incredible, with a mixture of English, Continental and Indonesian offerings. Finally, the pool and pool bar were great - we spent a lot of time there! All in all, we would recommend this hotel very highly indeed - thank you Brad and team!"
3202,Breakfast is amazing. Pool is great for little ones.,50,August 2015,"We stayed in two places while holidaying for the first time in Bali. This hotel and the Jineng Villas. Both are equally excellent but different. See my other review on Jineng Villas.

Things we loved about this hotel:
1. Extensive choices for breakfast buffet (also opens from 6:30am for those who have little ones who wake early).
2. Internet was everywhere around the hotel, pool, inside bedrooms, and you didnt have to log on every single time.
3. Had a gym and spa centre (used the gym, but not the spa).
4. Kids club (although we didn't use it).
5. Pool (great for the little ones)
6. Location was great.
7. Complimentary buggy to the beach.
8. Complimentary popcorn (my toddler loved this).

Things we didn't like so much:
1. It was a bit noisy for us even though we were on the top floor (6th floor).
2. Rooms were a bit small.
3. Having to go through the security was a bit annoying (I'm talking about every single time you leave the hotel).
4. Bathrooms don't feel like they have enough privacy (although I didn't have any issues, others might want to consider if sharing a room). Bathrooms have sliding doors and windows to the bedroom, although there are blinds.

We would definitely come back!"
3203,Just above average,30,August 2015,"This is a good hotel if you are coming to bali on a budget and want to receive a standard service (by that i mean a chain hotel service than a boutique). As its fairly new, cheapish and it is located near the beach (though the walk back from the beach at night isnt pleasant as its quite dark).
The quality of the breakfast in the canteen wasnt great. They did have everything but clearly they have been purchased on a budget.
The walk to town from the hotel is a bit far and you'd get hassled by all the local touristy shop keepers looking to attract attention.
If you are visiting this hotel for a short break and want something cheap and cheerful then this hotel could be ideal. If you are travelling from far looking for something special then you may wish you had paid a bit more and stayed somewhere else."
3204,Book early to avoid disappointment,50,August 2015,"This is our second visit since September last year and the popularity is a sure sign that they're doing all the right things to impress. We were late in booking and as such missed out on our preferred room option. As a courtyard type layout it is important to remember that during winter months (for Australia) the pool can be a bit cold in the morning, until the lunch time sun hits it. With the layout has the pool between all of the rooms you either have a poolside or not. Both have their pro's and con's. Make sure you request a quiet room if you really want one.
The food here is nothing short of exceptional. Breakfast is superb, with in-house made pastries and a mix of eastern and western food options. Coffee's are endless at breakfast, and best we've had in Bali.
Staff are typical ""Bali friendly"" and there are some familiar faces from last year. This indicates that they staff are happy, so a testament to the management team.
Great level of security upon arrival.
Housekeeping were great, always happy to return and service the rooms should we have our two young children napping.
Great location in Seminyak.
Great for families and couples alike.
Avoid disappointment by booking early. You won't be disappointed if you do."
3205,Great hotel,50,February 2015,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this Courtyard for 8 nights and we loved every aspect of the hotel. The hotel staff are incredibly friendly and helpful - they were able to provide us with suggestions for dinner, travel accommodations, etc. etc. The pool/pool bar are fantastic ways to spend the day (drinks and snacks are so good). At night, they have singers perform by the pool! Such a great experience and will definitely recommend."
3206,Bali bliss,40,July 2015,"Recently spent four days in blissful Bali and can recommend this medium sized hotel, for although we asked to change rooms due to plumbing issues, they were incredibly helpful and accommodating and addressed the problem promptly and courteously. Our new suite was perfect, spacious and overlooking the beautiful pool, with very comfy king bed and gorgeous linen and bathroom. The breakfast was good with plenty of choice of Eastern and western delicacies. Cocktails at the pool were divine, highly recommend the lemongrass mojitos! Location is close to the beach and an easy walk into Jalan Oberoi or quick taxi ride anywhere... We would definitely recommend!"
3207,Family style hotel,30,August 2015,"Stayed here for 3 nights in August this year. Having booked through a travel web site, the room i was given overlooked a garbage dump. I asked for a replacement but had to upgrade paying USD20 per night which was a bad start. However I tend blame the web site for not highlighting the view their special rates offered. The upgraded room was great overlooking the pool.

Room itself was good and clean. Housekeeping service daily, however a bottle cap that was under the dresser stayed there all through my 3 nights.
No bath tubs though there is plenty of space to have included one. Shower very standard. Wifi in the rooms and restaurant was included in the room rate. Speed was pretty good.

No turn down service.

The pool being the main and only attraction in the hotel it was a bit noisy but not too bad. Preferred noise over garbage.

Cocktails Happy hour from 4-8 at the pool bar, which is pretty good. One for One. The drinks were good but ofcourse as during any happy hour were slightly watered down. Never had a problem finding a table though it was pretty full most of the evening.

Used the Spa once and was disappointed. Cancelled the other three appointments i had. Much better massage outside for better prices. No special ambience and the masseuse was bad.

Beach is a 20 mt. walk or a 5 mt. buggy ride away. Buggy most often busy or being charged.

Good location being very near Seminyak Road for great shopping.

Good Breakfast spread but nothing exciting. Mostly Western and a small Asian section. Wish they had fresh juice though. Most juice is off a carton, served out in jars. The coffee was good and the guy made me lovely Latte's every morning. You have to ask for any special coffee, as its not part of the regular service. Nice Ice Cream. Good selection of Breads. Plenty of tables in the restaurant but it could get full at times. I used to do an early breakfast to avoid the screaming kids.

Definitely a family hotel as there were children everywhere."
3208,9.9 out of 10. .1 deduction for very cold pool.,50,August 2015,"booked our first luxury escapes deal with no great expectations. Everything went smoothly and the staff were incredibly helpful. Great breakfast spread, seen far worse in 5 star hotels. Everything about the stay was great. Have their own beach area and drive you there and to eat street in buggy. Cocktails at $22 australian are too dear other than at happy hour, plenty of better bars to drink in for less near by. Food outside of breakfast is ok but again plenty of choice nearby. pool is main issue not getting much sun so is very cool and not that inviting to sit in the water by 4.3pm happy hour. Great position close to everything, nice beach. Absolutely would stay again."
3209,Solid overall performance,40,August 2015,"Big picture: This is a very good place to stay in Seminyak. Transportation is quick from the airport (do not pay more than 100,000 - prepay taxi stand may rip you off). They take security far more seriously than the neighboring hotels, which is comforting. Check-in was marred a bit by being charged upfront when he offered to only fully charge at check-out. The room is excellent and quite comfortable. The bug spray can was strange and thankfully not needed. And from the view it's obvious all the loungers by the pool are not immediately occupied early in the morning. Oh, and with curtains open you get a direct view into your multiple-neighbor's rooms across the way. I'd still avoid city view rooms, though. Breakfast choices are quite varied and they keep the coffee flowing, but avoid around 9 am when it becomes overcrowded. The gym is far too small for the number of people staying here. We didn't try the spa. Location overall is fantastic, with easy walking access to the beach and dozens of restaurants (get the pocket map). Their offering of the hotel's beach area is really an afterthought given its distance from the hotel and surf itself. One evening they offered to give a ride back (I know, not always). The employee there said the cart was ""on the way"" yet it didn't arrive until 35 minutes later. I don't endorse dishonesty. Overall they definitely deliver a restful vacation with plenty of familiar services to keep things running smoothly."
3210,VERY PLEASANT VISIT WITH A1 SERVICE,50,July 2015,"Family holiday with 2 young children. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. If I was to be extremely picky I found the pool water cold, no welcome drink on arrival, Eggs benedict at breakfast always cold. Small problems which weren't a huge deal. Had a couple of hiccups on arrival regarding the size of the room which was sorted out well by the check in staff. Kids club staff are awesome and our kids loved it aged 5 and 8. This was on a Luxury Escapes deal which was awesome value. We where held over by the volcano disruption and could not be accommodated here so moved to the Bali Dynasty and their staff could take some lessons in customer service from the Marriott staff."
3211,Amazing Stay,50,January 2015,"This was an excellent hotel. All of the facilities were perfect.
The breakfast was to die for! AMAZING! And all other meals had at the restaurant were great.
The pool was wonderful as was the gym.
You felt very safe at this hotel with a large amount of security.
Would definitely stay here again :)"
3212,"Top Service, the most friendly staff!",50,August 2015,"Spent seven days at this resort - The staff and the service were exceptional. There was nothing that the staff wouldn`t do to ensure your holiday was just that, a holiday! The breakfast offered did not disappoint with a huge choice of dishes to select from. Complimentary and endless fairy floss and popcorn was a big hit with all ages! Management should be very proud of staff and the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak!"
3213,Weekend get away!,40,August 2015,"Every year, a visit to Bali is a must for me and gal friends. We've been staying at the same marriot hotel last few visits. This year, we decided to try out the new sister hotel - marriot courtyard.

It was a small treasure hotel with nice room decor. I love mine in particularly for the walk-in wardrobe concept. Great pool and excellent location in semiyak. Going everywhere was within 10 - 15 mins with ease of traffic. Only thing is beverages could be better.

We would like to specially say thank you to Ray (hopefully I got his name right!) from the front desk. We arrived late on a thurs night, but Ray at the front desk was very helpful and cheerful, making our check-in a smooth process. He was very attentive throughout our stay. After a shopping afternoon, he came up to us at the lobby to notify us that the room above me had dropped their teddy bear into my balcony. Hence a staff had to come to my room to retrieve it. Though small act, I do appreciate the assurance. Lastly, upon knowing we had a night flight, Ray accommodated a late check out for 1 of our room so we can rest. And was very thoughtful to ensure that we were attended to, even after checking out. All these small acts makes us love the services and would definitely go back again!"
3214,"Not bad, not great",30,August 2015,"After purchasing a voucher through Luxury Escapes we were looking forward to our 10 days in Bali at this new hotel.
First impressions were a lack of communication. After contacting the hotel before we left to organise extra bed for our 2 year old we were told this would be sorted. When we arrived we were told we would need to pay an extra $40 U.S. Dollars a night, although our voucher was for 2 adults and 2 children. Our daughter had to sleep on a couch for the first night. After further discussion and confusion with reception, this was sorted out for us. We also found the location just a little out of the way for the areas we frequently visited.
Luxury Escapes voucher says upgraded pool view room, all rooms are pool view, little bit deceiving when purchasing.

The hotel is built just like a courtyard, limited sun and windy. Pool is covered in shade 90% of the day and has limited sunbeds.
The concrete around the pool area is slippery and people kept slipping over with kids in our group slipping down the stairs. Don't understand why there isn't non slip surface around the pool edge?

Shower area in room was also slippery, not great for young children, our 2 year old slipped over twice.

The wardrobe light in our room wouldn't turn off, maintenance were called out 4 times to keep repairing as it would light up the whole room while sleeping.

Free cocktail, dinner and lunch vouchers only gave you a small selection to choose from. The 'seminyak kitchen' wasn't great, much better food outside of hotel.

Kids club was great, offered babysitting services which gave us time for some shopping, lunches and massages... Always needed in Bali üòÄ
Communication seemed to improve over our stay.

Wasn't an unpleasant stay, but wasn't great either. Probably won't return next time."
3215,Kids club,50,July 2015,"Fantastic hotel, staff are always friendly and helpful. Big thanks to the girls in the kids club especially Santi and Debby who are wonderful with the kids. Everyday they were so happy and creative with the activities. Our kids loved going to see them everyday."
3216,really great installations and atmosphere,50,August 2015,In the heart of Seminyak it is nice to stay at a place that provides top class amenities for a very decent price. The difference in service is abysmal compared to other hotels nearby. This is the second time I stay here and feel very at home in this friendly setting.
3217,Fantastic hotel and the team,50,July 2015,"It is a sensational hotel with a very dedicated team. My experience was just impeccable right from the arrival until the check-out. Very friendly team who always puts guest comfort first. I stayed in this hotel for three nights during a very busy weekend but the team in the hotel always had a GENUINE smile on their face. Breakfast was fantastic with loads of food variety (Western and Asian options). Pool bar team was very friendly and welcoming. Also the hotel is very close to the beach (just five mins walk) which is just perfect! I have been in Bali for more then 10 times and stayed in Nusa Dua, Kuta, Seminyak and even Ubud but Courtyard Seminyak was the best experience so far. Kudos to the sensational team!! I am definitely visiting again."
3218,Lovely hotel in Seminyak,50,August 2015,"Just got back from a 7 night stay at the Marriott.
Such a nice hotel they should be very proud of the staff they have all were very friendly and nothing was to much trouble.
Breakfast was outstanding every day and the rooms were very good they even let us stay in our room and extra 2 hours as we had a late flight. Cleaning of the rooms was outstanding."
3219,Surprised,30,August 2015,You would have thought that a large hotel chain like Marriot would have designed rooms to accommodate travelers......not here......in a Pool View Room which is supposed to be upmarket and having to live out of our suitcases as there is hardly any storage for clothing. Very average and here for another 10 days
3220,Good security and hospitality,50,July 2015,"Great pool bar and live music ....so many room has a good view to pool . But my room 676 block by the roof of the pool bar . Ask the best view when you stay .
The berakfast not so many item but good design ""seminyak chicken"" . And the buggy car can drive u to beach / seminyak road .
And my son sunglasses was forget and left in my room . And the staff send it back to me after i call to hotel
, what a great hospitaliy . Thank you @cyseminyak"
3221,Nice hotel in the perfect location,50,July 2015,It is a lovely hotel for family or even for a couple. A well managed restaurant and pool bar. All the staffs are well trained and always happy to assist. A special mention to the fire show organized on Fridays are really nice. The kids seems to enjoy galore. The proximity to the beach is a add on. It is just 10 min pleasant walk. Wonderful experinece
3222,Amazing,50,August 2015,"This hotel took my breath away, only stayed there one night, had a pool facing room which was gorgeous, so modern and brand new. Breakfast was also
Fantastic and staff were so friendly. It's a very busy hotel with lots going on and lots of families and couples. We wanted to party so it was a great hotel for us. If you want a more relaxing holiday perhaps choose a more traditional place in seminyak but for a lively atmosphere this hotel is amazing! Loved it"
3223,The all-around great Marriott experience continues!,50,July 2015,"The hotel is very conveniently located. It is just about 10 mins walking to the beach, which is superb.

The staff are very friendly (barring a lady who was supposed to seat us for breakfast but chose to give another couple priority inspite of us having come first and having waited for 10 mins)

The hotel has a good gym and swimming pool. There is live music in the evening and the bar is fun!

The staff were kind enough to allow us an early checkin.Thanks once again."
3224,Excellent,50,July 2015,We have just had six wonderful days at this hotel... Staff and service always very friendly and attentive. Breakfast every morning was extremely good.The Mexican Dinner was exceptional and highly recommended. Our room was spotlessly cleaned and fresh sheets everyday. We have enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely be returning.
3225,Great hotel in the best location in Seminyak,50,July 2015,"A lovely hotel in great location in Seminyak. Close to the beach - 5 mins walk down the street (the hotel even offers to takes you in a golf cart...) and up the road you have restaurants, bars and massage places. A taxi to Eat Str is only 40.000 ruphies, for more options.
Lovely rooms, modern and clean, feels new. A big hotel that offers anything you can wish for, great service and very nice staff. The breakfast is absolutely amazing. Make sure to book on a rate that includes breakfast. The premises and the poolarea is gorgeous."
3226,"Great Location, close to Beach",40,July 2015,"We had pool view room, which was great, However, there are no drawers to put your clothes in like shorts, underwear, swim wear etc, wardrobe is small but adequate. Safe is on 3rd shelf and due to poor lighting we could not read the instructions to use. I had to kneel on floor to try and read, should be up higher for older people.Had to hide passports and money,
Best Breakfast at any resort we have been to. Staff excellent, very friendly and helpful. I had vouchers for massage ( the girls are very good) however, not enough staff many guests missed out on massages as so many guests were staying who had bought through Luxury Escapes the same as us.
Pool is good size, however only one side of the pool receives the sun during the day and although told NOT to you have to put a towel on day bed on the way to breakfast otherwise you won't get one. Not enough day beds.
We hired a driver for the day and he was excellent, security is tops.
Staff drove us to the beach in the golf cart which was a lot easier for my husband, could not fault the staff at all."
3227,Very good!!!,50,June 2015,"Good location just 7 minutes to the beach and hotel pool is excellent.. All rooms has pool view with balcony so maybe less privacy when you are swimming coz everyone can look at you from their room but for me this is ok coz anyway im in holiday and un fact no one will really look at you. Breakfast has enough selection.. Welcome drink and the ice cream was also very nice and i love it.. Last time there was welcome amenity but this time i didnt get any... They said my original room was not ready so they chg my room so maybe thats why no welcome amenities.. One thing i would like to suggest is swimming pool water is too cold! Sometimes the swimming pool has no sun then cannot swim for long.. Last time was also too cold but this time was also too cold...
Except this all good! Thx"
3228,Always good,40,July 2015,"I love Marriott and they will not make you disappointed.
This courtyard is good, clean rooms and the beds are great. The pool is big but you only have sun in one of the side, they have a nice pool bar and live music from 5 pm. It is only 400-500 meter down to the beach and they offer transportation to the beach and to the market street for shopping. You have lot of restaurants close by and also places to rent Scooter(s).
The check in and out was smooth with friendly good service."
3229,"Lovely premises, great location.",40,July 2015,"A group of friends were meeting in seminyak for a few days and chose the Marriot. This is a lovely hotel with exceptional service and comfortable clean rooms. This a a very family friendly hotel which for a group of friends without families perhaps the least appealing
Pros
Beautiful premises, fantastic buffet breakfast, beautiful hospitality, clean comfortable rooms, great location.
Cons
The pool has limited seating and half remains in the shade for the day, children are in the pool area from opening to close (making that afternoon nap impossible), ask for a room high up and away from the children pool end, limited seating around the pool bar area.
This is a lovely hotel however if you don't want to be on holidays with families with young children i would consider else where."
3230,Wow! I wish Courtyard in the US was this amazing.,50,April 2015,"The Courtyard Marriott was pretty amazing. Due to gold status, we were upgraded to the one bedroom pool view suite which was lovely. The suite was 5 stars all the way around. It beats some of the Ritz Carltons I‚Äôve stayed in the US.

The pool was nice and cool and the happy hour bar was great.

Do not miss the breakfast. It was the really fantastic.

We‚Äôve stayed in a few places during our trip to bali, including Conrad in Bali, and we thought the Courtyard was the best."
3231,"Good location, Great buffet breakfast",40,March 2015,"This is a great modern hotel is an absolutely brilliant location in seminyak, 5 minutes walk to the beach, walking distance to Eat Street and close to the shops of Seminyak. Breakfast is good as are the staff very helpful with good English skills. Great room with pool views to enjoy evening cocktail at the balcony."
3232,lovely hotel with 5 star hospitaliy,50,July 2015,whenever we came to bali we always stay in nusa dua area... but this time we come across at this hotel and we decide to stay in seminyak area instead and choose courtyard seminyak... and we had such a lovely stay there.. the hotel staff from the moment we arrived everyone has showed a sincere hospitality... the reception welcome us and within a minute we are getting our key to our room.. the breakfast was great.. everything is perfect... not only that.. the location of the hotel is superb it's located in the heart of seminyak and it gives you many access how to avoid the traffic jam during their peak hours.... definitely will come back to stay for our next visit.
3233,Outstanding service,50,July 2015,"After being delayed by the ash cloud we arrived at our hotel in seminyak exhausted but it wasn't really up to standard so we went down the road to the Courtyard. As soon as we walked in looking weary one of the staff came straight over to help us and within 5 minutes we had iced tea and handed freshly made popcorn and after discovering we were Australian... Offered us a beer! They let us check in early and really nothing was too much trouble. Great pool facing room with king bed, sitting area, desk and big balcony with day bed. Amazing shower room with space to sit down it was a real treat considering how we were feeling. South side rooms get all the sun and you want a room facing the pool. Pool has big bean bags to use and a pool bar in the top section. The lounge bar by the pool is a great place to chill out and the food in this hotel is amazing. Great buffet breakfast we were rally spoilt for choose there was even breakfast ice cream. While we were sitting there we were even offered a freshly baked breakfast desert. Breakfast desert! Heaven! It is walkable to the beach and a short walk along the beach to LA Plancha and Cocoon beach club. At the end of the street is an amazing restaurant Chez Gado Gado which is well worth a try. The are some nice boutique shops if you walk the PPP direction but you're about a kilometre away from the main seminyak shopping area."
3234,Vacation,50,July 2015,"Definitely one of the better places to stay at while in Bali! The rooms are clean and the beds are so comfy, especially after a long day.

These also a kids club great for kids 4 years and older. 2 free hours! They can also arrange for babysitting which is so helpful for travelers with kids. Mommy and daddy can squeeze in some massage and spa time:)"
3235,Lovely Hotel with great staff,40,July 2015,"Nice hotel with spacious room and bathroom. Being a very new hotel everything works well. We were initially given a room facing the main street which ended up being very noisy. Couldn't sleep at night. After we told reception the next day they moved us and it was very quiet. They should of double glazed the outside rooms!
The pool area was nice the pool bar was lovely and the food and drinks were actually really really good. The happy hour drinks were great!
The breakfast spread was not bad. Heaps of pastries and your standard western fare. And a few local dishes too. Their nasi goreng is amazing. However I would of liked to see more healthy options.
Location wise its a long hike into the centre of seminyak.
Wifi was super fast!"
3236,Awesome honeymoon!,40,December 2014,"Hi,
We stayed here for about 10 days from end-Dec to first week of January, celebrating our honeymoon. The property is new and hence excellent rooms and facilities. The pool-bar is a great place to chill, and the hotel is located close to markets and the beach. The service can be slow (room-service takes a minimum of 45 minutes and sometimes more than an hour) and if we were in a hurry it would get annoying, but since we were on a relaxed vacation we got used to it. Overall the front-desk/office experience wasn't great, towards the end they made a mistake in the billing and we were being asked to pay extra, and after correction they didn't even apologize once, that is just one small example of the unfriendly staff. If the property/infrastructure wasn't great (a 5/5), I would've rated this hotel a 3/5."
3237,Modern hotel with excellent staff,50,July 2015,"We had four nights here after being delayed by the ash cloud. The staff on the front desk could not have been more helpful.
Our room was modern, clean with a very spacious bathroom. We were on the 5th floor with a lovely view down over the pool. Looks great at night with all the lights.
We ate by the pool and also in the restaurant. The food is excellent including the buffet breakfast. I mentioned the excellent staff in the title and I have to say it is true....they really were very attentative, very friendly and extremely helpful. I wish I knew the name of one of the bar tenders in the pool bar....he remembered that we had ordered a drink one evening but never received it. He approached us the next day as we walked to our room and insisted on making us a fresh juice each. This was the fourth hotel we stayed in this trip and their customer service was a stand out. Very impressed.
Also we really enjoyed the location. Walking distance to the beach, great restaurants, shopping etc. The only negative was it could be noisy at times with the pool running down the middle and the rooms facing same."
3238,Outstanding service in challenging times,50,July 2015,"Like many we were recently caught with cancelled flights trying to fly home from Bali. We ended up spending 4 nights here whilst trying to get home. Many people were far worse off however what really impressed was the attitude and helpfulness of the staff from the top down. No effort to exploit the situation, constant updates and very helpful staff throughout the hotel.Rooms are clean and comfortable, nice pool and bar area and great breakfasts but really it was the attention to the small details at a time when many people were trying very hard to resolve flight issues that made the hotel stand out. Thanks very much."
3239,Very very bad service. Dissappointed.,20,July 2015,My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. We booked via booking.com and initially we were going to stay for 2 nights. We booked the pool side room.. which is more expensive compared to the normal room. And due to changes in travel plan i decided to book an extea night. They could not accomodate our request to stay continuously in the same room. So we had to change room.. and on top of that they gave us a pool side room but the one right at the end which had no direct access to the pool!!! On the last day i asked for 30 mins late check out and the management said NO immediately. I mean it is only 30 mins... i am extremely dissappointed. Will not come back here again ever.... there are many better hotels in Bali.
3240,Excellent,50,July 2015,I stayed for 2 nights with family and friends . It seems perfect . Staff is very always Smily and pool side bar they have great cocktails and more over its not pricy. 5 min walk from beach side and near to market and bali spa . Great breakfast......
3241,Fantastic stay,50,July 2015,"We are coming to the end of our stay here at Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak. Our family have loved this hotel! The one bedroom suite is big and has plenty of room for our family of 3 but I think a family of 4 would be more than happy with the room size too. The staff can't do enough for you and are always ""on the ball"". The General Manager is an ever present sight around the hotel, and I think that's part of the reason why the hotel is run like a finely tuned machine and why the hotel is such a success. We believe the GM, Brad is a perfect example of someone with fantastic P.R. Skills. He makes time to chat to everyone making them feel important and ensures you feel welcome. The breakfasts are amazing and the 2 hour happy hour each day attracts a big crowd. I can see why it does because in our opinion the cocktails are better here than at the Doublesix Rooftop Bar. We ate lunch by the pool every day and looked forward to trying out the menu each day and we also ate at the restaurant twice at night (the food was delicious). If I had to find a negative, it would be the lack of pool beds in the sun. However in saying that, there are a decent amount of beds but there are also a lot of people at the hotel at the moment due to it being high season (and the volcanic ash back log of people). We will definitely be looking at staying here again on our next holiday to Bali."
3242,5 Awesome nights!,50,July 2015,"My wife and I were supposed to stay only for 3 nights but extended it by another couple of nights due to the airport closure. No complaints about extending our stay at this great hotel in the magnificent island of Bali.

One thing for sure - the photos of the rooms on the website don't do any justice! The actual rooms look much better (cleaner, bigger and more modern).

The staff are very friendly right from the front desk, the security and the wait staff at the Seminyak Kitchen (where breakfast is). Speaking of breakfast - they serve both the Western spread and Indonesian food. Yummy! Oh, and the staff there are very jovial and engaging. Bayu, the sous chef, is very entertaining; always addressing you by your name and he'll stop at every table to chat up with guests.

The hotel location is within walking distance from the Seminyak beach and Jalan Raya Seminyak (the main stretch of Seminyak where there're lots of good shops, cafes and restaurants). Not the noisy stretch; but not that far from there!

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Seminyak!"
3243,Lovely Stay in Seminyak,40,July 2015,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for one night at the end of our vacation in Indonesia. We were looking for a place to relax after sailing on a boat for 6 nights and we found it.

The staff were very friendly and checked us in quickly. We enjoyed the lovely treats at check in. We were given a room on the 2nd level that felt spacious, even with an extra bed added for our daughter.

We enjoyed our dinner at the Seminyak Kitchen (the hotel's restaurant). It was great food and we enjoyed the convenience of not having to leave the hotel. The breakfast (which was included in the rate we booked) was amazing. It was hard to choose as there was so many yummy things. A warning for parents -- there is ice cream available at breakfast-and your kids will love it!

At this point in our trip, we just wanted to relax and this hotel provided that opportunity.

A few small things: If you want a quiet room, have them place you as far from the pool bar area as possible. Our room was directly across from the pool bar and the music was loud. It did quiet down by 9:30 but if you have a child that needs to go to bed early or you are exhausted, this would definitely impact your ability to sleep.

The pool was lovely but it is cold if the sun is not out -- we still swam but just a word of caution."
3244,"Good family hotel, well located and VERY friendly",40,July 2015,"We enjoyed our stay - the hotel is well positioned just a 5 minute walk to a great beach for the youngsters (7 & 4), and amongst a number of cafes of various styles.
The staff were very friendly (as is typical in Bali).
The pool area had wireless Service buttons to request a barman to take an order - I've never seen these before and thought they were fabulous.
We had some dinner and cocktail coupons in our package but found that these entitled selections from a limited menu - I thought this was a bit deceptive. The spa coupons by contrast were good value. The cost of spa services were very reasonable given the facilities and much cheaper than Sydney - a nice extravagance after the $7 massage shops out on the street."
3245,Very good location,40,July 2015,"A budget marriot hotel, quite close to the beach just a 5 min walk. The breakfast was excellent with many items, the pool is pretty good, with a pool bar.The seminyak kitchen was great, serving tasty food. The rooms are well furnished, with a good balcony. Not a high end luxury one though. We had a few issues with the balcony door, the toilet flush, the shower area door lining etc which were rectified immediately on request. They were insisting on a safety deposit when we wanted to make some international calls from the hotel. Will recommend staying here for the location, and amenities."
3246,Great Hotel in Great Position,50,July 2015,"Loved The Marriott Stones last year, so thought we'd try Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak this time: travelled with 9 women for 50th Birthday.
I would describe Courtyard as the younger sister to Stones. Really great position and well set up hotel. Room to pool to gym to breakfast/restaurant to lobby all handy & close......sometimes in bigger hotels you feel like it takes forever to get from a to b. Courtyard is really ""comfortable"".
lots of lovely staff; from Dewi,Ray,Cindy,Maria & Ari at Reception,(always very,very helpful with any query) Nova at transport (also helped in getting my daughters wallet back when it fell out in taxi) , Joni & boys in aqua aerobics, chef at egg station and of course the most ""hands on"" GM I've ever seen, Brad (saw him fixing food in kitchen at brekkie) soooo many lovely staff to mention ,will write more names next time :) even the gardeners had a smile for us !
amazes me how people write negatives on such trivial things ;
pool water a bit cool? swim faster
room too small? stay home
missed out on a sun lounge? get up earlier
you're in a great hotel in a beautiful country with the friendliest people, don't whinge ....look for the good things ,they're there!
Enjoyed our time at Courtyard. Close walk to beach , shopping (good stuff & market stalls) walk to restaurants and short taxi ride to some of the well known places to eat.
**worthwhile getting hotel F&B credit when you check in , pay $80 get $100credit
enjoy:Franca"
3247,Good people and location,40,July 2015,"Stayed with our two boys using my Marriott points. Excellent location and very nice, friendly and warm staff ... Most places are in walking distance. Room was a little tight but just ok enough for 4. Thought breakfast buffet was expensive @ 260,000 IDR per person but you can go outside towards beach less than 500 mts and eat at 35-40000 IDR a good breakfast. Seminiyak square is a 15 min walk which is where all the action is in terms of bar and restaurants and shopping. Also 2 mins from hotel are several grocery stores like mini mart or K circle in case you need to buy something. Security is very tight with friendly and efficient staff. They have table tennis in lobby area and free Internet cafe + wifi is free in entire hotel. Gym has limited equipments so refresh your home workout sets. Nice pool and bar ... Overall great place"
3248,Pretty Decent,40,May 2015,"Stayed at the Courtyard by Marriot Bali, Seminyak while vacationing with the family sometime in May , 2015. It is located bang in the middle of the hustling and bustling city and is hardly the place to be if you wish to be far from the madding crowd. Service was excellent and the cuisine superb. There was a reasonably priced seafood buffet and a coffee bar which I particularly enjoyed.
The rooms are comfy but a little bit on the cramped side if you are travelling with kids. One of the biggest issue for me was the lack of privacy. The rooms are built with neat little balconies that gives you a clear view of the pool and an even better view into practically a hundred rooms. Residents would be well advised to shut the drapes if they want to avoid peeping toms.
There is a great activity room for kids. The spa was fantastic and I had the best massage ever. So all in all, t was quite a nice experience."
3249,EXCELLENT FAMILY HOTEL WITH GREAT STAFF AND AMENITIES,50,July 2015,"We were here for 7 nights on a Luxury Escape Package, themselves actually worth a separate review, and we were delighted with the venue.
Our Deluxe Pool Terrace room was great, walk straight out on to the pool area, with plentiful lounges for lazing on, a bar close by, but also with pool bar service.
The Seminyak Kitchen, only dining area actually, which had a very good selection to suit all tastes for breakfast, even Ice Cream for the children and some adults!!!! We also ate here a couple of times for lunch and dinner, but the hotel is located very close to a small market, many small super markets, restaurants and the beach. A free hotel shuttle will take you to 3 destinations whenever you want to go, there is no limit of hour!
The staff were EXCEPTIONAL!!! Nothing was too big an ask, and always with a huge smile on their faces. From Check In, Restaurant, Room attendants, Ladies in the Spa, all were just delightful.
The room we had I don't think is much different from any other except that it has direct access to the pool, whereas the other rooms overlook the pool, I think I would be correct in saying all rooms have views on to the pool area, I am not 100% sure on this, but they seem to have!
To sum it up, I would have to say IT IS A VERY HAPPY HOTEL ENVIROMENT, well located ina not too busy spot in Seminyak, but close to everything."
3250,"Great location, great stay",50,July 2015,"We had a family holiday together with our adult sons, partners, a 22 mth old and a 4 mth old. Suited us all very well. Great location to beach, varied shopping, cafes & good restaurants (Seminyak Square) etc. Breakfast was included in our package and it was fantastic, everything one could ask for and more plus very good service. Only 2 small grizzles, half the pool and half sun loungers are shaded by hotel & don't get sun which suited us but might not suit everyone, it does however make the pool quite a 'fresh' temperature. Rooms a good size but tight with a cot so need to be organised and tidy or upgrade to one beddy suite. Quite a well equipped, clean gym."
3251,Clean and Safe,50,June 2015,"Security checks like at airport every time you enter hotel. Modern. Large shower. Nice small balcony. Friendly helpful staff. Great breakfast. I'd give it ***** baring in mind it's not a 5 star resort.

This was my 5 time to Indonesia. Much better than I was expecting."
3252,Nice hotel & well located,40,July 2015,"We spent 5 nights at the Marriott. We choosed it as it is only 5min away from the semyniak beach and has a nice big swimmingpool.

The staff is very nice, smiling and we had a warm welcome.

The room is ok nothing amazing but big enough for a short stay and with a nice balcon with the pool view.

Breakfast was excellent with a lot of choice and any kind of breakfast you can enjoy.

Finally the pool bar is also very nice with very good barmen/girl.

We definitly recommend this hotel for stays is semyniak beach"
3253,Great place,40,July 2015,"Visited in June 2015 with family (3 young kids). Stayed in suite with adjoining twin room.
Overall had a great stay.

Pros

New hotel- rooms very nice
Staff very friendly
Good suggestions from manager about leisure activities
Good pool
Nice ambience in evenings with live music from ?5-7
Great breakfast buffet
Poolside menu and pool bar are great
Kids loved buggy ride to beach
Re security- don't worry, it's no hassle at all
When they first bring it up on check-in, it sounds a bit weird but the $100 of in-house credit for $80 is actually quite good- I bought 2 packs but prob should have bought 4.

Cons
One side of the pool is in constant sun, and the other side is in constant shade, it was never hard to get a spot in the shade but occasionally the sunny side was full
It's a taxi ride from ""eat street"" (especially if you have young kids) but if you get the hotel to call you a cab, it's only a $2 cab ride.
Gym is ok for cardio but could use a few more weights
Pool temperature was a little cool (esp in the mornings)

We had a great stay and would definitely recommend"
3254,New hotel Excellent service,40,March 2015,"we were there on march 2015 and booked 1 room. my friend want to join me in this hotel but they were fully booked for that day, since i booked for twin room but they gave me single bed. they add the extra bed with free of charge. i appreciate their compliment to solve this bed problem. Overall, i satisfied with their all service. they have variety choice of food for breakfast, and their pool is nice, location is very close on beach. Love this hotel"
3255,My Bali experience,50,July 2015,"First time to Bali and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!! New establishment with fantastic staff!! Where to begin with them...they are amazing! Always happy, smiling and very polite. If you stay long enough, they will remember you by name and what you like (omelette = well done OR coffee = extra strong!)
A special mention to the pool bar staff and even further...Hari. Great food and cocktails in a relaxed atmosphere with live music from 5-8pm.
Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to beautiful Bali! Many thanks to Brad and everyone at The Courtyard Marriott, Seminyak. #room224"
3256,Great hotel,50,July 2015,"We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriot in Seminyak for 3 nights, the hotel is very lovely and the rooms and facilities are great too, for couples, families etc..
Whilst on our holiday in Seminyak we were robbed of our phones, cards, cash in the street. The staff at the Marriot did there upmost to help us by escorted us to the police station to ensure we were looked after, translating our police report in to English and being helpful throughout the process. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting Seminyak
Also the breakfast is of a very high standard and the service is right up there too"
3257,Amazing buffet breakfast. Noisy hotel.,40,July 2015,"Best buffet breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. Rooms were modern and clean, beds and pillows were extremely comfortable.
Pool area was good, but as other people mentioned it was hard to get a spot at the pool in the sunshine. Which is disappointing if you want to sun bake. Music at the pool bar was a bit too loud. Avoid ground floor rooms as music from the bar and people/ children at the pool was very loud."
3258,"Beat expectations, a great seminyak hotel",40,June 2015,"To be completely honest, I had initially booked my stay at the Courtyard Marriott for its value. I recently traveled to Bali for my Honeymoon, and we chose the Marriott because it was relatively cheap and allowed us to stay at more traditionally higher end hotels (i.e. Four Seasons, Hanging Gardens) at a later portion of our trip without overextending our budget. Let me say, I had no idea that we would be so impressed with the accomodations! This has to be one of the best value accomodations in Bali. I would have expected a much higher price point for how nice the hotel actually was.

Highlights:
- Breakfast buffet was fantiastic. Huge selection and all items were great quality.
- Great pool area with attentive staff
- Room was clean and very modern (one of the most well-appointed in terms of modern conveniences we saw in Bali)
- Convenient location. Taxis and drivers are easily available through the concierge, though we were able to comfortably walk to nearly every major destination in the seminyak area

Things to Consider:
- Rooms are a bit small. Though we did not spend too much time in the room, there wasn't much space left after two large suitcases and two adults"
3259,Very poor,20,July 2015,"This probably the worst hotel I have stayed in. The rooms are small, there is no draws to allow unpacking for an extended stay and what little hanging space there is is taken up by the iron, ironing board and dressing gowns. Even if you could unpack there is nowhere to put the suit cases anyway.

The hotel is very noisy and the staff don't seem to understand the meaning of quite. They continually slam doors... Even at 4.30am which resulted in a call to reception but nothing was done until I got up and spoke to the staff myself.

The breakfast is the only positive of the stay.

Service is not good , we ordered two cocktails with dinner and after 20 minutes and two requests to follow up we left, just as we did there was a single drink delivered. We had asked for two. The kitchen only had three other guests so they were not busy.

Don't ask for vinegar with French fries because you will be told the kitchen has run out ... On two separate occasions.

We checked into a pool access room as part of a package and discovered we had been given a room next to the children's pool. Why would any hotel book to adults into a room next to a kids pool. It was so noisy from 9 o'clock in the morning it was impossible to sleep in and enjoy a relaxing holiday.

The design of the pool hotel is very poor there are two very separate pools both difficult to access and unless you camp out you can't get a sun bed."
3260,It was OK!,30,June 2015,"I stayed at the Courtyard last week. It was a OK experience based on my Bali experiences across the city, have been stayed a wide range of hotels from boutique to other brands. I'd say, room is nicely decorated, warm color, spacious bathroom as well as comfy mattress. This hotel scores above average.

Yet, taking the double security every time in and out hotel, I did not feel like going on a holiday. Plus, the current construction work outside the hotel is pretty annoying. The noise does bother me when i have breakfast as well as dinner. I am not saying they should stop. In case you look for a peaceful moment during dining hours, I do not think the Courtyard will suit you.

So everyone gave two thumbs up about the buffet breakfast. We found it was OK, nothing extraordinary. You got all the options on eggs, waffles, pastries, bread , juices etc. The bagel section is pretty unique , believe me or not. It is very centrally located, we walked to major shopping area without problems."
3261,Excellent Sevice,50,July 2015,"Came here with a huge group of 10 adults and 7 kids and had a wonderful time here. Nice clean and safe plus a convenient supermart right opposite the road.

Kids enjoyed the kids pool which came with water toys for general use and there's also a kids club with games, books and a ball pit.

Thoroughly enjoyed the Seafood Saturday buffet (had more than a dozen oysters) and all in all the service levels were excellent.

Highly recommended for a nice and easy holiday stay with friends and family!"
3262,Fabulous staff in great location,50,July 2015,"Just spent 6 days at Marriott and believe it to be one of the best hotels in Seminyak. Prices are excellent and rooms although not large are well appointed with a beautiful outlook over the pool areas and gardens. Breakfast is included in the room rate and would have to be the best breakfast in Bali catering for everyone with Western and Asian choices and lots for the children to enjoy. There is a kids club for families and the hotel is a five minute walk to the beach and 20 minute walk to Seminyak square. The staff can only be described as incredible; always gracious and greeting you with a smile. Wifi is also included in room rate and is fast and reliable.
This is my fifteenth trip to Bali and I have finally found the hotel to come back to. üòçüòçüòç"
3263,Fabulous First Bali trip,50,January 2015,"My family enjoyed a terrific first Bali experience in January at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak.
Being a family with two young toddlers (13months and 3yrs) we found the hotel to be perfect for our needs.

Having travelled allot, but never to Bali, all my apprehensions were eased from the moment we were collected from the airport.
The staff were exceptional. The pool staff engaged our 3yr old and always greeted him with such warmth (Thanks Captain!)
Tina, the reception manager is such an asset to your hotel. Her genuine friendliness and care was a truly impressive component of our trip. Not only did she remember both our children and ourselves by name, she sourced a traditional Balinese outfit for our 3 yr old during her days off.
The breakfast buffet was AMAZING!! If I had to make any ""negative"" remarks it would be that there's no where to hide a delicious icecream waffle cone from your toddlers at breakfast so that you don't set a bad example lol
In all seriousness though, we have travelled all over, and have never been so impressed with the quality and consistency of a breakfast buffet in a 5 star hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional
Balinese dishes each morning- delicious.
We also dined here at other meal times. All of which exceeded our expectations.

The bathroom was spacious and the shower was HUGE!!
When we stay next we will opt for a larger room. We stayed in a pool terrace, which was fabulous for pool access, but was a little cosy with 2 adults and 2 children (incl a cot)

We stayed for 10 nights and enjoyed it immensely. The close location to the beach and Seminyak was just wonderful.
The attentive and friendly staff really made our stay.

The pool bar was a favourite of ours everyday. The delicious cocktails and snacks, and the live music really let us relax and enjoy holiday mode.
The Kids club was a great source of entertainment for our two kids. The staff were terrific with all the children in there, and provided wonderful activities.

Thank you for a great stay and for a great first Bali experience.

Looking forward to coming back and staying again
SJ"
3264,Fantastic,50,June 2015,"I must admit I don't often write views but I feel I must in this case.
I have been lucky enough to experience a wide range of accommodation options in different countries.
This hotel rates right up there with the best, in fact I would say it would be the best overall experience I have had.
We stayed here from 22/06/2015 to 03/07/2015, the hotel hasn't been open that long really but it is fantastic.
The staff are extremely helpful, happy and quite frankly can't do enough for you.
All of the facilities are great, Seminyak Kitchen is awesome, in particular the buffet breakfasts, the pools and pool staff great, the gym very good with Life Fitness gym equipment, spa treatments are excellent, security is also fantastic. Really where do we stop.
The rooms are beautiful and well equiped, beds very comfortable. The only criticism we have is maybe they are a tad small but really in a place like Bali who spends their days indoors anyway?
The hotel is indeed perfect for families and couple alike.
Honestly I would highly recommend this hotel, go for it.
Super well done Courtyard Marriott Seminyak."
3265,Pleasant hotel,40,May 2015,"We stayed in a pool access room ,very clean and well furnished. The hotel ticked many boxes ,good food ie breakfast buffet ,friendly staff and very helpful, the wine selection not large a bit disappointing ,the waiter service to your lounge around the pool brilliant. The one criticism was the pool itself it's pretty much in shade most of the day and not particularly big. Overall I'd rate it 7/10"
3266,2nd time in a year and still loving it,50,July 2015,"Rarely you get top notch service and all the staff were prompt in getting your request settled. Visited last year with my 15 month old boy and this time with 4 other families. Everyone had an awesome time and kudos to Anton and team at the restaurant for their attentiveness and service. A must visit as facilities are nicely set up for an enjoyable stay.
One small feedback for families with kids would be: it would be great if the kids' pool can be heated. Sun is blocked in the early morning and late afternoon and if the kids' pool can be heated, it will be perfect."
3267,Value for Money!,50,July 2015,"Stayed for 5 nights with a 19 month old.

Upon arrival we were offered the choice of a refreshing beer, tea or soft-drink and the option of an ice-block, a nice little touch. We arrived in the evening, our toddler already asleep, check-in was quick and we were pleasantly surprised to see the cot already made-up. Our room located on the second floor, pool view, perhaps a tad squishy with three of us in a studio setup. However, room and amenities were clean, shower was huge, daily room service thorough. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Provided additional bottles of water upon request at no-charge. Huge selection of fresh food at breakfast, take-away coffees also included which was great. Room service delivered within the 45min timeframe, no follow up required. Centrally located, easy access to shopping precincts, variety of restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the beach. Felt very safe with required security checks for cars and people before entering the hotel premises. Overall a great place to stay and excellent value for money."
3268,Lovely hotel but not quiet!,30,July 2015,"I feel like I should start by saying I only stayed here for one night, in-between two trips, so I assume I was not offered their best room.

Let's start with the positives:

- This is a lovely hotel. I understand it's one of the newer ones in Seminyak so everything looks new and well maintained.
- I stayed in a Deluxe Double, which was not very big, but again I was there for less than 24 hours so it was fine. The shower was very big which is always nice. The bed was comfortable and the balcony was also very nice and fitted with a sofa and small table. A safe and ironing board+iron are provided in the wardrobe.
- Staff are friendly and accommodating.
- Breakfast is very nice. Lots of options ( they even have chocolate sprinkles, for Dutch guests I assume :) ). It's nice to order a soya latte and not be loked at like you come from a different planer. The room is set up to look like a cafe which is a lot of fun and has a terrace as well. There are also a few chefs there ready to make you omelettes and stuff, which is also great.
- Nice pool and bar, with live music and 2 for 1 cocktails.

Now for the negatives:

- This place is like a kindergarten. I am sure this is great for families with children but not so great if you want to have a nap in the afternoon and your room faces the pool. I was very tired when I got there and was planning to go to bed with the chikens but a combination of kids running on the hallways, people slamming doors and loud music kept me up until midnight. I am sure other rooms are quiet(er) but because my stay was so short I didn't feel like making a fuss about it and move.
- The location is not amazing. It's close quite to the beach and the center of Seminyak but I'd say not close enough (at least compared to other places I've stayed in). This is not a major problem since taxis are so cheap but walking into town is not ideal since there are no pavements (sidewalk) and also it gets very hot during the day, as one would expect in Bali.

All in all, I would say this is a lovely hotel for families with children but not ideal for people who want to relax and need peace and quiet."
3269,Very pedestrian,30,July 2015,"This is our second stay in Bali but one of many holidays over the years throughout Asia.
After staying previously at 'the Stones' Marriott in Legian and really enjoying the food and hospitality at this Marriott resort we decided to try The Courtyard Seminyak due to the preferred location.
The resort is designed in a rectangular configuration...just like a courtyard. However this design means the pool is in shade on one side nearly all day and there is insufficient poolside lounges along this one side to accommodate guests.
The swim-up bar is not welcoming and again poorly designed. The lounge area for the pool bar is sterile and seating is arranged like a classroom. As the bar gets busier during the evening guests naturally move chairs to make themselves comfortable but this impacts the comfort of other guests.
Smoking is welcomed in the lounge area, so if you're a non-smoking and trying to enjoy a drink with your family...forget it!
Unlike the Stones where the food quality was excellent, The Courtyard food was average and breakfast although a good selection was a circus in terms of the number of guests being accommodated in a small place.
Good things... close to beach and great restaurants...
Staff friendly but need further training...tend to cluster and chat in groups rather than being attentive to guests.
If you eat out every night and just use the resort to sleep then this may suit you."
3270,Classy hotel,40,June 2015,"Room held 3 beds, with a bit of rearranging. Large balcony accommodated chair and table. Room was serviced really well. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was so very good! So much choice. We sat outside, quieter. Chef lovely.
Room with a pool view over children's pool. Little bit noisy. Lots of children. No noise at night. Just kids playing. Plenty of pool toys for both adults and children. Lunch around the pool very easy with a buzzer provided for use, plenty of staff.
We were driven to the beach, although, only 5 min walk. Also taken to restaurant street. Taxi's were not on the metre all the time, wanted twice the fee. One had a flag fall of about 20,000....but we didn't realise until almost where we were going.
Lots of beach restaurants. Easy walk to Kuta along beach road, about half hour."
3271,Great resort in great location,40,June 2015,"We stayed there for 7 nights recently. Had
2 rooms as a family of 5 with older children. Very high standard throughout. Service excellent in all areas. Buffet breakfast very good but very busy being school holidays. Pool side bar has a good atmosphere around happy hour but can get too noisy. Rooms very clean, modern and with all amenities. Courtesy buggy to beach etc a great idea ."
3272,Simply perfect,50,June 2015,"We recently stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott for 9 nights with our 2 children. The grounds & services at the hotel are outstanding. The rooms, whilst a little small for a family of four are all well appointed with HUGE bathrooms and a generous balcony. The staff are exceptional. Nothing is to much trouble and everything is handled quickly & efficiently. The buffet breakfast is Amazing!!! There is nothing more you could want for. The location however would have to be one of the best things about the resort. Walking distance to the brilliant beaches - five minute walk or a complimentary 2 minute buggy ride and you're sitting in a bean bag sipping a drink whilst the kids body surf. Turn the other direction and there is bars / night clubs and shops as far as the eye can see. Or again, jump in the buggy and catch a quick ride to eat street to wander and enjoy the delights of some of Bali's most well known restaurants. The Pool pretty much has an area for everyone and the pool side service is exceptional. The Spa for a massage or facial was pure luxury & indulgence. As first timers to Bali, we would highly recommend The Courtyard by Marriott & would not hesitate to return."
3273,Poor service at checkout but not a bad stay,30,June 2015,"We stayed here at the beginning of the month (June) for a week. Upon arrival we paid the deposit fee on our credit card as you can buy a certain amount of $value for a cheaper rate to spend at the hotel throughout your stay. We had quite a bit of cash, so I asked the receptionist upon checking out, can we pay in full with cash instead of our credit card? The answer was yes. We had a pretty good stay. Breakfast was great, the pool area a bit of a nightmare but all in all for the price a very good deal. It's close to everything and the staff were lovely. The spa was amazing. We wanted a relaxing trip away and to spend most of our time at the hotel. The restaurant in the morning was great but in the evening not so great. The seafood buffet on a Thursday was terrible. At the end of our stay my partner got very ill with Bali belly unfortunately. This was not the restaurants fault, we think he just picked it up in general. We weren't flying home till late in the evening, so the reception organised for us to move to a different room until we had to leave at around 6.30pm, we thought this was such great service so thank you so much for this. When we went to check out we told the man at reception we would like to pay our full bill in cash. We did so and he assured us our payment would be refunded back to the card within 3 working days. It's now been 2 weeks, various emails and still no refund. This as you can imagine is such an inconvenience and to be honest at the time we just had a feeling this would happen. He didn't seem too confident about it and we felt uneasy but just wanted to get home. We really want this issue sorted as you really don't expect to come back from a relaxing holiday with this stress lurking over you, and the constant back and fourth of emails when it should have just been sorted out at the time. We are Marriott silver members who always stay at the Marriott hotels and not once has this ever happened. I expected more from a reputable company and this alone would tarnish us ever wanting to stay here again."
3274,Very average hotel for the price,10,June 2015,"The Courtyard by Marriott had come highly recommend to us by our travel agent and we were excited about our stay there.

The hotel was packed with families and young party groups and was noisy from morning until night.

Only half of the pool ever saw the sun which meant that people would get up first thing in the morning and take over the 20 sun loungers that would get any sun during the day. The sun loungers were on the same wooden decking as the walkway so everything a person walked / ran up the walkway to the bar or reception your sunbed shook.

For the price we paid I had expected a much better experience. I suspect from talking to other people there were much better hotels out there for a lot less money and I know a lot of people are going with the Marriott because it is new which was one of the reasons we had gone with it."
3275,Friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet,50,June 2015,"I have stayed here before and it's always a nice retreat. You really don't have to leave the hotel. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice and clean and comfortable with many amenities like iron and ironing board, hair dryer, scale, small fridge, ac, wifi, all kinds of shampoos and soaps and amenity kits. Love the late afternoon happy hour with two for one drinks and live entertainment. Perfect way to ease into a nice dinner. The breakfast buffet is outstanding with coffee provided, including lattes and other espresso drinks. The food selection is enormous. I love the home made bagels with all the fixings and their juice selections. I usually splurge one day and do a fresh waffle with ice cream. Hey have western style and Indonesian and Asian style dishes to choose from as well as an omelet station. All kinds of bread and danish. And again the staffers very attentive and friendly"
3276,Highly Recommended,50,June 2015,"Stayed here for 7 nights and no complaints whatsoever. We have been to Bali eight times now and I can honestly say that the staff here is the best we have encountered. Special mention of ""Widi"" (Sport & Recreation) who gave me some great games at Table Tennis."
3277,Family Hotel,20,May 2015,"We loved the Marriott during our first stay las December.

However our recent stay was totally different. Although not the staffs fault the children were unruly touching food at breakfast then putting it back, running around the restaurant whilst people were carrying hot dishes. We stopped eating breakfast, unless it was freshly cooked as we never knew if it had been handled by children. If parents can't control them then rules should be in place tif the are under ten they must be accompanied by a patent in the restaurant at all times.

Same as others we spent most of our time in the room as you couldn't get loungers I noted one time even though there were only ten people in the pool twenty five loungers had towels on them.
Room often not cleaned until late afternoon, I don't mind this on the odd occasion because everyone has to take their turn but it seemed it was every day for us."
3278,"Very nice, comfortable hotel",50,June 2015,"I stayed at the Courtyard for just two nights, a couple more days would have been great. Seminyak has many restaurants close to the hotel. It is also reasonably close to the airport (10 km). It is not on the beach, but very close to it. The hotel has a beautiful pool and bar with seats in the pool. The breakfast buffet was extensive. I was upgraded to a suite, since I am a Marriott Gold Rewards member, and the suite was spacious. I was touring the countryside rather than enjoying the beaches, so I spent quite of time in and around Ubud, and that is not so close as travel time goes. It is a beautiful hotel with gracious staff."
3279,Lovely hotel,50,March 2015,"Such a relaxing hotel, great room, very friendly staff, pool is great but get there early to reserve a lounge chair. Room service was great and massages at the spa were fantastic, close to the beach and lots of dining options nearby. Great live music in the bar also."
3280,Romantic,10,June 2015,If you want a swimming pool with Sun don't stay at this hotel. We are about to leave and cut our trip short One side of pool no sun other side plenty of sun lots of towels hogging lounges but no people. Was like this all day. Staff need to control use of banana lounges and remove any when people are not around. Watching from my window two guys having a fight over banana lounges makes me realise we are not the only ones with the problem. What a shame lovely hotel otherwise
3281,Amazing,50,December 2014,"Great Hotel, Great location and amazing and friendly staff. We stayed here in December for our Honeymoon and just loved the hotel . Breakfast was amazing and the people in the resort were simply superb. Their are plenty of cafe and restaurants around this hotel. Its always good to have smiling & friendly faces around you. Just loved our stay in this hotel."
3282,Best mid range family hotel in Seminyak,50,June 2015,"This hotel is perfect for families. 2 min taxi ride will take you to all the great restaurants seminyak has to offer.
Could not fault the hotel in any way. We had the 2 bedroom suite and it was perfect for two adults and two kids.
This was our second stay and we look forward to returning in Jan."
3283,a great property,50,June 2015,"as a Platnium member, I was really impressed by this hotel. It may only be a Courtyard, but the rooms, pools and restaurant stack up against any Marriott (or other hotel). I worried about the location, but the beach is very close and a very safe walk. The breakfast is excellent. Even dinner was surprisingly good and inexpensive considering that this was a hotel restuarant"
3284,outstanding,50,June 2015,"great property and even better service. everything is new with the rooms, pool and facilities top notch. the general manager went out of his way to be helpful and accommodating. Other staff members were very friendly and efficient at check in/out. only issue for this property is you may not leave as it is easy to sit by the pool all day"
3285,Super friendly hotel!,50,June 2015,"Currently staying here as a family of 4 and have loved every minute of it. Like many others we are here on a luxury escapes voucher and it is exceptional value. The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly and in particular have treated our 2 girls (aged 4 and 8) like princesses. Breakfast is definitely a highlight with a great selection and awesome egg station, special mention to Agus and Bayu for always delivering perfect soft boiled eggs and omelettes. Also to Billy who does a great job of managing everything and ensuring that guests are happy.

We have loved the pool area, although I have to admit the water temperature is a little cooler than what I expected, hubby and the kids don't mind at all though and I have been more than happy lounging about. Pool service is awesome with delicious cocktails and great afternoon entertainment. Kids club also do a brilliant job and my girls have had a great time there. It's conveniently located near the pool making it nice and easy to check kids in and out as they want. Lastly the massages at the Day spa were AHHmazing.

I would of loved for the resort to be on the beach and perhaps walking distance to the Eat Street area but I guess you can't have it all. In saying that it is only a short walk or buggy ride to the beach. The buggy will also drop you off just near Eat Street or you can grab a taxi which only costs a couple of dollars. There is a supermarket just across the road and lots of great little shops and stalls within walking distance so really the location is pretty good.

All in all we've had a great stay here and while we are looking forward to heading up to Ubud for the last part of our Bali holiday we will definitely be sad to leave."
3286,Awesome,50,May 2015,"Outstanding service, great atmosphere, great location, very clean, very friendly staff. Gorgeous hotel. Food was excellent. Something for everyone, even fussy eaters Worth every cent. Will be coming back for sure."
3287,Delightful experience - could not ask for more,50,June 2015,"Booked a week away via a Luxury Escapes promotion, seemed such a good deal that I feared it was a scam. After several emails and phone calls to satisfy my doubts, I was able to confirm booking, airport pick up and all other queries. Being presented with a number of bonus vouchers and upgrades just made the experience all the better. Great staff, great facilities, wonderful hotel. Highly recommended."
3288,"Bread were fantastic, Lovely to stay",40,May 2015,"The location of courtyard hotel from the beach approximately only 5 minutes by walking. The bedroom, swim-pool and bathroom were ok for the 5 stars hotel. The fitness center is ok, but some of equipments are not complete for the 5 stars criteria.
Besides, the staffs were super attentive and friendly. Would we be back again? Of course."
3289,Lovely place to stay,50,June 2015,"Staying here at the moment with my 2 girl friends. Nice clean hotel and very friendly staff. Our room is perfect for 3 girls sharing with 2 big beds, plenty of room and a great bathroom.
The pool area is good (although you have to get down there early to get a good spot as everyone puts there towels out first thing in the morning!). Nice pool bar and happy hour between 4-8 with 2-4-1 cocktails!
Great location, great food, great service I would stay here again."
3290,"Great Hotel, Great Staff",50,June 2015,"Just back from a fantastic week at this beautiful Hotel. We had a Deluxe Pool Terrace room which was immaculately cleaned each day. All staff were so happy and only too pleased to help with our endless questions. Pool was beautiful and the boys at the Pool Bar very funny, made great cocktails. Special mention to Desi, a gorgeous girl who always made time to chat each day about what we were up to. Breakfast was delicious each day, waffles were a favourite with so much choice. The day spa is another favourite, staff lovely and the massages and facials were divine. Ideal holiday spot for everyone with close proximity to beach. Appreciated the security, always felt safe. Hope to return next year with the family."
3291,What a gem of a hotel in Bali!,50,June 2015,"From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed. Registration, friendly, precise and courteous. A cold beer was appreciated at check in. Beautiful rooms, spacious, large bathroom and large tv. Pool area is of a good size, but mid afternoon the sun is obscured by the building. Anyway, you cool down a bit. From Brad, the GM, to the young head chef and all of the staff made this a rewarding property to stay at. Their interaction helped to manage this hotel. The restraunt was streamlined at breakfast time, the poolside snacks were good. Even the head chef walked around with samples of little delicacies to try. Stay here if you want luxury from a very new hotel.
To Brad Edman and your wonderful team, thanks and well done!"
3292,Great Hotel so far,50,June 2015,"Here now at the Courtyard staying in a deluxe pool view room on 5th floor. Arrived yesterday and hubby was greeted by a cold beer and Me an ice tea and icy pole. Excellent start!! Given the key to our room went up and then our bags arrive. Nice not having to lug them with you.
Breakfast this morning was as good as everyone says. All the staff really friendly and more than happy to help with any questions.
Glad we chose here to stay"
3293,The Best,50,January 2015,"Had a wonderful time at courtyard marriott. The breakfast spread was the best, everything was fresh and they had a huge variety. The pool area was so much fun very relaxing and the food served by the pool was so yummy.
I recommend the garden view room or pool view room overlooking the resort. A huge plus for their high security extremely impressed compared to other resorts. Felt very safe!
Short distance from the beach. They have a free buggy that takes you down to the beach just tip the driver.
You can't go wrong loved this place!!"
3294,Amazing hotel that ticks all the boxes,50,December 2014,"We stayed in December 2014. The hotel was new only being open for a few months. The food was outstanding, the best buffet we have ever seen for breakfast. We also had lunch and dinner here a few times, never missing a beat. Our first room was a good room but balcony over looked the entrance to the restaurant, we asked to be moved and they had no issue in doing so. The pool was great and drinks at the bar even better. Location was good really close to beach and short walk or cab ride to some great restaurants in Seminyak. Also in walking distance or some great beach bars like woo bar and potato head. We would defiantly stay again with out a doubt."
3295,"New property, close to beach",40,April 2015,We stayed here for 4 nights and the reason we picked this one is because it is new and close to beach (5-8 mins walk). Breakfast buffet was really good. But room was a little bit small. other facilities was good. This is modern interior so if you want to stay balinese style this is not a good place but if you want convenient location with clean facilities with not too expensive place this is it!
3296,"Awesome Hotel, Great Location, Outstanding Management & Staff",50,May 2015,"On arrival we were greeted by excellent reception staff, with a welcome drink, refreshing towel and a nice icy pole. On check-in everything we needed to know about the hotel was explain and we were then shown to our room.

I'd like to mention Ari at reception he was very helpful with booking some tours for us. As it was our first time in Bali he also recommended if we were catching a Taksi to catch the Bluebird ones as they use a meter for your trip. Ari was excellent.

The hotel was only a short walk or a buggy ride to Seminyak Beach. The hotel was convenient to many great restaurants, massage places and a supermarket opposite.
The buggy was also available to take you to Eat Street in Seminyak where there are some grea restaurants. The buggy can also take you up to the intersection of Seminyak Road.

Excellent pool with sun beds and umbrellas all around as well as the bean bags and floating beds that were excellent to float on. There was also a grassed area to lay in the sun on double sun beds, this was being renovated with new grass whilst we were there, but we were still able to use it. The pool bar was a great, staff so friendly and excellent on the cocktails and beer. Entertainment daily with some excellent singers and musicians. Happy hour daily is excellent with some days happy hour going longer...love it!!

Buffet brekkie is excellent with a great selection of food from cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit, Asian food, eggs any style and omelettes, western food, also breads for toasting and Danishes not to forget the pancakes, waffles and ice cream and fresh juices many to choose from. As you were seated you were offered coffee or tea.

The Head Chef takes the time to meet and greet and make sure everything is alright, not only in The Kitchen, but also down at the pool bar he's always making sure everything is running smoothly. Likewise is great to see Brad the General Manager up at The Kitchen in the morning turning food and down at the bar during the day helping the chef making sure the plates are presentable as well as socialising with the guests making sure we're happy. It was great seeing you around Brad as a lot of hotel you would never see the GM.

Brad your staff are an awesome bunch they're more than happy to look after everyone and make everyone's stay enjoyable.

Rooms are modern and well maintained, the shower is awesome.

The gym was great too.

I mustn't for get the girls in the day spa the massages were just the best!!!!!!

It was great having free WiFi to keep in touch with the kids back home üòÉ"
3297,Best Bali hotel!,50,June 2015,"The staff were super friendly and helpful for out first trip to Bali! They helped answer all our questions! The pool staff were great too, best hospitality! It made happy hour that more fun and enjoyable by the pool. Gym and pool facilities were great and clean. Breakfast was out of this world! Soo much to try!"
3298,Like staying with family,50,June 2015,"I have just returned from a week with the Courtyard Marriott Hotel. It was a total pleasure. We were made to feel so welcome by Brad and his team that it was like we were hanging out with old friends. The kids even referred to the GM Brad as ""uncle brad"". Billy and his team do a standout breakfast and we feasted like royalty. The poolside cocktails were delicious. Our room - King bed with extra single - was plenty big enough for our family of 4. We travelled with two kids aged 4 & 8 and both were very happy. We were actually in a group of 21 and we all had a ball.

I've read some of the reviews about the sun only hitting half the pool - really?? Talk about first world problems. I have a little suggestion....sit on the sunny side of the pool if you want a tan...wow problem solved. The girls in the kids club were super friendly and so kind to the kids. My girls loved being with them. We also had 4 massages in the spa and I can highly recommend you give it a go.

To Brad and all the amazing team behind the scenes...thank you for making this such a memorable and happy time for us as a family. The girls will never forget the behind the scenes tour. We can't wait to come back!!!"
3299,Courtyard Family Holiday,50,June 2015,"Very happy with facilities, room, food, spa services.
Staff are super helpful and kind, nothing is a problem for them. They helped us organise a few activities. Very close to beach (La Plancha) and shopping is good. Would come back for sure..."
3300,"Awesome staff,great location,good food and management that gets it!",50,June 2015,"Writing on sadly our last night here at the Marriot,off to a private Villa tomorrow,
booked this on a 10 day Luxury Escapes deal and wow did it deliver.
Location:3 mins walk to a great lively section of Seminyak Beach,tons of good restaurants,massage places, Supermarket opposite.first time in many visits that I haven't bothered hiring a scooter,it was just so easy.
pool: Great pool although we went to the beach nearly every day, swim up bar was a good size,staff so friendly and excellent on the cocktails.Small complaint kids should be kept down the lower section pool to give adults a bit of space,there is plenty down there to keep them happy.
Evening singers and happy hour: can't go wrong..tick
Buffet brekkie: Agus at the egg station is awesome,Edi deserves a raise he had our double shot flat whites ready when he would see us walk in.Chef takes the time to meet and greet,as a foodie I think that's important but to see the GM. brad assisting ,making sure the food isn't drying out is and that guests are happy is just awesome.As a business owner I know the importance of customer relations and Brad was always to be seen around the entire hotel checking quietly or having a friendly chat.
His staff respect him and he is obviously the driver in making this pace work and work well it does.

Rooms are not large but for a couple adequate,modern and well maintained.

I've spent far more at Sheridans,W and others and Were far less satisfied.

Excellent value and recommended,if you are are couple request a room above the reception end away from the main pool as some kids are quite vocal from an early hour until around 8:00 at night,this is the only flaw I can put forward. kids are kids though no offence to others as we have had our own kids and fully understand."
3301,Convenient location,40,June 2015,If you want a hotel centrally located with great facilities this is a good choice. Within 30 minutes from great restaurants in the Kerobokan area and Petitenget beach clubs. Breakfast buffet is great not to mention the spa and gym. Friendly staff who smiles all the time!
3302,"Disappointing - small rooms, ordinary pool with no shade",30,November 2014,"We had 4 nights at the Kuta Paradisio Hotel and then treated ourselves to 4 nights here, how disappointing, we much preferred the much cheaper Kuta Paradisio.

The rooms & bathroom at the Marriott are new but so incredibly tiny, the pool is just a big oblong with no shade. The sun lounges are on top of one another. In comparison the rooms & bathrooms at Paradiso were massive and the pool varied & interesting with sun and shade. The garden around the pool has many nooks and shady areas for you to lie on the sun lounges.

A waste of money, just trading on the Mariott name."
3303,"Relaxing holiday, great place to stay in Seminyak",50,April 2015,"My friend and I stayed here on a short relaxing break in Bali.
This was definitely great value for money. I have stayed in more luxurious resorts, but the rooms were large and comfortable; the staff friendly, polite and accommodating; the restaurant food was well done and very reasonably priced for a resort; and the pool area down to the beach was beautiful. Best of all it was quiet - no loud music from the restaurant / bar or rowdy guests.

Very comfortable bed, great relaxing holiday.

We will be back soon."
3304,Great hotel with superb rooms great staff.,50,October 2014,"Their breakfast had absolutely everything you could wish for, and the staff were absolutely wonderful. We had the deluxe pool room which was superb as we love to swim a lot. Nighttime was a little dull but it seems everyone goes out on the town for tea. Loved that everything was kept so clean and the manager said we could drink the water it was so well filtered even though we didnt. Fully recommend unless you want a private pool"
3305,A Gem of a hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,June 2015,"All I can say is this hotel has an amazing feel and vibe and is in the heart of Seminyak though you wouldn't know it.

The rooms are amazing, I stayed in a one bed suite with pool view. Great to sit on the balcony to relax. Air con worked very well and the room was well maintained and had a fantastic rain shower.

Brad the GM was everywhere working with his team and interacting with the guests. He had great rapport with the kids in the resort but could also have a great conversation with us grown ups. I was very impressed by Brad and he was a real host of the property

I LOVED the pool bar and the team there. I have not seen a team work so hard and so well. In a long time. Great food offering, chicken satay was amazing and also great drinks and cocktails.

A lovely duo plays guitar and sings in the evenings which a great way to relax and unwind while enjoying the tunes and some beer or cocktail.

The hotel has a great vibe around it and is in a great location. Turn right and you are at the beach and turn left and you are in the heart of Seminyak.

Great hotel and I will certainly go back."
3306,Too many people!,30,May 2015,"Too crowded and busy at Breakfast, It was like having breakfast at a shopping mall, cues out the front,
Fantastic Yoga, great instructor but disappointed I had to pay extra, was minimal but with the price of the rooms, should be included...given there was only myself and the instructor!
Would suit familys or people who like being surrounded by Aussies and other families"
3307,Didn't quite meet expectations,40,May 2015,"We stayed for 3 nights after spending 2 nights at The Stones in legian. Maybe our stay at The Stones left me bias, but because they carry the same star rating and are both from the same hotel chain I felt this hotel could have done more. Firstly, when you pay $15 - $16 aud for a cocktail at a 5 star hotel, I'd expect proper alcohol (not Bali moon) to be used, and only fresh fruit, not jam in the strawberry daiquiris. If you plan on relaxing around the pool, you need to be down there early to grab a chair or you miss out for the day! Breakfast was good, and the staff were lovely. The hotel is clean and close to many popular places in seminyak. If I had bought my son along with me this hotel would have been perfect, it is very kid friendly. I just feel for the price tag, the quality isn't quite there, none the less it was a pleasant stay."
3308,Outstanding Management + Happy Staff = Very Happy Guests,50,June 2015,"What is most obvious at this hotel is the outstanding management & the ambience that General Manager Brad has created. It is evident in his relationship with his staff & his amazing interpersonal relationship with his guests. He was everywhere. Making sure that everyone was happy & enjoying their stay. We stayed on a luxury escape package which included massages, breakfasts, dinner, lunch, cocktails & transfers. The Day Spa was simply the best I have ever been to. Beautiful, classy decor & warm, professional services. Breakfasts were great & the kitchen is run by another charismatic personality Billy Costoglou, the Executive Chef. Nothing was too much trouble & he was on hand every morning mingling with the guests & overseeing the smooth running of the busy kitchen. The rooms are very comfortable & little touches like a decent hairdryer & phone, iPad chargers each room. Wifi is free to rooms. The design of the resort lends itself to being a bit on the noisy side but mostly it is just happy holiday noise from guests enjoying themselves. However, the walls are a little on the thin side & we were kept awake into the early hours a few nights by partying guests in room next door. I was not in love with the clear glass door on the toilet & feel that should be at least frosted. We were very impressed by the action taken when my grandson slipped by the pool injuring his leg. The pool attendant Widy called the in house doctor who provided first aid free of charge. Widy's caring continued each day as he enquired as to grandson's condition. The kids club was another great feature & children were well cared for by Santi. Security is quite tight with everyone entering hotel required to go through screening. Reception Manager Daniel kindly offered to ""look after"" my granddaughter's turtle egg as we were checking out. It is these nice touches that puts this hotel well above the rest & ensured we had a lovely relaxing, safe holiday."
3309,Happy Holiday,40,June 2015,"The rooms are great and very clean. I love the two option shower heads and big shower. Breakfast has a great variety of delicious options with staff fully informed of all the ingredients for dietary and religious requirements. The Exicutive Chef Billy is very friendly and happy to answer questions or make suggestions on local establishments and entertainment. Breakfast starts early for the day trippers not to miss out and goes until 11am for the party goers.

If I had known this hotel would be over run by kids I would have thought twice about booking. A suggestion, out of the three pools would be, to make the pool bar pool no kids under 16 for a more relaxing time for the people without children. But if you have children you will love this hotel that also has a kids club with lots of activities from 8-8.

The staff are wonderful, very friendly and love to have a chat. Happy hours yes more than one hour 4pm - 8pm with live music are a good way to get the night started before heading out."
3310,Nice play to stay,40,May 2015,"We stayed at this hotel in on a package deal with many specials included, so it was particularly good value. We enjoyed the hotel, but for us as a couple who were travelling without children, the pool area was very much like the local pool on weekends with kids screaming and running around. I'm not meaning to sound like an old codger as we have been there and done that with our own kids, I'm just saying that if you are looking for a quiet pool area, probably don't come to this hotel. Having said that there is an upper level to the pool where there is a lovely swim up bar, but you can't really sit poolside here unless you are in the water. The hotel rooms are spacious and the bathroom is really spacious. Service was excellent as well. The staff were always attentive to our needs. The breakfast was a busy affair, but well managed and the complimentary cappuccinos etc. were the best I tasted in Bali! I would recommend this hotel but just keep in mind that it is the Courtyard by Marriott and the pool is in a courtyard, so the noise can be a little echoey! The room was very quiet at night though."
3311,Paradise found,50,March 2015,"After spending a few nights in Legian, severely sleep deprived thanks to a karaoke bar full of drunk Aussie bogans, we arrived at Courtyard Marriott. Well..... What an experience! This was our first time in Bali, and I'm so glad we stayed here for 7 nights. There was a free shuttle (looked like a golf cart) to the beach. Buffet breakfast was included, which was awesome. After a few days though, we ended up not eating much for breakfast. Will definitely stay here again. Staff were friendly, and the GM (Brad I think?) was a really nice guy. Couldn't have asked for more. Thanks!"
3312,Great service and food.,40,June 2015,"Good hotel. Rooms are a decent size, with amazing bathrooms. Service provided by all staff is great, from reception to pool bar and security.
Breakfast at Seminyak kitchen is great with a lot of variety even for those with dietary requirements ie vegetarian dishes.
Happy hour at pool bar is great with the live band and great service by all, but special mention to Hendra, who took great care of us each day we sat by the pool.
The staff at the front desk are really helpful and assisted us alot with finding a lost phone at the middle of the night with no hesitation at all.
Only negatives I would say is, the paper thin walls which allows moving furniture and noise from all levels to seap through at all hrs.
In addition, the structure of the hotel is complicated with the sun blocked by the high rise building. Lastly, but only minor is the long wait for coffees at breakfast!
Overall, the service by the staff makes the stay very memorable."
3313,Service with a smile,50,June 2015,"We are part way through an 8 night stay at the hotel and are very pleased with our choice for our first trip to Bali. The hotel itself is in excellent condition as it is so new, and the rooms and grounds are being maintained to a very high standard. The rooms themselves are compact but they are well designed and the bathroom is fantastic. Wish I could take the shower cubicle home! Everything is very well thought out including power points with built in adapters, concentrator nozzle for the hairdryer and even bathroom scales - maybe not such a good idea while on holiday! üòâWe were allocated a high floor room as requested and housekeeping are looking after us really well. In fact every staff member we have had contact with has been excellent. We checked in late on Monday night and both my husband & I commented it was the friendliest, most informative checkin we have ever had! That standard has been maintained by all the staff who never stop smiling. Breakfast staff are so attentive under the supervision of Billy who is doing a great job in Seminyak Kitchen. We haven't spoken to the GM but have noticed him around frequently in lots of different areas, he seems to have a soft spot for the children! Today we had pool bar service from a charming young man called Hendra, nothing was too much trouble for him. I wish we could name everyone that has assisted us so far because they do all deserve a mention. We had an amazing massage in the spa that was incredible. So professional and the decor and ambience was first class. We are still finding our way around the area but the hotel is well located, very easy to get down to the beach via a short walk or the buggy if you need it. There is a lot more I could add but I'm on holiday so it's time to think about dinner!
Thanks Courtyard by Marriott, we are enjoying the experience."
3314,Not a hotel for us,30,June 2015,"We are on the last day of our week long holiday in Bali. We have strayed for our usual traditional Balinese hotel with tranquil gardens to experience a new and more modern option at Courtyard by Marriott. On the positive side it is lovely modern hotel in a great location with exceptional staff. On the negative side we have found the hotel is producing a lot of noise from the pool and bar areas due to the construction shape and layout. The most annoying aspect we have found (also mentioned in previous reviews) is the noise from the housekeeping trolleys which start rumbling up the tiled corridors early in the morning. We feel that the management should promptly address this problem for the comfort of future guests.

Unfortunately, we will not be returning and will be happy to return to our former retreat."
3315,Pretty good stay,40,May 2015,"Needed to come to Bali to do some wedding preparations, wanted to stay in Seminyak & this hotel looked nice, plus had a swim up bar!
Negatives: the bottom pools are surrounded by the sky high rooms, so all day sun is limited. Pool service slow, but most Bali hotels I stay at are. Myself & my mate both had separate issues with our room key, but fixed quickly. Passing through security a bit of a pain, but understand its for safety.
Positives: fantastic wifi, IT buddy happy as he had to do some work, very friendly staff, with great English. Breakfast nice, typical buffet, no Vegemite out with the other condiments though! Room clean, shower amazing.
Would stay here again if there was a cheap rate going."
3316,Nice hotel,40,May 2015,"Enjoyed my stay at the Marriott. Great location, 5 mins to beach walking or they can take you in the golf buggy. Staff are very friendly. The only thing I did not like is that the pool has no sun from 3pm because of the hotel built up around the pool, but it is a lovely pool. Good gym facilities. Good spa treatments. Breakfast is good, the coffee could be improved in my opinion. The rooms/beds are very comfortable, lovely bathroom/shower."
3317,Great hotel.,50,May 2015,"This hotel is first class. Brand new, lovely rooms and the nicest staff you would ever meet. Loved the breakfast and it catered for all nationalities, which is not easy to do. Families, couples and singles are all catered for. The beach is only a five minute walk away. The Aussie manager is hands on and the Aussie chef, loves chatting about Aussie Rules. If you can get a deal, go for it."
3318,Nice Family Stay,40,May 2015,"We stayed here as a family mid May taking advantage of a luxury escape deal, we had 2 connecting pool view rooms.... We were advised that the room would be suitable for 4 adults and one child, not really - the beds were only doubles which made it quite snug. When enquiring about a rollaway bed we were advised that it would not fit in the room ( voucher suggested otherwise) but we only used the room for sleeping so not a overall drama
Breakfast was excellent so much choice , my granddaughter made the most of our no rule holiday having ice cream and pancakes for breakfast some mornings
Pool area is great for all ages and the removal of the tall plants gave much more sun , mind you I still found the pool quite cold but great of the family used it daily
The Spa my god could have stayed there forever the girls do amasing job and I was totally relaxed after my treatment
Great location close to beach which is a nice couple of minute walk
I have booked another deal for November and very much looking forward to coming back and enjoying your hotel and facilities"
3319,"Relaxing, fun filled stay at the Marriott. Great food and staff!",50,June 2015,"We recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott with 6 of our close friends. This was our fifth stay in Bali so we were expecting good things, especially after a previous visit at the Stones Legian which was beyond fantastic.

The hotel has a lot of positives. The location is great with all the best bars and restaurants within a 10 minute taxi ride. If you are willing to pay a little more I recommend using the hotel drivers, they are polite, professional and friendly.

The pool at the hotel is the main attraction for me. The size and shape of the pool is great with enough pool lounges to go around. I am pleased to see that they are not allowing people to 'reserve' lounges as this has been a major gripe of mine at other hotels in Bali. The pool with the pool bar is great for adults without kids as there are less children in it.

All meals eaten at the hotel were fantastic, whether it be breakfast, in room dining, pool side or in the restaurant. My favourite was the Mighty MO burger‚Ä¶ going to be thinking about that one for a while!!!

We had a massage which was relaxing. It costs about 5 times the price of the spas outside the hotel, but I really think it is worth it for quality. You pay for what you get.

Unfortunately there was some aggressive and disruptive guests staying at the hotel at the same time as us. A complaint was made and this matter was dealt with promptly and professionally by the GM, Brad. Very impressed.

On the note of staff; every single person we came across at this hotel was a delight. From the housekeepers, bar staff, wait staff and room service and security... each and every person had a smile on their face which was infectious.

One tiny suggestion if I may: Often it was a struggle to get coffee at breakfast. The servers were inconsistent in offering it and sometimes I had to flag someone down and remind them a couple of times before anything came (sometimes after my meal was already finished). This is minor, yes, but on holiday it is HEAVEN for a latte to appear in front of you soon after you arrive and before you hop up to get a feed‚Ä¶ and this was difficult to do.

All in all‚Ä¶GREAT stay.. thanks for having us Brad, Daniel and team :)"
3320,"Great stay, amazing staff",50,May 2015,"Recently stayed here for 6 nights with the Luxury Escape deal. Check-in was easy and the staff at the hotel were amazing, they were polite, helpful and friendly, couldn't do enough for you. I loved the spa and the therapists were so professional and friendly and it was very relaxing and clean. The staff in the Cafe were the best, always remembered your name, coffee preference, egg preference etc. I didn't find the security check an inconvenience it only takes a minute to go through the screening. I would stay here again."
3321,Great hotel for families,40,May 2015,"My wife and I stayed at the Courtyard by Mattiott in Seminyak in May 2015 for a week and overall it was very good with a lot of positives and a few negatives. The positives are the friendly staff and the fabulous service, the best nasi goreng I have ever had, a great pool bar, rooms spotlessly clean, new premises location 5 minutes walk to the beach, free wifi in the room, nice restaurants close by and the wonderful spa. The negatives are few, but still significant for us. This is a family hotel which is overrun by children of all ages. Our room on level 5 overlooked the childrens pool and the screaming was unbelievable! They were obviously having a great time and the facilities are very good for children, including a Kid's Club. While the rooms are an adequate size and modern, there are no drawers to put your clothes in - just a few open shelves in the bed side tables and in the wardrobe, which means you have to live out of your suitcase. As most of the rooms look into the courtyard, the rooms are accessed by an outside passage which is tiled. The cleaning staff use trolleys to move their supplies and equipment and the noise of the wheels on the tiles sounds like a train outside your door! Not a problem during the day, but a bit rich at 6.30am. After I mentioned this to the staff, they did slow down the trolleys so the noise was reduced. Overall it was a pleasant stay, but not a hotel which suits us. But great for families."
3322,Location could be better,40,June 2015,"The hotel was beautiful. We stayed in 3 ground level rooms, but initially I thought they had direct pool access. Not totally true. Regardless, the stay was comfortable. We spent quite a bit of time just resting in the hotel as it was raining on and off when we visited. There is a nice massage centre right beside it by the way."
3323,Another wonderful escape,40,May 2015,"This is our second stay at this hotel, overall we are extremely pleased with our time here. We deliberately booked a pool view room as the deluxe rooms all face a noisy street. We were on the sixth floor and the main issue with our room was the very noisy housekeeping trolleys that started around 6 in the morning! Breakfast was exceptional again, pool food was good but the service on a couple of occasions was appalling, I ended up going to the bar to ask for service and was abruptly told to ring the service bell, I had done so 3 times!!!
Reception staff were excellent and very polite.
Overall a lovely stay in a hotel with great location walk to beach, shops and restaurants."
3324,Excellent holiday hotel,50,April 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and all I can say it was not enough. Well located in Seminyak, walking distance to shopping area and close to the beach (the hotel provides shuttle to beach). What really pleases me was the superb ever-smiling staff, who is attentive to your every needs. When we checked in, we were provided with a cool towel and a fruity ice cream! tat was a delight for our drying throat in the hot weather. We stayed at the Deluxe room, large enough for 2, with large comfy bed. Please note this is a non-smoking property so the rooms smell clean n fresh. we enjoyed the huge swimming pool, with water sofa. Hotel also have various activities for both adults n children to enjoy during the stay. The breakfast was a huge selection of local and western dish, all made fresh. The hotel have a strict security check for every guest walking into the hotel, which some finds it troublesome. All in all i would say this is a very cosy modern hotel, suitable for couples, friends and family."
3325,Think Carefully Before Booking a Deluxe Room,10,May 2015,"I have just checked into this hotel. I booked a deluxe room and received one at the corner end of the building facing what looks like a building site and also the main road from which you can hear motorbikes non stop! I just went down to the reception to ask for a room change and guess what I am told? That if I do not want to face the main road, then with the category of room that I have booked, my only other option is to have one facing a wall... So, before booking a deluxe room, please decide whether you prefer loud vehicle noises or whether you prefer feeling claustrophobic as this will be the choice that you will be given upon check-in."
3326,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff",50,May 2015,"We stayed here for 10 nights on the Luxury Escape deal, and it was fantastic value for money. Breakfast choices were fantastic, from fresh fruit to eggs anyway, Asian dishes, Bagels, ice-cream, waffles, croissants and pastries. I tried something different every morning, but the last two days I felt slightly unwell, so reverted to plainer foods such as fruit, scrambled eggs, toast and vegemite. Imagine my dismay when told they had run out of vegemite! Never fear, Anton (Assistant Manager) came to the rescue. He double checked the kitchen, then ran across the road to the mini mart to buy some - alass the market had none either! Never giving up in his efforts to please me, Anton had a chat with the head chef Billy, who raided his private jar of vegemite to give me some in a dish. These guys deserve a medal.

On our first day at the hotel we were greeted at the swim up bar by Anton, who remembered our names from then on. We used our free Dinner voucher on the first night in Seminyak Kitchen, but I felt unwell halfway through my entree and could not eat the other 2 courses. This was nothing to do with the food , just my lack of sleep after waking at 4am to catch the flight to Bali. Anton was very understanding, offered to bring our opened bottle of wine to our room and the next day gave us another voucher for a free dinner. We had the dinner on the last night before flying home, it was deliscous and I ate it all this time. Try the creme brulee - lovely!

We spent a lot of time in the pool on floating beanbags and on the sun-loungers. We always managed to get a lounger in the sun, as people were often coming or going from the pool. During our stay the management removed the taller plants around the pool, which meant that more of the loungers were in the sun now. Snacks & lunch at the pool were yummy, especially the Pork sliders.

Putu (Tony) at the front desk was very helpful at all times, explaining the bill to me when I checked near the end of our stay. Food and drink prices were very reasonable for a 5 star hotel. All the staff from cleaners to Management were friendly, approachable and went out of there way to help us. The ""Marriott chariot"" (golf buggy) as my hubby called it was available to drive us to the beach or nearby restaurants. Security staff were charming as well. We only met the Manager Brad on the last day, as he hadn't been well, so kept his germs to himself. We had a nice chat with him, and found him to be very friendly. He is very obviously a people person, and makes it a priority to support his staff, run training sessions and reward them for their good work.

My apologies to the Water aerobics instructor (held at 11am everyday) who asked me to join in. I kept saying ""tomorrow"" - which never came. Oh well, maybe next time!! Thankyou also to the room service staff who delivered bowls and bowls of ice for us everyday, to chill our wine.

Overall, fantastic staff, lovely room, great pool, great location, best breaky spread ever (including the vegemite)!

We'll see you again.
Thanks, Lyn and Grant Scott"
3327,"Comfort, location and SERVICE",40,April 2015,"booked a seven night holiday in a pool view room and was extremely satisfied the choice. The Hotel is well suited to couples and families and is well located for walking everywhere. Close to beach, shopping strips and restaurants and the golf cart courtesy drop off was just a small pleasant touch which puts you in close proximity to everywhere you need to go. The staff were fantastic and very attentive to the needs of guests"
3328,Nice hotel but service needs improvement....,30,May 2015,"My wife and I stayed here as part of a Luxury Escapes package that include free spa treatments, a free lunch and dinner and a couple of free cocktails. The package was excellent value for money, but I have to say that if not for the package, I would probably not stay here.

First of all let's start with the positives. The hotel is very new so the rooms are modern, spacious and well furnished (although there is a distinct lack of storage space for your clothes). The included breakfast is excellent with a wide selection of western and Asian cuisine to satisfy all tastes. The gymnasium and Spa facilities are five star as you would expect in a hotel of this price range. The shuttle service to the beach and up to the main road were readily available and quite handy at times. That's where the positive end!

Let's start with the service.... No welcome drink on arrival (despite this being part of my package)..... My room not being made up on one day until after I complained at 5pm (not ideal when wanting to shower with fresh towels before going out for dinner).... No drinking water supplied on another day..... Had a rude experience with a waitress who was ushering us to a table and was quite short with us because she couldn't understand that we didn't want to sit outside.... Had a poolside drinks waitress refuse to take our happy hour cocktail order because her watch showed there was 4 minutes to go before happy hour started, despite our phone clocks (synched to Bali official time) showing it had (some common sense please!!!). This hotel is still new so I'm prepared to cut them some slack, but they certainly need to improve in all areas of customer service if they want to be considered a 5 star hotel.

My other gripe is the pool area.... Its partially in the shade so the water is quite cool.... There are only about 6-8 deck chairs that are positioned in the sun. You can imaging how hard these are to get, specially when inconsiderate people run down there early in the morning and place a towel and a book on them so no one else can use them.

The other major gripe is the cost of drinks.... most cocktails costing the equivalent of AUD $18..... This is Bali not New York!!!! ... I've stayed in other 5 star premises and the most I've ever payed is $10.

In summary it's a nice hotel but the service and facilities is not commensurate with the cost .... Stay somewhere else!!!!"
3329,Great place to stay in Seminyak,50,April 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriot in Seminyak and found it to be excellent value for money. The staff were superb and were very attentive to all our needs.
The hotel is very new and has a great vibe with happy patrons enjoying delicious breakfasts and rooms that are very well appointed. We went initially for an overnight stay and were so impressed we went back the next week. Their GM Brad Edman is very engaging and has a real presence making sure everyone is happy and correspondingly has the staff onside and they seem to really enjoy working there. We would definitely stay there again if in Seminyak."
3330,holiday,40,May 2015,a good family orientated resort good security presence good pleasant service people very friendly. .will recommend this place Bar pool happy hour everyday is must. Breakfast is awesome lots of variety of food.
3331,Amazing staff and fmade to feel like home,50,April 2015,"The staff there were amazing led by the General Manager Brad, who bent over backwards to make us feel at home.The staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived. The room was spacious and very clean and the breakfast buffet helped us start each day refreshed and refueled. I would definitely go back to this hotel and loved the time we had there."
3332,Felt more like a prison than a hotel,10,May 2015,"Was disappointed the minute I arrived, after staying in a peaceful bungalow in Ubud I arrived at this place and it seemed I had stepped out of Bali and into the Goldcoast. No atmosphere, no gardens, no sunlight after lunch as the height of the prison like walls block put a shadow over the pool and there aren't enough chairs. Breakfast we nicknamed ""cling clang cafeteria"" as the noise was ridicoulas with unruly kids running around and no seats left outside where it was a little quieter. We were sucked in by the voucher deal as its only for limited range of cocktails, massages were booked out at times that suited us and the free lunch voucher was useless because the fish was dry and in edible. The Getaway Travel ad I watched before booking was extremely misleading as its nothing like what it depics in the video, it feels more like a prison. If you want a sense of real Bali don't stay here. Location isn't that great either"
3333,Wonderful Stay!!!,50,May 2015,"I recently stayed here on a Luxury Escapes deal for 7 nights and I have to say the value for money was second to none, we were lucky to experience the hotel on this package. From check in (special mention to Ray) which was seamless and friendly throughout our whole stay I cannot speak highly enough of the staff, always on hand with a smile and happy to oblige any request. I could to fault the food or service in Seminyak Kitchen. We dined for breakfast every day and also had a dinner and one lunch - the food was always of very high standard. Another special mention to Agus at the egg station in the morning, always smiling and happy whilst fulfililng many different orders. Also Agus by the pool bar made great drinks and was lovely and friendly to have a chat with. I have given a 5 star rating, mainly based on experience as a whole as opposed just to the hotel. Yes, if you look there are always little faults you can find, but instead I see the positive and it is here in abundance!!! Special thanks to Shashank and his team for a wonderful break."
3334,Fantastic Family Holiday,50,April 2015,"From the moment we walked into the hotel, we were met by the friendly staff.
We were really impressed with the comfortable room. We were in a 2 bedroom suite, which was perfect for our family. It was clean and every detail had been thought of.
Our kids loved the kids club, while my husband and i shopped, and relaxed by the pool.
My favourite aspect about this hotel was the staff. The breakfast team remembered our names, and what we had the previous day. This is amazing in such a busy hotel. The General Manager and management team were seen talking to guests, cleaning breakfast tables, helping in the kitchen. This created a very personable ambience, and one we very much appreciated.
The beach is located approx 5 min away, which was perfect for the kids to learn to surf.
Overall, we loved the hotel. Will be back."
3335,You can choose your hotel but you can't choose who stays there,50,May 2015,"This is our second stay within 6 months, over that time the hotel has definitely matured, with the hotel staff offering more seamless service, the few hiccups I had last stay did not reappear so management is clearly taking note of feedback and fixing issues as they pop up.

We had originally booked 2 x pool facing rooms however the hotel kindly upgraded us to a two bedroom suite which has significantly more space. This particular room is great for family's and friends, with two separate rooms, both with their own bathrooms including free standing bath tubs and a connecting living room with third television, dining table, lounge and mini bar area. Space was generous and this room type definitely delivers on a level of luxury not seen in the lower room types.

Breakfast was fine, the only frustration was that there was often a 10-15 minute wait on getting a table and service was a little slower than last time. that said the hotel was clearly at capacity occupancy with a conference held by Nikon on at the same time so whilst the wait and service was frustrating, it was definitely understandable.

House Keeping was exceptional, our room was always spotless, with a few extra towels and toiletries left when they saw our usage patterns (We stayed for 8 days so the staff had time to get to know us which was great)

Security was also excellent, I self drive on our Bali holiday's now, after a few days the security guys checking the car knew who we were and always had a chat with us which was really nice. Unfortunately valet was a little slow, self parking is not available so you must valet each time, which is free, but on collecting the car was often a 10 minute + wait, if one was allowed to self park it would eliminate this waiting and also the load on the staff.

The Free Wifi at this hotel also would have to be the fastest in bali, it is incredible :)

Unfortunately this hotel has now become very popular with the stereotypical ""Aussie Bogan"", it's not the hotels fault so I've not scored them down. But it's worth noting, if you're after an adult friendly hotel with quiet mornings and no screaming kids, this is no longer the place (Which is sad because on our first trip we loved the quality demographic of guests). Each day at 7am I was awoken to screaming children in the pool, with their bogan parents doing their best to emulate beached whales, sitting in the kids shallow pool, paying more attention to their Bintang's than what they do their children. I asked a few times for these guests to silence their children but was ignored every time. This then continued with such feral children running through the breakfast area screaming, up and down the corridors at night and then again, repeating itself the next morning. As a result, we hardly used the pool because of the noise and classless behaviour of the other guests - I suspect other guests felt the same judging by conversation around the hotel.

So again, I don't judge this hotel based on this, they can't choose who stays here and the Balinese culture is so naturally polite that the staff just smile at such behaviour. But it is unfortunate that such low quality guests have decided that the popularity of this hotel makes it suitable for them.

I had two children with me, they were polite and respectful of other guests and did not scream and carry on in public area's. Unfortunately the minority have spoiled this hotels for the majority.

As a result of this, the hotel is fantastic and they do everything they can to make guests feel valued. I'm not sure whether I will stay here again tho because of the type of people who are now staying here."
3336,Room facing the street is super noisy,30,May 2015,"I experienced the messy booking with the hotel, but after i complain, hotel give us a free lunch, so i think its fine!, i accept their apology.

the swimming pool is actually nice and relax, location is perfect, close to main street with all restaurant and shops we needed."
3337,Great hotel and location,50,May 2015,"My wife and 1 yr old son stayed here for 10 days and would recommend it. It's 400m from the beach, has a great breakfast and the staff were AMAZING with our son (especially Agus!!!). The only complaint would be that the pool is quite shaded in the afternoon."
3338,Very happy but still a few hiccups,40,May 2015,"We are here at the moment on a 7 night luxury escape so valve for money is amazing. Friendly staff and food and drinks are good. If I was paying there normal rate, there are a few things I would like to see improve.
1 room service is too slow, waited 45 minutes for coat hangers then had to call again. Rang for ice as our fridge is not cold and took 20 minutes. Room cleaning is good but I think they need a check list.
One day had no flannels. Glasses weren't replaced with clean ones in the bathroom. Shampoo and conditioner not always replaced when empty. These are allminor things but they can make a difference at a 4.5 star hotel.
We had lunch on our first day by the pool and no one explained that the shaslick cami in a nox with lid, my hubby thought it was a tray as his burger was on top, but the time we asked a staff member the satay were cold. We also ordered cocktails when happy hour was on to find out our were not included in the happy hour so that cost $32.00 for 2. Our menu did not have the happy hour list on it, so I wish staff had informed us when ordering. Or they should have signs saying certain drinks for happy hour.
Rooms do not have enough hanging room or drawers, you will live out your suitcase.
Massage was good but unfortunately you can hear the kids in the pool. I would not pay $37 ++ . I know this sounds a bit negative but all the good stuff said is true, I just wanted to point out were they can improve. These are only small things."
3339,Beautiful resort and amazing staff,50,May 2015,"We booked our package through Luxury Escapes and couldn't be happier with the hotel and all the inclusions.

All staff are wonderful with genuine friendly smiles and will do anything to make your stay memorable.

We booked a day tour with reception and our driver for the day was 'Made', he was such a great guide, fun, knowledgeable and happy to adjust the itinerary to suit us. Highly recommend Made for your tour. :-)

Only a slight hiccup, we requested Double/Double beds as were two friends travelling, we confirmed this a number of times but on checkin was booked as a King. The attendant quickly and without drama corrected the error and we were given room #608, which was lovely.

My first time to Bali, thanks for a great experience."
3340,Best family destination,50,May 2015,"We spent a week here and absolutely loved it! The Manager, Brad, sorted out interconnecting rooms for us as we were travelling with children even though he was away on holidays at the time. All of the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were modern, very clean and had everything you would need on a holiday. The Seminyak Kitchen was great and we ate there on several occasions. The breakfasts were amazing and had an endless amount of freshly made food to your choosing and run by an Aussie chef and a team of lovely Balinese chefs. The staff at the kids club were great and my son just loved them.
The hotel was only a 5 minute easy walk to the beach and Seminyak itself is full of great homewares and various other shops. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
3341,Fantastic,50,May 2015,"We booked using a luxury escapes voucher no problems at all. Staying in room 630 and very happy with our room. Fantastic comfortable bed and pillows, breakfast to die for and the staff are the most helpful and friendliest people I have met. Spa treatments excellent and just the overall atmosphere in this hotel is fantastic. Would definitely recommend staying here. The staff here are doing a magnificent job well done to all of you."
3342,Lacks pool chairs in the sun,40,May 2015,"Stayed here for 5 nights and requested a room with sun but ended up getting pool access room 137 which got no sun at all so had to try and get sun on the other side of the pool, lovely room, asked for hard pillow and staff happy to assist, this hotel needs more sunbeds in the sun and many guests we spoke to said the same thing, management needs to get rid of the high greenery in the lower pool area to allow for more sun on the lounges but otherwise the position, the staff and the breakfast was amazing"
3343,Can't fault,40,March 2015,"We stayed 8 nights using a Luxury Escape Voucher which was fantastic value in the newly renovated hotel
There was a few room problems but was sorted out very quickly by management , things that happen booking through a second party .
We had a pool side room , then a twin room on the second level. Both rooms excellent
Breakfast nice and should suit everyone's taste , just try to arrive at the restraunt before 9 am
Pool clean and pool service outstanding
Location ,5 minutes walk to beach or hitch a ride on the golf cart provided at hotel entrance , very handy
Some people complain about security but more the better I think ,everyone who enters the hotel is screened by several security staff .
All in all a pleasant stay with very friendly staff"
3344,Girls trip the drama that we didn't expect,30,May 2015,"Arriving in the early hours of the morning after what felt like a 10 hour flight across the pacific my friends and I were greeted by two lovely men at the desk with cool towels, yummy ice blocks and this unfamiliar beverage. We had made it, exhausted from the flight we made our way to our room to discover that our two double beds were not the two king size beds we were expecting. Too exhausted to care we ordered room service and to our disappointment it was hardly anything special. we do not recommend the margarita pizza or wedges at 2 am! The next morning we headed to the buffet breakfast and instantly our stay began to improve. The staff were polite, welcoming and a great array of food was on offer. We recommend the bagels and fresh juices. The daily room clean would arrive really late or not all on some days and when our room was cleaned simple things like toilet paper, tissues and towels even were forgotten, which become a little inconvenient when you shower and then realised you had no towel ! On our finally days we requested late checkout to discover on their booking system they had us checking out that very day. this being Incorrect, we began to panic as our flight home to Australia wasn't leaving until the following night at 11:50 pm we were at this point very annoyed and sourced our email of our booking confirmation. They asked us to email a copy to them so they could check with their manger and we continued on with our day trying to relax and enjoy our time. this little mix up had really created drama we didn't ever expect. On return to the hotel after a relaxing stroll around Seminyak we wanted to double check at the desk in regards to the mix up. the person we spoke to had no knowledge of the problem, this annoyed us further. What was really frustrating and concerning was the lack of communication between staff members. After explaining the story all over again the problem was finally resolved and updated in the computer reservation system. We wanted to re confirm late checkout of our room for 6pm with the lady behind the desk, who went on to inform us that we would have to pay 25 % of the daily charge, this was unacceptable after all the stress they had put us under. We would really consider other options next time we visit Bali. The facilities were amazing, food service staff and room service staff lovely, breakfast buffet superb, however simple mishaps regarding very important details such as correct bed size, check out dates And booking private cars for the airport cause unnecessary stress on what should be a relaxing holiday in paradise and should be second nature for a hotel this size to get right."
3345,Lovely time,50,April 2015,"Beautiful new resort on the border of Seminyak and Legian. Reception staff, room attendants , security staff all welcoming and so friendly. Room has lovely , fluffy pillows and bedding. Storage room is almost non existant except for wardrobe hanging space. We literally had to live out of our suitcase and I have bought this problem up with Management so hopefully they will make some changes. Bathroom big and luxurious. Pool areas were also big and catered for everyones taste with a swim up bar in one section and a long family friendly one down below this.
Balcony to pool provided a place to dry bathers.
Breakfast selection was huge and enjoyed by everyone. Dinner in the same restaurant was very pleasant with trendy music and a good selection of local food and also what I consider junk food like burgers and chips, because lets face it...we all feel naughty sometimes !
I really couldnt fault this hotel -having been to Bali 18 times and have stayed in many 4 -5 star hotels. This was up there in the top 3."
3346,Honeymoon,40,May 2015,"Spent my last to nights here
Amazing food
Amazing pools
Great wifi
When we got there it was a bit of a downer to find out that they haven't taken out our money for the room until we got there so $$$
Security is great
Down side
The rooms linen felt dirty
Pillows horrible to sleep on
And the smell of poo coming from the drains wow knock out"
3347,Great Experience,50,May 2015,"Our thanks to the Courtyard Marriott for providing us such a great week. We booked a room as part of the Luxury Escapes Package. The rooms are great, spacious and clean. The staff are simply awesome; so professional and nothing was ever too much trouble. Breakfast was amazing with everything and anything you could possibly want. You're definitely not restricted to banana pancake or omelette in this hotel. The food in the Seminyak kitchen was very tasty too. We are a couple but travelled with a family of 2 adults and 2 children. We all really enjoyed the experience."
3348,Great place to stay with family,40,May 2015,"Small but comfortable rooms in a fairly new hotel. Situated in a good neighborhood, the beach is just a few minutes away and plenty of nice shops to browse around in. Breakfast is good and the staff valiantly handle a large crowd with a smile. Large swimming pool and a play area for kids makes this a very family friendly hotel. Excellent spa too, though one can find equally good ones around the hotel at half the price.
The only drawback was that we could hear doors slamming and we must also have disturbed other guests when we checked in. Handle the doors with care."
3349,Exceed my expectation,50,May 2015,"I walk in to the hotel with expectation that service is going to be much better than the same chain I stayed during my visit to Shanghai, as this is after all, Bali. But is taken back by the fact that it exceed my expectation. I have to say, though, that I am a member of Marriot Rewards, so the review is based on how they treat a member.

While checking-in, we are welcomed with welcome drinks and Popsicle, which is always welcome, considering Bali's hot weather. Lobby is spacious, with view to the amazing pool. The pool is really spacious, with bars and live music (I forgot what time the live music started, but it ended at 8pm). You could easily spend days relaxing there, without the need to leave the hotel, unless to sample those amazing food that Seminyak is famous for.

I was escorted by one of the staff,who explained the room, hotel facilities and area map, and also wait for our luggage to arrive before leaving the room.

Admittedly though, room is a lot smaller vs. my expectation (after seeing the pictures on their web), but the bed and bathroom is spacious. I stayed in the pool-view room, so are treated with spacious balcony with view to the pool. Amenities are all Marriot's standard.

The hotel has buggy car facilities to the nearby Seminyak beach (or you could easily take a relaxing 5-8 mins stroll too). The buggy car could also drop you at the start of Seminyak eat street, since it is quite a distance to walk to the famous eat street.

My tiny complaints are the fact that we have to ask twice for extra towel and pillow to be delivered to the room (despite having mentioned this while checking-in). If you are driving in and out of the hotel, you would notice the security is so tight, which is nice during the first visit or so, but after constantly experiencing it, it could be quite irritated. Although, I agree that it's better to be safe than sorry."
3350,Very Relaxing,50,May 2015,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our week at this resort. The rooms were immaculate, the pool bar just beautiful. And thanks for upgrading us to a pool view room, such a lovely gesture. Planning our next trip back there as soon as we can."
3351,Excellent Accommodation,40,May 2015,"After a few emails back and forth trying to book our accommodation with our voucher from Luxury Escape we were advised our dates had been accepted.
From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. It took a few times to realise that the security personel were just doing their job which made us feel very safe. Being scanned upon entry each time is a great idea..more hotels should do same.
our room was awsome, breakfast was to die for..no need to eat at lunchtime.
Our free dinner, lunch and cocktails were also most welcome.
The only negative is the pool area shades just after lunch but that is not hotels fault. Pool area and staff were also very helpfull and I did enjoy the water aerobics. We also used the gym each morning which was very clean and everything you could want.
Overall, we would definately choose this hotel again should we ever return toBali."
3352,Great Location....,50,March 2015,"My Companions recently made a trip to Bali and I went along as well! (Read, I snuck into a suitcase when no-one was looking.)

We were met at Ngurah Rai International Airport by one of the Hotel drivers who whisked us away in style to the hotel. When we arrived we went through the security check, bags through the x-ray machine and us through the metal detector screen.... standard in many hotels nowadays, and in some ways, makes you feel safe.

Check-in was prompt and our room was available immediately. My companions set about to check out the pool and one of them wanted to know how good the gym was. Thumbs up on both counts. The pool, or should I say pools, are amazing and nearly all of the rooms have a balcony overlooking the pool area. Happy Hour beside the pool always set the mood with great entertainment.

Our room had the king size bed which is almost standard in good hotels. The rooms were slightly smaller but we spent so little time there that it hardly mattered. And I must say this is the first hotel I have ever stayed in that had scales in the bathroom!

All the staff were fantastic and something that stood out is that they all seemed so happy. We were there for Nyepi or Silent Day as it is known which meant we were not allowed to leave the hotel for 24 hours. The Marriott team did a fantastic job of making sure everyone was taken care of ie. meals etc, as most guests had never heard of Nyepi. One of my companions only realized this would occur after she had made the booking but went ahead just to experience it, once. And in case you are wondering, the calendar year in Bali is now 1937.

The hotel is located a 5 minute walk from the beach and as everyone has stated in their reviews, a buggy is provided for the quick trip if needed. Whatever you need is just outside the hotel and Bali is really a beautiful and enticing paradise, but if you just want to sit around and relax, then The Marriott Courtyard is perfect!
Koko (& Companions)... more adventures to come!"
3353,10 Night Luxury Escapes Package,40,May 2015,"Room 549- 10 night luxury escapes package at this luxurious hotel complex..
We have been to Bali many many times over the last 25 years and normally stay at Nusa Dua or SANUR and only returned to Seminyak because of the fantastic value promotion by the Courtyard Marriot and Luxury Escapes.
Almost everything was perfect from the seamless airport pick up to the front of house staff during streamlined check-in ..to the very courteous and polite security team...
The only thing that still has room for improvement is the housekeeping which was a little substandard until we bought the shortfalls to the attention of the housekeeping staff on our floor and to their credit they took our constructive criticism and noted shortfalls onboard and from the fifth day onwards housekeeping has improved considerably.
We normally do not eat dinner in-house and for the first two nights rediscovered good quality restaurants at reasonable prices in the immediate area however on the third night we decided to eat in-house and I am so glad we did. From the third night we ate every evening meal at the Seminyak Kitchen on level 3 and whilst you can buy cheaper meals outside of the hotel for an extra couple of dollars it's well worth eating at this particular venue. The food is good quality .. the hygiene is 100% and the staff are incredible.
The room we had was good quality and we found absolutely no challenges with the plumbing or the air conditioning but the room lacked drawer space and was not very soundproof and as a consequence we had constant noise from the kids swimming pool particularly in the afternoon when we were trying to rest even though we were on the fifth floor.
During check-in I was asked to pay US$500 ""deposit"" which I declined to do as I had already pre-paid the entire 10 day tariff.
This payment was not an authorisation it was actually a debit against my credit card.
I was assured that I would be refunded any outstanding Credit amount on checkout however I declined the offer and anything I purchased in-house I simply paid for by cash or credit card at the time of purchase.
Overall ....well done Courtyard by Marriott ... I think you've nearly got it right and we wish you every success for the future ... A great place to stay in Seminyak..."
3354,Awesome resort stay,40,May 2015,"Staff in this hotel definitely makes you feel welcome the moment you arrive at the hotel. From security staff, to housekeeping and restaurants staff, they will greet with a smile.
The tight security here makes us feel safe, even if we have to go thru the scanning process everytime you enter into the hotel.
We were allow early check in upon arrival since there's room available. The staff at the lobby will provide us with a handy small map showing the area we stayed within Seminyak, and went the extra miles to recommend a few nice places for food.
Room was all good when we checked in on day 1, however on day 2 it's disappointing as the clean towel put on the rack has blood clear blood stain with a diameter of about 4cm. I'm clueless how can they not check. Lucky thing is I have the habit of checking the towels before use. Then since I was short of a bath towel with that, I used the smaller towel on the rack. Then on day 3 the housekeeping staff replenish everything except the smaller towel. Also on the same day I noticed that the blanket cover is dirty with black stains that maybe from eye makeup. Well, the housekeeping staff definitely changed the blanket cover daily but missed to check and ensure they are changing a clean item.
Also on the left hand side of the ceiling there's a spider Web.
I'm not sure if the housekeeping is under staff or needs to be improve.
Yes, I did not highlight them to the staff coz I'm there for holiday and not to check their work.
The reason I'm writing it here is for awareness.
That's is why I stated ""awesome resort stay"" in the subject title of my review. Coz if you come with an expectation of a hotel stay and you are those extremely particular about cleanliness you might be disappointed. But treat it as a resort (chalet) Stay, then it's awesome!
The hotel restaurant - Seminyak Kitchen serves delicious food. That we ordered room service so much more frequently compared to our other hotel stay.
Another plus point, they provide hotel guest a buggy ride to the seminyak beach, and the Seminyak Beach is only a 5 mins walk away. But, I would suggest you use the pool as it's way much cleaner!
To us we are happy with the stay with the price we paid.
I rated this hotel 4 out of 5 due to the cleanliness which in my opinion can be improve.
I will return to this hotel again in future."
3355,Great Hotel,50,May 2015,Lovely hotel..We stayed 6 nights and loved it. Great place for couples or families. Our little girl loved kids club as they had a variety of things to do. Happy hour by the pool is a great way to meet people and enjoy the great live music and cheap drinks. We had an issue with our door but they moved us happily. Breakfast is one of the best buffets I've experienced with so much variety including ice cream which my daughter thought was heaven.. Would definitely stay again.
3356,Honeymoon bliss,50,May 2015,"This was the last stop to our 2.5 week stay in bali! The breakfast is to die for my favourite I have ever had all around the world, the staff are all so lovely and rooms are clean and modern! We stayed in the 1 bedroom pool access room and we loved it! Could be more seating around pool as seemed to always be full and the thought of sitting on bean bags on the edge of the pool top scared me think it's a bit dangerous if someone accidentally slips back or falls asleep. Beach is just down the road we got the buggy down there and to double six beach a couple of times was very easy and only a $2 drive in taxi to eat street in seminyak we even walked a couple of times we loved it here and want to return ASAP! Thanks courtyard and especially shashank for
making our stay even more special"
3357,Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak - Luxury Escapes deal,40,April 2015,"Such a fantastic deal and it didn't disappoint! The Marriott is a great place to stay with friendly 'can't do enough for you' staff. Ideally located near beach, shopping and great eating. We went with 2 kids - 7 & 4, and they had a ball at the kids club and really enjoyed the fabulous pool, making plenty of friends along the way. The deal was incredibly generous, the standard of everything was A1, the brekky unbelievable! I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Hotel or the deal."
3358,Awesome by far the best service experienced,50,May 2015,Well I travelled to bali with my wife for her 30th bday and the way we were treated was unbelievable. I sent a few emails to the hotel to help make the day special for my wife. Tina and cindy did such an amazing job helping me organise the day and it went better then planned. The staff and the way this hotel is run is amazing and credit must go out to the management. The room was great with a big bathroom - the pool area is very inviting and pool bar prices and food at the hotel are very good. Breakfast was amazing we couldn't wait to go every morning. The spa was so beautiful and treatments outstanding my wife is also pregnant but it wasn't an issue at all. Only issues are the house keeping could be improved and i guess more deck chairs have to be added around the pool somehow maybe a decking made on the grass area. Overall it's a hotel you don't want to leave great prices for quality food and drink great staff I just can't wait to return with our baby hopefully nothing changes keep up the great work
3359,Marriott Magic,40,May 2015,"Great hotel, wonderful staff, happy with security. Room adequate but not enough water, did not find bed & pillows comfy, in fact one lot of pillows had sour odour. Could not use lounge outside it was so dirty. Not sufficient seating in room. If you want peaceful relaxing hol, this is not for you. Great for families, during school Hols must be bliss. The children do not seem to use the childrens pool, prefer to take over the other pools, squealing & splashing with careless parents, dragging all the blow up pool toys into the larger pool (get rid of the blow ups). Get to the pool early for quiet time....before they are running around the board walk. After having spoken to other older guests, feeling is similar. Beautiful gardens & cannot fault the wonderful service everywhere."
3360,Pure Bliss,50,May 2015,"My best friend and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was amazing. The location is great, a short 5-10 min walk to the beach or if you want the staff will take you down or pick you up in the hotel buggy. We managed to hitch a ride on our way back from the beach one evening with a lovely family who had organized a pick up.

The breakfast is to die for, we even made a request at short notice for black sticky rice and Billy the executive chef made sure it was on the menu the next day - amazing! The coffee is also excellent and
all the staff were extremely helpful and happy.

We loved the pool area, plenty of beds or beanbags and the pool bar staff were excellent and we enjoyed the cocktails and snacks that we ordered.

We had a deluxe pool view room and it was lovely and spacious. All in all I could not fault anything or change anything about our stay. We loved it!!

Thank you"
3361,Will be back!,50,May 2015,"This is my second stay in this hotel (my first stay was last November) .

I normally don't wake up for breakfast when I'm on holiday (even though it's included in the room rate)-- and with a bed as comfortable as Marriott's, it is honestly really tough to drag yourself out of bed. And yes, the breakfast was very worth it hauling myself out of bed, and trekking to breakfast. I say trekking because it always seems like a far walk in the mornings when you are hungry and sleepy. Breakfast was always a surprise- a wide variety of dishes : Asian / western .. And I really loved how the juices were placed in those pitchers which never seemed to run out. I once went down at 1045am and I finished the last orange juice pitcher. When I requested for another glass, it appeared magically-- no questions asked. Very impressive service.

I had a good workout in the gym . I found the equipment adequate (I used the Dumbbells) and there was ample space - Two benches, free weights as well as medicine balls / yoga mats / treadmills and elliptical machine. My only gripe is that they do not provide bottled water at the ""refreshment"" area which has a water dispenser and apples. Even though they have tiny little cups available for the water dispenser, for people seriously working out, you would probably need more than 5 cups to quench your thirst. another option is to purloin 300ml bottled water from the treadmill machines and then to refill it when you are done (which is what I did because I was getting tired of constantly refilling tiny cups -though I feel bad to the next person who is actually using the treadmill machine because i don't think the bottled water was replenished).

That being said, I was thoroughly impressed by how secure I felt being in Marriott. As a solo traveller, I felt taken care of and safe -- thanks to the high security presence in the hotel especially. There is a compulsory security check for visitors and guests, even when just popping over to the minimart across the street to stock up on snacks-- but the security is always friendly and professional , and they make sure to handle your stuff gently and not to crush your snacks. Lol.

Walking on the streets near the hotel was fine as well. Plenty of food options. I frequented Sushimi (Sushi restaurant down the road) as well as Lucky Day Bar (less than 3 mins from hotel).

I visited seminyak Kitchen on my last day. I had requested for a late checkout at 3pm, and I had ample of time before heading to the airport. (Thanks to the comfortable bed I totally missed my lunchtime). Decided to try their ham and mushroom pasta with cream sauce. When the pasta came, the mushrooms were missing. When I clarified my order, I was met with a flurry of apologies from everyone (I almost felt bad!) and I was offered sauteed mushrooms instead . No issue with that , in fact the mushrooms and pasta tasted good! The chef came out and apologised as well, while asking me how I felt about the food and with a cheerful smile, thanked me for my feedback. I thought that was the end of it. The major shocker came when I asked for the bill. I was informed that the meal would be on the house ! I insisted to pay but the staff refused saying that they mixed up my order, so it's on the house. Can I just say that this little incident and the professionalism of the staff made me really impressed by the marriott service, and largely contributed to me writing this (very lengthy) review ?

Kudos to all the Marriott staff that were working there that day. They handled the situation very efficiently (and no, just in case anyone is wondering, I did not throw a fit, but I'm sure if I had, they would have dealt with it efficiently as well!)

i would also like to thank the housekeeping for making up my room (despite me calling for them at weird hours like 4pm after I'm done sleeping)-- and they really have a sense of humour because my stuffed toy bear is arranged in different positions everyday !


I didn't get all the staff names but I would definitely be back . Especially to Melinda at the front desk (who has very nice eye makeup) for her patience and professionalism while putting up with questions on where to go and food options. Thank you for a memorable stay and good job Marriott. (Please give me a free upgrade on my next stay ok? Hahaha! )"
3362,Fantastic hotel,50,April 2015,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in a room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The staff are incredibly friendly and make you feel extremely welcome from the second you walk in, right through to check out. The WiFi was fast and the buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious. The beach is about 5 - 10 minutes walk but otherwise we caught taxis everywhere. Taxis are easy to find, directly outside the hotel and are extremely cheap (if you use taxis with a meter)."
3363,Fantastic!,50,May 2015,"This was our first trip to Bali, and the hotel made it a fantastic experience!
The staff were so accommodating and friendly, always greeting you with a smile and nothing was ever too much trouble for them.

We were upgraded to a beautiful pool view room which had a lovely view but was also tucked away so not in full view of people in the pool. The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the shower was huge and it had all the facilities you would need with a lovely balcony and comfortable couch.

The pool area was great, split in to two pools - one at the top next to the pool bar and one lower down with lots of sunbeds and loungers. The floating beanbags were awesome!

The food and drinks at the pool bar were more expensive than else where (as expected in a hotel) but we were happy to pay the extra to enjoy the awesome pool and lovely service, and delicious food and drinks! I loved that the sun loungers had a 'call' button so you didn't even have to get up to order food/drink! Breakfast was great with a lot of choice!

The hotel was on a fairly busy street, but we didn't hear any noise from inside the hotel. Only a 5 minute walk (if that) to the beach, and a 10-15 minute walk to Seminyak Square area (or a $2 taxi) which has a heap of great bars and restaurants.

We would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Seminyak area, and we will definitely be back! We had a great time."
3364,Great stay but need a bit improvement,30,May 2015,"I stayed here with my friends for company outing on May 8 to May 10. The hotel location is great, just walking distance to the beach and also to some shops and cafes around Seminyak area. The pool is great, with relaxing bean bags and many sitting areas. Breakfast also delicious and have many variations, really enjoyed it!
Some improvement can be made though due to me and a few friends realized that the pillows in our bed (they give 2 for each bed) have some stinky odor, in addition mine is not as fluffy as usual hotel's pillow. On the first night the smell is still tolerated, but when I wanna go to sleep on second night, the pillow still smells that I have to ask them to exchange a new one. They did quickly exchanged it though, but hopefully they give it more concern whether the pillows are in great condition or not to avoid further complaints."
3365,Mid price relaxation,40,February 2015,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights. It was comfortable, the food was good and the breakfast buffet satisfied us through lunch. It is not a 'nature style' hotel, rather rooms all along a big rectangle along a very long pool area. The advantage is that many of the rooms have a nice outlook over the pool area. The room was very comfortable, modern, very satisfactory. Not much greenery around this hotel but a good place to fly and flop if that is what you are after. It is well situated and you can walk to Seminyak shops etc."
3366,Isolated bliss in Seminyak,40,April 2015,"I had the pleasure of staying in the Courtyard for a week. The staff were incredibly friendly and the room was perfect, a corner room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The pool itself is the best part of the hotel, the noise from outside is insulated and the service in the pool bar was great - including good deals on the cocktails. The food was more than adequate - the bloody mary burger being the highlight and well recommended and the free popcorn is a nice touch.

The room was kept immaculately clean and the only issue I had was that the shower was not warm at all - appreciate that in the high humidity of Bali this may be by design but it would be good to have an option, especially as the air conditioning was so strong that the humidity was effectively reduced.

I found Seminyak to be quite a bustling place and the taxi drivers incessant honking and requests for business infuriating so it was nice to have a place that I could retreat to and relax in."
3367,Excellent service,50,April 2015,"We cannot fault this hotel. If I had to sum it up in two words: Excellent service!
What we wanted we got it all in this hotel: Excellent location.
Good size room with fantastic bed and pillows, quiet, good night sleep, spacious, big telly, lounge area, great shower and bathroom, plenty of space to move around. Good housekeeping and was on the ball.
We had a Pool Terrace Suite. Our room walked out onto the kiddies pool and was sunny in the day. If the sun got too much around the pool I could sit on the small 'balcony' area outside the door leading onto the pool area surrounded by beautiful plants or find a shady spot under an umbrella and still be part of the fun in the pool. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool as well as bean bags. There is a bell for bar and food service for around the pool which is always a bonus and so convenient. Free sorbet ice creams around midday, what a bonus on such hot days!

Someone on Tripadvisor complained about the security aspect - we were more than happy to do it - you walk through a security screen similar to what is at the airport. Put your belongings through the x-ray machine - can't understand the issue some have with it. It took maybe ten seconds. I'll rather be safe thank you.

The food hygiene standards were excellent and the head chef was present at breakfast keeping an eye on everything. Loved that the juices, fruit, cheese and cold meats were kept refrigerated. The best breakfast we've ever had, without a doubt. Loved the espresso variety coffees that was available with breakfast! Try the ice coffee and ask for it with a blob of ice cream!!
We had lunch and dinner there on occasion - don't bother going anywhere else for Mie Goring - just have it here! The best.
We loved the pool bar, (just need to get Bintang Radler) happy hour 2-8pm!!, great cocktail variety which was enjoyed by all, try the Lychee Martini it was enjoyed a lot by some!!, live music later in the afternoon and evening, good seating around pool bar area making it easy to befriend other guests, water aerobics at 11am, three great pools with floating pillows or beds in them, fitness center and Zanti Spa. Book early for the Zanti Spa as it has a very good reputation and was nearly always booked out!
Also appreciated that they had a 'no towels left on the sunbed' policy. It didn't seem to be policed though as people left their towels on the beds for hours on end yet nobody used the beds preventing others from enjoying them. If they could keep an eye on it that would be great. We were there in low season yet it was pretty busy at the hotel. So you had to get out there early to secure you spot, but saying that people come and go and you would soon find an empty seat.
Check in and out was the smoothest ride ever! No issues. You can also do it via a Marriott Hotel app on your phone. Wi-fi was free and speedy. No issues at all. Would recommend joining the Marriott loyalty program.
The hotel is walking distance to Eat Street if you like a leisurely stroll on Jalan Raya Basangkasa past all the great shops on your way there, or shortcut it via Jalan Drupadi, a hop and skip to the beach or take the complimentary golf cart! It was safe to walk everywhere. Plenty to see and do, plenty of the usual Bali places - bars, restaurants, massage, mani-pedi places - liked Santai Day Spa - to choose from.
Our fave restaurant in Seminyak is Sambal Shrimp (next door to il Cortile) near the corner of Jalan Drupadi and Eat Street - everything is fresh, local and nothing is frozen. We discovered UpCycle Green Museum Shop where the craziest handbags, wallets, purses can be found and Barbar Cafe on the same street, Jalan Raya Basangkasa, is a worthy pit stop even just for the decor!! LacaLaca a Mexican restaurant and bar near the end of Jalan Drupadi and Eat Street has something different and the best red Sangria!! Ginger Moon and Ultimo is next door to each other on Eat Street - was recommended and we loved it!!
The service at the Marriott Courtyard was without pretense, it was honest, polite, jovial and super friendly. Everyone spoke great English and nothing was ever too much trouble.

We were really so incredibly happy there and will return without a doubt - purely for the fact it ticked all our boxes and the service was excellent. Everyone involved with this hotel should be super proud of themselves."
3368,"Very Nice Hotel, Great Pool and Walking Distance to the Beach",50,April 2015,"Stayed two nights on a 6-day visit to Bali and Java. A diverse cross section of guests, many families, some with three generation, couples and solo travelers. Three separate pools connected and a very well-attended bar. Everything convenient even though the hotel was large. Excellent security......felt very safe. Convenient to shopping and the lively bar/entertainment scene."
3369,Chillin by the pool,50,May 2015,"This my 2nd stay at courtyard Seminyak, was by far my most relaxing break I have had for a long time. We had 9 days with a bit of rain & nice temperatures. From Brad(general manager), Billy(head chef),Rudi(runs-or should run pool bar), & the staff in general were absolutely fantastic.
Many thanks to all."
3370,Excellent Service,50,May 2015,"Stayed here for 3 nites and wld highly recommend to others. The place is new and well maintained. The staff always hv smiling faces n is always happy to be at our service.
We requested to change room as it has a connecting door to the next room which was quite noisy. Mr Sila assisted to change to another room with any further delay. Checking in was a breeze by their reception staff, Ms Melinda.
The breakfast spread was superb with wide range of dishes. The guys at the egg station does a good job. Despite the peak breakfast hour with lots of orders, he can still keep a sweet smile and attentive to the guests needs. The staff at Seminyak Kitchen shld be praised for being very polite and attentive.
We also did complained to the housekeeping section as our pillows have some damp smell. They immediately sent fresh warm ones."
3371,Wonderful stay,50,April 2015,"My family checked into four rooms on arrival in Bali after being let down by the accomodation at the Bali Rich Villa's.

Brad, the GM made us very welcome. The rooms are spacious and have everything you would need. The pool area is lovely and during happy hour you can get two for one drinks. We enjoyed cocktails by the pool, nighly live music, room service, snacks by the pool, breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and none of it could be faulted.

I would highly recommend the Marriott and will definitely stay here again. It is also in a great location next to beach, shopping, spa's and good quality restaurants. Thank you."
3372,Great hotel in Seminyak,50,April 2015,"The Courtyard is a great hotel in a rather busy area of Seminyak. The rooms are comfortable and have a good size. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Especially to mention are the nice pool in the center of the hotel facility, the great breakfast buffet as well as the nice spa and gym."
3373,Hard to fault. Great stay.,50,May 2015,"Just spent 7 nights at the Courtyard Seminyak and found it to be an excellent experience. We had a pool view room which was of a comfortable size. The bed and pillows were comfortable and the air-conditioning quiet. The shower was huge. The pool area was very relaxed with music from the pool bar setting the atmosphere and plenty of floating bean bags and inflatables to lay about in the water. Happy hour of 2 for 1 drinks goes from 2 pm until 8 pm (6 hours) making cocktails about Au$7 and Bintangs $2 each. Pretty good prices for an international chain hotel. Excellent live music by the pool bar each day from 5.30 to 8 pm. As always mentioned in reviews of this hotel the breakfast was awesome but lunch or dinner are also to the same standard. The girlfriend thought the vegetarian lasagne for dinner was the best she had tasted and I had a steak one lunch that was better than most I'd had in Oz. The hotel spa is very nice and the fitness centre well equipped. Although a kid free holiday the kids club looked plenty entertaining for the young ones. There is also an ATM off the lobby. Security is high with airport style metal detector and luggage X-ray machine on each entry to the hotel. Great staff in all services around the hotel. Seminyak beach is at the end of the street only several hundred metres walk. Plenty of local shopping stalls, restaurants and massage shops located in the same street. Mini mart located opposite the hotel. The only negative was the water in the shower stunk each time it was turned on and I can't remember from previous trips to Bali whether that is a hotel or local problem. Would happily recommend this hotel."
3374,Great Hotel,40,April 2015,"Great hotel in great location. It's quiet yet still near the fun. The beach is less than a 5min walk away but if thats too far than take the free shuttle. The rooms are good size with all the normal amenities. Breakfast is a huge buffet with more options than you will need. The pool is very nice too with pools side service at any time.
Considering that it is Bali, I think the hotel is slightly overpriced. But overall, great stay"
3375,"Highly Recommend, Enjoyable Stay!",50,April 2015,"My husband and I stayed here recently for 9 nights. From the moment we checked in we were made to feel valued and treated like royalty by the very friendly concierge, especially Cindy, Melinda and Ari nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are modern, clean and we especially liked the heavy blackout drapes to sleep in and block out the hot Bali sun in the morning. The king bed was comfortable, shower was big and spacious with optional rain head function.

We especially liked the massive selection at the breakfast buffet daily (although we would like to see corn fritters added to the menu if possible!), the food and beverage supervisor I Gde Made was professional, friendly and accommodating every day we stayed there. The breakfast buffet has a variety of healthy options also which was great to see i.e. fresh fruit, nuts and various cereals to choose from. As well as you usual omelette and noodle station.

The location is fantastic, 5 minute walk to the beach (or if you are lazy and can't brave the blazing hot Bali sun there is a shuttle bus from the Hotel to the beach!)., there are also great spa's and shopping not far as well as Eat Street/Oberoi Street with a great selection of restaurants to dine at.

The pool was great, however as numerous people have mentioned can be difficult to find a sun lounge due to the amount of guests staying and limited number of sun loungers/beds by the pool.

Brad the General Manager, was extremely down to earth and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Even recommended a place for us to buy ceramics after we mentioned we liked the ceramic bowls in the restaurant! Touches like this make you feel so welcome and valued as a guest.

Room Tip: Definitely a pool view room, the higher floor the better we stayed on Floor 6 (Top floor). I would not stay in a room that overlooks the road as I imagine the traffic noise etc would be annoying.

We would definitely recommend this Hotel and will stay here again next time we have the pleasure to return to Bali."
3376,Great Hotel with amazing buffet breakfast,40,April 2015,"We spent 3 nights here over Easter and really enjoyed the hotel. The staff were amazing, so helpful and friendly. We had a problem with our first room, with a generator noise constantly running so we told reception and were promptly moved to another room. It was no problem for them at all and a staff member came with us to make sure the noise wasn't a problem in the new room. The rooms were lovely, nice comfy beds, very clean and a balcony overlooking the pool
The buffet breakfast was incredible. Fabulous selection of food, from Nasi Goreng to fresh fruit, to eggs made to order, freshly baked pastries and donuts and cereals. The hotel didn't seem to be completely full, however it was very difficult to find a lounge by the pool. Some days we weren't able to get one until 3-4pm which was disappointing."
3377,Beautiful,50,April 2015,"A gorgeous place to stay! Family friendly environment, great food at the restaurant, perfect service. Stayed there for 8 nights with my husband and two kids, the kids loved the kids club which was quiet and cool. Everything was clean and well maintained. Special thanks to Santi, Ella for being so delightful :) heaps of others but I didn't get all their names.
Would go back in a flash!
Mel"
3378,Amazing hotel! Highly Recommend!,50,April 2015,"Spent 7 nights at this amazing hotel. The staff were all such friendly, lovely people and nothing was ever too much effort for anything we asked for. The food here was fantastic. Our daily buffet breakfasts were definitely a highlight of the trip. We stayed in a deluxe pool view room which would have to be the best hotel room I have stayed in- great size room with balcony, AMAZING shower and very very comfortable bed. The service and attitude of all staff could not have been better. 5 min walk to the beach and great location for shopping- there is a shuttle which takes you in to the main street at anytime which is about a 5 min drive. It truly was such a pleasure to stay at this hotel and there is no doubt we will be staying here again."
3379,Top Spot,50,April 2015,"Spent 10 days in a pool access room on a Luxury Escape Voucher and it was perfect. No noise issues at all and the only point I'd make is the lack of hanging space but as you pack light for Bali it isn't too much of a problem.
Each day we sat and had a beautiful breakfast for up to an hour and a half. The staff genuinely love their job throughout the resort with a special mention to Arta for his excellent service and entertainment and Agus for delivering his great omelets with so much joy. The pool area and service were sensational and I had two of the best massages in the spa by a very professional Ariviana.
Highly recommended."
3380,Perfect for the whole family,50,April 2015,"From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and cared for by every staff member we met - not once did we have one of ""those"" encounters that all too often happens when travelling. Nothing was too much trouble, when an error in room allocation was established it was immediately remedied and our room was wonderfully located and appointed. We had seen a couple of reviews saying that some rooms were noisy due to kids pool or the bar - but I can't imagine how, we didn't get this sense at all.

Without doubt one of the best service experiences we have had, from Seminyak Kitchen Staff Yeani who was a hit with Miss 4 and of course us too as a result, to Chef Bayu who hosted hubby's cooking class letting us bring home some wonderful recipes. Hariyanto and Hari in the gym and spa both left us in better shape than we arrived! And the lovely ladies in kids club ensured the holiday met everyones needs!!

Wonderful food and delicious cocktails, with great access to more of the same throughout the Seminyak area - this was truly a hit and we will be back! Congratulations Billy and Shashank your teams are a credit to you."
3381,Highly Recommended,50,April 2015,"My wife and I were in Bali last weekend for a family wedding in Seminyak and made our decision to stay here largely based on previous TripAdvisor reports and can confirm we definitely made a good decision, so thank you once again TripAdvisor! Although Bali is not exactly our thing, the location of the Courtyard Marriott is absolutely ideal. Albeit not one of the direct beach front resorts, it is right in the heart of all of the activity and a short and enjoyable walk to the beach, but at the same time ensures a secluded and peaceful environment within the property. We chose a Pool view Deluxe room and would strongly recommend this option to you as the rooms are very comfortable complete with a very well appointed bathroom and balcony with a great view of the pool. I would have to say that the three stand out highlights are:
1. The design of the pool is amazing. It was an absolute pleasure to spend some peaceful time lounging by the pool complete with fabulous pool service staff who were always immediately available and great hosts. (Be sure to head up to the top pool and get amongst the 2 for 1 cocktails at the swim up bar between 6pm to 8pm! Sensational!)
2. We both love breakfast and can confirm that it doesn't get much better than this. The variety and freshness of the food, the juices, the fresh fruit, the coffee, the service and the environment could not be better.
3. The service and attitude of all of the staff we came in contact with are an absolute credit to the management and the training that has been instilled. (We had a late flight departure and the staff could not have been more accommodating to allow us to stay within the hotel until we eventually departed).
If you are intending to stay in Seminyak in the future, book with with full confidence that you will have made a good decision!
Should we ever head back to Seminyak, this is the only place we would stay. Enjoy."
3382,Good location and nice hotel,40,March 2015,Stayed for 2 nights on our way back from sydney to jakarta. The room is not too big but it was just nice even with kids. Clean and modern. Nice breakfast as well and good location. Cheap massages are just around the corner and shopping area is walking distance as well. The hotel is quite new and the security is very strict like any other marriott hotels. We had an enjoyable stay and will definitely be back
3383,Excellent hotel,50,March 2015,"Stayed here just the one night before moving on to The Stones Hotel (sister hotel in the Marriott Group), and regret not staying longer.

Was contacted by staff member Cindy a month before our arrival date, who promised to get a surprise ready when we checked-in, upon hearing we were in Bali for our anniversary.

Arrived in a rental car and the valet service was prompt and efficient. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite and greeted with a slice of cake in the room. Nice touch!

Everything about the hotel was clean and new; service from each and every staff member we encountered was outstanding.

There's a great assortment of both Asian and Western dishes for breakfast and you get several types of coffee to choose from (think latte, cappuccino etc).

Room service wise, I'd recommend the Asian over Western dishes as our fish and chips arrived a tad soggy although still delicious.

Will most definitely come back."
3384,Loved it!,50,March 2015,"Not much you can fault about this brand new, modern, vibrant hotel in Seminyak.

Stayed in a Poolview Deluxe room - comfy king size bed, decent size bathroom with rain shower, nice little balcony to sit in the afternoon and enjoy the acoustic music from the pool bar. The room was kept immaculately clean every day with towels and amenities refreshed. They even lined my shoes up and tidied my belongings.

I can't decide whether my highlight is the too die for buffet breakfast or the bean bags in the pool! Buffet breakfast in the morning was just about anything you could possibly promise your stomach! I'm still missing my eggs benedict, followed by donuts, followed by waffles and chocolate ice-cream every morning. After filling ourselves up at breakfast, it was time to lounge around at the pool area and grab ourselves a floating bean bag - the best hangover cure! The pool is well designed with a top area if your after a bit of atmosphere (bean bags, swim up pool bar, delicious cocktails, music, etc) and a lower area if you simply want to relax on a pool chair and read a book. There's also a shallow area behind a fountain that could probably be called the kiddies pool area. Here goes ‚Ä¶ my only complaint is the people who ""reserve"" pool chairs. We would struggle at 8am to find any vacant seats, and funnily enough there was no one even using the pool - very frustrating!! The hotel has signs up requesting this not to be done, so they really do need to police it better. It's simply not fair on other guests who are ready to use the area.

The staff at the hotel offer nothing but 5 star service ‚Ä¶ checkin staff are efficient, concierge and security always welcoming, the General Manager and Executive Chef (both Australian) are always interacting with the guests and are not above everyone else to pitch in. They are continually leading their team by example. Perhaps the pool bar staff could have a bit more charisma though ‚Ä¶. might have been a bad day for our cocktail maker but he could barely break into a smile.

Location is about half way between Eat St in Seminyak and Double Six St in Legion. I like this as best of both worlds - easy enough to catch taxi to both, or walk along the beach.

Without doubt, it was an awesome 7 nights and will definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to Bali."
3385,First Class Service and Hospitality,50,April 2015,"I just recently returned from my wonderful 7 days holiday vacation in Bali. I must say that my stay at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak was very memorable. All the staff are absolutely exceptional. The minute I walked in, the warm welcome and greetings. Cold drinks, warm towel and the fruit bar. Its the little things that makes it special. Special thanks to Cindy - the guest relations manager for greeting me upon arrival at the front desk and the check in process, and throughout my stay making sure Ive been taking care of. My complimentary upgrade to a One Bedroom Suite was much appreciated and awesome service that as a Platinum Elite member received. Special Thanks to Melinda at the Front Desk who also upgraded my travel buddy who arrived later, and a non Elite member. He was really impressed with the service that he got, he cant stop talking about it. The suite was awesome, huge room, great pool view. The living room is large, the spacious bathroom with a rainfall shower, the king size bed was very comfortable, beddings very soft, the balcony overlooking the pool. Special Thanks to the housekeeping staff who kept my room looking immaculate. Thank You to Herry for the daily towel animal creations, I look forward to it everytime I get back to my room, also his daily notes.(I guess Herry was assigned to my room the whole week lol) I love that. Also the turn down service was a nice touch, Thanks for always replinishing my bottle water and freshen up my bathroom and the bedroom. Wifi was fast and reliable, great TV channel selections. Room service was quick and convenient.

The breakfast buffet at Seminyak Kitchen is outstanding! Thank You to Dewi and Indah for the wonderful greeting daily, the warm smile and hello, and always knows where we want to sit. To Werdiana, Alii, Mala for always filling our coffee cup, and how I want mine, the daily conversations and their recommendations where to eat, what to see. They became our friends at the end, it was so sad to leave. I love to many choices from western food, to local dishes, fresh fruits, made to order eggs, bagel station, bread and pastry, fresh pancakes and waffles, fruits infused water, name it, they have it, even ice cream for breakfast. I must say best breakfast selection ever. After a week, Im so spoiled. We ate each morning outside on the deck, overlooking the street, which is fantastic and very cool vibe. We also had a chance to eat at Seminyak Kitchen for dinner, Thursday Night Thai buffet and the other night we had a la carte. Very impressed with the food quality and taste.

Another highlight of the hotel is the beautiful pool with its swim up bar. The drinks, the food, the pool crew are so personable and offers great service. Pool side lunch was great. The club sandwich, burger sliders, pizza. And the cocktails, awesome Happy Hours 2-8pm, I Look forward to it daily and the live band/music. I really appreciate the cold face towels, ice cream fruit bars and also the offer of water. Very nice touch. There was a few times that all the lounge chairs were all taken, but the bean bags, floating bean bags was available and most of the time I didnt have to wait long for a lounge chair to become available.

The rest of the hotel amenities was all excellent, the spa offers excellent massage, great pricing. The 24 Hours gym, equipment all in good working conditions. I actually used it everyday. I didnt mind the extra security measures, I feel very safe staying here. The location is perfect, walki g distance to the beach. Lots of restaurants nearby and shops within a short walk away.

Thank You to every smiling staff member for making this stay just the best ever. Also to Mr. Widi, who drove me to the airport qhen I left. I'm looking forward to my return very soon (October 2015)."
3386,best value Hotel with splendid services,50,April 2015,"Great Location, great rates, superb crews, breakfast and services... recommended... Will go there again !!! Last year we tried some other 4 star and above and this one is the best value. Other ""better"" than this one is way too overrated.. You should try someday !!!"
3387,Perfect!,50,April 2015,"We're on our last day here and I couldn't wait to write this review as we were so happy with our stay! We were welcomed with a fresh drink and a fruit popsicle on arrival. Check in was a breeze. Security was friendly and made you feel very safe. Front desk staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating.

Room...
- Clean, fresh, air-conditioning
- Balcony faced the street which meant a bit of noise but nothing excessive.. a pool view would be nice but not necessary since you don't spend much time in your room
- Wifi was FAST and reliable, great TV channels
- Bathroom shower was glorious with rainfall shower head and choice to use removable shower head too
- Room service was quick and convenient

Pool...
- Two areas... one up top near the pool bar where they played music and the lower part where it was a bit quieter. The waterfall was relaxing to listen to.
- There were always lounges available - on one side it was always shady and the other sunny all day. Only one day we couldn't find lounges on the sunny side, but turn over is often enough that we didn't have to wait long. Besides, they have floating bean bags in the pool you can lay on too!
- The pool was the PERFECT temperature.. refreshing but not freezing or too warm
- When it got super hot the staff would bring around ice cold, mint scented face towels, fruit popsicles and lemon ice water to help you cool down

Food...
- THE FOOD!! So so so good.
- Breakfast alone is worth coming to this place. Buffet style with Asian/Indonesian cuisine on one side and American on the other. An array of freshly squeezed juices (guava, pineapple, tomato, strawberry, orange, apple.. etc), fruit, salads, meats and cheese (all kept in the fridge to keep cold and fresh), cereals - everything you could want.
------All staff were so sweet and friendly, always making sure you had everything you needed. Special shout out to the adorable omelet guy who always had a huge smile on his face, so charismatic and chatty - I don't even eat eggs but you can't help but notice how GOOD they looked! Everyone walked away from his station with big smiles on their faces. The man (who I think is the restaurant manager) was very attentive and kind as well, making sure you had everything you needed and that you were enjoying yourself.
- Pool side lunch was great.. highly recommend the pizza and the wedges. If I could take home a bottle of their sweet chilli sauce, I would. Pool side staff were great. By the way, 2pm-8pm happy hour (2 for 1 cocktails/beers)! :) :) :)
-Dinner was exceptional. Try the Carbonara pasta!!! To die for.

Spa...
- We had the traditional balinese massage and they were excellent! Very relaxing and worth it

Thank you to every smiling staff member for making this stay just the best."
3388,Beautiful resort,50,April 2015,"Spent 5 nights with my family here at the beginning of April, booked a 2 bedroom apartment which I have to say is the nicest accommodation I've had in Asia, rooms were tasteful , roomy and clean, and seviced well always extra towels and water available. The breakfast was good and my 2 boys loved it. The pool area was clean and well maintained my only complaint as many others have mentioned is pool lounges are all taken by 9am
and come midday half the resort is in the shade, my boys aged 10 and 12 also found it a bit boring as no pool activities like water polo etc . On the whole we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this resort as staff were lovely and the location was central"
3389,"Nice, modern hotel in Seminyak, Bali",50,April 2015,"Stayed at the Marriott Courtyard in Seminyak for a weekend. The hotel is modern style, clean, and has great service. The security at the entrance is kind of a pain, but also makes you feel good about safety. The pool area is nice to relax at, eat and drink between other Bali activities - 2 for 1 tropical drinks during happy hour (2pm-8pm) is a nice way to chill. The breakfast buffet was great too ... very crowded though with families in the morning. Overall, I'd recommend and would go back."
3390,Refreshing & Modern,50,October 2014,"Stayed with my daughters (aged 16 & 20) in October 2014. We all loved it. Normally stay at a sprawling ""bali feel"" resort with large grounds and lovely gardens but wanted to try something different. We were not disappointed. Loved the room - it was a little tight with three of us - but still comfortable. We had a pool view room and definitely recommend this as we spent time sitting on the balcony enjoying the atmosphere of the hotel. Breakfast was fantastic as many reviewers have already attested to.
Pool is the centrepiece of this hotel and is beautiful. We visited during WA school holidays and I have to agree with previous reviewers about shortage of sunbeds, however, when we approached a staff member they managed to sort something out. The pool side bean bags are also a good option and are as good as a sunbed. The GM Brad was very hands. The security process when entering the hotel is reassuring. For us the location was perfect being near eat street, beach, shops and spas. I give it a big thumbs up and have re-booked for June this year."
3391,Worth considering,40,April 2015,"Having stayed at The Stones it was difficult not to compare the two hotels. Check in was slow as it always seems to be when checking into hotels in Bali however both of our rooms were ready which was a plus. My sister booked a cheaper room and I am not sure it was worth my paying the extra for a pool view as her room looked in the same direction however had a garden view rather than a pool view. My understanding is though sometimes you can end up with a street view when booking the cheaper rooms.

* Lovely room, clean, good quality bedding and linen and good amenities
* Nice outlook and balcony
* Good variety of TV channels
* Great selection at breakfast plus good coffee (always a bonus)
* Friendly and attentive staff
* Excellent level of security
* Great location close to restaurants and spa's
* Nice pool x 2 although there is a lack of sunbeds in the sun and some of the ones in the shade are behind bushes
* Pools are small so can be crowded
* Buzzer system around pool so you can buzz for service (The Stones could do with this)
* Drink and food prices very high by Bali standards
* Small things for instance the toilet paper in the bathroom could be placed in a basket rather than just sitting there - particularly considering the cost of the room.
*Rooms can be noisy at night with music playing although for music lovers and late nighters this would not be an issue

What I preferred about the Stones was that the pool was bigger and more sun lounges (or so it appeared) and that there appeared to be more food and drinks available in the mid price range (snacks etc). Also the corridors at the Stones are air-conditioned and internal which is a plus. The location of the Courtyard though was excellent."
3392,Hidden Gem,50,March 2015,"This hotel was our last stop in Bali, close to the airport, before heading home. It was a pleasant surprise because the surrounding area does not predict what awaits you. The hotel is fairly new, sparkling clean and the staff is very helpful and accommodating. A room that opened out to the pool was most welcome. An extended happy hour, poolside was most welcome. Breakfast was a little noisy."
3393,Amazing!,50,April 2015,"I absolutely loved this resort. The staff was great, the pool was quiet and relaxing, the location was convenient (both near the beach and a walk-able distance to the Seminyak Square) and the breakfast buffet was to die for. I would hands down stay there again if I were to return to Bali. Even though it seemed like a family-oriented resort, it still felt intimate and romantic going as a couple. We arrived early and were allowed to check in hours before the stated check-in and they also let us stay past the stated check-out (we had a later flight). My only complaint is that we weren't able to stay for longer. I highly recommend this resort!! :)"
3394,A beautiful place,50,April 2015,"Myself and a few friends stayed at the Courtyard Marriott because of some recommendations from people we met whilst in Bali. This hotel would suit anybody couples, families, friends, solo, or business. The WIFI was of a higher standard than many other hotels in Bali.

The entire establishment is eye catching, and the rooms great for our needs. The pool is beautiful, the gym has what one would need whilst holidaying. They also have a ping pong table in the lobby for some fun, they do many different activities throughout the hotel including water aerobics, ping pong competitions, live acoustic music on Friday and Saturday nights, a popcorn machine for guests, icy poles brought pool side throughout the hot weather and all of this at NO extra cost.

If I had to be picky, the only thing I can think of was the fact that they served only a more expensive bottle of still water in the restaurant instead of the aqua brand we had become accustomed too.

Overall a great hotel, in a great location, great friendly staff with many many things offered to guests.

I would gladly return."
3395,Wonderful stay,50,April 2015,"We had a magnificent two day stay. We really enjoyed the tranquility of the hotel, everything contained around the beautiful pools and gardens. Breakfast was fantastic with the option of taking a table at the balcony. Super fast internet allowing us to conference call, skype and use multiple devices a day. Drivers were very friendly and always available, taking us down to downtown or Ubud, our next destination. A 5 min walk from the beach."
3396,Great hotel for families but pool staff could care more,40,April 2015,"This hotel has everything you'd expect from the courtyard brand. It's clean, secure, and in a good location. Nothing is too much of an issue and if you ask, they will generally respond. Service is a bit hit and miss but it's indonesia so just part and parcel. If you arrive by car, you go through a very thorough bomb check and when you physically leave and into the hotel, you go through a metal scanner. Without you go through the metal scanner depends on the person, sometimes they check you, sometimes they don't, and it Appears to depend on how you look. The breakfast is buffet and has a very good spread. The pool is busy, but it's very good to relax in.

Few things to note:
- getting a spot by the pool is a bit like the Hunger Games - made the best tribute win. Poolside staff do not care much, probably because they are so overworked, but particularly do not care about people leaving their stuff on the pool chairs, and then going elsewhere, depriving someone else of that chair. The chairs itself are not very sturdy so I'd be careful. My partner almost got injured when the support bit did not hook properly and promptly fell back, in front of a pool staff walking past, and he just smiled and promptly continued walking without offering any assistance. It is a very busy pool with lots of family
- Very ideal place for families, not so ideal for couples
- make sure you don't have high expectations other than knowing that it's a courtyard Marriott. For example, there is no turndown service unless you are VIP but they don't tell you how or what is defined by VIP

Overall a good stay as long as you have realistic expectations."
3397,Lovely,50,April 2015,"This a relatively new and beautifully maintained hotel, with a huge swimming pool and a really good and plentiful buffet breakfast. One comment, however, on some earlier reviews: Anyone who raves about the homemade bagels here has obviously never been to New York!"
3398,Lovely new hotel in great Seminyak location,40,March 2015,"The hotel is in a great location that is close to the beach, restaurants and shopping. They will even take you on a golf cart down to the beach which is handy for sunset cocktails! The pool is lovely with a swim up bar in the top pool and a kids pool at the bottom end. The service was excellent with staff bringing around fruit icy poles on hot days. The chairs around the pool go quickly with people reserving them early but we found they turn over during the day so it wasn‚Äôt an issue for us.

The restaurant is fantastic with an amazing selection of food available as part of the buffet breakfast. It is definitely one of the best that I‚Äôve ever seen. The juice selection, bagel bar and egg station were my favourite. We enjoyed a great dinner at the hotel as well. The head chef is from Sydney and made sure he spoke to customers.

The rooms all have a balcony or open up straight to the pool area. They are nicely decorated and have everything you need. Our shower was huge with a rain head or normal shower head option. The rooms are on the small side and lack room to store your luggage. The wifi and pay TV were included in the price.

We had spa vouchers as part of our luxury escapes deal. It was an amazing experience with great staff and lovely rooms. Make sure you book appointments at the start of your trip as there were lots of people wanting to use their vouchers.

Overall I would recommend the hotel if you want something that is close to all the action. Be mindful that this is not a Marriott set on a huge piece of land with lots of beautiful gardens. It is a multi-storey hotel that has the advantage of being close to everything. The hotel is not right in the heart of Seminyak so you need to get a taxi ($3-5) or take a long walk to get to eat street or Potato Head area."
3399,Superb family stay with 2 kids under 4,50,January 2015,"We had such a lovely stay at Marriott.

Breakfast was one of our daily highlights. It was available until 11am - another plus for us! There was a huge selection of pastries, bread, pancakes and even ice-cream and waffles!!! Winner! It was hard negotiating with our kid about why he couldn't just have ice-cream for brekky!

Housekeeping came by twice a day. It was so lovely to come back from our day trips / pool visits to a brand-new room! Staff was awesomely friendly! I don't know if it's just the Balinese friendliness, but we were always greeted with very warm smiles and ""Hello Madam. Good morning!""

The kid's club was great. BUT it's a bit of a bummer because our kids were 3.5 years and 1.5 years back then. Hotel guests get 2 hours of free babysitting at the kid's club for children 4 years old and above.

I tried to bargain with the staff that my boy turns 4 this year and he's actually pretty tall for his age, but they kept to their guns. If we wanted to use the kid's club, we would have had to stay with our kids.

And of course we'd rather do other things with them than to be stuck indoors playing with toys in Bali right?

We did hire a private nanny (outside the hotel) one afternoon though and that was how our kids managed to use the kids' club without us.

The kids LOVEEEEED the pool! And so did we. The kids' pools were shallow enough for Gabriel to walk around with his floaties and yet deep enough for Sammy to swim around in his goggles.

Water was nice and warm. Sometimes even too warm. But I ain't complaining here, since I'm used to much colder waters in outdoor swimming pools.

The pool bar had SUPERB cocktails and finger food. There was live music on certain days, so we were also pretty happy we stayed on a higher floor so that it wasn't too loud for us.

We stayed in a family suite so the kids had more space to run around the room. We had 2 TVs! One for the bedroom and one for the adjoining room. Our hotel room was located on a higher floor because we read the reviews that it can get pretty loud on the lower floors.

The only drawback was the smell of the water when we first turned on the shower. There was a distinct ""drain"" smell which got better after a few seconds. However, that would happen every time we turned on the tap. We got someone to repair it on the 3rd day and they came pretty promptly. However, on the 5th day when we wanted to check out, the smell of the water came back again. I think perhaps the management should do something to rectify this issue permanently.

Other than that one flaw, we had a very SUPERB stay there! Highly-recommended for anybody who is looking for a place to stay in Seminyak, Bali!"
3400,Fantastic Family Holiday Destination,50,April 2015,"Our family of four (2 adults and 2 kids 9 & 7) stayed for 7 nights in the Easter school holidays using a Luxury Escapes voucher.
From the minute we were collected from the airport, to being returned 8 days later, we had a ball at Courtyard Seminyak.
The facilities at the hotel were excellent. We enjoyed the extensive breakfast each morning at Seminyak Kitchen, as well as a number of other lunches and dinners. The cocktails at the pool bar were varied and delicious. The kids enjoyed the complimentary icy poles and popcorn served by the pool.
The staff at the Zanti Spa on site were knowledgable and we enjoyed our Balinese massages. The kids club was opened all day long and had a variety of activities.
We stayed in a pool view room and found the space was adequate for our family's needs. The beds were very comfortable and the rain shower was wonderful.
The staff at Courtyard Seminyak are amazing and we wished we could have thanked each and every staff member. Nothing was too hard for them and it was lovely to be greeted by name from all staff. Special mention to the wonderful staff at Seminyak Kitchen!
The high level of security set our minds at ease and we did not see this as a hinderance at all.
The location is perfect for a young family such as ours as it enabled us to explore the area without it being super busy, however there were still many shops and restaurants to explore just down the street.
We had a wonderful time here and are already planning our next trip. Keep up the wonderful standard!
Best Regards,
Andy, Elizabeth, Luca and Layla."
3401,Family of 4 Fantastic Stay,50,April 2015,"Family Holiday 2 adults + 2 children: Double Pool Access Room and then Jnr Suite .

Pros: New Hotel in a great Seminyak location between Kuta and Petitinget. Just 5mins walk to eat street and the beach. Superfast free WiFi. Kids Club that opens from early morning to 8pm, well equipped Gym, SPA and restaurant. Fantastic customer service from the moment you check in to check out. Good sized rooms for families, clean and well equipped. Pool Bar 2 for 1 happy hour seems to last all day **SMILE**. Live music from late afternoon onwards.

Cons: I really couldn‚Äôt find anything that put me off this hotel.

Tips: Avoid paying for a hotel car and take a taxi on the street. Negotiate your price if taxi doesn‚Äôt use the meter e.g. IDR 30-50k to Eat Street, IDR50-80k if going to Potatoe Head area. Cars and Mopeds can be hired just outside of the hotel. The hotel gym has bicycles available for use and it‚Äôs a nice bike ride to head up north of Canggu to see some surfing beaches.

Overall the hotel is great and we will stay there again."
3402,Great hotel,40,April 2015,"Very clean. Very safe.
Restaurant prices great.
They security check all vehicles and people coming in to the hotel. Other hotels have this set up but they are only pretending to do a check. The others do this to make their hotel look really safe for tourists.
Beautiful pool. Great staff. Only got 2 mozzie bites. Mozzies are around in october november, the wet season and lots of fruit and flies also are around then. April is the end of wet season. Only 1 shower in the arvo in 10 days for about 20mins.
I think we got the best located room, 246. At the end of pool away from the pool bar and live music so kids can still get to sleep and away from the main pool where people tend to make noise at night. King bed and can fit 1 extra bed for your child also connects with room 247 with 2 double beds. Fantastic pool view.
Only downside is the mouldy smell in the towels and linen and on the room curtains but you get that everywhere in bali.
But in summary i dont see the big deal about bali. You cant get anywhere without a driver or taxi. You can negotiate everything but it gets very tiresome and in the end you can get dresses and short for the same price at the end of season clearance sales in australia. There is rubbish just about everywhere as it is a bad habbit of theirs and the water sports at nusa dua are not really that safe. Finally the currency quite confusing at times. Be on the ball or you could loose a lot of money.
I say go to singapore. Clean safe Public transport really safe and easy to get anywhere."
3403,Lovely new hotel with super fast internet and great restaurant!,40,April 2015,"Stayed here for 8 days over Easter with our family.
Our kids loved the kids club and begged to go in each day, unusual as our kids normally hate kids clubs.
The rooms are pretty small but clean and modern, the bathrooms are huge though. We had interconnecting rooms on 6th floor and would recommend booking pool terrace rooms (rooms which have verandas opening up to the pool) on ground floor. Daily room servicing was great although some days was as late as 6pm.
Breakfast was sensational, had a huge choice of fresh produce. Nothing is a bother to the staff. Breakfast is served at Seminyak Kitchen which we ate lunch and dinner at several times as well, although a little pricey it is a great restaurant. The kitchen is open and you can watch your food being cooked in a very clean environment. Staff are extremely helpful.
We have stayed in Bali many times and have always had dreadfully slow internet, not so for this hotel, by far the speediest internet ever in Indonesia.
I would highly recommend this reasonably priced hotel for families."
3404,You will love this ...,50,March 2015,"We recently had a 7 night stay here in a pool access room The service is first class although there were a couple of minor hitches I'll detail later All rooms are located around a central pool area including a very well staged pool bar There are call buttons under beach umbrellas for pool bar service ,very convenient
Our room was serviced daily by he hotel staff who are respectful and polite On a very positive note all couples in our group is ten were given free resort massage vouchers , meals and cocktails an awesome package much appreciated by all
My only small gripes are ... My laundry took three days to be delivered back to my room even after being told is was ready 3 times! Over 3 days..
The hotel has system where you have to put credit from your credit card into a system where the hotel draws down on that credit unlike any other hotel I have stayed at where you pay your bill at the end of your stay
Not a big problem really but I was embarrassed In front of my friends when bar staff would not accept my signing of a meal bill so I had to pay in cash
I resolved this problem by depositing $500 dollars into my hotel account. Only to be told a few days later I had no credit again! So I had to interrupt my pool time to prove to front desk staff I had actually made the deposit. Lucky I had a receipt as proof . I found this practice strange to say the least. Surely Marriot can come up with something a little better . These small events marred a perfect stay."
3405,Great hotel,50,April 2015,"This is a great hotal in a great location.
We stayed for one night. Beautiful modern room and amazing breakfast choice. Lovely pool area and gym equipment. It was quite busy with families though so probably more ideal for people with children ."
3406,Excellent hotel,40,March 2015,"The Courtyard Marriott was on the whole an excellent choice for 10 days in Seminyak. Breakfast really good. Pool delightful following a move from a suite opposite the in pool bar where loud music emanated all day. Staff on the ball apart from one area (see below). Room above average with fine bathroom and bedding. Unit serviced well every day. In general very good apart from two problems.
1 The area in which this hotel is located is very commercial, very much like districts closer to the airport like Kuta. Good restaurants a $5 ride away and a few close.
2 The day we were leaving was a disaster. We had paid extra for a 6pm checkout. At 1pm, our phone rang to be told we had to check out at 2pm because of a Hindu festival which was closing the roads to the airport. We argued that we had booked the room until 6 with a 10.30 flight out. five phone calls later, we were assured we would be OK. One more phone call telling we had to leave at 2 infuriated me. Finally we were assured by a man at the front desk all was well for 6. In fact few roads were closed. We got to the airport well inside our departure time. A poor experience for an otherwise superior hotel."
3407,Good Hotel,30,April 2015,Stayed here for a couple of nights and although service was good the place lacks atmosphere. Pool area is small for the amount of guests and seevice not as friendly as some others. I prefer Breezes across the road.
3408,Great choice for families,50,April 2015,"I stayed here with my 25 year old daughter for a week over Easter. As we both work in schools in Australia, we holiday at the same time with many other Australian families. This hotel is a brilliant choice for a family holiday. The pool is fabulous and accessible from many ground floor rooms. We had a room on the sixth floor which was an excellent option for us, as we were away from most of the families with littlies. The restaurant staff, particularly at breakfast, are friendly and attentive. One morning there was a child who was making a fuss that the parents could not appease. A staff member scooped the child up and proceeded to continue clearing tables etc with a little helper under one arm. The child immediately stopped crying and the parents were able to relax. Win win for everyone!
The location of the hotel is really handy to many shops and restaurants. The beach with bars and restaurants is a short walk in one direction and fabulous shopping at the end of the road in the other direction. We enjoyed the daily water aerobics at the pool and the nightly live music at the pool bar area. Happy hour is from 2pm, which is a bonus.
We did have a problem with our showers being cold. The hotel was very busy and maybe the hot water was in short supply due to the demand. Minor problem, as the weather was warm and a cool shower wasn't dreadful, but a bit annoying first thing in the morning. Also, people had glass bottles in the pool, which bothered us with small children jumping in and out of the water.
In conclusion, this is a very hip hotel, well priced and offers great service. it is well suited to young people and families."
3409,A Magical Anniversary,50,April 2015,"We stayed at this holiday for 8nights to celebrate our 1 Year Anniversary. We can't praise this hotel enough.
The staff there are so wonderful, helpful and understanding. Special thanks to Ray, Cindy and Melinda on the front desk. They ensured a smooth check in and check out. Also thanks to staff at the restaurant who always had a smile on their faces. Thank you to Juliar and the manager (sorry I can't remember your name). So lovely and caring.
I cannot thank Muliani (head of housekeeping) enough. Hubby and I had a wedding shoot and she ensured my dress ( which is pretty big) was pressed prior to the shoot and cleaned to perfection afterwards. It's the special touches she did which really made our holiday so special. Muli arranged a beautiful bouquets for me prior to the shoot and ensured we had a magical stay.
My husband arranged an anniversary surprise which the hotel arranged with a beautiful bouquet of flowers, hand written card and a delicious cake.
We stayed in a one bedroom suite 539, very spacious, super clean (thanks to house keeping staff, Dwi) and furthest away from the music at the pool bar.
The location of the hotel is great as you can try different local restaurants and it's only a 5minute walk to the beach. However, the hotel does provide a buggy to the beach too! We could see the beautiful sunset every day.
We loved the buffet breakfast each morning. A good variety of food and absolutely delicious.
We had dinner and room service at the hotel on a few occasions.The standard of the food was always excellent!
I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and return again in the future.
The only con I can say about this hotel is that there are not enough sun loungers by the pool. So some days I spent the whole morning in the room, which was nice too so I can't complain.
The Spa is a MUST! We booked prior to going as I read on trip advisor that a lot of people couldn't get an appointment as it gets booked up quite fast. We made two trips to the Spa. Really enjoyed the stress relief massage!!!
Thank You to everyone for making our 1st Anniversary so memorable."
3410,EXCELLENT,50,April 2015,"i am currently staying at the Courtyard Marriott, in a one bedroom suite, with my husband and son, we arrived on Monday and are here for 10 days. I can honestly say that i would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff are amazing, friendly courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms are serviced twice daily and exceptionally clean. The pool rivals any 5 star pool resort with three separate pool areas. The only thing missing is a beach view, although the beach itself is only a 5 minute walk. I cannot fault this hotel and i have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world. This one is up there with the best. Donna Bird"
3411,Bali Hi!,50,March 2015,"What a wonderful hotel and staff! Most impressive were the staff, from Ade to Hardi to Maria, all at the front desk, to the GM Brad himself. Helped us with touring info, restaurant choices, and general hotel services. No wonder it received all the accolades from previous visitors. We would recommend this location to anyone visiting this part of Bali. Great pool area, but get there early as chairs go fast throughout the day."
3412,Wonderful hotel,50,April 2015,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for eight nights over the Easter break and it was brilliant. The staff were exceptional throughout our stay, and the location of the hotel is ideal for access to the great local bars and restaurants.

Great pool area with a swim-up bar serving plenty of cocktails and nice food.

Can't fault it, and would definitely return!"
3413,Great place to stay,50,April 2015,"Staying here at the courtyard Marriott right now and it's awesome .. From the staff to the service , amenities and the food everything is just perfect .. Markets and restaurants at your doorstep and staff will go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect .. The rooms are suitable size for any needs and the bathrooms are lovely with a rain shower .. Don't hesitate to stay here best choice ever !!"
3414,Great stay,50,January 2015,"Stayed here with friend for holiday occasion. Starts the beginning, very friendly security guards greeted us followed by nice front desk staff ready to help us for check in. Lobby is simply comfortable and nice too. Room is lovely. Clean, modern, nice overlooking pool. Bar staff at the pool was also friendly and always ready to served us. Overall stay was really nice. Ups, almost forgot, breakfast is so good, good job Food team and Kitchen team. Look forward to come back again."
3415,Totally wonderful hotel - fabulous!,50,April 2015,"As an expat in Singapore we are lucky enough to experience some great hotels and this really is a keeper!

A warm welcome, chilled towels and refreshing tea and healthy artisan ice lollies for the children. Our room was perfectly appointed for our needs, clean and modern with direct pool access - the children were ecstatic!! They wasted no time to mingle with new friends and to enjoy the complimentary popcorn whilst perched on a stool in the swim up bar - heaven!

Breakfast has everything you could wish for with lots of pleasing choices for the children and wonderful fresh healthy options for me!

We also love the location which is great and just a short walk from great restaurants spas beach etc.

The service and friendliness of this hotel is second to none which is why we can't help return!

A huge thanks to Brad and his sensational team!"
3416,Lovely new hotel in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"A lovely hotel in Seminyak, conveniently located close to wonderful dining & shopping. Beautiful clean rooms overlooking a pretty pool, with amazing & friendly staff - nothing is too much trouble, and a fantastic breakfast to be leisurely enjoyed each day. Love the floating beanbags in the pool, and the treatments in Zanti Spa are professional and thoroughly enjoyable. The courtesy buggy to nearby hair & nail salons was very much appreciated!"
3417,Amazing!,50,April 2015,"Great hotel, amazingggg breakfast, found out was only opened in August 2014 so you can imagine very clean and modern! Rooms are great, staff friendly and very helpful. Cannot recommend this hotel enough, close to beach, maybe just under a 5 min walk? About 20 min walk from Seminyak square, but so cheap to get a taxi everywhere. Love this hotel!!!!!"
3418,Wonderful Stay,50,April 2015,"We stayed 2 nights here and were very impressed by the service and the hotel in general. All the staff we spoke to were polite, friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and comfortable, no issues at all. The pool was fantastic! A lot of reviews said there was not enough day beds or room to sit, this was not the case during our stay. Food and drinks at the pool bar were fantastic as was breakfast each morning. Hotel was in the perfect location, roughly a 5 min walk to the beach, close to shops and quite enough not to hear much traffic. We would recommend this hotel and would return again, should we decide to stay in Seminyak."
3419,Fantastic stay!,50,April 2015,"Highly recommended. We all loved the hotel and would happily return to stay there.

Everyone we met were so friendly and helpful including the guards at the metal detector who always had lovely smiles on their faces. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, from changing a travel cot for an extra bed without any extra charge to getting a beanbag for us when no sun loungers were available.

We had a pool side view and we enjoyed using the seating area on the balcony. Before we booked, we were a bit worried that the room might be too snug for the three of us but it was fine even with an extra bed. The room could have done with a few hooks to hang towels etc though.

Breakfast was great and there were lots to choose from both Western and Eastern cuisine.

Special mention should be made about the staff at Kids Club who put on a few activities for the children on Easter Sunday. Our child went to the Club to meet the Easter Bunny briefly. The Club had little presents for all the children including our child who was delighted to be given a present as she was only there for a brief moment.

Location was fine although it is a bit of a walk to the Seminyak Square area and Eat Street (Jalan Laksamana). There is a hotel buggy (free) to bring you to the beach or Eat Street if you don't fancy a walk (quite energy sapping in the Balinese heat).

There is a supermarket opposite which is open until 2am which is handy for provisions. We can recommend Mozarella Restaurant and Lucky Day Restaurant as well as the Ku De Ta Beach Club which we enjoyed using. We heard that the hotel is in the process of building a beach club which would be the icing on the cake as the pool and swim up bar is just great. I also had a massage at the Spa which was lovely and relaxing.

The only slightly disappointing aspect for me was our experience at check in. I had understood from other reviews that we would receive refreshments (welcome drink and ice lollies for the children) on arrival but that was not our experience. Perhaps we were booked under a different package but that would have a really lovely touch."
3420,Best hotel aeouns,50,April 2015,"Our friends mum got this deal for us and wow! We got way more than we bargained for - definitely what you think 5* service is anywhere in the world. Very clean and very high standards everywhere. The breakfast buffet is to absolutely die for - the 3 of us would be thinking about it the night before!!! Very family friendly from what we could see as it was full of young families and the pool bar was fantastic! The cocktails were so so so good - just beware of the taxi, it's basically all alcohol!!! Fantastic staff as well, they are so friendly and love to have a nice chat!"
3421,hotel,50,April 2015,stayed 5 nights lovely rooms very modern & clean but only fault with hotel not really close to beach or shopping & the hotel lacks atmosphere big time very sterile need better activities with guests & cooler places to eat in hotel
3422,"Great value, comfy bed & good breakkie spread",40,April 2015,"Stayed at Courtyard Marriott Seminyak for a workshop from 31 March to 3 April.

The good:
Efficient check in with nice reception, welcome and fruity ice lollies!
New, modern & spacious room with comfortable beds.
Bathroom is spacious with adequate amenities.
Breakfast spread was good, can actually order cappuccino, latte on top of local coffee.
Waffles with ice cream is a nice treat.
Pool & bar was really nice, love the happy hours & super chill!
Location is not bad with lotsa spa, shops and restaurants nearby.

The not so good:
My room was facing the road on a low floor, I could hear the security!
House keeping can be improved, did not replenish tissue, shower cap & sanitary bags.
5 mins to the beach via bugy, ended up not visiting the beach at all.

In summary, I would recommend and don't mind staying here again."
3423,Modern hotel,40,March 2015,"Found travelzoo voucher for this new modern hotel & was very pleased with our stay. Had pool view room & was impressed with layout & facilities. Plenty of choice for breakfast, especially loved the ice cream bar. Resort had golf buggy to shuttle you to eat street, beach & shops. Pool area large with fantastic bean bags to float your day away listening to live music & eating free popcorn, washed down with a yummy cocktail. Location was great near plenty of restaurants, beach & massage spas, which is what I like to do in Bali. Excellent security as you enter hotel."
3424,Excellent Hotel,50,March 2015,"An excellent hotel in almost all respects. The lobby looked deceptively simple and stark but the rooms were superb, the breakfast excellent, the staff so very helpful and courteous. A good location though not overlooking the beach. Has its own enormous pool. Ideal for families with small children. Very good food - both in range and quality. Free Wi Fi, free local 'phone calls, taxi on call at the reception - we felt very much at home!"
3425,Great for kids,40,March 2015,"We have just returned from 7 nights at the Courtyard with our 2 year old Granddaughter. We booked a pool terrace room (room 145) at the kids pool end of the complex, this is the best area to be with kids. The pool starts just deep enough for a two year old to walk in and then goes up and deeper in sections that are walled this really helps when chasing the two year old and gave us time to catch her before she jumped in the deep section. The kids club is also located here and is very clean and caters for kids of all ages. The Spa is wonderful but the one small problem is its location by the pool bar, I was having a lovely relaxing massage when pool aerobics started and the noise just engulfed the roof, might I suggest they consider noise cancelling head phones to put on clients during these times as it is VERY distracting. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great. Overall its a lovely place to stay."
3426,Amazing new hotel experience!,50,March 2015,"This was my first trip to Bali ever, we grabbed a deal from the 'luxury escapes' so was not sure what to expect.... Well ! The hotel is only 6 months open and the rooms and grounds were beautiful, the room maybe needed more room for 2 suitcases but only a minor issue. The service staff at the pool bar and the restaurant for all our meals were polite, efficient and well versed in western hospitality. The Daily breakfast buffet was an amazing range of everything you could imagine. the location is away from the full on busy areas but still close to everything. Thank you from 345"
3427,Nice for stop over,40,March 2015,"Stayed one night after a relaxing stay in amed.
Quick check in, lovely staff, nice room, large hotel but pretty quiet.
Had the most amazing breakfast, best ever!!!
Close to beach, security. Cocktails bit expensive! Nice pool bar with lovely staff."
3428,"Breakfast soso, hotel perfect",50,April 2015,"Perfectly located hotel, with great and friendly staff... All very clean and the rooms are also fine.

Only thing i feel worth mentioning is that the afternoon pool music is quite loud to hear in the room... But i guess no one in bali is there to sleep in the afternoon in their room.

Definitely coming back"
3429,Excellent!,50,March 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak last week for 7 nights & thoroughly enjoyed everything! Firstly, as others have mentioned, the service & friendliness of the staff is 5 star. Across the board, every staff member we encountered was genuinely happy to see you & chat with you about how your day/experience was going. This made us feel very welcome & relaxed & our 11 yr old daughter was even learning some Indonesian from a few of the restaurant staff who we would see every day at breakfast & took the time to teach her new things each day!
The food was always top notch, especially the complimentary dinner which didn't skimp on anything. The breakfast was an impressive buffet with lots of choices. We enjoyed the pool each afternoon although we usually had trouble finding a free lounge by that time as Happy Hour at the pool bar started at 2pm & went til 9pm (wow!) No problem though because the giant floating beanbags were more comfy & fun anyway.
Our room was very new & clean, always fresh towels & bottled water each day. Wifi was excellent, no drop outs anywhere in the hotel. The shower was large & had great water pressure, a small thing that matters to me!
The complimentary massages in the Day Spa were awesome! My second one was with Nadia & was one of the best I've had anywhere. Their homemade ginger tea at the end was delicious too!
The golf buggy at reception was a great idea for dropping you down the street to the beach if you didn't feel like walking (only 5 mins walk but a lot of taxi operators hassle you along the way). We loved heading down around 6pm to watch the sunset each evening before going out to dinner. There is a Star Mart store right across the road from the hotel if you need snacks or incidentals. I noticed they also sell beer.
We totally loved our stay at the Marriott & would definitely book again!"
3430,"Gourmet Breakfast, Best Sleep, Overkill on Security",50,March 2015,"Great location, right on the corner of Jalan Drupadi and Jalan Camplung Tanduk. Great restaurants and eateries on Drupadi and it takes you onto 'eat street' Jl. Kayu Aya.
On arrival I was given a complimentary drink, cold towel and a frozen fruit popsicle.
Check in was quick and easy. Staff were polite and professional. They showed me to my room.
My room was very quiet. The best sleep I've had in a hotel in Bali or anywhere in the world actually. For example I didn't hear anyone walking past the room nor doors being shut. Bed was very comfortable as was the air conditioning. Loved the rain shower. The shampoo/shower gel etc were very nice!
Thank you for the chocolate dipped Macaron's and chocolate dipped strawberry. A very nice touch!
The switch on the bed lamp was broken which meant I couldn't turn off the light. A quick call to reception and 2 maintenance guys attended within 10 minutes and fixed the switch. They worked quietly and professionally.
Wifi was free and super fast.
Breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen was possibly the best in Seminyak. True gourmet. Bagel station with all the toppings including salmon and cream cheese. Eggs Benedict!! The range of dishes from western to Asian was extensive. Don't miss out on this!! Customer service was really good. The restaurant manager even appeared and made sure I was being served while waiting at the egg station.
The fitness centre was adequate and provided myself with a much needed workout. It is open 24 hours too, so if you need to do a workout at say 1am then you just use your room card to swipe yourself in. Water bottles and towels are provided.
My second night I had an upset stomach, which I've since realised was due to the food I ate on my airline (as I got sick again after my flight home). So rather than risk going out I ordered a Nasi Goreng from room service. Food arrived within 30 minutes and it would have to be one of the best Nasi Goreng's I've ever had. It was a truly gourmet version. Thank you!!
Check out was very quick and easy.
The only annoying factor at Courtyard is the overkill on security. Every time you walk back to the hotel you have to walk through the security scanner and your shopping goes through the bag scanner. It's like having to go through airport security twice a day. :( I witnessed a few guests getting really annoyed at this. I don't blame them.
However I highly recommend staying at this hotel. If you want great food and good sleep (who doesn't) and location location then this hotel is for you."
3431,That pool!,50,March 2015,"First time in Bali and this was the first place we stayed. Having travelled quite a bit we were very impressed with the hotel. Excellent service, clean and good sized rooms, and a huge two storey pool with swim up bar. 5 minute walk to the beach, live band at their bar each night, and the buffet breakfast was superb. Had a great time there."
3432,"Love the hotel, great location, everyone happy.....",50,March 2015,"We have been here for 4 days and are loving it, we looked the reviews and recommendations on trip advisor before booking but here's what I've got to say...

We upgraded our room from a twin to a pool terrace suite as reviews said rooms were on the small side, and it's given us just what we need. The one bedroom suite is not huge but consideraby bigger than the twin rooms, suite is big enough for us, we don't spend that much time in there anyway . We love the convenience of being right beside the pool. The staff are nice and friendly, the food is good, breakfast is plentiful with lots of choice for either western or Asian food, pool bar food is also good and reasonably priced, we've had dinner in seminyak kitchen the upstairs restaurant which is nice and not too pricey. We've also had a massage at the spa, it was included in our package, lovely and relaxing but if you are paying its considerably more that you would pay up the street.

Having kids we wanted to be nearer the kids pool at the far side of the resort rather than near the pool bar as people said bar is noisy, but it's not, there is music playing all day but it's not blaring and people with no kids tend to be at the bar and those with kids at the other end near kids pool but I wouldn't say its too noisy or inconvenient. There is aqua aerobics in the pool mid morning.

The issue of sunbeds that people previously mentioned is probably the biggest gripe. We are up early in the mornings so to not an issue for us but as people mentioned there are books and towels left to bag a sun lounger very early then disappeaing for hours and by mid morning there are no sun loungers to go round and people are getting frustrated as there are lots of empty beds with books and nobody around. This morning the pool man came and moved them all. There are now also floating beanbags available too, they are great but there's not enough of them either a couple more would be great.

Having been to bali many times, you don't come to seminyak/legian/kuta for the beaches, they are not beautiful white sand beaches like Thailand, however it's not far to the beach turn right outside the hotel and it's 2-3 minutes walk. Other reviews have said the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and that it's noisy. Bali is noisy, there are motorbikes everywhere, that's just bali, there are shops and spas, caf√©s and bars immediately outside the hotel or turn left and a 5 minute walk takes you to Jalan Raya seminyak, the Main Street where there is everything you would want.

We are defiantly enjoying our time here and the kids have already asked if we can come back next time."
3433,10 th Wedding Anniversary - Renewal of Vows,50,March 2015,"We recently visited the Courtyard Mariott to renew our vows for our 10th wedding Anniversary. The staff & wedding coordinator Via were absolutely amazing. It only took a few emails to design the celebration & choose from a stunning list of decorations. Once there, the staff made us feel extremly welcome & made sure all our needs were met. After a few days of relaxation at the resort spa, by the pool & on the beach our celebration took place. It was seamless. Beautifully presented & I would say even more special than our first wedding 10 years ago. We all had a great time ! The Decorations & flowers were beautiful & the Indonesian pastor added a nice mix of humour & seriousness to the celebration. A truly wonderful way to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.

All of the hotel staff are well trained, very professional & friendly. The hotel itself is well designed, with most rooms overlooking the pool & gardens. Live music fills the place every afternoon from 5-8pm which adds to the relaxed feel of the hotel. The buffet breakfast is amazing & evening menu a good mix of yummy especially the desserts creme br√ªl√©e is Devine. Our children enjoyed the kids club with hourly activities including face painting, kids yoga, learning Indonesian, mask making, outdoor games & much more.

If your travelling to seminyak & you want a hotel with it all then the courtyard mariott will not disappoint."
3434,Let down after 1 main incident,20,March 2015,"I recently stayed at the hotel with friends

Pros.

Nice pool, all staff fantastic, great rooms, close to beach,

Cons.

No-one in the hotel told us about the new year until friday afternoon at 4pm even after asking about it every day this is unacceptable considering we were not allowed out of the hotel this is something the hotel should have told all residents either before they come or when they check in.

we also had an unfortunate incident on the friday night we had friends in the hotel for dinner and they ordered the curry which was pretty much coloured water with no substance to it we returned it and watched as the chef put it back in a wok and add more ingredients and serve it to another customer the manager did his best to fix the situation though.

We also had different things said to us at check-in with regards to discounts etc but when we went to use them they said they did not exist.

Would consider staying here again but we were put off by the food situation this resulted in two of us not eating on the saturday and we left on the sunday.

Not what you expect from a marriott"
3435,"When the chips are down, you learn a lot about a hotel.",50,March 2015,"My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak last week. Our first full day in Bali was Nyepi Day. It's challenging for any hotel to keep its guests happy while confined to the property for the day - but the staff were wonderful and no one seemed to mind being ""locked in"". The day after Nyepi, we ventured outside to check out Seminyak and to change some money. And we were seriously scammed by a money changer! We've travelled a lot; and this scammer was so good, we never saw what he did or how he did it, but we realised sometime later that we'd been unmistakenly ripped off. In deciding what to do about it, we elected to discuss it with the hotel manager to get some local advice. The Duty Manager, Shashank Sinha, listened to our story and referred us to the hotel's Security Supervisor, John, who was far more hopeful of a positive outcome than we were. To cut a long story short, John followed the trail and got our money back for us! The money changer came to the hotel the following morning to apologise to us and give us back the money he'd scammed. Amazing!

This hotel cares, its staff go the extra mile, and they treated us like family. Yes, the rooms are lovely and they overlook the beautiful pool. The food is wonderful thanks to Chef Billy and his staff, and the restaurant and bar folks are personable and engaging. The in-house spa is uber relaxing. But when you're away from home and you've been wronged - and your host cares enough to fix it - that's a big wow.

Does customer service get any better than this? Not in my book."
3436,Great location and family environment,40,March 2015,"Once you are inside the courtyard you don't notice the street madness at all. We arrived at around 11pm and was a bit worried when we drove by all the colorful nightclubs on the same street as the hotel. But once we passed the security at the hotel, it was peaceful and quite. Lovely room, lovely shower with natural lights and roomy balcony. One thing missing was a drying rack for the swimwear. The small handle bar on the wall of the balcony was good for only one swimsuit. I saw that others were hanging their swimsuits on the balcony railing which is not so appealing.
Our family had a great time hanging out at the pool - swimming and relaxing in the shade. Unfortunately, it was too hot and sunny at the swim up pool bar (no shade).
There are many cafes and different kinds of restaurants within walking distance."
3437,"The best service ever in a new, quality hotel, ideal for any traveller.",50,March 2015,"Traditionally we have preferred resorts to hotels, but this was a fabulous experience from start to finish. The room we were initially allocated was near a busy area of the hotel so upon requesting a change, this was immediately done - no questions. My wife and I stayed in a pool view room for 7 nights, and although slightly on the small side, it was clean and comfortable. The hotel has been open for less than a year so everything works and is in great condition. The quality and assortment of food for breakfast was excellent. There was a wide range of nationalities staying here - of all ages, families, couples and retirees.
The pool was large, clean and at the perfect temp.
Brad, the GM was out and about meeting people, and at one stage we saw him wiping down the bar at poolside. He comes across as generous in his nature.
Billy, the exec chef was always visible and enjoyed meeting people. His quality of food is very good, as his his team. Of note is a young man called Julian who remembered your name and was very attentive to any needs. He was impressive and loved his job.
On our last day, a staff member in the restaurant asked me ""is there anything else that I can do for you?"". This was the essence if our experience at this hotel.Nothing was too much trouble, service with a genuine smile.
Live music by the pool every night and half price cocktails made it worth staying in. The price of food was very reasonable, although drinks are almost on par with Aussie prices. The location of the hotel is perfect if you want entertainment, restaurants, massages or transport, and only a minute or so on the free shuttle buggy to the beach. They have a kids club and a calendar of different activities including a fully equipped gym.
This place is a gem and well worth a look. If you found fault here, then you're too hard to please or your happy to pay double elsewhere. Great value, nice people, good quality, ideal location, what more....,?"
3438,New hotel with lots of smiley staff,50,March 2015,"This is a new hotel.The de luxe resort room is attractive and a good size in muted colours with a beautiful canvas print of a paddy field above the bed. The bed itself is very comfortable with nice linen. The bathroom has the usual amenities.
Security is very strict each time you enter the hotel...just like an airport with the X-ray and walk through scanner. Our car when we arrived was subject to search with sniffer dog and mirror as well as visual search under the bonnet and trunk.
The food has been excellent. Lots of western choices as well as Asian food for all meals . We eat at the hotel all the time although there are many restaurants nearby that look good.
The pool is pleasant , the sun lounges comfy and pool service for meals or drinks is delivered with a smile. There is plenty of shade by the pool and lots of towels available.
It's a short walk to the beach. Icy poles are served at the pool in the morning and popcorn at the pool terrace in the afternoon . There's lots of big kids enjoying both items.
We have thoroughly enjoyed our week stay here and are delighted to recommend it to others who want a laid back holiday ."
3439,Nice new hotel!,40,March 2015,"As we were over in Bali for a Wedding, decided we would spend our final day/night at the new Courtyard by Marriott.

Check in was a breeze and after entering our room found the room to be nice. Good size bed and nice bathroom, only thing is the window with curtains to the bathroom (understand to watch tv from the bath) may not appeal to all as well as the see through toilet door.... Frosted door would be the go!

The pool area is amazing, great pool bar and good set up, very happy with this area. Breakfast is also amazing, something for everyone and really like the look of the kitchen, the wood look is stunning.

The customer service and the friendliness of the staff was great, everyone was so nice.

Overall, would definitely come back."
3440,Fantastic stay,50,March 2015,"We are Staying few nights during Nyepi day at the hotel. The room was so good, especially the balcony, where I can see the activity from the pool and enjoying my cigarettes.

The Bar has an special deal during that day, with almost 6 hours happy hour, with kind of selected cocktails and Beers, kept me drinking and enjoying my time during that day :)

The Breakfast was stunning, with various cold cut and cheese, Ice cream and variety of food from local and International.

The overall stay was really nice and looking forward to stay back at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak"
3441,Thank you...,50,February 2015,"Before i get started with this review, i'd like to thank all the people working at the hotel. They made my travel perfect. It's not been a while since i left there. But i already miss all the good memories. Last yeat i was under a lot of stress so I just headed to Bali for refreshing myself. I chose 'Courtyard by Marriott Bali Semynyak' because I had heard that the hotel was built lately so i thought it would be clean. Yeap it was really spick and span. But the most impressive thing was the people with beautiful smile at the hotel. They were very sweet and gentle. The guys at the restaurant and the bar, the security guys, people who cleaned my room clearly anyway everyone i met. I'm sorry that i can't remember all their names. They treated me as a close friend sometimes made me feel that I'm a very valuable person. And they gave me many good information about sightseeing and good restaurants and so on. So i could enjoy whole time with good experiences. I think i fell in love with them especially guys Muhtar and Cindy at the hotel front desk. They are so sweet and professional at the same time. If i get the chance to go to Bali, i will choose the mariott seminak again for sure. And i bet no one will regret."
3442,Cannot fault this gorgeous brand new hotel,50,February 2015,"We spent 5 nights in a pool view room and loved our spacious bathroom with rainfall shower, huge king bed and gorgeous little balcony overlooking the pool. Our room was serviced daily and always left looking immaculate.

The breakfast is a buffet heaven! Spectacular spread of western and Indonesian dishes. Coffee is drinkable but not great, then again bali isn't really known for it's good coffee!

An absolute highlight of our stay was of course the beautiful pool with it's swim up bar. The drinks at the bar, whilst definitely on the pricey end, were to die for. I could literally live on those passionfruit mojitos!!!!!!!

The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Security is excellent.

Location of the hotel is good - not heaps of great restaurants within walking distance but taxi rides are quick and cheap.

The Courtyard is excellent value for money and I would definitely stay here again!!!!!!"
3443,"Hotel was fantastic, but the room service wasn't up to par.",40,December 2014,My husband and I stayed here for our 2014 Christmas vacation. For the most part we absolutely loved it - the breakfast was especially good and we enjoyed the pool side bar. The only negative thing I can say is about room service - it would take a long time to arrive and when it did arrive it was sometimes cold and sometimes they would forget something like a side order and we would have to call the front desk again.
3444,Excellent value,50,March 2015,"Spent a few nights here in March. This hotel is new having opened in the last year. It is excellently located in a quiet street in Seminyak within easy reach of the beach, shops and restaurants. However the best thing about the hotel is the staff. They are simply wonderful. Brad the General manager and Billy the Chef deserve special mention for the way they take time to speak to the guests and make sure they have everything they need for their stay."
3445,Will not be back nor recommend.,30,March 2015,"Rooms are quite small facing either very noisy roads or the pool area. Few issues with housekeeping forgetting towels, leaving dirty dishes in room after cleaning it, etc.

Pool area has no-where near enough sun lounges. Given the hotel is so remote and not close to a nice beach, you were left stranded with no-where to go as all sun lounges taken by 9am. Service next to the pool poor. Staff do not respond to the service buttons being pressed. This is frustrating when you can see them standing joking around or doing nothing. Service (when it eventually comes) is poor with incorrect orders, no cutlery or napkins provided.

Breakfast is good, very busy with some waiting time, but I would say the friendliness of staff in this area of the hotel was the best.

Concierge - we had a terrible experience with concierge. At one stage, the concierge allowed an external taxi driver to come in and pick a fare from the list! We had been promised a taxi, however when there was a couple that needed to go further, our taxi was given to them. When we questioned concierge, he told us we could go out onto the road to get our own taxi! Ridiculous!

Inconsistency with the ""security"" scanner at the front entrance is a joke. Not all guests are scanned, and staff are not appropriately trained to deal with guests who are on the phone and do not go through the scanners - what is the point?!

Location - if we had known how far this hotel was from decent restaurants and shopping we would not have stayed here."
3446,Unimpressed,20,March 2015,"Numerous issues with this new built hotel of the Marriot fame! Part of a large group and most of us complained about the noise from the front and side rooms. The sliding doors made of thin glass, no attempt at sound proofing.

House keeping always forgetting something in the room such as replacement tea bags or ballpoint pen. Cupboard also in bathroom, not suitable with high humidity.

Breakfast was very average, with all cold stuff (milk, juice, fruit etc) in one large fridge, resulting in a traffic jam as only one person can access the fruit at once. I stood behind a small woman, who could not reach the top shelf. The fruit was not fully ripe either.

They also installed a ridiculous security system whereby even if you come into the hotel in your swimming trunks, you have to go through a scanner. Every day I played a game by pretending to be on my mobile phone, deep in conversation, and by-passed the scanner and the security guys. Funny to watch their faces, not sure what to do.

The pools are jammed between the buildings, with no real open space. The pool side bar is in direct sun and very hot, with ceiling fans far to high up to be effective.

Curious who manages this place. However, 5 stars to the staff (not managers) who were sweet and polite."
3447,"Fantastic hotel, will stay again",50,March 2015,"Breakfast to die for, many choices of food, Indonesian or Western.
Bagels are my favourite ,cream cheese and smoked salmon.
Great coffee each morning.
Hotel location great close to restaurants, Bintang supermarket,(15 minute walk) spas.
Walking distance to the beach(hotel provides shuttle to beach)can walk along boadwalk , restrauants, beachside cafes, hotels.
Great exercise activities, my sister and I did Aqua aerobics, every morning.Some mornings only the two of us.
Tried yoga(need to pay for this) power walking, my sister did treadmill and stretching.
Would like to thank Gym instructors,especially Jacka, Merti ,Widi for a great Aqua classes,and all the instructors, you made our trip so enjoyable.
All the hotel staff so friendly and helpful.Every night we ordered ice bucket to our room, staff lovely.
My husband and I changed rooms to be near my sister, room very noisy facing onto street opposite Breezes Resort, we asked and staff changed our room to the quiet side.
Delux room lovely,bathroom has rain shower plus normal shower.
Fantastic lighting in room,don`t have to lie at strange angle to see pages of the book you are reading.
Taxi ride to Eats Street in Seminyak(lots of up market places to eat).
Short taxi ride to Discovery Mall.
Band plays every night,by poolside bar, you can hear music, not intrusive.
We all loved this hotel.
Will stay again."
3448,a week in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"A somewhat oasis in the middle of quite a run down area , but if your going to Bali then you will thoroughly enjoy this gem . Bali is Bali ! if you have been there you will understand the haves the have not's , its all part of the S E Asia experience.
The Marriot was much more than I expected , the rooms where good , great bathrooms , and all facing inwards towards the pools and gardens , not much point facing out as there's not much to see . the staff where fantastic the service was excellent the food was great ,what else is there to say , you will not be disappointed ."
3449,Was ok but wouldn't stay again,30,March 2015,"For what you pay you get a shoe box for a room, smallest balcony and no cupboard space for two people. The room size terrible but amenities ok.
What we found more disappointing was you had to line up and wait for breakfast, hardly ever got a sun bed or had to wait and we could never get a booking into the spa, always booked out. We checked out early. Compared to the double six where we are now is absolutely amazing, always sun beds, always appointments for the spa and the room is huge!!"
3450,Can't go wrong!,50,March 2015,"Last minute decision to extend our trip to Bali and booked two extra nights at the Marriott. From the moment we arrived it was clear the service was going to be first class and it didn't disappoint. All of the staff are professional and incredibly welcoming which gives this hotel a real positive vibe.
The breakfast is outstanding and we ate each morning out on the deck which is fantastic and cool, overlooking the street that leads to the beach only a few steps down the road.
We spent some time relaxing by the pool and had no trouble finding a lounge near the pool bar. The bar staff were fantastic and great fun ensuring we were well hydrated!!
Just myself and my wife this visit celebrating an anniversary, but definitely coming back to this hotel with our kids later in the year.
Great location, great value, great vibe!
Thanks to Brad and the Marriott team"
3451,Safety is #1,50,February 2015,"When our driver turned into the driveway of Marriott Hotel in Seminyak, we were caught by surprise how strict the hotel was in taking steps to screen the car both by human and a guard dog to ensure safety. That's not the end, we have to walk through the metal detector and our luggage has to be ex-rayed too just like at the airport. We were alright with that for safety reasons.

Overall the hotel is nice, room is comfortable and buffet breakfast served at the restaurant has good selections of local and western spreads. Location wise, it's less than 10 minutes walk both towards the beach or the other direction to town center where you can find lots of cafes and shopping."
3452,Highly recommend,50,March 2015,"We stayed at CY as a group of 4 friends, overall the experience was wonderful & I would highly recommend go anyone.

We had an overall positive experience with lovely rooms, friendly service & awesome pool area. I also really liked the high security and amazing food at breakfast and by the pool bar. Unfortunately the day spa was fully booked so we didn't get to experience it but Spa Bali around the corner and down the road is fantastic. Tony who checked us in was very friendly and efficient, even when an error had occurred with our booking.

Unfortunately we did experience a few minor issues, but this wouldn't take away from a 5 star experience. We had requested and been told we were booked in a pool side room, on arrival to find out we were level 6 & no pool side rooms were available. Also asked for twin share, only to share a king bed (2 friends in the room). The size of the bed was massive so we just left it as is.

The only other issue was the reserving on pool beds, it was annoying seeing the same gear 'set up' with no owners for nearly the whole day while we couldn't get a bed.

Don't bother taking a knife to cut fruit, security will notice in your luggage & hold until you depart - not a bad thing, just a lesson for my next trip!

Thanks Courtyard by Marriott, we can't wait to visit in 2016."
3453,"Clean, new hotel with friendly staff and great food.",50,February 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard for a week and we loved the hotel. The location is good - there is a great supermarket across the road that had a very large selection of food / drinks. There is also a safe money exchange place that always had a good rate and a Commonwealth ATM across the road. It is about a 5 minute walk to the beach and about 15 minute walk to Bintang supermarket. The hotel is relatively new so the rooms are clean and modern. We had a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the length of the pool, but the way the hotel is designed means that all of the rooms have a balcony that overlooks the pool, so there is no bad room really. The best thing was that the pool is in the sun the whole day - even though it is in the middle of the hotel complex. We were worried that it might be in shade for part of the day but it wasn't. The food at the hotel really is excellent. I think the chef might be aussie and the quality and freshness was fantstic. The breakfast was really good (you can have waffles and ice-cream if that takes your fancy). There is live music every afternoon down at the pool bar. We loved it but it was loud so it might not be everyone's cup of tea. The security is excellent and the staff are super friendly and helpful. There are limited pool beds due to the lack or space around the pool but they are trying to make the best of it by providng large floating bean bags and in-pool beds and also removing towels etc that reserve the beds for longer than an hour. I think that's a good thing if it's enforced because we did notice reserved beds as early at 8.00am that seemed to be empty for hours. Can also highly recommend the day spa. We would definitely stay there again."
3454,Great spot for young couples of families,40,March 2015,"We purchased an awesome deal through Luxury Escapes which included various extras and we were very impressed with the hotel. Layout of the hotel and location are perfect, it was busy on our trip but we always found day beds available and the hotel had a great atmosphere for young couples. The floating beanbags are a fantastic idea.
Rooms are on the smaller side but still adequate. Although they are quite new, our room already needs a paint and some maintenance (i.e. cleaning on blinds, outdoor couch) but this didn't ruin our trip.
Breakfasts were great, the head chef (an Aussie called Billy) goes around chatting to people which makes guests feel appreciated. We ate lunches a few times by the pool and recommend the amazing Mo Burger. Cocktails were also good and happy hour is 2-8pm :) Gym was very good and fully equipped.
Massages were nice and staff beautiful (although a little loud as pool bar is next door).
Staff at the hotel were very helpful and mostly all spoke good English. Those at the pool bar however probably need some further training and help - it seemed like lots of people standing around but not great a response time. The attitude of these staff were not like reception or those working in the Seminyak Kitchen so definitely an area to work on.
This hotel had a good mix of age groups - as a couple in our 30s we thought it was a great spot and would stay here again. Thank you Marriott."
3455,Amazing!!,50,March 2015,"we loved this place.... hotel is new opened august 2014 so everything is still new and clean... pool(s) are amazing... we mainly kicked back at the end kids area where the pods are so not near the bar... nice and quiet, music during the day in the background but not loud at that end... recommend a pool access room as it's great for access!
while lazing around the pool the staff bring around complimentry water, icy poles and frozen face washers to cool you down... amazing service!!"
3456,Good hotel and nice location,40,December 2014,"Stayed here for two nights in December and had a great experience. When I checked in the TV was not working, within minutes of reporting the issue maintenance arrived with a new tv and changed it quickly, terrific. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Swim straight up to the pool bar for drinks and the staff helped to hire a scooter to get around with. Good rooms."
3457,"When in need, The Marriott's was there for us...",50,March 2015,"My husband and I are from Canada. Our 10-night holiday at The Marriott in Seminyak was going to be the end of a 10-week trip to Asia. However, the end of our journey changed abruptly. Six days before we were supposed to fly back to home, my husband finally decided at 4 am to go to the ER. I called the front desk to let them know what was happening and they told me to come down and they would drive us to the hospital. They suggested we should go to Siliam Hospitals (International Hospital) and we followed their advise. We were later discharged at 8 am and one of the hotel employee came to pick us up. Well, later that same day, things were not good at all so we decided to head back to the ER. Again, a Marriott's employee drove us to ER. This time, my husband was admitted to ICU. He stayed there for 2 days and has been on a regular ward since then. We were supposed to fly back home yesterday (March 15) but could not. He needs to stay at Siloam Hospitals until March 24. All that to say that numerous employees at The Marriott's have become my "" family"" during this time of crisis. They have looked after me by providing free transportation on several occasions at the beginning of our ""drama"". The Marriott's had a representative deliver a gorgeous bouquet of flowers and a basket of fruits to my husband. The representative visited with my husband a good 45 minutes as he was alone... I also needed a place to stay so they made sure I kept the same room at a good rate. The Chef Billy and several of the employees at the restaurant are asking about my husband on a daily basis. This makes us feel so good. Everything they do is from the bottom of their hearts...

I am not going to comment on the room, food and service as there are a lot of other reviews about those topics but I can say everything was perfect. We had massages, cocktails, dinners and lunches and everything was great.

We hope our situation never happens to anyone but we are really lucky in our bad luck. Balinese people are great! The Marriott's staff display high degree of class and compassion which is greatly appreciated. Thank you again to The Marriott's!"
3458,"Good place if you like loud music and a beer sitting by the pool, otherwise avoid",30,March 2015,"The rooms are new and of high quality with drink making facilities and a fridge. Security is good and food at the restaurant is high quality (head chef is Australian) but definitely aimed at Western rather than Asian visitors (ie fried breakfast, eggs benedict, donuts and bagels). The area has some reasonable restaurants, including a very good vegetarian restaurant called ""Zula""; and various gift shops to browse around. Tried several recommended spas and found services to be cheap but very poor quality, compared to elsewhere. There isn't enough sun chairs around the pool and most are occupied at 9am. Loud music starts playing at 2pm at the pool bar and continues until 8pm. You will hear this music in the rooms even if the doors and windows are shut...there no way to avoid, although rooms further from the bar are quieter. There is a waterfall between the two pools in the middle of the hotel and this creates a lot of noise as well.
If you are looking for a quiet peaceful hotel with Balinese elements or charm then this is not it and to be frank Seminyak doesn't have much Balinese charm. If you are looking for peace and quiet and the sound of the waves on the beach then this is also not the hotel for that. But if you love a beer, socialising around the pool listening to club music then this is the place for you."
3459,"Amazing, thank you!",40,March 2015,"Spent two nights at this wonderful hotel early this week and had a great stay from the start to end! Was greeted and checked in with warmth by the lovely Cindy who very kindly made reservations for me at the restaurants/spas I wanted to visit.

The breakfast here is great as well - a wide variety and Agus makes a mean omelette! The staff were all lovely and very welcoming but am afraid I have forgotten their names.

Great pool equipped with its own bar! Popsicles are served to those lounging in the sun and there are also aqua aerobics classes for those who are keen. Guests are also able to join activities such as Pilates classes held for free and even yoga tho I think there's a charge for that.

5 stars. Keep up the good work!

Navleen"
3460,Don't hesitate. Best in Seminyak,50,March 2015,"For those writing ""terrible"" reviews based on petty things such as door keys not working or security taking too long to check bags etc, shame on you. Did you really allow these things to overshadow the wonderful atmosphere Marriott provides? Not once have I been treated rudely or ignored and all of my questions have been dealt with in a polite and timely manner.

When I walked into the establishment, my jaw dropped. I felt, and still feel thoroughly spoilt. This is an amazing hotel and if you happen to be lucky enough to book on a deal (I didn't), then you've won big time. Value for money, excellent quality and spotlessly clean.

Fantastic position, walking distance to Legian and lots of shops along the way to explore. Staff are friendly and happy to assist with all needs.

As I write this I'm sitting in my room listening to the sounds of the acoustic music act playing by the pool. It's lovely..

Just book it. It's the best."
3461,Good place to stay,50,March 2015,"We stayed for 7 days and had a most wonderful time. Many thanks to Billy and his staff for producing good, healthy safe food. The breakfast was as good as an evening meal. The kitchen is in open view and it appeared that the kitchen staff were strictly following an Accredited Food Safety Plan.
The facility was very clean and secured by professional security staff.
The reception staff were friendly and most helpful especially after my wife had her credit card taken by the ATM."
3462,Family Hotel Perfection!,50,March 2015,"Our family of 4 (kids 2 & 4) stayed here for 7 nights from 23 Feb through a Luxury Escapes package we purchased. We were travelling with friends who also had 2 children (boys 7 & 4). We loved every minute here and can't recommend this hotel enough, it is the perfect family resort.

Check in
This was simple and smooth and were given all of our vouchers upfront. Melinda did a great job of explaining everything and personally took us to our room.

Location
It's on the road half way between Eat St and Double Six Beach with Chez Gado Gado and Royal Beach Seminyak at the end of the road. It's an easy 400m stroll to the beach. The hotel has a supermarket across the road and plenty of spa's nearby (including 2 Spa Bali's). Lots of market type shops and good Resturants close. Bintang supermarket is a 10-15 minute walk.

Room
We stayed in a twin pool access room. They list the beds as 2 x double beds but they are a bit smaller than that. Was fine for us with 2 small children. Bathroom large and modern. The pool access suited us perfectly so our 2 year old could sleep while we sat out the front of the room on the sun lounges. Our room was made up beautifully each day by Purwita who would leave the kids towels in animal shapes.

Pool
The pool scene was lots of fun with prompt poolside service. Great options on the food menu (loved the Bloody Mary Burger) and the 2 for 1 cocktails from 2-8pm was appreciated (fave's were Espresso Martini & the Passionfruit Mojito's).

Breakfast
This was unbelievable! Chef Billy has this sorted. I particularly liked the break from the traditional egg station with offerings like Bircher Museli and the bagel station with house smoked salmon!

Kids Club
This service was outstanding. They provide 2 hours a day free of charge which the kids loved. Small charge for children under 4 (approx $6ph) Great for arvo shopping or an early dinner. Rina was so beautiful with our daughter and handled the full of energy boys with ease. She always reported back on exactly what they did and how much they ate. She is a diamond at CY.

Facilities
The onsite spa is so luxurious, all masseuses are well trained.
Hotel has very strict security which made you feel safe.
The complimentary golf cart to the beach and up Dhupadi was so much fun.

Improvements
Finding it hard to pick a fault here. A great family hotel that we would stay at again in a heartbeat. Thank you for having us."
3463,Wow Wow Wow,50,March 2015,"This place is heaven on earth. From the second you walk in and receive your welcome drink this place ticks all the boxes and then some. The breakfast was sensational, the staff were there to cater to your every request. The rooms were perfect with a large balcony. Lastly the pool was out of this world with a swim up bar offering delicious snacks throughout the day. Will be coming back for sure because I have never experienced service like this before."
3464,Great Hotel in great location,40,March 2015,"6 of us stayed at this hotel by using the recent Luxury Escapes deal. Staff were great in replying to e-mails and arranging our requests.

The hotel is new and all amenities great. The hotel was at capacity during our stay and it was very very hard to get a sun lounge. Only about 40 lounges and over 200 rooms. The spa was great, but as previous people have said you must book in advance.

The breakfast is fantastic with the head chef out and about talking to everyone, as well as recommending some other great restaurants in the area.

Pool staff were so happy and lively, always up for a laugh and a bit of fun.
Security at the hotel was great, felt very safe and they were very friendly as well.

Will definitely stay again."
3465,Delightful breakfast,40,March 2015,"This is a fairly new hotel located conveniently in Seminyak. You can walk to a lot of the shops and restaurants, or even stroll to Kuta.

The kind of standard you would expect from a Marriott hotel, although I have had more comfortable bed and pillows in other Marriotts.

We did not get some towels or bath products replaced, but once we called for service, they were brought to us fairly quickly. Staff are very friendly in general.

Pool area is nice and kids friendly with floating seats.

What we enjoyed most here is their daily breakfast buffet. An impressive range for drinks and fruits to a fresh start. The waffles are delightful, especially with red bean ice cream and fruit toppings. There is an Asian section with local foods like nasi goreng, chicken or fish curry, and you can also choose fresh ingredients to make your own noodle soup. There is enough variety for you to try something different each day."
3466,Lovely stay,50,February 2015,"The hotel was 5 months old when we stayed at the Marriott. We were with about 8 other friends and booked through a deal with ""luxury escapes"" which included massages, cocktails, breakfast each day, a few lunches, dinners and transfers from and to the airport.
The only minor issue we had was in the very poor one word email from the hotel saying ""confirmed"" to advise that our booking was successful.
All hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and they went out of their way to make our stay a first class holiday. The dining staff and head Chief were fantastic and their breakfast, lunch and dinner options were exceptional and although we had vouchers for some meals, the cost meal costs were very modest even at Bali standards.
The hotel rooms are well appointed and very clean. On the down side, travellers need facilities to hang out wet clothing and the rooms lacked an airer and towel rails. This was also evident with many other guests as they deployed ropes and other methods to hang their wet clothes on balconies during our stay. We stayed connected to free hi speed WiFi which was available at all locations in the hotel.
The fantastic pools are large and very clean. There was plenty of sun lounges, umbrellas and floats to lounge the hours away in or around the pool. The upper pool has a cocktail bar and very competent bar staff who serviced the whole complex. Many great evenings where enjoyed sitting waist deep around the cocktail bar sipping on the endless list of spirited delights.
The hotel has a well layed out gym with modern excercise machines and free weights and a beautiful massage/spa centre with friendly, well trained staff.
The hotel had entertainment each night during happy (few) hours and an aerobics class each morning. There was also a supervised kids club which looked like it was well stacked with toys and children's stuff which appeared to be well utilised while we were there.
The multi level hotel has both stairs and lifts and rooms are spacious enough for elderly and persons with disabilitiy aids however there was no grab rails in the bathroom of our apartment.
As we took advantage of a holiday deal, we did not have to pay the full price so obviously we found it to be good value for money (we spent)."
3467,Very Overrated Hotel!... The Stones kills it in comparison.,20,March 2015,"We moved to Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak after having just stayed at The Stones Hotel in Legian.

Do yourself a favour and stay there rather than here, as it is a poor cousin indeed.

The hotel isn't at full occupancy, yet there are no where near enough chairs around the pool for all guests. I would estimate that other five star hotels we've stayed at have twice as many or more for the same amount of rooms.

Cocktails are reasonably expensive at around 140 IDR plus 21% tax. That said, 2 for 1 at happy hour is available between 4pm and 7pm.

This hotel certainly isn't 5 star, maybe 4 at best. Rooms are small.

The staff and location are fantastic, however the rooms and facilities are a let down in comparison to other options in Bali.

Also, there are currently a lot of Australian tourists staying on their 'luxury escapes' packages, as these include massages etc, good luck getting an appointment at the spa without 2 or 3 days notice.

Overall pretty disappointing, and had we known we would have remained at The Stones, where the facilities and service are miles better."
3468,"Fantastic Staff, Location and Service!",50,January 2015,The staff were so welcoming and helpful. We especially enjoyed the company of Cepi who worked every week night in the hotel restaurant. He provided not only great service and knowledge about local areas and attractions but was also very entertaining and added greatly to our experience. Executive chef Billie was also awesome and his knowledge of local restaurants was a brilliant asset! A wonderful experience.
3469,"super service, luxurious rooms, great food and close to the beach",40,November 2014,"We stayed here for a 5 night holiday. There are 5 of us (3 kids) so we got the 2 bedroom suite which allowed us to all stay together which is much better (for us) than adjoining rooms. The suite was excellent, the bathrooms were the best part, really luxurious. Beds comfy, usual supply of disney on TV for the kids. The staff were excellent, really friendly, helpful and welcoming. There's a really nice pool in the middle of the hotel that we enjoyed with a nice swim up bar. Only downside was that the floor around the pool got so hot you could hardly walk on it, not sure if there is a better material to use? The hotel is close to several other shops and restaurants, we tried a few which were all nice, safe and with good service. The beach is a 10 min walk away and the hotel will take you there in a buggy (which the kids loved). Its a good beach as well with good facilities to hire. We spent some time in the waves with some body boards that we hired. The beach was great for our kids as its quite shallow and a long, gentle slope into the water so you can go out a long way and its still not deep. It really did the trick to introduce us to Bali as this was our first trip. Next time we would probably stay in a villa as we need more space and like to self cater, this showed us what bali has to offer so we know what to look for when we come back. Thats not a reflection on the hotel, more our specific needs and this place bridged a gap for us perfectly."
3470,1st Time to Bali,50,February 2015,"1st trip to Bali with assistance of friends who are regulars. Stayed at Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. The Hotel is just 6 months old and offered us a couples perfect accommodation. We stayed in 2nd floor King Suite - very spacious rooms with very comfortable furnishings and balcony over looking the pool. Staff were wonderful. Very friendly and obliging from the time we arrived. Head Chef is an Aussie and we enjoyed 2 great meals at their restaurant - 1 Aussie BBQ Night and A La Carte - but on both occassions we also enjoyed Indonesian Fare (great Nasi Goring). All you can eat breakfast part of the package and a great way to start the day. Pool and Pool Bar was a big part of the daily activities with Happy Hour from 4.00 to 7.00 and musical duet performed most nights from 5.00 to 6.30 - again staff wonderful. Through Concierge we arranged a day trip to an Elephant Park which ran to schedule and was a great day. We used their driver and car service and while more expensive (we payed $14 AUD more to airport than our friends who took a taxi) the cars were modern and spacious. Seminyak a great place to be based from. Room service very reasonably priced and good quality. Locally we drank at nearby Galaxy Bar and ate at Blue Ocean and Potato Head (watching sunset from both the latter 2 venues was a memorable part of trip). All recommended. Meals Great. Lots of shopping - mix of ""barter"" stalls and more upmarket stores. Would recommend the Hotel and location to any 1st time Bali travellers but make sure you take at least a day trip into the village/rural areas."
3471,Beautiful place,50,March 2015,"The pool area is amazing. There are two pool areas. We went for a day use and we loved everything about it. The people were so friendly and welcoming. The service was very efficient.
I highly recommend this place and would definitely go back again."
3472,Excellent Service,40,March 2015,"i just came back from a 3-night stay from Courtyard Marriott and my dad and i were sufficiently impressed with the hotel. Security is tight and all vehicles and people entering the hotel will need to go through stringent checks. Takes up a bit of time but nothing frustrating. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and was pleasantly surprised to know that we could get our room (check in time was supposed to be 3pm) and had welcome drinks and popsicles. This was great as we had an early flight and took the advantage to rest before heading out. The concierge team has been more than helpful; i went to Bali with no plans at all but the staff were able to give good recommendations and also offered buggy ride when my dad and i wanted to go Cocoon at night. We also loved the breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen. Loved the brunch options and the wide variety of juices. Room was spacious and had a clean-cut design which I really liked. The staff had upgraded us to room with pool view and top floor so the view was amazing.

Overall, it was a restful holiday for both of us and we would definitely come back to Courtyard when we have the chance to visit Bali again. Big thanks to your wonderful team! :)"
3473,Superb Accomodation food and Location,50,March 2015,"My wife and I have just had 4 sensational nights in the Courtyard Marriott.
What can we say, from airport pick up ,to Melinda and the team at reception , security , and of course Billy and his great team at the Seminyak Kitchen ,to name them all like Desi etc too many ., We have travelled a lot, and the food here, quality and variety, atmosphere etc you need to experience Well done team !!!
Location and access to many superb restaraunts makes this Hotel ideal, and cheap to get to even using Hotel Transport .
Cannot wait to return!,, have continued our journey and unfortunately comparing the Marriott to where we are !
Ron"
3474,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,50,February 2015,"We bought a 10 days holiday with Luxury Escapes. The hotel is fabulous, the service fantastic, the food out of this world, from the moment we got there we were very welcomed, the room large and spotlessly clean, the luxury bathroom amenities a big plus. The staff at the hotel are so kind, concerned about their guests that no request is too much for them. Felt very safe in their care as security is excellent. Ngurai at the dining room, Melinda at the front desk, Billy the executive chef and Brett the general manager and Vianda who looked after our booking superbly. The hotel is well appointed and not far from the beach, we did not go swimming there as beach quite polluted. Hotel staff can take you to the beach in an electric golf cart if you require. Thoroughly recommend this hotel, we cannot find any fault, on the contrary, the best hotel we have stayed in Bali ever, and we have been there many times."
3475,Bali bliss,50,February 2015,"We bought a deal for this hotel from luxury escapes, $999 for 7 nights including daily breakfast and several meals and free cocktails and massages. The experience didn't start good as we emailed the hotel with the dates we wanted and it took a week for a reply. Then when I sent our flight details for the free transfers we recieved no reply at all. I checked with other tripadvisor reviews and got the email of the manager Brad and sent him a email. I got a prompt response and also got a email from Shashank Sinha the director of operations confirming all details.

When we arrived in Bali there was a nice car to pick us up and take us to the hotel. On arrival we were checked in promptly at 11.15am and shashank came and gave me his card and said he had given us one of the best rooms on the sixth floor. At check in we were given our vouchers for all the free meals ect.

The room we were in was directly opposite the pool bar and the view of the pool area from the balcony was great. The room was not large but not small either. The tv on the wall was the biggest we have had in a hotel and there was a lot of cable tv to watch including several movie channels and the australian network.the bed was huge and comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed and the toilet even had a rear washer!

The staff are fantastic and attentive. My wife didn't want the free massages and gave the vouchers back to reception, who promptly offered her extra free meal vouchers. The meals around the pool were good. I tried the Bloody Mary burger and found it very tasty. The meals in the seminyak kitchen restaurant were also good especially the Indonesian dishes.

The breakfasts were great with lots of different juices to start and lots of choices of both western and Asian dishes on the buffet. There is a egg station for fresh omelettes and fried eggs. All the staff in the restaurant are very attentive and nothing is too much for them.

The guys in the pool bar also were great and we spent many an hour around the pool bar trying the cocktails and drinking lots of Bintang.

I see from other reviews that noise was a factor. When we were there the bar closed at 9pm and the noise level at anytime was good, less noise than at home in fact.

Checkout was also smooth and the car took us back to the airport promptly. I will be coming back to this hotel the next time we are in Bali. Thank you to all the staff at the courtyard marriott"
3476,An outstanding CNY vacation experience,50,February 2015,"We are first time to Bali and stayed in Seminyak for 5 days. With 11 monthes old child, we did not go far to touring and make us keep utilize the hotel facilities. 3-5mins to beach, nice food quality, stuffs with hospitality. I would like to thank Cindy, Demi, Billy who provide convinience for my residence, dinning, especially for baby. It give us a chance to have a real relex vacation."
3477,Great facility at an attractive price,50,February 2015,"We stayed 5 nights at the Courtyard hotel.
Room 155, walk out of room into pool- best location
Rooms are small, however well appointed and very very clean.
Service at the hotel was outstanding. The master chef ""Billy"" was always available and was a great ambassador for the hotel!
The main restaurant is a modern facility with excellent food. The resort Manager Brad was regularly mixing with guest, a pleasure to deal with.
The floating pool beds are a great idea, the pool is also great.
About a 400m walk to the beach or the main drag into Seminyak.
Security is great with X-ray checks for all when entering the hotel. Well done Mariott!"
3478,You get what you pay for!,50,February 2015,"Book this hotel!

It's close to the beach and offers great service, comfortable, modern rooms backed up by excellent service, a great pool and bar area and an enormous, varied breakfast buffet.

WiFi was free and a good strength. The spa was also excellent.

For those looking for a mix of the beach with a location that still supports good access to Seminyak then look no further."
3479,Nice hotel,40,February 2015,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Feb'15 with my husband and 3 year old girl. Overall it is a pretty awesome hotel with some improvement areas.

What I absolutely love-
1. Wide variety and delicious breakfast
2. Kid's club
3. Hotel service. Staff was all smiles and helpful at all times
4. Lovely pool and live band by the pool
5. Security checks for all guests everytime they enter. Safety is very important since I have a young kid

Improvement areas-
1. Comforters are not covered in proper covers but sandwiched between 2 loose sheets. This is very disturbing for me as when asleep, I tend to kick the sheets off and cover myself with the comforter and since comforters are not washed, it is unhygienic
2. Noise. My room was near the cargo lift and so every morning from 6.30am onwards, I would be awakened by the sound of moving trolley. outside my room
Apart from the 2 improvement points above, I totally enjoyed my stay at The Courtyard and would recommend it to my friends"
3480,A treasure - you will enjoy staying here!,50,January 2015,"This is a new Courtyard. Probably one of the best Marriott properties my wife and I have ever visited. You are provided with a refreshing drink upon arrival and cool towels. The staff were genuinely glad to see you and tried to help you with any needs that you required. Check-in was a breeze. The General Manager [Brad - an Aussie] was 'hands on' and helped in all areas of the hotel making sure the guests were all comfortable. He referred to his staff as the team and he was one of the team! The pool was enjoyable/clean and has a swim-up bar which was fun. There is a 'happy hour'! The restaurant was amazing for both breakfast and dinner [Indonesian and Western fare]! Prices were very reasonable. The rooms were comfortable,efficient and clean. Nice patio of the living area if one wanted to sit out on the deck. Be prepared for being placed through a metal detector and baggage through an X-ray machine every time you enter the hotel and this is for YOUR safety! Has pick-up from the airport for a minimal charge if you need it. Close to the beach [400-500 yards]. Excellent restaurants nearby if you do not want to eat at the hotel. Can arrange local tours through concierge and they were very reasonable."
3481,It's a -real- Stay,50,February 2015,"It's a very beautiful stay with nothing to complain about.
Comfortable place to stay with worthy price.
We got best room allocation in 5th floor facing hotel area and swimming pool. Blue sky made another beautiful day in Bali that time. Honeymoon set up with tasty honeymoon cake? Yes! Comfortable bed and sofa on balcony, jeez, we're just enjoying every part of Courtyard Seminyak! Staffs are warm and knowing where they are, working in hospitality industry, even the security very well behaved and recognize their guest.
Try the cocktail at Pool Bar after swimming, another relaxing time with pop corn available and again, nice staff serving you.
Breakfast is beautiful too, selection of infused water and food combination.. pick what you want!
Last but not least, very huge ""thank you"" for Brad the GM, Shashank the DOO and Sila at reception, you guys rock!
Thank you for having us and make our stay more pleasant, we look forward to come back home soon."
3482,Flawless Holiday Spot!,50,February 2015,"I stayed at Marriot CY with my partner in February and must say it was one of the best hotels I've stayed! First mention is the location. The beach is only 2 minute walk down the road and the hotel is surrounded by restaurants, bars and boutique shops.

I was taken back by the security levels upon entry to the hotel - I dont think I've had thorough checks in the airports! But it gives a great deal of confidence in the place.
The rooms were very well appointed with luxurious bathroom, beautiful bed and a lovely balcony overlooking the pool.

The pool was absolutely wonderful with plenty of room for sunbaking around, great floating beanbags and a very convenient swim up bar... with a happy hour, happy day really! Live music in the afternoons was a nice touch. And did I mention staff walking around with refreshing face towels and fruit pops? Its the little things that create positive memories

Restaurant was fantastic with great variety of food. Best breakfast also (special mention to the Aussie chef Billie).

The day spa was an absolute tranquility hidden away from the world with perfect service, incredible treatment rooms and delicious ginger tea afterward.

But what makes this place, is the staff! I've met some incredible people that are so lovely, polite and helpful that it made me believe in humanity again! They were so attentive and positive and nothing was too much trouble for them. Cepi was awesome! Also, a couple of girls at the help desk who went out of their way to get me roses on valentines day. What a beautiful surprise that was!

THANK YOU team CY Marriott! :-)"
3483,Outstanding Hotel,50,February 2015,"Firstly, All the staff are absolutley exceptional, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was ever to much trouble! Special mention goes to Muchtar and Melinda at the front desk and Chewan (Chaca) at the pool bar, who all genuinely engaged in conversation each time we saw them, and went above and beyond their call of duty.

The rooms are spotless and immaculately maintained. The housekeepers did an amazing job in their daily service and worked quickly. We stayed as a group of three, with a queen and a rollaway bed, we didn't feel the room was too small for triple share, and the bed quality on both the queen and rollaway was good.

The pool bar is lively during happy hour which was our delight with live music for a few hours. The breakfast was also fantastic with a wide selection of western and asian choices. Location wise, on a peaceful street (By bail standards) with the property being away from the ""Busy"" side of Seminyak, however, only a 5min cab ride away to the Seminyak restaurants and bars etc, the beach itself was a 5 minute walk.

Again, the staff at this are nothing short of exceptional. I would choose to stay at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak without any hesitation and have told anyone who will listen to stay here when coming to Bali."
3484,Excellent Experience!,50,February 2015,"I stayed at the Marriott CY Seminyak with my wife and 3 daughters from Feb 5-14. It was a fantastic stay and was what we were hoping to experience! The Courtyard is generally a more accessible type of Marriott accommodation in other markets, but in Marriott Courtyard Seminyak, it was truly an excellent & full Marriott experience. We were met by the pre-arranged private transfer driver who was right outside the immigration area. the driver was excellent and very knowledgeable.
We arrived at the front desk at about midnight, but were still met with iced-tea, frozen juice pops and a cool towel. Check in was friendly and efficient. We were given 2 adjoining rooms with a Queen and 2 singles, plus a rollaway bed. The rooms may be slightly smaller than some hotels, but are more generous than others. We found them to be absolutely fine for the 5 of us. Anythinf we needed, room service attended to with lightening speed (extra pillows, ice for our ice bucket, clean towels, etc). The nightly phone call from front desk asking if there was anything we needed was a nice touch. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool. We had been concerned about previous comments on TripAdvisor regarding a loud fan noise from the roof, but it is clear that a noise barrier has been built around it. We were close to the equipment, and couldn't hear anything.
We were also worried about the ice and drinking water supplied by the hotel at the bar and restaurants, and were pleasantly surprised to hear that it was perfectly safe,(not the water out of the taps) the hotel has installed high tech filtration and UV treatment systems. Big relief!
Our room was on the 3rd floor overlooking the great pool.
Breakfast every morning was excellent. It was well presented, very fresh, and the team were plainly happy and welcoming, especially 'Agus' who remembered my coffee preference each day after the initial order. He also took time to write down specific things we should see in Ubud, an area he was very familiar with.
We all loved the pool, and the confident but pleasant and professional service provided by the service team. Lunch around the pool was an easy decision.

Since Marriott is a US company, they have taken extra security measures. Yes, you have to go through a boom gate to get in and out in a vehicle, and there are airport type scanners to enter the hotel, but we viewed this also as a giant positive. We felt safe and secure knowing that the hotels was so vigilant about their guests security. The team operating the security should be deployed globally to teach airport staff that you can still smile and yet do an effective job.

We had the pleasure to meet Brad the GM (an Aussie), and he went out of his way to make our stay both comfortable and memorable. He could be seen working alongside his team at any number of places in the hotel, and the staff spoke highly of him, and their delight to work for him.

We used the concierge services a lot, and they were also very knowledgeable and helpful.

Upon checkout, we mentioned that we needed a larger car than what picked us up, and they happily organised a fantastic minibus with leather massage chairs, TV etc. The girls loved it!

We have been to Bali 6 or 7 times, and we will happily return to the Courtyard Seminyak. They are a class act who seem to have quickly ironed out any teething problems which most new hotels face, and they went overboard to make our stay memorable and pleasurable!"
3485,A beautiful Hotel at a gorgeous location!,50,February 2015,"A very beautiful Hotel, 500 meters from the Beach, with beautiful rooms and a gorgeous pool and amazing staff... I would recommend this especially for families with young children. A perfect place to hang around post sunrise or after beach fun...The great places like Ku De Ta or Potato Head are very close by and so are number of restaurants!"
3486,Good location and fantastic breakfast,40,February 2015,"New hotel in a good location (close to the beach).
Staff friendly but takes time to run the hotel a bit more professionally (in particular house keeping not there yet).
Breakfast is very nice and presented in a pleasant way."
3487,Loved it!,50,February 2015,"Stayed 6 nights in Feb '15 and could not fault this hotel. Everything was brand new. Staff were all lovely and very accommodating. The pools were fabulous. Perfect water temp and great bean bags to float around in. Loved having a button beside the deck chairs to press when you need a drink. Staff would bring cold towels and icy poles whilst you were relaxing in the sun - so lovely!
The location is great. You can walk to the beach - you pop out at Gado Gado. There is great 'Bali' shopping in the street and cheap massage/nail bars also.
We chose to stay in the Pool Terrace rooms, so we had direct access to the pool and really loved being able to go back into the room without having to pack up.
But by far, our favourite thing, which we only discovered at the end of our stay was the free shuttle into the heart of Seminyak - which was on a golf buggy! Loved flying through Jl Drupadi on this. Not sure who had more fun, us or the people staring us in amusement!"
3488,Great hotel great stay!,50,February 2015,"We stayed at the hotel for 8 days and loved every minute! I was ill on our arrival and the staff in Seminyak kitchen went out of their way to prepare me chicken broth. It is these small gestures that really stand out! Spotlessly clean rooms with nice amenities . Fabulous pool, great breakfast, what more could you ask for! Staff all very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back again soon!"
3489,Seminyak Siesta,40,February 2015,"We really enjoyed our recent stay. Had a pool access room even though we ended up in a corner with no pool view. We were offered another room without asking but decided we liked the privacy and no noise. Happy Hour is 6 hours which is probably a necessity given that food and beverages become quite pricey (by Bali standards) when you add ++ to everything. All the staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. One criticism is that the door that accesses the pool from your room is not able to be unlocked from the outside which kinda defeats the purpose. The pool which covers most of the courtyard area is great and is a good meeting place for guests. Also, the day spa is quality all the way - cool, spacious, well equipped, nice products. I had a couple of excellent treatments there. Overall, lovely ambience at the Courtyard!"
3490,5 Stars is not is not enough for this hotel should be 10 out of 10,50,February 2015,"From the moment we were picked up at the airport the service was amazing ,then get to the hotel
it was spectacular ,beautiful room beautiful bed ,beautiful bathroom,
all the staff were so friendly knowing you name ,and genuinely friendly ,in the restaurant the food was delicious and not expensive. the staff in the restaurant were so helpful about Bali,one man
Cepi was a great help with a phone card and came with us in our tour to see we were not ripped off so kind, and Agus was a great help with where to go in Seminyak ,in fact all the staff were great .we absolutely love our time the and cant wait to go back i would recommend any one
contemplating a trip to Bali stay at the Marriot Courtyard"
3491,EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS IN EVERY WAY,50,February 2015,"We have just returned from a fantastic ten days at Courtyard Seminyak. Having bought a luxury escapes deal we were a little nervous about what we would find but the hotel exceeded our expectations in every way! From the moment we were picked up at the airport everything was so organised and perfect. Reception staff and the concierge were so courteous and made us feel so welcome, and everything promised in the luxury escapes deal was provided on arrival, vouchers for massages and cocktails, etc. We had two beautiful rooms overlooking the pool which were modern, clean and very new. The hotel is located in a perfect part of Seminyak, so close to the beach and the shops and restaurants. Security at the hotel was fantastic and we all felt very safe throughout our stay. We were blessed with fantastic weather so spent a lot of time just lazing around the pool, which was so relaxing. The pool is gorgeous, perfect for either doing laps early morning or for relaxing in the shallows reading a book in the middle of the day. Service around the pool was fabulous too, we enjoyed great cocktails and great food, lots of choices and all good. Breakfasts were amazing, so many choices and all beautifully prepared, very fresh and healthy. All of the staff were fantastic, so helpful, keen to do anything to make your holiday perfect, like booking reservations at busy popular beach bars and organising taxis, etc. The concierge, reception staff, waiters, barmen and housekeepers were all so courteous and efficient and friendly. When we come back to Bali we will definitely stay at Courtyard Seminyak, it has everything we need in a holiday and offers the perfect location from which to explore Bali. Seminyak itself is just that little bit more upmarket and has a great vibe, and the hotel is so well situated to enjoy all it has to offer. We highly recommend this hotel and all of its staff and management!"
3492,Quite good... BUT!,40,November 2014,"Went here with my husband in November of 2014, booked through a third party website.

Check in was not a problem and we got a room on the top floor just to the left of the reception. The hotel corridors can be a bit confusing when going in and out as we needed to take not the first lift but the second, a bit hidden away to get to our floor. Understandably the hotel was new and additional signs is hopefully to come.

The room itself was quite spacious but it seemed unfinished. The pictures on the website did not match the room we got. The paintings on the wall was not there, instead there was a rough wooden board with exposed screws. On the opposite side of the room there was an exhaust fan that was really, really noisy 24/7. The bed itself on the other hand was divine, it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had in a hotel.

BUT... the room layout was a bit weird. The wardrobe and the safe was in the toilet. So if he went to the loo, I couldn't not get to the safe. The room was for two people but only one toothbrush? Only two towels? One chair in the entire room? When we ordered room service one person had to sit in a couch to eat or on the bed. Just weird.

One reason why we chose this hotel was the ""Marriott Smoke Free Policy"" which in turn was non existent when we got there. The entire premises are supposed to be smoke free (which is important to us due to medical conditions) but the first thing we see is an ash tray. And people are smoking everywhere throughout the premises. That is ok, but don't advertise the hotel as smoke free if it isn't.

We did go to the gym as well but I would not call it a gym. It was a room with a couple of treadmills, a couple of cross trainers, some yoga mats, pilates balls and one set of weights and a home-gym type machine for lat pulldowns, thats it. It was not equipped enough for a workout.

The breakfast was fantastic, one of the best ones I have had. I also loved the fact that they had breakfast up until 11.30 and that suits me perfectly. Their granola was probably the best one I have ever had.

I would still recommend it, it was a lovely hotel and I will probably be back. I will ask for another room though if I end up near the exhaust fans again as I didn't sleep properly with that noise. Close to the beach and you can find plenty of bars and restaurants."
3493,Astounding hotel and customer service!,50,February 2015,"I cannot explain how excellent and attentive the staff are at the Marriott. I must say Cepi, who is one of the waiters in the restaurant made sure all our needs were met, and even gave my friends and I important tips when travelling around Bali.
It is amazing how everyone will always greet you with big smiles on their faces. Our cleaner, Purwira, always made our room perfectly clean, so after a big day of shopping we could come in, relax on our bed and not lift a finger.
This hotel has got great food, fabulous customer service and amazing rooms. You cannot go wrong with staying here!! I will 100% be coming back and I will definitely be telling all my family and friends to stay here.
I hope Cepi and Purwira are recognised for making our stay so pleasant."
3494,Great Boutique Hotel,50,December 2014,"This is a great, hip property in the Seminyak area. Felt like it was straight out of Miami. The hotel is centered around a big pool, that is great to hang out at. Our room looked over the pool and had a tub on the balcony, which was pretty neat. The food at the restaurant was very good and extremely well priced. We had Christmas brunch and couldn't have been happier with the food options as well. Lots of asian inspired options and plenty of local fruit. The location feels like an oasis. The hotel is in the midst of a bustling area and lots of activity, which is great when you want to go out, but the hotel itself is very laid back and mellow. Perfect combination."
3495,Friendly but not what I was looking for,30,February 2015,"The purpose of my trip was to find a new hotel for our next holiday trip. I found a good deal on lastminute.com and was eager to stay and relax at the Courtyard after a hectic week.
Check-in was friendly with a cold towel and welcome drink, as well as an upgrade on my room. I was also invited to join the Marriott rewards program. All good so far.
The room was well designed and comfortable. Nice touches are the JBL radio with charger for iPhones. Pity the clock time was wrong and it took me time to figure out how to set the right time (it is the little things that count).
Sleep was comfortable and the bed/mattress very satisfactory. The next morning I strolled to the beach, which is about 10 minutes walk away. There is no sea view from this property.
After my walk, I tried to get into my room, only to discover the key no longer works. My wifi was also non functional and several calls were made, as well as a trip to reception. All to no avail. IT only starts work at 9, and I got it all working just before 11.
Breakfast was very good, though small hiccups and not seeing the fresh fruit hidden away in a fridge. I ordered an omelet and then had to rejoin the queue discovering it was sitting on a side table in the kitchen. The kitchen manager was very helpful and even offered a fresh omelette.
My room was overlooking the pool which quickly filled with screaming kids, as the sound seem to bounce off the walls - highly irritating. Thank goodness they started to play music at 11. I was going to go for a swim but got so frustrated with the noise and kids in both pools.
This is certainly not a hotel for business or couples. Probably great for families.
So, in conclusion, I won't be coming back here for my next holiday. The staff were friendly and well trained, but I think it could be better."
3496,Friendly staff.,50,February 2015,New hotel about 400 metres from the beach. 5 stories about 200 rooms. We had a pool access room on the bottom floor. Which was great as there are only about 40 lounge chairs at the main pool area. We were able to get two outside our room with no problem. By about 9.30 am they were all snapped up. The pool was warm and clean. Nice big bean bags to lounge in in the water. Closer to the main entrance the is the pool bar. The staff were friendly and there was live music by the bar every night. Beautiful buffet breakfast with both western and Asian. Chefs cook eggs etc to order. Donuts were great especially the jam ones and plenty of juice. Not noisy at all considering how close to the street it is. Plenty of security including sniffer dogs and searches of your car/taxi as it enters. Get the cab to drop you out the front. There is then airport style metal detectors to walk through and X-ray machine for your bags. Very quick though so it is not a nuisance. Room was nice and new with everything you would expect. Big bathroom. There is a large mini mart across the road with a money changer. We were given 4 free massages at the resort and two dinners and two lunches. Food was good but there are so many options around. Easy to get a cab and walking distance to la plancha double 6 and cocoon. There is a gym that is open 24 hours and a kids club for those that need it. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Have stayed in villas and resorts here but if it just a couple I would stay here again for sure.
3497,"Fabulous, staff went above and beyond, will definitley come back!",50,February 2015,"Booked on a whim through a groupon voucher and turned out to be the best option possible. Right from the moment we were picked up at the airport to checking in, we received all our vouchers straight away (no issues like there often is with deals). They were very accommodating if we wanted to swap lunches and dinners around. Pool bar and spa are gorgeous. I think what made our group have the best time was the staff...they went above and beyond. From the room cleaning to cool face towels and ice blocks throughout the day to organising day trips and drivers for us all day. There was also a golf buggy waiting at the hotel to take you down the street or to the beach for free whenever you needed. Not to mention they have fantastic security, never once felt unsafe here in Seminyak. Absolutely amazing hotel."
3498,You pay for what you get!! Bang on!!,50,February 2015,"Amazing Staff!! Attentive, Friendly, Welcoming!!

My partner and I arrived to bali at night and didnt know where to stay for the first night as we didnt have accomodations booked, so my partner looked up hotels and found the marriot. It was pricey for one night but all worth it.

Upon arrival we were greeted and welcomed, by friendly staff. They were all so attentive, everytime you walk past a staff you were greeted by with hello and a big smile.

Our room was fantastic, air conditioning was fabulous, nice and cold when we walked it. Staff who helped brought our
bag into our room was helpful showing us where things were.

Next morning there was a breakfast buffet, wow it was good. Staff yet againg delightful, attentive and friendly. So much variety of food.

As we left to go to another villa for 2 nights we realised how good it was at courtyard marriot, location,service and food was great and we missed it as we had nothing booked for our 4th and 5th night, we rebooked again and came back to the marriot we were so pleased we did not want to leave for the other villas we had booked for the last 6 nights.

Marriots wifi was great, faster then all the places we stayed in and we could access it from the kitchen.

Seminyak kitchen was goof we went to have lunch and dinner there. The thursday night chinese buffet was even delicious!

Id say marriot killed the villas and hotel we stayed in. It was our first time in bali and they made it a great experience.

Terima kasih!!
We appreciate your staff!!
Best place we stayed in, in bali, keep up the good job and we will definitely return again just to stay at your hotel only."
3499,Loved it. Will be coming back!,50,February 2015,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights and we were disappointed that we didn't look into staying at the Marriott for a longer period of time, as we were in Bali 11 days all up and stayed at other villas and hotels, by far the Marriott was our favourite, very good location and close to many things.

The service was amazing from when we arrived until we left, there is security screening which assures that you are in a very safe place at all times. The staff were happy all the time and made sure you were always attended to.

The room was very clean and modern, we had a deluxe pool view room and was well air conditioned compare to some of the other places we stayed at during our holiday.

The restaurant was very good especially the breakfast that's included, giving you a wide range of food to pick from, the only thing I would comment on is the pricing for the lunch and dinner, we found other local restaurants nearby for lunch and dinner which had excellent food with reasonable prices.

The pool and pool bar was amazing and made it hard to want to go anywhere else but swim in the pool and enjoy a Bintang with entertainment from 5pm to 8pm.

Will definitely come back to stay again and I hope the Marriott is able to keep it clean and at it standard now as it is still fairly new."
3500,Nice but not the best,40,February 2015,"It's a nice hotel but I liked the Marriott at Nusa Dua more. Rooms are small and too busy with furniture. Staff is very polite, breakfasts are fine. Pool is not big but enough. I would say not enough sun lounges around the pool for so many rooms. Cool mattresses at the pool. The worst were the towels at the pool: small and stinky when wet! Obviously too old. All the rest is fine though I'd expect a bit more from Marriott."
3501,1ST CLASS HOTEL,50,February 2015,My wife and stayed for a week and found the hotel amazing From the time that you arrive you are greeted with strict security which is a must here now in bali. The rooms are excellent and very clean as you would expect the hotel only opened last august The kitchen serves wonderful food especially the breakfasts the service from the pool bar to the kitchen is excellent and the staff are to be congratulated The only complaint is that the cocktails at the pool bar are very expensive with liitle taste this is due to half nips of spirits The pool food should also be addressed as it is not up to the marriott standard 0verall a very lovely hotel.
3502,Its the staff that makes the hotel enjoyable.,40,January 2015,"""Your customer doesn‚Äôt care how much you know until they know how much you care. ~Damon Richards ""

Just recently returned from my stay at Courtyard Seminyak. I would like to to first mention the following exceptional staff that have made my stay memorable:

Edi - from breakfast. thank you for being attentive and bringing our coffee with a smile every morning. You always make sure our table is cleaned and when my friend got sick with Bali Belly you helped me bring breakfast  to her room.

Ajianto - Mr front desk ... right from the check in you were always helpful. You have helped us call the restaurants we needed to book dinner for and even more important he helped me get the doctor in at the hotel for my friend. It was always easy dealing with you.

Ayu - best masseuse ever! .. why oh why did I only find you on my second last day. Always smiling and very professional. Ayu fixed the knots on my back with ease and whilst I gently fell asleep on the table.

The hotel is new, beautiful and definitely in a good location. I like that the security  does pay attention and no, it doesn't take much to go through the screening. Anybody that complain about this is just being petty.

I just hope they keep the service up at its standards and hopefully the novelty of being new doesn't wear out too quickly."
3503,Wonderful experience,40,January 2015,We picked the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak after reading the good reviews from tripadvisor. And the whole experience has been wonderful. We had a deluxe room overlooking the pool. The room is very clean and tastefully furnished. The international buffet breakfast spread has lots of choices for you to choose from. The staff are very attentive and helpful. The pool is beautiful with a pool bar for anyone who is thirsty. The high security check by the staff is excellent for our safety sake. Highly recommended.
3504,A superb experience,50,December 2014,"Just arrived back in Australia and feel compelled to write our first such review because this quality hotel was so good. The highlight was the staff with all aspects outstanding: the restaurant, housekeeping, spa, pool and gardening staff, security, etc, etc. All were so friendly and did a great job whatever their responsibilities. Special mention must go to Anton, Indah and Juliartawan who were consistently welcoming as we enjoyed the delicious and excellent range (western and Indonesian) of food in the kitchen.

The room itself was superb - clean and as new. It was not enormous, but ours was a perfect size for a couple, with a great selection of TV channels and wireless internet that was as reliable and fast as our good connection in Perth. Housekeeping consistently cleaned the room on a daily basis. My book on a bedside table even inherited a bookmark on the page that I had folded the corner over on!!

In summary...thoroughly recommended. We hope to be back."
3505,Wonderful and fantastic hotel!!!,50,January 2015,We have been to many five and four stars hotel but this one is the best!!! The reception staff was SO nice and friendly when we arrived!! Everyone here are so friendly! My son loves the kids club and we love it too!! First time in our holiday that my husband and me can have our own time! The breakfast is fantastic! The staff Nguran is always so nice and kind! Love this hotel!!! Will definitely return!!!!!
3506,Ten wonderful days of 1st class service,50,January 2015,"This hotel exceeded all our expectations. This holiday was organised last minute and we were looking for something within our limited budget because we have another trip planned mid-year. As soon as we arrived we were surprised about the amount of security that this hotel had. We were welcomed with a drink and an ice-block which was very refreshing. Our room was spacious and the shower was magnificent. Breakfast in the morning was extensive and included Asian as well as American. There were even freshly made bagels that were delicious. However, we all thought the jam doughnuts were to die for. The executive chef was present every morning and his staff were trained to ensure your breakfast was a culinary experience. The pool was very relaxing and their floating bean bags were great for tanning but also keeping cool. The reception staff were very friendly and were able to answer your every question. The hotel manager was extremely helpful with suggesting great places for dinner and we were never disappointed. I cannot speak highly enough of the facilities or of the staff. The hotel is located in a great position and everything is within walking distance.This hotel exceeded all our expectations and we would definitely come again."
3507,Great hotel with excellent service.,50,January 2015,"It's our last night here and we have loved every minute of it. It's my 5th trip to bali but my first to Seminyak. Picked a great hotel at a very good price with many inclusions. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 adults and 1 child and there was ample space. A deluxe room would have been sufficient as we spent very little time in the room.
What I liked most:
- The rooms are very clean
- The breakfasts are great, with so much variety. If there is something missing the chefs are happy to make it for you.
- The staff are all very friendly and helpful, especially Anton (F&B Manager) who is always present and takes the time to check if we need anything and open to feedback. He is an asset.
- the pool area is very nice and I especially love the floating bean bags - very relaxing.
- my 7 year old liked spending a couple of hours a day at the kids club, the staff were great. One of the staff recognised us from the Sofitel where she previously worked and even remembered what my daughter liked to do.
- spa treatments were great
- pool bar food nice and very reasonably priced. Encourages you to stay and eat at the hotel.
- location is convenient
- the best wifi I have used in hotels

Just a couple of areas the hotel could improve on:
- food service at pool bar takes way too long
- on a few occasions the food didn't taste very fresh (eg. The fish and chips, calamari and the bread served for lunch and dinner). Unfortunately my niece got sick after eating the fish.
- the price of cocktails are exorbidant - $18 AUD for a cocktail. Not sure what that's about. Visited double six and royal beach seminyak and their prices were much more reasonable. I don't understand the logic of putting prices up but then having happy hour for most of the day.
- would have been nice to have shuttle service to other parts of seminyak or Kuta to avoid the chaotic taxi service and getting ripped off.

Overall we all really enjoyed our trip. Would highly recommend to friends."
3508,Fabulous,50,January 2015,"This was definitely the best we have stayed in Marriotts hotels before in America, so knew the standard was great, but this exceeded expectations.
We had transport from airport to hotel which was a plush people carrier as there was 6 of us plus luggage. The driver even arrived with cold drinks for us which were gratefully received.
Arrived at hotel and the staff were extremely helpful took care of everything.
Rooms great everything wonderful.
Buffet breakfast was to die for so much choice can't begin to tell you.
Pool area including garden immaculate men worked so hard keeping neat.
Bar made wonderful cocktails and food was yummy. Staff were all excellent and would do anything the children were looked after well with a kids club which they enjoyed.

Certainly going again. Thank you"
3509,"Amazing Hotel - with Excellent Service, new great location",50,January 2015,"I can not speak highly enough of this hotel... where do I start!

Welcome drink also included fruit home made ice blocks - delicious and welcome in heat... Room was amazing, we had a Suite room and brought deal from Travelzoo so a bit nervous what to expect. Far exceeded expectations and true 5 star resort ! Staff could not have been more helpful and that included Kids Club, Reception, Porters, Security, Restaurant Staff and cleaners... EVERYONE went out of their way. We got great service from GYM instructor who spent more than 1/2 hour helping us stretch after a workout - so HELPFUL !

Would go back and highly recommend this hotel in the future and look forward to staying here again VERY soon !!!

On our last night we had to book excess luggage and call Australia to book, hotel staff made call for us and did not even charge us for the call when we'd offered and we had already checked out 5 hours earlier.

Over and beyond service - just why I love BALI so much .. thank you !!!

Thanks for an amazing stay !"
3510,Amazing break!,50,January 2015,"We have just come back from our first trip to Bali, staying in the courtyard Marriott Seminyak was such a wonderful experience. I honestly can say this has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The manager Brad and every single member of the hotel team was so polite and willing to help with anything nothing was too much trouble for them. The security that has been moaned about before is brilliant. Takes all of a couple of seconds to get checked when coming back into the hotel. I would rather this than not feeling safe. Can't wait to visit again. Thanks for an amazing time and making our trip so enjoyable."
3511,Beautiful new hotel,50,January 2015,"6 of us(work friends) came here for 3 nights in the ground floor pool access rooms and we found the hotel great! The rooms are beautiful and new, the buffet breakfast was yum and had a lot of different choices from bakery, hot, eggs, sweets and juices. There are plenty of shops in walking distance and everything else an easy taxi ride away. The pool is beautiful and the spa was amazingly relaxing!
Would definately return!!!"
3512,Best hotel stay,50,January 2015,"My family stayed at the Courtyard for 5 nights. Our stay was perfection from beginning to end. The staff were all incredibly helpful. Our check-in and check-out process was very smooth. The rooms were very clean and stylish. We chose a pool view room, so we spent some time on the balcony drinking coffee and enjoying the view. Their breakfast buffet at Seminyak Kitchen was flawless. They have a wide selection of both Western and Asian favorites. Their signature bagels and bircher museli were family favorites.

The hotel was nestled in between an array of small shops and restaurants, and was a short walk from Seminyak Beach. It was incredibly easy to get a cab. My family and I enjoyed many a stroll down the vibrant streets.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Bali."
3513,Thank you for an amazing stay.,50,January 2015,"Wow, we came to this hotel with high expectations and this hotel certainly delivered! We did not realise the hotel opened only 4 months ago, and we were amazed by the outstanding service and cleanliness of the hotel! The pool was beautiful, large and clean. No negative words to say at all. Thank you for an amazing stay."
3514,"Excellent hotel, superb location, wonderful staff",50,December 2014,"We stayed in the last week of December for 5 nights. This is a great Marriott property, minutes away from the Seminyak beach & popular market areas. The Courtyard is a nice/ clean hotel with attentive & highly supportive staff. The breakfast spread is lovely & the pool with surrounding areas is well kept. Our room was excellent & the massage offered at Zanti spa was very relaxing. I saw before travelling that few people wrote on TA of finding the security a hassle. In contrast, we felt its a necessity in these times & we really didn't mind it much (never took too long). All in all, a great place to stay."
3515,had a wonderful time in marriott seminyak,50,January 2015,""" had a wonderful time in marriott seminyak. The staff is exceptionally good and courteous. Spa was amazing. Special thanks to shashank sinha for his round the clock assistance. Would love to visit again."""
3516,Fabulous!,50,January 2015,"I spent 3 nights here and cannot fault anything in the stay. All staff were absolutely amazing, especially Cindy, Ade, Ari from Front Desk/Concierge and Herry from Housekeeping. The breakfast was delicious, such a big variety of things to eat. The room was great with free wifi since I'm a Marriott Rewards member. Thank you for a lovely stay, hats off to the above 4 associates, well done guys!"
3517,New Hotel,40,January 2015,"First time staying in Seminyak. Courtyard is a nice place with friendly staff and an all afternoon happy hour at the pool bar.
Breakfast is nice with plenty of choice and all fresh and clean.
Let down for this hotel is the foul smell from the water when turning on the shower.
Same issue in more than one room"
3518,"Amazing, this Hotel is perfect !!!!",50,December 2014,"Can not fault this beautiful hotel from the minute you arrive you are treated like royalty .. The staff can not be faulted so happy and friendly every single one of them, Balinese hospitality at its finest. The pool is awesome the floating bean bags so comfortable and the atmosphere around the pool relaxing and staff coming around with yummy icy poles or cool water every now and again such a nice touch.. Perfect hotel for couples, families, singles. Great location and very security conscious which is nice.. Will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel :)))"
3519,Super Quality for a Courtyard,50,January 2015,"Rarely do you see visible Hotel General Managers, here Brad Edman is everywhere. Making sure the service and your needs are taken care of, is his objective. New, top quality for Bali, considering the choices available. Good value, with nice rooms. As Platinum, the service and treatment was at a level expected by loyal Marriott members. I staybat the Courtyard Nusa Dua earlier in the week and wanted to compare. The result is both are great! The difference is where you want to be....peaceful Nusa Dua or hectic night life Seminyak, super to have two great options."
3520,Great Hotel,50,December 2014,"This hotel has the comfort and facilities of a new modern hotel. Had the best breakfast here, wide spread and very generous with their helpings. The staff are friendly and helpful. You feel safe and secure with their high security and scanning system. If you like Seminyak, this is a good place to stay, away from the noise but within walking distances to the shops."
3521,Good hotel but not super special,30,January 2015,"We stayed over the Xmas period. It was very busy. Often at breakfast there was a large que of people waiting for tables. The hotel is in a good location,you can walk just a few mins to all the nearby restaurants, shops,massage shops etc. we found the rooms to be quite small and with an awkward large amount of furniture, leaving little room to move around. More suited to couples than for families, there were stairs to access the pool area (unless traipsing the whole way around the building) so abit difficult with prams. Kids pool was good but no sun lounges for parents, just very low bean bags, not ideal for relaxing watching kids or getting them dried.. There was also live acoustic music played at night so at check-in request a room away from the music/pool bar if you are concerned. The day spa was reasonably priced (about $30aud for a 1hr massage). Cocktails were about $10-15aud. Happy hr had limited options for cocktails. Free wifi worked well."
3522,Hotel stay in Seminyak,40,January 2015,"This had been my first stay at a 'Big named Hotel'.

The hotel was rather new, therefore it was clean and modern. The rooms were clean, and had all the amendities that you would require during your stay.

We selected a pool access room and received room 154 which included 2 single beds. This was right near the pool located between the main and childrens pool. Our stay dates were the 9-16 of Jan, and the hotel didn't seem to busy. The 'noise' that I had read about from previous reviews wernt an issue due to the amount of people staying at this time.

The staff were very helpful when required, and the food at the resteraunts were also a highlight during our stay.

Two things that were a bit of a disappointment was firstly the pool side service. 'Happy hour' which maybe consisted of 15 people around the pool at the time we stayed took way to long to get service. Once your service had finally been recognized, staff would come with the menu and take your order. I think to get a drink by the pool on one instance took over 20 minutes.

Another point that was annoying was house keeping. After returning to the hotel in the late afternoon (around 5pm) our rooms had still not been done. This occurred for about 4 days until we called reception to ask what was the delay. They apologized and sent someone to clean straight away. The following days of our stay, the room was done before lunch.

Over all I did enjoy this stay. The hotel was in a good location and was very neat and clean. The facilities were also very good and they also provided many activities throughout the day.

Just a note.

-The pool is the busiest part of the hotel. So if you require day beds. Get in early. I noticed that most people would be by the pool all day which could make it challenging to get a day bed and say lunchtime.

-Security screening is needed everytime you return to the hotel. Some viewers had written this to be a nusance, but honestly it takes 10 seconds. Personally I would rather see something being done to keep the hotel and its guests safe, than have nothing."
3523,Exceeding expectations,50,November 2014,"My husband and I booked this a week after it opened, and stayed for a few days end of Nov. We stayed a few days in Ubud which had a more rural vibe, and when we came to the bigger city of Seminyak, we were relieved to have the comforts and conveniences of a modern hotel.

The metal detectors and strict security threw us off a bit upon entry, but after passing by other hotels, it seemed like most of the big hotels had upgraded their security measures as well in a similar fashion.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We upgraded to the ground floor pool-side access rooms. They were quite nice if you like the pool, however we found mosquitos came into our room more frequently.

One of the nights, we were tired and stayed for a light dinner at the poolside bar, listening to two singers on guitar and vocal. It was a nice treat for a relaxing evening.

The breakfast buffet was amazing in every way. Eggs done how you wanted, gluten free bread, cut up fruit, infused water, mini donuts, and fresh juice to name a few. I went to a neighboring 5 star hotel for another breakfast as part of a spa package and it wasn't quite as nice as this one.

We were walking distance from the beach but the hotel shuttle could take you there too. Their Courtyard Marriott dedicated taxis were very clean and brand new, just a bit more expensive than the normal taxis. We were happy to pay for the Courtyard taxis as they were quite courteous and reliable. The staff at the concierge were also quite helpful if we needed help with finding directions or calling for reservations.

All in all, it was a really lovely stay. If I went back to Seminyak I would definitely stay there again."
3524,"Lovely, well-located hotel",40,January 2015,"Just got back from a two-night stay here and enjoyed almost every minute of it. Hotel grounds are very well maintained, pool is lovely with fun things like floating mattresses and plenty of sun beds, and rooms are well-appointed. Only let down was the food - while the breakfast was good, lunch was uninspiring. In particular, the chefs seemed unable to cook noodles properly. Having said that, there's plenty of good grub to be had elsewhere in Seminyak and the rest of Bali, so it's not a deal-breaker. Ask for a room facing away from the pool and on a higher floor if you want peace and quiet, as it can get rather noisy."
3525,Excellent stay in the heart of Seminyak,50,January 2015,"This outstanding new hotel has everything. Great location (Short walk to Seminyak beach and close to all the nice restaurants in Seminyak and Kerobokan), beautiful rooms with a fantastic view of the pool. A big relaxing pool with a swim-up bar. A lot of sunbeds and beanbags to get relax in. We stayed over New Year and hotel was fully booked. But it didn't really felt to busy. I got an upgrade to a One bedroom suites and it was lovely and well furnished and spacious.
Breakfast has everything and more. Good quality and with a wide spread of Asian, Western, Noodle station, Egg station, freshly baked bread, pastry, fresh fruit and even ice cream. Everything was displayed nicely and always feel fresh every day. On the New Years day they kept the breakfast open until 2 pm. Never experienced before.
But that really makes this place is the people who always are so courteous and helpful all the time.
Just to mention some of the extraordinary I have to mention about Ari at Concourse that had helped us book a return trip to Gili T. The same day we left he had a day of from work. We was a group of 12 people that left with a small bus and we left the hotel without knowing 2 more people should have been on the bus. But he did take his motorbike to find our bus on Jl By Pass Sanur to make sure that the other couple get on the bus.
Thanks again GM Brad and Chef Billy and the rest of the team at Courtyard Seminyak. Will be back again for sure. Excellent work!"
3526,Disappointing,10,January 2015,"The hotel is new and clean, but that is about all of its advantages. It is very small and feels entirely deprived of the local spirit. The design is a matter of personal taste however. Upon the arrival the receptionist insisted on charging my card certain amount to cover future consumption in the hotel. He was reassuring that the difference will be given to back to me in local cash upon check-out. I am certainly familiar with pre-authorising cards when the room has not yet been paid for or, for that matter, for additional charges, but have not heard of actually charging the card in advance. I felt it was very rude and presumptuous. After I expressed my doubts about this practice, the receptionist lowered the sum he wanted to charge from my card, so everything felt arbitrary. Rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. I would say that double is a good size for one person, but not for two as there is no place to put luggage without tripping over it. Only one bath robe for a double (I didn't understand why), water is a scarce commodity for one needs to beg reception to bring it to the room. I once asked for four bottles and reception kindly informed me that only two per room are allowed. Breakfast is plentiful but quite greasy. The fruits and veggies are stuck in very inconvenient refrigerators and they weren't very good quality. Juices were not fresh, with added sugar. Lunch options are again super greasy fast food. Hotel is very tiny so there is nowhere to hide from people and plentiful staff. I felt like I am always bumping into a bunch of bored pool bar attendants hawkishly seeking someone to order something from the bar. This hotel is definitely not a five star hotel and I will not recommend it to people seeking authentic Bali experience."
3527,Simply the best!!,50,January 2015,"My husband ""Mr Andrew"" lol and I have just returned from the best week away ever! We stayed in room 533 overlooking the beautiful pool and immaculate gardens of Courtyard Marriott Seminyak! The service from the minute of being picked up at the airport by the wonderful Nyoman our driver in a very clean air conditioned vehicle to the Bintang at the reception area when signing in was a fabulous start and it just kept getting better! The rooms were amazing and each day immaculately cleaned and refreshed by the ever obliging staff!! Every person working at this beautiful resort love their job as you can see by their passion and enthusiasm to please! After meeting Brad the ""captain of the ship"" GM whilst having a strawberry daiquiri at the pool bar we can understand why everyone is a members of a happy team.He is such a people person and is as hands on as anyone else, in fact he made us his version of a strawberry daiquiri with a touch of mint, yummy!!
It was nice to know he new where we came from Lake Macquarie NSW as he was from the same area some time ago! We could not start to list all the outstanding people from the pool bar to the second to none ""Seminyak Kitchen"" were we enjoyed unbelievable breakfasts each morning including our favourite eggs benedict! The service again was amazing and from Made the supervisor to the executive chef Billy and all the staff we can't thank them enough and can't wait to return the best restaurant in our opinion in Seminyak and truly best breakfasts in Bali. With all that said we are already looking at dates to return to this superb resort and have no plans of staying any where else as our driver and now friend Nyoman will take us out each day to wherever we want to go! Thanks again Andrew and Denise Kinmond"
3528,Amazing staff,40,September 2014,A few months ago my daughter and I had to fly to Bali in an emergency situation . My son was involved in an accident and had multiple fractures to his face. The staff were amazing they took us in like family and cared for us. Every day when we returned from the hospital fragile and exhausted all staff would ask how is Dale and how are you coping? The head chef Billy is from Australia he is amazing nothing was too much trouble.. And his food to die for xx...when we had to leave Dale was unable to travel for a few more days so they took him in and cared for him. Billy personally took care of his food as he was unable to open his mouth very much..I haven't even mentioned the room 10/10 . Thank you so much to all the staff . Highly recommend this beautiful Hotel..
3529,Everything was too notch if you don't need to email reservation,50,October 2014,"We stayed in October 2014 and was happy with the hotel hence booking our next vacation here again. But emails with reservation has been so difficult and can't be guaranteed an inter connecting room (if the reply was a straight no I would look else where), as this is not an option with 2 adult 2 children. If you don't require any specific bookings it will be fine, if you require assistance via email be prepaired to be patient.
Would I continue with my next vacation booking? I'm not overly keen now to be honest. Unless my requirements can be confirmed indefinitely."
3530,Exceeded expectations,50,January 2015,"Have come here with two friends and we have had an absolutely lovely time. The staff are very friendly and always looking for a way to accommodate you, the premises are always clean and beautifully presented, as are all the facilities. Especially enjoyed the pool bar, they have a range of cocktails and other drinks as well as a yummy food menu which you can order from wherever. All great value for money. Also loved how the staff walk around offering everyone iced lolly pops and lemony water - just what you need in the red hot sun! The location is also very convenient, just a 5 minute walk from the beach where there are a range of beachside restaurants, across the road from a convenience store and a 15 minute walk from seminyak square. Taxis to places like potato head are only about $2-3 too. Overall would definitely recommend to anyone and will definitely be back!"
3531,"There are better places to choose from, but it's early days.",30,December 2014,"We went Boxing Day to 4th Jan, taking advantage of relatively cheap opening special rates.

The staff are lovely, friendly people, as we have always experienced in Bali, but the food and beverage staff are quite disorganised, which is really a management issue. The hotel was completely full between Christmas and New Year, and they didn't cope all that well, but got a bit better when things calmed down, but it's a brand new hotel, so it still has some teething issues.

The room facilities are good, particularly in the suites, and an excellent bathroom.

This is not a resort style hotel....it is a courtyard style hotel, with a rectangular pool, catering for poolbar drinkers, lounge lizards, and kids, all in three different levels, and overlooked on all four sides by the rooms, and therefore it can get noisy, and well into the night. It is about 5 minutes walk to the beach, which is near the Legian/Seminyak boundary, and which is serviced by the type of beach restaurant bars which have thumping music and crowds of people under umbrellas, which is all good fun if you like that sort of thing.

I suspect that the hotel will attract those who like the Kuta/Legian format more than the more relaxed areas of Bali, but it's only a 25 minute walk via the back streets to Seminyak Square with all those great restaurants to choose from, so it is still pretty well located, and there are also plenty of bars and restaurants locally.....Gado Gado is 5 minutes walk.

We probably won't stay there again, but probably more because, after having been holidaying in Bali regularly for the past 28 years, we probably have become more used to the resort style of accommodation."
3532,Value for money,40,January 2015,"I just stayed at this new convenient hotel in Seminyak, surrounded by restaurants, shops and spas.
It is truly great value for money.
The staff are very obliging, but the big plus of the place was the General Manager who genuinely takes pride in this property. His willingness to chat to everybody and recommend fabulous restaurants, tour spots, and even organized a late checkout and hotel car for us when we left was very helpful.üëç"
3533,"""Peaceful With Great Hospitality""",50,December 2014,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott during our honeymoon in Dec.I guess we took the right decision to choose Marriott for our stay.This hotel is located just close by the beach as expected! Firstly would like to mention about the amazing staff in this hotel.....they are so friendly and helpful...they made sure that we enjoy our stay.We took the package along with the breakfast and that's something you don't want to miss out on.Our room was upgraded to the pool side view thanks to Mr. Shashank for it :) :) .The hotel is reasonable in terms of the rates and you won't starve as you can find your favorite cuisines within walking distance.The POOL area is spacious with an amazing pool bar.Perfect location for a peaceful stay to enjoy your honeymoon close to the nature.Me and my husband would surely recommend this hotel to all the travelers planning for a stay in Bali.

Regards,
Prachi & Varun"
3534,Fantastic Hotel in Seminyak,50,January 2015,"Just returned today from staying for 10 nights at the Marriott with my husband and our 17 yr & 14 yr old kids. From the moment we arrived the service at the hotel was everything that we hoped for after reading other reviews on Tripadvisor. Brad the manager (a lovely Australian guy) arranged interconnecting rooms for us and helped us with a map of restaurants in Seminyak that he recommended which we went to almost every night. All the staff were very friendly and greeted us warmly each time they saw us. The breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen in the hotel was a full buffet with everything available that you could wish for. This hotel was recently opened and felt very new and the pool was one of the best features of the hotel.
We hope to return to the Marriott in the future and would highly recommend this hotel to families or anyone wanting to stay at Seminyak."
3535,"A Hotel in Bali, not a Resort",30,January 2015,"Here at the moment, this is a very clean, new, small Hotel which is well located.
Every staff member we have encountered is very friendly & helpful. Breakfast has a great selection & we've found housekeeping very efficient, however no bottled water left in rooms at all???
Pool is quite big considering its not a Resort as such, & weve found it really nice to relax around the pool.
Hotel is 5min walk to filthy Seminyak beach, which is so full of litter at the moment we havent bothered to go near it. About a $2 cab fare to Eat St too which is so great as we are around here every evening to eat.
Personally, I wont stay again as the Courtyard does not offer the Bali ambience we look for when staying in Bali & the rooms are small.
However if this is not an issue for you, you will very much enjoy your time here.
Ill also add, the security in my opinion is definately not over the top, we really appreciate it, anyone complaining about this is a absolute whinger!"
3536,AMAZING!,50,January 2015,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights but I wished I booked for longer! It was my boyfriend's first time overseas and my first time in Bali, so I wanted to book in somewhere special.

I found out about this hotel through Groupon when they had a deal for it. After reading the great reviews about it on TripAdvisor I decided to go ahead and book and I'm glad I did.

I was worried that because we had a Groupon deal the service we would receive would be second class but this was not the case at all. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by staff and our reservation was taken care of. We were offered a fresh face towel, iced tea and iced pole as well which was exactly what we needed after coming straight from the airport. Check in was at 3pm (I think) and we were a bit early so we waited in their restaurant where we ate a complimentary meal (part of our Groupon package). The complimentary menu was limited and different to the paying menu. The food we received was good, not gonna complain since it was free haha.

I strongly suggest that if you book into this hotel you have the buffet breakfast option included. Breakfast was from 6.30am-10.30am. The food options were crazy! They had absolutely everything, catering to all different preferences and dietary requirements. From memory buffet breakfast included sweets like doughnuts, bagels, different breads for toast, jams, peanut butter, butter, bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, stir fry veges, yoghurt with assorted toppings, fresh fruit, cereals, milk (including soy), bottled juices, fruit infused water, a noodle bar and more. The quality of the food was excellent as well.

Room service is prompt and the pool bar was my favourite. They literally have a bar in the pool! The chips and wedges were delicious and they had great cocktails and mocktails. Happy hour was 4-7pm where if you bought one drink you got one free. If you plan to spend the day by the pool, I suggest you grab yourself a lounge early in the morning. The place is packed by 11am.

The hotel is new and very clean. For those people complaining about their room not being cleaned during your stay, we figured out that there is actually a switch you need to turn on in order for your room to be cleaned. We flicked it on everyday and always came back to our room made up.

Also, people are making comments about the stringent security. Every time you enter the premises you must have your bags scanned and you must go through sensors. It took less than a minute every time, there were never any waiting lines and the staff were sooo friendly about it. Never any accusing tones or suggestions were made. You weren't made to feel like a thief or anything. It was really assuring for me, especially when DFAT received threats of a terrorist attack in Bali during our stay. It was just an extra piece of mind for us. We always felt so safe at the hotel.

Overall, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The building, rooms and facilities are beautiful. The staff were so kind. The food was fantastic. The location was perfect. THANK YOU CY!"
3537,Excellent! Awesome Awesome staff... Fantastic location.. Superb Buffet,50,January 2015,"Best motel ever!! The staff were absolutely beautiful.. I wish I could mention them all!! Food was excellent.. Situation was great.. Walk to shops in Seminyak, Legian & Kuta.. Great restaurants close by.. Powerful hair dryers & super fast internet (you don't have to log in every time you use it) Only downfall was that the Beaches that were close by, were extremely dirty..
The only disappointing thing about the Marriott was that when we went to pay they added the 21% tax.. Which they fail to make that clear when advertising prices.. So check the actual full pricing first if you are on a budget..
We moved onto the Grand Nikko in Nusa Dua after this motel.. I was so sorry that we didn't make all of our stay at the Marriott.. Staff not as friendly, nothing to do except swim & the only things to rave about are the beaches & amazing pools.."
3538,"New, clean, friendly staff and good location.",50,January 2015,"We stayed New Years Eve 2014/2015 for 2 nights after travelling around Bali. Hotel is still new, therefore everything is in great condition, clean rooms and well maintained grounds. Pool area is big with swim up bar and adequate lounges and seating. Being New Year security was tight, when entering the hotel bags etc were all scanned and we were required to go through a metal detector. Staff were lovely, helpful and friendly. Reasonable price for rooms, our room overlooked pool area. Good location, near beach, shopping and spoilt for choice with restaurants. Would definitely recommend to friends."
3539,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location, Great Staff! A Gem in Seminyak!!",50,January 2015,"My wife, baby and myself stayed here for a week. Location- perfect! Short stroll down the road to the beach and about 10 min walk to Seminyak square(Central), just perfect.. Quiet. The hotel is fairly new so it's in good shape. The Staff- they really are the stars here, they are wonderful! Helpful,nothing was to hard and they all went above and beyond to make our holiday a relaxing fun one. Our Room- was lovely but on the small side. We had 2 suitcases and had to take turns as opening both would mean cutting the room in half, the bed is very comfortable and true to size king. The bathroom was nice with all the extras you'd expect , the shower was massive and my wife loved the rain shower.Housekeeping- our room was done to 5star standards everyday!, even our daughters cot was done perfectly, we had Herry making up our room and every day he would make up toy animals out of towels and leave them on our bed for our little girl... She loved them! The buffet breakfast would rival the best around the world. But their lunch and dinner menu could do with a bit of work in the way of choices, having said that the meals were fantastic... Their Creme Br√ªl√©e was the best we've ever had!!!! Surprisingly the restaurants around Bali have turned out some best ever dishes for us... Go figure?.. Great pool! Great pool bar! Good gym with life fitness equipment (good Dumbbells to) and a few treadmills all brand new. The spa retreat on site was great but cheaper options are on the doorstep. All in all a fantastic stay.. We wouldn't stay anywhere else and will be back no doubt! I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be close to the action without being in the middle of it."
3540,"Clean, nice and great location",50,January 2015,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in January. The place was clean and everything works according to plan. Get the breakfast package, you will not be disappointed. Service was excellent Marriott level. The price is really reasonable, restaurants are within walking distance. The beach however is a public beach and was really dirty when we stayed there."
3541,Beautiful 5 star hotel with relaxed friendly atmosphere.,50,December 2014,"Spent 3 nights at Courtyard by Marriott at the start of visit to Bali and we were absolutely delighted with the hotel. It is just a few months old and is beautiful. The huge two tiered pool is fantastic with plenty of bean bags, sun loungers and floating beds. The pool bar is great and provides a nice vibe. Amazing restaurant with so many choices and the option of indoor or outdoor seating, Breakfast was great.
The staff here cannot do enough to help and are extremely friendly. My husband sprained his ankle on day 2 so we called for the hotel doctor. He had just left to attend to something at the hospital but came straight back after receiving our request and was in our room within an hour tending to my husband. The cost was AU$120 which I thought was very reasonable and he came with a suitcase full of medication and medical supplies, and spoke excellent English.
Security is very high, we had to go through a scanner every time we entered the hotel. We found this very reassuring and not at all intrusive. The security staff are always friendly and smiling.
A short walk (5 mins) to Seminyak Beach and plenty of shops and market stalls near the hotel.
I travel a lot for work and stay in a lot of hotels and I was suitably impressed with this one. I like the fact that they have created a 5 star hotel with a friendly relaxed atmosphere. A perfect balance and a big tick for Courtyard by Marriott."
3542,New hotel with great service,40,January 2015,"We booked this hotel as our family was staying there for part of our trip and we're so glad we did!
Even arriving at midnight on New Year's Eve we were greeted with smiles, a welcome drink and a free room upgrade to a pool view on level 5 (ask for 5 or 6 if you can).

Rooms aren't huge but you're in Seminyak and likely to be busy much of the time. The bathrooms are great which to me is more important as this is usually where hotels fall down in Asia.

I'll brief the highlights of the room:
Super comfy bed - slept better than at home!
Good aircon and not noisy
Great shower and good cupboard space in bathroom
Nice balcony with love seat
Blackout blinds for morning sun
iPhone 5 dock for charging without worrying about converter plugs

A few small points for improvement:
Some drawers in wardrobe would be nice for underwear/tshirts

That's really about it ..

Breakfast is plentiful and varied - special compliments to Bill and his team at the restaurant. He went out of his way to fetch my uber Melbourne boyfriend an avocado - he may not want me to share that! But any request was met with smiles and an accommodating attitude.

The hotel manager, another Aussie, is always buzzing around greeting guests, clearing tables and making sure guests have what they need. I think his hands on attitude is great and could be seen more in Australian hotels :)

The pool is large and there's usually a chair and happy hour half price cocktails are great. Pool bar food isn't bad either and prices aren't too steep. And if you want to save a bit on costs grab soft drinks from the minimart across the road.

Very glad we chose this hotel and would recommend to family and friends who want a Bali experience of the hustle of the streets but want a nice place to relax and unwind."
3543,Great place to stay,40,October 2014,"What a great hotel.

In general I'm not a huge fan of Bali. However we wanted to get away for a long weekend and a Bali flight special popped up on my email just as I was looking at places in the south of wa. Why not!

We stayed here as all my previous visits had been Kuta noisy and crowded.

The hotel..
Very clean, very well priced ( booked direct in their website) and the staff were all very friendly.

Pool was amazing! As you would expect anyway, but no matter where you sat, the pool attendants knew what you wanted and took good care of you, refilling drinks, bringing water around and even reminding you about sun cream.

Security. Yes you read the reviews on here and unbelievable people are complaining about this.
Security was perfect. Felt extremely safe. Yes every time you entered the hotel the car was checked, your bags were scanned and metal detectors were in place but it works seamlessly, walk through and no delays at all. Best of all, you walked away knowing you were in safe hands.

Highly recommend this hotel/resort and we will be back!!

The management have a good thing happening here, all the staff were so helpful and friendly.

Thanks guys again for a great weekend away!"
3544,Well appointed and breakfast to die for.,40,October 2014,"Stayed here for a week towards the end of October (Thanks for the discounts Travel Zoo) in a first floor room facing the pool. Almost brand new so everything was up to date, sparkling and worked. Must mention the great broadband good speeds even managed to download a Movie.

Staff extra helpful, cant remember any issues with room makeovers and everything was always left spotlessly clean. Massive bathroom/shower by the way.

Only had breakfast in the dinning area - best ever- congrats to the Aussie chef and very attentive staff.

Ended up with a few Million bar bill from drinking 2 for 1 cocktails, beers and bar snacks but good value.

Probably is a bit on the expensive side but we got a really package deal and would definitively stay again if can get similar discounts.

Highly Recommend."
3545,Lovely hotel but ...,30,December 2014,"The highlights
- bed quality and size . So comfy I didn't want to get out of bed , and my girlfriend didn't have issues with me stealing the covers.
- pool size . Can do laps in the pool it's so big
- the finishing - lots of stone and kept well. Many friendly staff .

The disappointments
- too expensive . Seminyak is expensive generally however 300 per night seems excessive
- room service food was average at best
- drinks were pricey at the pool. We had a few cocktails , costed close to Perth prices. They were tasty though.
- House keeping slow. Took forever to get the room cleaned , even with a sign up. We ended up with dirty plates in the room for a few days. In their defence we turned house keeping away on the first day because we were both sick, but I'd hoped for faster service the following day. There are a lot of rooms and possibly they could have a few more cleaners. I had to call reception to get it cleaned in the end
- the TV needs to be ""dried out"" with the hair dryer . The motherboard gets wet from the air con and doesn't turn on. You'll need to pull the TV out and get drying for 5 minutes before watching.
... At least in our room

More negatives than positives but I will conclude that the hotel is extremely nice and well positioned , however I wouldn't likely stay again.

Stay in Ubud or Amed for 50-70 per night. So much nicer than Seminyak."
3546,Noisy Hotel!,30,December 2014,"This was our first time staying at this Hotel. The staff a lovely and the Hotel is clean and new. I had to follow up with house keeping every second day to ask them to make up our room as it wasn't done. One day I phoned 3 times and waited 4 hours for it to be done! However, when the room was cleaned it was done well.

My only issue was that the rooms face the pool & there is loud music played all day. From 6am - 11pm. This is very annoying for anyone who is sick or wanting a rest during the day, it is impossible to sleep! Plus you will then be woken up at 6am with loud music! The Hotel needs to consider guests sleeping at these times and turn the music down!

Brad the GM was lovely & friendly to deal with. He assisted me with our original Hotel booking & also suggested places to visit in Bali. I would stay at this Hotel again however there are other Hotels I would book before this one."
3547,First time there and love it,50,December 2014,"I just stayed there for three nights and love it. Its location is near to Seminyak beach and plenty of shops & cafes. It has great facilities: spacious new rooms, kids corner, great swimming pool, fitness center, even a pingpong table. Its staffs are very friendly and helpful."
3548,Fantastic Hotel!,50,December 2014,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights at this hotel in December and we thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent there. The service was par-excellence ! The hotel staff were friendly , courteous, warm and extremely helpful. I would specially like to thank the concierge staff who went the extra mile in helping us plan our itinerary during our stay.The breakfast buffet was scrumptious , with a good mix of traditional Indonesian and continental dishes. The location of the hotel is superb too. It is a short walk from the beach and there are plenty of restaurants, convenience stores and curio stores around it. We would definitely stay at the Courtyard the next time we visit Bali again."
3549,Great new hotel!,40,December 2014,"We stayed for 3 nights in Seminyak and really liked it! The hotel itself is brand new, clean and well located.

The resort is not big but offers everything a traveller might need. The rooms all have spacious balconies either facing them street or the pool area. Our room faced the street but was still very quiet at night. The rooms are of medium size, with a fresh colour scheme. The beds are very comfortable too. The bathroom was good, nice rain shower and seperate toilet. Perfect for us.

The main restaurant offered a great buffet breakfast but quite expensive for Asia ($30 per person). We also had lunch there and the food was really good, we were impressed.

The gym was new and well equipped. Although small, it wasn't always busy when we were there. The pool was also good but there were not enough lounge chairs. We could never find a place to enjoy the sun, which was a little disappointing.

For us the highlight was the location. It is right in the action! Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops to keep travellers entertained. It is also right next to the beach.

All around the service was fantastic! This property has amazing staff!

We loved it and would recommend it to everyone we know!"
3550,Lively and Buzzing,50,January 2015,"This is a new Marriott hotel in Seminyak. Seminyak is flash, brash and arguably a bit phoney. It's also the centre of life for hordes of the island's expats (many of whom own boutiques, design clothes, surf, or do seemingly nothing at all). The entrance is from behind the street and the hotel has a very smooth check in process. All the employees I interacted with (including security and housekeeping) were extremely warm, friendly and spoke very good English.
Easy to book, affordable, and great value for money. The pool bar is a HIT. Very lively and buzzing. Don‚Äôt miss the happy hours cocktails. Very engaging staff and even more engaging leader who is all around the resort and gives you a high five with a smile every time you pass him."
3551,Amazing hotel and excellent customer service!,50,December 2014,"We stayed at the hotel for Christmas and New Year. Our room was on level 5 so we had a great view of the beautiful hotel setting and layout, the pools are amazing and not over crowded. All amenities were great, beds very comfortable and room very clean and well presented. In a great location, close to the beach, easy to get to the restaurants, bar and airport. My friend had Bali belly the night before we were due to check out, the hotel staff are very helpful and allowed late check out at 3 pm for free of charge (normal check out time is 12 noon). The staff are very friendly and also greeted us and said hello every time they see us.

Very impressed and will definitely be back again. A big THANK YOU to all the staffs at the Courtyard by Marriott for accommodating. We had a wonderful time and wish that we could stay longer, 7 nights is too short :)."
3552,"Great Experience, Friendly Staff, Recommend staying here",50,December 2014,"I would recommend this hotel. My husband, daughter, son in law and grandson Spencer and myself stayed for 11 days over the Christmas New Year. The staff went beyond the call of duty for us especially the Breakfast staff. The head chef Billy was extremely friendly and organised a fantastic Xmas and New Year at the hotel. SECURITY IS A MUST these days and people not happy with this are very ungrateful. We will be back in 2015. Food was excellent. General Manager Brad was very friendly and helpful as was the Reception staff allowing us to keep one room until 6pm as we had a young toddler with us. I cant thank everyone enough."
3553,Great hotel,40,December 2014,"We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this hotel. Breakfast was great! The rooms were new and well decorated. The staff were very friendly. The pool was great and the swim up bar was very popular with many Australian patrons. The hotel should be complimented on their security. Yes, you need to walk through a metal scanner when you enter the hotel but it is well worth the few extra seconds.

The only negative was the very loud live music in the evening (this seems to be a problem common to many hotels in Asia), however it was the festive season so it did not bother us. It might be a problem for guests with young children. Also our mini bar did not get replenished (only once during our six night stay).

If your looking for a new western 5 star hotel in a central location then the Courtyard by Marriott should be high on your list."
3554,Good Location,40,January 2015,"Only 5 minute walking to seminyak beach. So many shop around hotel.

New hotel, staff are friendly and the food is delicious. The most importan is check in process only 10 minute. Its good to be back to this hotel again."
3555,Absolute bliss!!!,50,January 2015,"Had some drama with extending check out time in our hotel in Kuta so decided to join some friends for our last night in Courtyard. Only had king suite left by the time we decided to make the move.. Decided we might as well splash out. And what a treat it was!! An absolutely paradise, home away from home. Couldn't fault anything or anyone in the entire hotel from cleanliness to modern fittings to staff to cuisine! Courtyard is the place to be"
3556,"Amazing holiday, thanks to Marriott",50,December 2014,"My husband, 4 year old daughter and I stayed for 4 nights from Christmas eve and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The breakfast was sumptuous and we were spoilt for choice despite being vegetarians. The reception staff were extremely courteous, the free shuttle to the beach always available, housekeeping done on time whenever requested.

The massage at the spa was very good 2 out of 3 times, my daughter loved the kids club.

Can't fault anything at the resort. Would certainly come back and stay here the next time we visit Bali."
3557,Dissappinting,30,December 2014,"I booked myself in here for a night on my own before my friends arrived so I could move to my villa, thought I'd treat myself being a female on my own. Booked a direct pool access king room, and booked it months ago. Even re confirmed when booking my transfer that I could step directly into the pool.

On arrival I was told they were out of king pool access rooms (how can this happen when I booked so far in advance?!) and that I would be given 2 single beds, so they would give me my transfer complimentary in return. That was ok, as I was still looking forward to my pool access room....I was taken there and it was not direct pool access, it had a bit of grass and then faced the kids pool with at least 15 kids screaming and squealing!!! Not the pool I would want to use, not even the adult pool with the bar!

So after paying over 200aud for my one night to treat myself, I might as well have stayed in the standard room, or another hotel altogether. I felt really ripped off.

I also ordered found the security to be over the top and painful, it was like being at the airport every time you walked out, everything back through the conveyor belt and walk through detector! I've stayed in many nice hotels in Bali and they don't take it to this level, it's way over the top and annoying.

I was really excited about staying here but felt it was a total let down. Only plus was my lovely driver, he was great value.

Won't be staying here again."
3558,"Superb property, great staff.",40,December 2014,"I had a great time here.

The staff were top notch and nothing was too much of a problem.

I cannot believe some people are complaining about the lack of a vegetarian breakfast. Simply untrue. I am veget/arian and every morning thoroughly enjoyed the made to order eggs, abundance of fres/h fruit and of course the cereals, breads and pastries. What else exactly would someone expect?

Some guests there from particular regions (Russia and the subcontinent) seemed to be excessively rude and demanding of the poor staff and expected everything at the click of the finger. I however can not praise them enough."
3559,Fantastic Hotel,40,October 2014,It was a good hotel with very friendly staff and facilities. Pool is the highlight. Security is good and is of prime importance in a place such as Bali where we had some issues some time ago..food is also very good.
3560,SHAMEFUL MARRIOTT SHAMEFUL ! 0/100 worst hotel,10,January 2015,"I am GAURAV ADLAKHA( May be it can be Gauray Adlakha in your records because of front desk mistake which was so many times told to rectify as well) I stayed in room number #560, one of the guest who came to enjoy new year at your property on my honeymoon with my wife. I choose your property by trip advisor rating & reviews by booking.com in Augest when it was just opened up , I also depended on the brand image of MARRIOTT group which I had in my eye because of this brand image I booked your hotel for 3+2 nights from 29/12/2014 to 1/1/2015 & 1/1/2015 to 3/1/2015. Earlier I was planning a split stay 3 nights with marriott & 2 nights with some other property but by brand image I made it a 5 (3+2)nights stay with you guys but at the end of my stay I felt CHEATED , exactly if I would tell u few of EXPERIANCES I face , u would agree me. I would like to share my experiences with you.

On day one(evening time ) of arrival I asked the front desk officer to charge me for both my bookings to avoid Inconvince to me but he refused & asked me to come on 1st jan from when my 2nd booing started & I REQUETESD him to allot me same room for all my 5 night stay as booking was of same category but he said not possible I have take this matter to manager for clearance, it took 1 hr for them to commit me the same room & yes please to inform you that Welcome drinks were served upon demand only. YES AS WE WERE HONEYMOONERS DEMAND A GOOD GREATING & SPEPICAL ATTENTION ALLREADY MENTION AT THE TIME OF BOOKING 5 months ago & AT FRONT DESK THEY JUST WANTED TO CHECK & I MADE 2 MORE CALLS ON THE SAME DAY TO HAVE A CONFORMATION THEY JUST DENYED, HOW LOW WE FELT THAT TIME.In room Refrigerator was not working, we complained and it 45 mins from your maintainace team to approach.

On Day two,in breakfast restaurant as we are vegetatian asked for some special attention could only get a cappuccino & bread in name of meal. As we had activites planned for the day we came at 8 PM still the room was not made up properly. NO BROOMING OR CLEANING UP OF FLOOR AT ALL ,WET BATHROOM FLOOR AS WE ARIVED , REFRIGERATOR NOT WORKING AGAIN, NO DENTAL KIT I EVEN BELIVE CLEANING WAS NOT EVEN DONE ON ANY DAY DURING STAY.

On day three we had same breakfast issues like yesterday no vegan meal available. LINNEN WAS NOT CHANGED & we called them to change it ; they asked ""sir , are u going some where today?,"" I said ""yes ""they replied -""we will do it when u will leave ""but IT WAS NOT DONE. We asked for scissor at around 8 o clock and called them for 3-4 times for same & can not immagine this at all got a cal at 09:30 that it is not available in the property for use they can provide a cutter to cut the dress price tag. I flet pretty amazed that a 5 star property dennies for a scissor. I was shocked.

Day 4 , 1st jan , early morning 8 clock we went for the breakfast the staff alloted us a table, in another 2-3 mins she came back and says ""Sir , I think today ur room is without breakfast "", I asked the lady to re confirm else let me finish it & I Produce the voucher or I'll pay . She rudely said ""I HAVE ALREADY CHECK IT WOULD HELPFULL TO HER IF I PRODUCE THE VOCHER BEFORE STARTING IT EVEN I AM READY TO PAY IF I DIDNT HAD A VOCHER. I was SHOCKED coz all my booking prior done with all inclusive of breakfast. I asked her to call the manger here it self she told me he is at front desk u can meet him there only.
ON DAY ONE OF NEW YEAR EARLY MORNING WE LEFT THE BREAKFAST & went to meet the night duty manager. I've then produce the VOCHER & he conformed that breakfast is included but we actually missed it because we were having a planned pick up at 08:30 am & share him all the problems I am facing from the house keeping like cleanliness & all I even asked me that MY FIRST BOOKING EXPIRES HERE CAN I PAY FOR 2nd BOOKING NOW, he assured me I can pay it at my convince later because Cab was already waiting . He promised me the same room to continue and he would check the cleanliness himself.
On arriving back at 8 we directly went to the room , we were shocked to see that the key was not working , we reported it to front desk they said u have to check out because of end of booking , I even asked him to check for my note of new booking in morning I was told by manager that both my booking has been matched & I can continue the stay & all this took 1/2 hour to check it MOST EMBARASING I WAS ASKED TO PAY THAT VERY MOVEMENT FOR A FRESH CHECK IN . I told the guy my card Is my room make a new key for me I will bring the card and pay, HE EMBARAZED US SO MUCH THAT SIR KEY CAN BE MADE AFTER PAYMENTS ONLY, I've told him I am an existing guest then he called the manager , ""manager went with me with keys to the room for pick my card for payment "". I know payment is a big concern but embarazing a guest is not good. AS WE WENT TO THE ROOM WITH MANGER MADE HIM SAW THE ROOM THAT TIME NO HOUSEKEEPING WAS DONE IN 12 hours NO HOUSEKEEPING AT ALL . Manager went shocked I even told him night manager promised me a smooth room in night but UNFORTUNATELY NOT A PIECE OF PAPPER WAS LIFTED BY SUCH A BIG GROUP .
""S H A M E F U L L""
What left to compliant more!!

Next day we left the breakfast coz of EMABRISED mood yesterday and called housekeeping for 2 plates & a butter knife , It WOULD BE HARD TO BELIVE FOR PLATE AND KNIFE I HAD TO MADE CALL ATLEAST 4 times and on LAST CALL LOST MY PATEINT ALSO. It exactly took 35 mins to revice a empty plate from you guys ,
""VERY VERY SHAMEFULL for MARRIOTT"". I let this know to the duty manger the same he excused us with over occupancy in hotel & realised a bottle of CHEAP RED WINE in anticipation & promised me a spa & room decor . Please to imform you No dental kit, comb & conditioner in room again.

On the last day we pleasing met the manger in morning he asked to spa today, we said yes. We made the booking for 2nd jan 01:30 pm booking we meet him again at 01:15 PM on the way to spa , he joined on the way to please us we asked him to decorate the room or attleast make it clean until we get the spa treatment done for 2hours , he promised us for the same . We left our room on housekeeping mode so that the time we would be back it should done, we meet the house keeping person on way tipped him good so as he can make the room clean on time. As the spa was done we went back to the room at around 4 STILL THE ROOM WAS NOT DONE THE GUY WE TIPPED HE I THINK JUST ENTERED THE ROOM & was STARTING TO MAKE UP THE THINGS. I CALLED THE MANAGER STILL THE ROOM YET IS NOT CLEANED FORGET THE SPECIAL TREATMENT & DECORE ATLEAST IN 2 hours time it should be done. WE ASKED HIM TO ARRANGE A CAB RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE CHECK OUT RIGHT NOW COZ WHERE CLEANLINESS IS NOT CONCERNED WE CANNOT STAY.
He sends guest relationship manager Miss Cinndy ( not sure for name) to solve the matter she was also shocked after inspecting the room that how bad it was done. She offered us a complimentary drop up to airport tonite & send some cheese to clear up the matter & promised a clean room in few hour as we left for dinner cruise at 04:45 pm.

""Sir you would be shocked to know was it intentionally or unintentionally room was the same!
Forget about the decor , forget about pleasing us after having word with so many concerned people if still the room was not made ""
As for my self respect I didn't called them again but shown the room to duty manager as and when we left the room.

ALL THESE EXPERANCES LOOKED SMALL THE BIG CONCERN IS WHEN I ARRANGED A WAKE UP CALL FOR MY FLIGHT or CHECK OUT AT 01:30 am, I WAS SURE THESE GUYS CAN MISS IT WITH AN EXCUSE SO I PUT AN ALARM IN MY PHONE FOR 01:20 am & YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED THAT THEY ACTUALLY MISSED IT & I CALLED THEM TO INSPECT IT , THEY SAID THEY MADE A CALL WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP is this exuse worth any reason when no call is made. I would like to request you to kindly take up all this as concern & inspect about the wake up call at most because people depend on you guys for that, let them relax peacefully !

I WROTE ALL MY EXPERIANCES HAD IN AT MARRIOTT , it's like a BAD DREAM, I think it will take time to forget such a WORST OF WORST EXPERIANCES AT YOUR HOTEL. Bali is not in my dreams now coz of such a poor hospitality. As being such a big property you guys improve up the level of satisfaction of the guest.

I would rate MARRIOTT A BIG ZERO FOR HOSPITALITY & STAFF BEHAVIOURS. I tends me to think over & over again was that intentional or only I had such a bad experiance. I would wrote the same letter to booking.com & ask them why they suggested me this kind of a worst property where guest satisfaction is not consider a assert of business."
3561,Blissful Relaxation,40,December 2014,"We had a very relaxing stay at Courtyard Bali Semimyak. We had actually booked different accommodation before arriving in Bali but quickly realised that it wasn't adequete for us. So we did some window shopping and came across Courtyard Bali Seminyak. We decided to have a drink at the dining area after viewing the nice room. The very friendly waiter Agus served us. He was very helpful and helped us in making our decision to stay at Courtyard Seminyak based on his excellent service.

The housekeeping overall was good, except there were a few inconsistencies depending on which house keeper(s) was working. For instance, we left a generous tip for housekeeping on our first night, but didn't receive the comp bottles of water or any acknowedgments. The following day we left a smaller tip and received a note of thanks and comp water bottles provided (4 in fact!). Can't remember that housekeepers name but he kept the room very clean.

Drinks were ok however there were a limited choice of cocktails.

The hotel is very new, opened Aug 2014 and you can tell. Everything from the decor to the bed sheets look very new and clean. The pool is beautiful and has two levels, upper - where the pool bar is and the adults hang out. Lower - more suited to families and where the sun beds are.

Overall a great stay and we will hopefully return in 2015!"
3562,"A professional hotel,...",40,December 2014,"its a Marriott. Just like many others across the world.
Rooms are a bit small, especially compared to the other hotels one has stayed in across Bali.
Breakfast is great, service is good.
Unfortunately, Marriott missed in on adding in the Balinese touch."
3563,"If you like peace and quiet, don't stay here",30,December 2014,"We are currently staying at this resort and I feel compelled to provide honest feedback for anyone considering staying here. As single women, this hotel has been a complete let down. Started off in a pool room close to the pool bar - BIG mistake. The noise from the music at the bar is completing ridiculous and far too loud. We could not even hear our own tv in the room one morning. Since then requested to be moved to another room at the far end, another mistake. All we can hear whether we are in, or out of, our room is other people's children screaming, crying or sqealing all day long! This is not the fault of the guests, but a design fault the the hotel failed to consider. All rooms are pool facing and the pool runs the length of the hotel complex.
Another major problem is that there is nowhere near enough sun lounges for the majority of guests. Again, this needs to be looked at. Every guest should be able to stay by the pool for the day should they wish, unfortunately this is not an option for many and we witnessed numerous people trying to locate somewhere to relax.
In terms of the rooms being serviced, again, I expected far more from a property such as this. Our minibar has not been replenished in 4 days. We constantly have towels missing, soaps not replaced, etc, etc. This is just not good enough.
On a positive note, breakfast is fabulous, large array of choices and the staff are very friendly and more than accomodating.
If the Courtyard by Marriott is able to address some of the problems that I mentioned, it would be a great place to stay. However as it stands, I would not choose to stay here again."
3564,"Yes, it's a Marriott",50,December 2014,"Another success for Courtyard Marriott. The property is designed well. Staffs are very attentive and helpful. Thank you for the upgrade, we enjoyed our stay with you. Cindy, our GRO was very helpful, arranging our transport and our restaurant booking.

Breakfast is excellent. Love the fresh juices. Definitely will go back again.

Note on the side, use your google or trip advisor to find popular restaurant near it. Many popular place to eat or hang out near the hotel."
3565,Room and Pool Bar,50,November 2014,"I highly Recommended for this Hotel for everyone, The best swimming pool ever for the stay and also the staff very friendly and Service oriented. the food was excellent and the price reasonable.
Buffet Breakfast with a lot of choices."
3566,Lovely people and service was great,40,November 2014,"We were at this hotel in November 2014. I had read previous reviews about the security putting a dampener on the holiday but honestly it is not a problem at all. The security people are very friendly and it is a quick process. Nice hotel with a great buffet breakfast. Rooms are not very big even the executive suites but functional, comfy beds and big showers. The service is prompt and the local people who work there are mostly young people and very hospitable. I loved the spa treatments at the hotel- way more luxurious and relaxing than you get out on the street! Overall a good hotel- however because of its minimalist design features, it lacked the traditional Balinese charm which is something i would have appreciated."
3567,Great hotel,50,December 2014,"We had a great 4 nights at this hotel. Check-in experience was smooth, and our room (family suite) was reasonably sized, though not large. Good selection of bathroom amenities. Staff was courteous and helpful. The pool is large, and nice pool bar. Breakfast was included in our price, there was a good selection of both western and asian food - great eggs benedict, and decent coffee. We had a few other meals at the hotel too - generally good quality food at reasonable (though not cheap) prices. The spa was good too. Location is a 5-10 minute walk from the beach. Lots of touts outside the hotel who hassled you on your way to the beach, which was a bit annoying but not the hotel's fault. We will stay here on our next visit to Bali!"
3568,Recommend,50,December 2014,Great hotel. Staff are very helpful and nice. Great atmosphere with awesome pool bar and live band. Breakfast is delicious. Close to restaraunt on the beach. The hotel offered to drive us to the beach in their golf buggy. On arrival we were offered a Bintang. New hotel. Bed and pillows so comfy.
3569,OK but security spoils the atmosphere,30,December 2014,"Ok hotel.
New, clean.
Rooms are quite small. Too much furniture. Soaps etc limited. No cotton buds??? Not enough storage space to unpack your bags. TV doesn't work when the rooms are humid.
Security borderline ridiculous. Airport security is more lax. You get scanned and xray every time you enter the hotel.
Pool music way too loud and unnecessary so don't expect to sleep in if you have a pool room. They tend to crank it up now and then maybe to get you out of the rooms so they can clean them.
The restaurant gets packed so plan early or you'll have to wait.

Recommend a room AWAY from the pool bar."
3570,Luxury Escape voucher booking,30,December 2014,I have also bought Luxury Escape Vouchers for a family of 6 and have now booked for August. It took several emails to get our booking confirmed but I think if you are patient and book ahead and not at the last minute you will be rewarded with a fantastic stay at a very affordable rate. Please remember you are emailing to Indonesia where English is a second language. We are very much looking forward to our stay. Lee Scott.
3571,an affordable marriot,30,December 2014,"as the tittle mentioned, this is the affordable version of marriot type. it includes almost everything : the meal & the room service. the nicest element is the design with very large pool as the center. this hotel is pretty new so the interior looks really nice. but, the drop off is the security service that a bit stiff and not too friendly. recommended for family with young kids."
3572,Very Impressive Hotel,50,December 2014,Stayed for a week over Christmas with my 15 year old son. Service was impressive and rooms were clean and well designed. Our room over looked the pool on level 6. The breakfast was amazing with both western and Asian cuisine. The only thing I could fault was that the cafe latte was definitely not barista made. I walked up the street every morning for my latte. I liked the fact that security was tight especially over the Christmas period. You have to have a security check every time you enter the hotel. Almost forgot to mention the massages at the hotel were superb and were much better than the cheaper ones out in the street. Only $30 for an hour of bliss. Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Bali.
3573,Expensive and every extra is costly,20,December 2014,"We booked last minute online towards the end of Decembre 2014.
The rooms are overpriced. There is a 2cm gap on top and bottom of the sliding door (balcony) towards the street, It is VERY noisy ; if you have booked there, ask to have a room facing inwards on the pool. Also make sure the breakfast is included.

The food is average (quality) and expensive. Phone calls from the rooms are EXTREMELY expensive (like US$70 for a few minutes!).

The breakfasts were not included and we all had to pay US$28 per breakfast. The food was OK - classic self-serve breakfast seen in many big hotels.

Dinner was SLOW; we waited a long time to get told that the cocktail on the list was ""new"" and that the head cocktail guy was not working today. The food was OK but nothing fancy.

The pool is nice but not much sun, as it is surrounded by the building.

Rooms are small, but modern with goood air con and nice TV.

The location of the hotel is good. Lots of bars on the same street, open late, and on the other side, you can walk to the beach.

Overall it is not a bad hotel but I definitely felt ripped-off. I've seen much better value for money."
3574,Love it,50,December 2014,"We stayed at Courtyard Marriott with our two children 10 and 8. We had a deluxe pool view room with two double beds. Although the room was not huge, we were aware of the size at the time of booking as we had inspected the hotel prior to booking. We loved all the amenities, pool, restaurants and facilities. The breakfast was superb. Our daughters loved going to and from the kids club.
We enjoyed it so much we have rebooked for 2015 and are bringing with us our parents."
3575,Everything you want in one small but fabulous package.,50,September 2014,"Loved this place. It's not massive. The rooms aren't big, but it's enough to give you what you want which is comfort, quality, style and relaxation.

The service we got there was top notch. The manager Brad and Executive chef Billy were always so helpful. We never received this kind of attentive service when I stayed in a big resort in Thailand.
I want to come back with the kids next time to show them what an awesome hotel.
My only negative is that it is a smaller hotel and it's good for a smaller family. The rooms are not huge and the deck chairs around the pool get take up quickly if you arrive middle of the day.
I'm coming back with my 2 kids and leaving the partner home for next trip. My kids being quiter kids I know will love it."
3576,Great stay,40,November 2014,"The hotel is new, good value during promotion. The rooms are small however modern and meets all your needs. We originally had different rooms however when we checked in, there were problems with our air-conditioning so we were moved to different room that were not inter-connecting as requested. Communication between staff at reception could be improved as the same requests were met with different answers depending on staff members. The breakfast at Marriott was fantastic and could tempt even the fussiest eaters; they're loads of choices for all different cuisines and it's great to see the Executive Chef greeting customers and aiding his fellow chefs. There are lots of restaurants and supermarkets opposite and around the hotel that cater to all your needs and the beach is only about a five minute walk away or you could ask the staff to drive you in a buggy to the beach and eating areas. The pool's more than satisfactory with complimentary bean bags and the staff walk around hourly with complimentary refreshing towels, icy poles drinks. All in all, a great stay!"
3577,Luxury Escapes,10,December 2014,I too am waiting for a reply. I have been emailed once to say my dates are available but that was a week ago and nothing since despite being asked if I want to proceed with my booking. Even an estimated date that we will be emailed the information would be good but lack of communication is very disheartening.
3578,I'd love to stay but.....,10,December 2014,"I also bought a luxury escapes deal, after 12 days and multiple emails I find out my dates are unavailable. I was offered a lower class of room or the option of upgrading for additional 1200usd (insane amount). I got a refund on the voucher then emailed the resort to make a standard booking and guess what...2 days later no reply. Not good enough Marriott, I'm taking my business elsewhere (and I'm a very regular traveller to Bali)."
3579,"Great stay, excellent service",50,October 2014,"We stayed here in October 2014. We got pool access rooms that were beautiful. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and always had a smile on their faces. A big shout out to Cindy Meilani who provided us with excellent service and attended to our every need. We even got a Balinese souvenir, which was very thoughtful. Thanks for a great stay!"
3580,Excellent service friendly and would come back,50,December 2014,"Just want to say thank you to Cindy , Cinqo and all management for efficiency in resolving our room issue . Jaka thank you for the stretching and yoga it was a great experience and also to all the staff at the swim up bar could not fault their service . Kitchen seminyak food was brilliant could not fault. We will definitely be back. Had a wonderful holiday . Angelique Wessels room 360"
3581,Very good stay!,40,December 2014,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak from December 18 to December 22nd. The hotel is still very new and it is very clean. The rooms are very modern and the pool is big and spacious. Although the hotel is not directly in eat street which is Seminyaks hustle and bustle, it is very close to it and there are still many shops, massage places and it is directly opposite to a mini super market, commonwealth bank atm and a legit money changer (that wont rip you off). The hotel is also very close to a lot of boutiques and restaurants.

The only problems I had with the hotel was that the compendium stated that there was supposed to be an iron in the cupboard, but there was none in my room, and there was only 1 bathrobe in the room when most hotels provided 2. The breakfast was also not that great, the fried rice, mee goreng and the noodle soups in particular tasted bland and lacked the flavours that Bali is known for. Besides those small issues, the rooms are great! They provide you with all the bathroom amenities you need including a digital scale to track all the delicious Bali food you are consuming!

My most memorable experience would have to be joining happy hour by the pool bar from 4pm to 7pm for some delicious half price cocktails and bar food!

Overall a very good stay and I am sure because of how new the hotel is, it is only going to keep getting better over time!"
3582,Reservations shocking,10,December 2014,"Purchased a voucher from luxury escapes for a pool terrace room deal. What an ordeal.
To cut a very long story short it took the Marriott 1 week to reply to my initial email of dates that I wanted, only to be told those dates were not available. When I questioned that I still could purchase that room through there web page, there reply was , we only allow a certain amount of rooms for this deal and they are all sold. As my voucher is about to expire within the next couple of days, trying to organise another rate ( which I told them I was prepared to pay extra) has been a nightmare. Rang the hotel twice to get them to reply to my email, still waiting . Don't ask questions because you won't get answers. Especially if you ask had they not of taken 1 week to reply to my initial email , would the room been available then. Very frustrating. Beware. 1 person taking reservations is a joke."
3583,Stay was NOT long enough!,50,December 2014,"In short, this place is fantastic. I cannot understand how this place got 2 ""terrible reviews"". Security was certainly not over the top, the security staff were extremely friendly and the security checks caused minimal, if any, disruption.

The food.. WOW.. We enjoyed two dinners in Seminyak Kitchen. The first were the Bloody Mary burgers which were fantastic! Second dinner experience was an Indonesian Buffet.. This was just as brilliant. The winner though, were the breakfasts. The choice and quality of the food was out of this world! The staff were extremely friendly and my partner and I were greeted every morning by our first names. Coffee and tea was always offered despite other reviews here.

The room was clean, spacious and really enjoyable to stay in. We had a great view of the pool and the room was cleaned and maintained daily. The air con was a godsend on the hot days. We could not hear another thing outside of our room which was surprising given how busy it is nearby.

The pool and bar staff were exceptional. We were greeted by friendly staff every day and offered fresh towels. Thought the morning we were given free ice cold waters and although we left early, we saw visitors enjoying cold ice blocks also. The pool bar staff at happy hour are the best. Like with the restaurant, the staff at the pool bar really helped make this memorable.

We have currently just arrived at Sofitel in Nusa Dua and we feel like it's so lifeless and disappointing compared to our stay here.

We WILL be back. Thank you."
3584,"Wow, will definitely return!!",50,December 2014,"Wow, this place is amazing!!!!! From the moment you arrive you feel like you are in paradise, so many nice touches, from the fresh flowers handed to you in the car while they complete their security check, to the welcome drink & cool towel whilst checking in, does it get any better than this?! It does!! We were shown to our room & had our luggage delivered straight away, ordered room service the first night as we got in around 10pm, it was reasonably priced, quick & delicious. The buffet breakfast is to die for, the BEST I have ever had. The staff are all amazing, friendly & willing to help with anything & everything you may need. The pool is awesome, comfy pool lounges, super comfortable pool beanbags & a swim up bar with a daily happy hour and live music. I usually stay at Sofitels when I travel but I couldn't go past the opening special at this hotel, we have just arrived at Sofitel Nusa Dua for the last leg of our first trip to Bali & all I want is to be back at the Marriott in Seminyak, if my rate at Sofitel wasn't pre-paid I'd be in the next taxi back to to Marriott! Thank you so much to all of the staff who made our stay absolutely amazing, we will most definitely be back."
3585,Luxury Escapes,50,December 2014,We booked recently with a luxury escapes voucher for next year so I thought I would write as I saw complaints. I have booked a voucher deal with a company only once in the past and it didn't go well as they were or had gone bust so I was a bit nervous but figured as it is a Marriott it should be ok. The voucher was easy to purchase and I checked if we could have our dates straight away with the hotel on an email that was given and no problem with getting the dates we wanted. It was really easy and I was told the Marriott looks forward to when we stay in August & we are excited too as I have been reading the reviews here & it all sounds good!!
3586,The Bestaz!,50,November 2014,"We arrived late from our flight and our cab was checked as we entered the premises. This is done every time for your safety, now worries then bags removed and we proceeded to the desk to be greeted in very warm, welcoming fashion. We were offered a cool drink and moist cool towel. Check in was very quick and courteous.
We proceeded to our room and were so pleasantly surprised. All the reviews that had been written about this hotel were 100% true. A lovely room and a balcony that we could sit on and look down at the pool. We were in room 534 on the 5th floor. The room was quite at night and sleeping was so nice in a great comfortable bed. Fresh toiletries were replenished each day when the room was done and that always was done perfectly.
Next morning breakfast was absolutely fantastic. The Australian head chef wandered around each sitting and spoke to the guests and even at night we again were blessed with their company. We ate there on two occasions in the evening and were never disappointed. There was one very attentive waitress who served us on many occasions. She had worked at the Marriot in and I would give her 10/10 for her smile and genuine friendliness.
We had a full body massage and a face massage, you have to one those. We just loved them.
The weather was not all that good and they tell me May is a good time to visit, but trust me we still had great time. Our last day we spent at the pool at the bar as the sun finally showed up and had some great snacks there also.
Each time you go in and out of the hotel, your bags are checked. As an Australian and having been to Bali before I took all the medicine in case I got Bali belly‚Ä¶ not needed. And after the Bali Bombings when over 100 Australians died and many injured, I hesitated for a long while to go back, but I must say I felt completely safe at all times. I would even let my daughter stay at this hotel.
We were granted a late checkout and just chilled out in the computer room until our taxi arrived to take us to the airport for our evening flight back to Sydney.
Wifi was very quick."
3587,Well appointed room,40,December 2014,"Pleasantly surprised. Room is router than it appears in Internet photos. Lovely firm bed, four good pillows, duvet-great sleep! Block out and sheer curtains even better sleep.
Amenities provided very sparingly - just two tea and coffee sachets, one toothbrush and robe...waste not want not, I suppose it makes sense.
Nearly 60 channels on TV???
Lovely view of the pool fr our 6th floor room looking up the length of the pool towards the foyer. Jet lagged, loud bird calls from the roof so was up early watching the pool attendants at work pre-sunrise from our balcony.
One thing though-the number of light fittings and switches in This room is mind boggling, great for lighting but a hide and seek when you want to turn off the Lights before going to bed, or is there a master switch undiscovered?"
3588,Great hotel,50,September 2014,"Really great hotel, from outside the street is crowded, but once you come inside, it is totally different. It is very cozy and relaxing. it seems all room have pool view, very nice view with pool bar. good service and good breakfast. they have kids corner with many activities."
3589,great price and location,40,December 2014,"Stayed 4 nights, got free breakfast and upgrade to pool view room. Live band during happy hour (4-7!) near the pool was a bonus.
Excellent location and great price for spending time in seminyak or exploring bali"
3590,Comfortable Stay,50,November 2014,"The stay at the hotel was very nice. The staff and services were excellent. The location of the hotel is also central with markets, restaurant etc near by. The beach is 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Do not miss using the pool bar if you are staying in this hotel."
3591,Great service,50,December 2014,I stayed at the Marriott for 2 nights before I went to the gili Islands for 3 nights and then returned to Marriott again. The hotel was kind enough to store our large suitcases while we were on the gili Islands. The safe were great and very friendly. The breakfast was a great way to start the day. although seminyak isn't the greatest place to be the hotel was perfect and would recommend it to anybody planning on staying in seminyak
3592,Superb Hotel and Excellent Service,50,December 2014,"I stayed here for three nights on a business trip to Bali. The check-in process was a bit lengthy but thereafter everything worked like clockwork. The staff are all highly trained, well spoken and have good command of the English language, and many more. Nothing seems too much for the staff, who are always willing to help. The rooms are of a pretty good size, many with balconies. The whole property (opened only 3 months ago) seems to be well maintained. The gardens and pools are a very attractive feature of the property. Breakfast is absolutely superb, with almost everything you could wish for at the start of the day. Altogether a really good choice. I will be back here again"
3593,One of best hotels in Bali,50,December 2014,"Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott last week for 7 nights.
WOW What can I say, could not fault a thing, from check in to check out the staff should be commended as they were extremely professional & polite, special mention to Billy in the Seminyak Kitchen for breakfast which was just sensational everything you could want & Werdiana Putra for dinner, these guys went out of there way to make sure we were happy & satisfied with our food. The pool staff especially Candra were so friendly and approachable nothing was a problem, a lovely happy face to see each day.
The rooms even though a little small but not a problem were of high standards, clean & comfortable. The wifi throughout the hotel was no problem.
Overall an excellent hotel which made our holiday a very enjoyable & relaxing stay.
As a frequent visitor to Bali we will highly recommend the Courtyard Marriott to anyone wanting a hassel free relaxing holiday, we will definitely be back in August with family."
3594,"Great Hotel, Location and Staff",50,December 2014,"My wife and I travelled to Bali with some friends, and we chose to stay at the Courtyard Seminyak due to the great location and that there was an opening special on.
We were all very happy with the hotel. Being newly opened, it was fresh and clean.
Buffet breakfast was sensational, with a wide variety of food (I need an egg chef and noodle station at home now!).
The coffee at breakfast could be a bit hit and miss, but that is the only tiny negative.
Staff were really friendly and helpful, from reception to the pool bar, to everyone else working the grounds, housekeeping etc.
Rooms initially seemed a little small, but we were only there to sleep at night, so it was not a factor. The pool view rooms are quite nice. The gym had enough options to.give you a good workout plus there were other fitness activities on offer by the hotel.
Location is great - we walked to all the main shopping streets in Seminyak, but if we were feeling lazy, it was just a quick taxi ride.
Free wifi was available in room and in all public areas - great speed considering everyone using it and even better than I get at home.
I would definitely consider this hotel again!"
3595,Great for brand new hotel - nothing that needs changing,50,November 2014,"Only a 5 minute walk to the beach, 10 minutes the other way you're on the main street, and 15 minutes down the side road you're at the restaurant strip. Pool is awesome, good pool bar. Great variety of drinks, food - not always way you're expecting, but always tasty. Staff - super friendly, pleasant and nothing is a problem. Always a smile and hello when you pass a staff member.
Room - awesome. Just down from the pool, third floor. It's above the kids corner/day care so in the morning it's a little loud but not to bad. Room was always super clean after servicing, never an issue. Would stay here again with out doubt and would recommend.
I travel a lot and this hotel had the best GYM I have ever seen - small but it had ample of everything. Great work Marriott."
3596,Great value and services,40,December 2014,"I just got back from short trip to bali and I stayed this property for 4 nights, It is a brand new hotel and it is more on a bussiness and leisure kind of feel to it. The check in was seamless and quick. The reception team was amazing.

The room
It was suprisingly small compare to other hotel with the same value for money. Clean and decorated with minimal art work. The bed was comfortable (kig size). The housekeeping was just ok nothing to be shout about. However, on my 2nd day the house keeping was excelent they even folded my scatered clothes and aranged it neatly. kudos to whoever u were ;). The aircond was cold and well functioned. The wifi was extremly fast as I was in the 6th floor. The hotel could do better in term of sound insulation as I could hear other guests next door. If you opt to not being disturbed by live band playing evey night, I would suggest the highest floor.

Toilet
Medium in size with nice fixing. Eventhough, the hotel is newly opened, the glass panel in my toilet was broken I did not complaint as it was not a major issue. The water presure was good. The ammetties provided were adequate. I did not have any problems with the toilet except for the glass panel issue.

Breakfast
Probably the best in the seminyak area. A lot of choices from local to western dishes. My fave was pancake with luicious chocolate sauce. It was scrumptious. However, the noodle station could do better on its brooth seasoning. I found it to be a bit salty. Other then that the dishes were delicious. The excutive chef went around and talked with the guests which were very proactive.

Pool bar
The cocktails were refreshing, however the selection of food were limited, friendly staff.

Zanti Spa
It was clean and warmly lit. The service was just ok. I had two sessions and it was just average. The staffs could be more friendly and willing to help guests eventhough they seem not willing to do it expecialy at the gym. Since most of the time when I was there the gym was empty. On the positive note the massage was amazing.

All in all, the hotel was great in value which cater to every guests need. Strategicly located around cafes and restaurants in Seminyak area. Easy acess to Seminyak beach and getting around the hotel is not much of hassle. However, there are some area which needed to be look into namely house keeping, spa, gym and perharp the condition of room. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I shall pay a visit whenever Im in seminyak. Cheers!!"
3597,Amazing!!!!,50,December 2014,"My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights and we had the most amazing time. This hotel is stunning! Staff are super friendly and happy to help in any way possible. We were on the 6th floor and it was a great view of the pool and really quiet.
Food is exceptional, especially the Nasi Goreng. Food is also very reasonably priced for the quality.
Buffet breakfast is incredible and a very big choice! Eggs made to your liking, sweets, noodles, toast, bacon and so much more.
Happy hour is 2 for one from 5-7 and the cocktails were delicious.
Pool is a great size and very clean.
There is a general store right across the road to buy water, snacks etc. beach is a short stroll and the sunset is worth it!
There is not one negative about this resort! It's amazing. Anyone who had complaints must be extremely fussy!
Thank you for an amazing stay. We will be back!!!"
3598,Anniversary Weekend,50,December 2014,"Had an absolute wonderful weekend away for our anniversary. We stayed 4 nights early December and arrived on a very stormy evening where the hotel was experiencing a minor technical problem due to the very heavy rain. We couldn't get into the room we had booked that night however Brad and the staff sorted this out very quickly and went to great lengths to ensure we were well looked after and not disadvantaged. Highly recommend this hotel for modern facilities including a great pool and swim up bar, comfortable clean rooms and very friendly staff. Loved the little extras including staff greetings and wishes, the special card and cake delivered to our room and not to mention local restaurant recomendations. Would have to be one of the best hotel breakfasts in Bali all in a great location. Thanks Brad, We will be back and bring our friends
Regards,
Ray & Jackie from Perth"
3599,Expat Beach Getaway,50,December 2014,"A great get away for anyone coming to or living in Bali. We have been living up in Ubud and needed a beach break. At first we nervous about the Courtyard brand as in the States Courtyards aren't considered anything more than for business trips but this has a fresh new design and fun vibe. AMAZING breakfast with Western, Balinese and other Asia treats. The staff is on top of things with asking if you need coffee while constantly cleaning. During breakfast various sample treats (mini puffed pastry) are pass around giving you a chance to try something you might not normally do. Nice to see proper pork bacon being served. It's a great location to beach (5 minute walk) and restaurants. Fun pool w/bar daily happy hour specials. Wifi by the pool with you are digital nomad who need to work while relaxing. Some of the friendliest and helpful staff in Bali. Marriott really has come up with something exciting for the Courtyard brand, well done!!!"
3600,Excellent value and location,50,November 2014,Stayed for 4 nights in November. Booked a suite room because there were 3 adults. There was plenty of room in the lounge area for the extra bed. There was also a dining table with four chairs and sofa with another chair. Bathrooms are large and the shower larger with an amazing shower head - total rainfall effect. Beds/pillows/linen are good quality and very comfy. Check in was smooth and the staff extremely helpful. Breakfast was excellent - quality and variety of food was great. Pool area is a winner - long enough for serious lap swimmers and yet plenty of cushions to float around on. Mixture of pool lounges and bean bag chairs - nice change. And plenty of towels - no signing in and out - yay! This is a new hotel (opened 1/7/14) on the corner of Jalan Drupadi and Dyhana Pura - opposite Breezes. There is a well stocked mini mart across the road that also offers a reputable money changer and ATM's as well. This hotel offers real value for money - only a 5 min stroll to the beachfront. And free WIFI both at the pool and in the room!! There is also a kids club and safe pool area for the children. Definitely will be returning soon!
3601,"An amazing hotel, Absolutely unbeatable at this price point",50,December 2014,"We have enjoyed six nights at the Courtyard, booked a fantastic deal directly through the hotel website.

Being regular guests of some very high end hotels (W in Seminyak, Crown Towers Melbourne, Venetian Macau) I was originally apprehensive about booking a hotel in this price range, however due to the excellent reviews it had been getting I decided to give it a go, and so glad that we did!

My wife and I came with the intention of having a rest and relaxation style holiday, enjoying excellent food, a little shopping and a lot of time by the pool. The courtyard was an excellent base for this, the location is superb, only 10 minutes from most of Seminyak‚Äôs best restaurants, a short 10 minute trip to Legian or if you wish only 20 minutes to Kuta.

Our room was adequate for the stay, it is fairly small, but with plenty of room to store your luggage, a generously sized balcony and reasonably sized bed, we did not feel cramped. It is a pity the Bathroom‚Äôs are not more luxurious, with no Bathtub and fairly cheap tap ware it is unfortunate as this is the one area that the hotel simply cannot compete with the ‚ÄúBest‚Äù of Bali (Albeit at a fraction of the cost).

Service in the hotel is amazing, the guys at the pool bar are some of the best I have experienced across many hotels in Bali, always happy to have a chat, a lot of fun and actually confident enough to show their own personality, it is very refreshing to see hotel staff take off their ‚ÄúHospitality Face‚Äù and make friends with the guests. Loved it!

Daily activities by the pool, whilst I did not join in, appeared to be being enjoyed by many guests, again, with super enthusiastic and fun hotel staff running them. The pool itself is awesome, with three levels, top level with pool bar, second level with two waterfalls and pool lounges and then a shaded area at the back (With great noise insulation) designed for kids. The only frustration here, was guests who allowed their noisy children, to play in the adult area‚Äôs of the pool, It is a pity guests do not think of others quiet enjoyment of the facilities before they let their children run riot (Not the hotels fault though, they unfortunately cannot filter guests at time of booking). The only other thing I will mention, is having the same band play during happy hour (Which goes for 3 hours) whilst was great the first night, after 6 became quite tedious. Maybe try and mix it up with some house DJ's, Live Bands, Vocalists etc?

We used the Spa facilities twice, once for a facial and massage and the other for a standard massage. Both times, the treatments were excellent, very good value for money and in spacious and comfortable rooms. The best thing was, I was able to get in at very short notice.

Food and Beverage was of a high standard, but not brilliant, Breakfast is exceptional, with great food quality, some of the best Coffee I‚Äôve had in Bali and seeing both Billy the Chef and Brad the GM go around collecting plates and interacting with guests is impressive! Unfortunately though, the pool side menu is very limited and of quite low quality (Think: Deep fried chicken, spring rolls, wedges, french fries and chicken satay), would have been good to have a proper menu with things such as Pulled Pork Rolls, American Hamburgers and Hot Dogs, Seafood dishes such as Garlic Prawns and Oysters etc. Same as room service, The food quality was fine but very limited and very boring desert options. One of our favourite things in Bali is enjoying desert late at night in our room rather than at the restaurant of the evening, we could not do that here due to the limited menu. I was surprised at the lacking menu both poolside and room service wise as this would be an excellent revenue stream for the hotel which is clearly under-utilised.

I had a minor concierge related issue on our last evening, I sent a quick email to the staff asking for Brad to contact me, even though he was off site I had a phone call within an hour and he was very genuine in his concern. Couldn‚Äôt speak highly enough of Brad!

Overall, with a few minor complaints, this is easily one of the best hotels we have stayed at in Bali, from now, the biggest compliment I can give is that if the current pricing stays static, it will no doubt become one of the hotels we regularly stay at in Bali."
3602,A memorable stay,40,December 2014,"Execellent value for money, lovely and welcoming staff.

Clean room, wonderfull pool, and best of course is the staff.

However the breakfast buffet is not yet at 5 stars level, only ar 4 stars level... but we are fussy customers and it was overall very nice.

for sure we will come back."
3603,Great New Hotel,50,November 2014,"I chose this hotel for my family vacation because it was just opened in August. It was a right choice considering many choices we have in Bali. I am sure many of us find it difficult to find a perfect hotel in a place like Bali and choosing the new Courtyard in Seminyak is the best decision I've made. The check in was pleasant and we was attended warmly by the reception staff although it was peak time at 2 p.m. During check in, I basically bargaining for upgrading & complimentary extra bed for my 3 children. The staff was gladly attending to my request and allowed us to upgrade with complimentary extra bed. What a nice way to begin our vacation! For this I feel very appreciated by the staff. The room was new, comfy & cosy with settee at the balcony facing the pool. The kids really enjoy their stay especially the pool, kids club and their breakfast every morning. We stay for 4 days and every morning we are all excited to have our breakfast. The fruit variety was commendable and everything taste very good. We enjoy the pool so much especially the 'floating mat'. I manage to jog to the beach one morning. It was just less than 5 minutes run to the beach and the experience was just amazing. Surely will come back to this hotel one day."
3604,Better than expected,50,December 2014,"Stayed for 5 nights as a couple, great service throughout. Quite a new hotel, so everything is in good order. Like most Marriotts in this part of the world, service is really good, especially during breakfast. Not much happening outside the hotel though, it's easily 20 mins walk to the main shopping street and Bintang Supermarket. Good security as you would expect of a marriott hotel. Fantastic pool and pool bar, well designed guest rooms ensures everything works well. Most public areas are not air conditioned but you really don't realize it due to the good design. Do recommend a pool view room would suffice if you can get it. Pool access rooms are for aficionados only and not really worth the extra. All in all perhaps the best value lodging in Seminyak."
3605,"Fantastic stay, lovely staff, great location",50,December 2014,"My husband and I travelled to Bali with some friends, and we chose to stay at the Courtyard Seminyak due to the great location and that there was an opening special on.
We were all very happy with the hotel. Being newly opened, it was fresh and clean.
Buffet breakfast was sensational, with a wide variety of food (I need an egg chef and noodle station at home now!). Reports from the coffee drinkers in our group were that coffee could be a bit hit and miss.
Staff were really friendly and helpful, from reception to the pool bar, to everyone else working the grounds, housekeeping etc. Yes, there are things that we noticed could have been done better (such as our room keys access being extended in line with late checkout), but overall, the staff were so friendly and obliging that we didn't mind.
Rooms initially seemed a little small, but we were only there to sleep at night, so it was not a factor. The pool view rooms are quite nice.
Location is great - we walked to all the main shopping streets in Seminyak, but if we were feeling lazy, it was just a quick taxi ride.
Free wifi was available in room and in all public areas - great speed considering everyone using it. Australian hotels, take note!
I would definitely consider this hotel again!"
3606,Excellent! New clean and friendly!,50,December 2014,"We can not say enough great things about this hotel. The staff is amazing from the groundskeeper, security, front desk, pool, housekeeping and restaurant staff are all amazing and hard working. Our only regret is we aren't staying longer. We would highly recommend staying here."
3607,First Class,40,November 2014,"This is a new hotel so everything is pristine and fresh. The quality of the hotel is reflected in the price but it also has that Balinese friendliness that is so typical in all hotels. It is not a 'character' hotel which some people look for in Bali, it is more of a corporate/leisure hotel catering mainly for couples. I only stayed one night unfortunately but was impressed by the service, breakfast, staff and amenities. Will definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends."
3608,Amazing,50,December 2014,"This hotel is the epitome of amazing. The food, the pool, the rooms, but most of all the service. We spent 10 days in this hotel and by the end we were so sad to leave. The staff became like family to us, they were so friendly and could not do enough to help you. The breakfast buffet has so many choices and all the food is of top quality, even after 10 days we were not slim of choices. The service in the spa is impeccable, we left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated and again we could not fault the service. Another great thing about the hotel is all the great activities offered throughout the day, yoga, stretching, aqua aerobics were great to help us keep active and keep our mum entertained as she finds it hard to chill out :) special mention to Jaka, Yeani, Rudi and Hariyanto who were amazing and made our holiday with their great service and friendly nature. All staff are trained well, it is hard to fault this hotel, we will be back and will remember this beautiful holiday forever."
3609,Excellent value in a top location,40,September 2014,"We visited Courtyard Marriot in Seminyak at the end of a trip back home to New Zealand, and needed a few days r&r in Bali before heading back into London winter. I was initially reluctant about booking, as I usually prefer more traditional Balinese accommodation when in Bali, however the Courtyard was freshly opened and had some fantastic deals for bed and breakfast.

On arrival after a long flight, we were treated to scented face towels and a cool drink. The hotel feels more like an apartment complex set around a beautiful pool (hence the 'courtyard, I'm guessing') and being brand new, the rooms were amazing. Perfect beds, great shower and bathroom (always a must for me when travelling!) and delightful staff. Big shout out to the restaurant manager, an Australian chef who laid out the most amazing (complimentary!) breakfast buffet every day and would stroll around the room talking to guests. He even recommended a surf school for us. And proper coffee - made by a good barista! Rare when travelling in Asia, but we had a fantastic flat white each morning.

The location is spectacular, right in the middle of Seminyak and a few minutes walk to the beach. We didn't need a taxi as walked everywhere, including to dinner each night.

My one criticism (and it feels a bit petty!) is the poor availability of sun loungers by the pool - particularly because half the pool is in shade after midday. It was near impossible to get a good lounger in the sunshine next to the pool unless you ran down after breakfast and 'reserved' one (a habit I hate!), which didn't always make for a relaxing start to the day.

Would highly recommend this property for travellers to Seminyak. Four star rating as despite all the perks and the excellent service, it retains the slightly bland feel of a 'big chain' hotel."
3610,Perfect hotel for young & old,50,October 2014,"Stayed at this amazing hotel in oct of this year. I can not stay a bad world about it. From when we arrived and there staff came and opened our doors, grabbed our bag & offered us a welcome drink and cold towel. The rooms are a good size and everything is so neat and tidy. We had a room right at the back and this location was very good and could not hear any noise. The staff are all so welcoming and so nice they walk around the pool all day offering free refreshments and always asking how you are and how has your day been. They also have a lot of activities on around the pool all day from games to water Aerobics. The hotel is so clean and the staff are always trying to make it look better then it already is.
This hotel I would recommend to every to stay at and when my girlfriend and I go back to Bali will will be staying here again."
3611,Fantastic Hotel in a Great Location,50,November 2014,"I stayed here with a friend towards the end of a 10 day trip to Bali/Gili. It was absolute luxury. Highlights included the amazing buffet breakfast spread, hot water and fantastic shower pressure, clean bedrooms with new facilities, block out curtains, fantastic pools, lovely attentive staff, free fast in-room wifi. It is in a great location - short taxi ride to the heart of Seminyak or Legian, but with lots of cheap massage places, restaurants, bars and convenience stores right next door. I would definitely stay here again."
3612,Great new hotel worth a stay,50,October 2014,"Stayed hear in October for 4 days and had a great time, brad the manager is Australian and made our stay fantastic with his hospitality, the location is great close to beach and restaurants, we stayed in a walkout pool room, I would recommend."
3613,Great New Hotel in Seminyak,40,November 2014,"This new hotel offers everything in its properties. You don't need to leave the hotel at all, unless you are looking for the beach and night life.

Smooth process of checking in, room facilities was great.

One thing perhaps is, there is not enough sun beds to go. This period isn't a peak yet and all the beds were taken up. Imagine during peak seasons...

Breakfast was great. It's a huge spread and will cater to all kinds of people; the savoury and sweets peeps.

Pool Bar food was normal. It serves it purpose to offer food for the guest to the hotel. However the menu was rather boring, mostly burgers, chips, salads and some local favourites. The hotel can use with more choices.

The gym is decent. Offers the essentials. However the shower facilities could use a little improvement, like providing a hair dryer, some bench spaces or lockers, cater for people who has checked out and waiting in the hotel for their flights out of Bali.

All in all, great place to be, clubs and some nice burger places around the vicinity. Great choice to stay if you have family, otherwise it's a good choice for any weekend vacation."
3614,Nice and New hotel in Seminyak area,50,September 2014,"It is a new Courtyard hotel in Seminyak area. Room is very nice, clean and quite big. It comes with two double beds, so it is good for family of four. Check-in and out was very smooth and fast. Staff is very helpful and knows their jobs well. Wifi is free, fast and good in all areas of the hotel. Breakfast is very good with many varieties. Pool is nice and big, so it is not that crowded, eventhough many people are in the area. Overall, it is a very nice hotel to stay when you are in Seminyak area."
3615,nothing to complain about,50,November 2014,"Stay for 4 nights and the way for it was soo smooth!! Mr.Yogi at the desk was extremely helpful and there was nothing complain about. Room was clean and well maintained, georgeous pool, nice bean bags, delicious breakfast.. wish could stay longer... :))
This hotel is fit for family and friends who's looking for pleasure, it is not away from the art market, local spa, and anything you need for holiday..."
3616,mother daughter trip,40,November 2014,"I travelled with my daughter for a short trip. From our first impression with Courtyard by Marriott everything was handled with efficiency and professionalism. Check in was efficient and quick (which doesn't always happen in Indonesia). The rooms were very nice and clean, although very small. We only took carry-on luggage, but if we had suitcases there is nowhere to put them in the room. The bathroom was clean although the amenities were not refilled each day. The amenities were of good quality, but just the basics. The pool was very clean, and well maintained. Breakfast was lovely with a great variety. If you wanted anything that wasn't on the buffet the staff were happy to make it for you. The Manager/F&B Manager and Executive Chef all walked around greeting guests and helping to clear plates, which was very nice.

The room smelt of smoke which was disappointing for a new hotel which is supposedly smoke-free. The Reception team offered me a room move, but we decided to decline (our choice).

I would recommend Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak to friends and colleagues, although if the stay was for longer than 6 nights a bigger room would be recommended.

Perhaps a smoke-free area around the pool would be a good idea.

All in all a lovely stay."
3617,"Had a fantastic time, great attention to detail!",50,November 2014,"We stayed for nearly a month while in Bali for a combination of business and holiday. We had just such an amazing time and felt like family by the end. In particular we LOVED the care by the Kids Club - our daughter turned 5 during our time there, and the hotel management and staff went out of their way to put on an AMAZING party for her with all the trimmings and for all the hotel kids. We also felt especially looked after by the breakfast staff and by Brad, the General Manager.

Great rooms, great staff, great care. And can't argue with the value!"
3618,Absolutely fantastic,50,August 2014,"After 10 days in Ubud, we needed to splurge and relax on the beach.
This hotel is perfect. I recommend also the restaurant which serves great food.
One thing they need to improve is the service at the restaurant, the waiters are too attentive. for example, as soon as I finished eating the waitress took my plate away and ask me which dessert I wanted, not waiting for my wife to finish eating.
The hotel is well located, a walking distance from the beach also."
3619,"Yoga, massage,and kindest stuff",50,November 2014,"I have enjoyed my stay at marriott, particularly because of the extra offerings of the hotel and the kind stuff. The morning yoga classes with mertayasa are the best way to start off your day with fresh energy. Then you get the best breakfast and enjoy the pool and again smiles... I can definitelly recommend this place ..."
3620,top from check-in to check-out,50,November 2014,"we stayed there during the first two nights in Bali. Ordered transportation via hotel to pick us up from the airport, which is about 30 minutes away, depending on traffic. Amazing facilities, the hotel is fairly new (opened August 2014). Great pool bar with live music and happy hour in the afternoon. They have two pools, one more suitable for families, and the one with the pool bar for a more younger crowd. Rooms are above the typical courtyard room you would picture....very sleek and modern, great bathrooms. Breakfast is great, all things there, great service. Only flaw: no beach access, but you don't miss it with such great facilities and pool set up. Definitely again."
3621,Fantastic Hotel,50,November 2014,"It was great we all loved the hotel stayed here on a girls trip in twin share rooms.

Clean, new, modern great facilities

Plenty of pool beds, pool bar

Rooms had good size beds in twin share huge showers no bath if people are looking for one.

Balconies a little small

I would say on the pictures for a deluxe pool view room online it shows a ground floor room opposite the pool. But we were given rooms on the 2/4/5 floors with balconies facing the pool

So may want to specifically request ground floor. So didn't keep us together but let us check in when we got there at 11am and have us late checkout till 3pm at no charge

Staff super friendly and attentive and security just like the stones scan bags everytime you come back which gives you peace of mind

Well priced food and drinks

Easy to walk to restaurants /shops and to get a cab

Breakfast huge choice and open till 11am proper coffee/lattes etc included

Would definitely stay here again"
3622,Overall a Positive Experience!,40,November 2014,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott in November 2014. The hotel was new and rooms were clean and functional. First night was not great as we had a group of people by the pool outside our room at 2am and it seemed to take quite awhile for them to be moved on. Apart from that our stay was very enjoyable. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was AMAZING! Spoilt for choice and the chef was always wandering around asking if he could get you something special. I would come here just for the breakfast! The pool was nice, loved the bean bags to laze around in after a day's shopping and pool bar is great. Cocktails are a bit on the expensive side for Bali but still reasonable. Probably not a hotel I would bring my kids back to but great for couples or friends."
3623,Amazing breakfast but........,40,November 2014,"This hotel serves amazing breakfast. A great variety of hot food, lovely egg benedict made to order, sweet pastries, fresh juices. It's definitely one of the best hotel breakfast I've had.

The room is quite small but functional. However I'm disappointed with the general cleanliness of the room. The floor feels dusty. There are stains in the bathroom walls and floors. The bed sheets have brown spots on them.

The Kids Club is not great and staff there are not pro-active in arranging activities for the kids. I left my kids there for 2.5 hrs and all they did was to watch tv the whole time they were there."
3624,This new hotel rocks an incredible breakfast!,50,October 2014,"We stayed here during October for one week and enjoyed every moment. Our room on the pool side of the hotel was a good size and clean too. The pools were great and made to suit adults and children. But, the buffet breakfast was by far the most amazing breakfast we've ever had at any hotel EVER. There is such a wide selection and every possible breakfast option you can imagine - including icecream to top it off as you walk out the door and into the sunshine. Both Balinese and 'Western' selections were plentiful.

Having never been to Bali, Brad at the front desk gave us some ideas for day trips out of Seminyak as well as local places within walking distance and/or taxi to dine. The beach to watch the sunsets is a five minute walk from the hotel. Our package deal at the hotel included wifi and breakfast which were fantastic to have. We wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel."
3625,Expected More,30,November 2014,"We spent one night in the hotel and to be honest left feeling under-whelmed. Having stayed in some amazing hotels in Bali, the Marriott left us feeling a little disappointed. Everything was ok, but nothing was great. This reflected the cheap price of the room. The rooms were ok at best. We found our sheets to be damp. The pool side area was crowded. That said breakfast was fantastic. Given it is so easy to find the wow factor in Bali, this hotel fell a little short of our expectations."
3626,"Good service & excellent courtesy by staff,other things are just icing on the cake.",50,November 2014,"A must stay if you are in Bali for the friendliness & courtesy of the staff.
The ambience & other facilities are par for the course.
The poolside is the place to lounge on a lazy evening after a hectic day's activities.

Keep the good work going Marriott."
3627,A Most Memorable Vacation!,40,November 2014,"I have done quite a fair bit of ""research"" on the wide selection of resorts in Bali before deciding on the new Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak. First impression matters most to me and I must say that the hotel had definitely ""wow"" me in this regard. They have implemented tight security checks upon guests' arrivals, the staff were well-trained and it was a smooth and efficient process. We were greeted warmly by the front desk staff and check-in was a breeze. The staff were very friendly and attentive, especially Eka and Hardi at the Concierge who had helped to arrange the next day's tour, excellent services! The room was spacious and had a warm and Zen decor. We love the pool a great deal and spent hours just lazing on sun bed, reading or had a dip in the magnificent pool. The swim up pool bar is a gem too. The facilities such as the 24-hours gym and Zanti spa are well-kept and worth visiting. Seminyak Kitchen provides a wide selection of international cuisine and their buffet breakfast spread just wet your appetite, do try their Signature Salmon bagels for a light lunch or Ikan Bakar for dinner - Delicious! The staff are very attentive and you get to see either the Managers or chef greeting the guests and engage in friendly conversations during breakfast time. Overall, Thumbs up for this new resort and to the management and staff! We had a wonderful stay and definitely be coming back. (^_^)"
3628,Fantastic hotel,50,November 2014,"My wife and I have had the best relaxing holiday at the courtyard Marriott,The staff were amazingly attentive, the Quality of the food at breakfast was superb,the room was large,clean and spacious what more do you want. We'll be back for sure"
3629,Gorgeous retreat,50,November 2014,"I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 2 nights and it was bliss. The staff are lovely and accomodating and engaged in ensuring you enjoy your stay.
I arrived earlier than the 3pm check in time and they sorted me out with a room immediately I also organised late check out till 3pm and that was fine. Room is a good size, comfy bed, great shower etc. The pool is amazing. Buffet breakfast was huge. You could eat there for a week and not have tried everything. Security is great and not that hard to go through, if you get your taxi to drop you off outside when going back and forth you can save time from getting the taxi checked. My only criticism is organising a car, you can get a taxi for youself and barter a cheaper price to go somewhere rather than using the hotel car service. I used hotel car to go to dinner and paid 100, rp got a return car for myself for half that price and could have gone less if I cared to bargain.
But having said that its a hotel service and its easily accessible so they can charge as they please.
Would happily stay here again in a heartbeat."
3630,Still has the new hotel smell,50,October 2014,"Great experience here. Friendly staff, modern amenities, everything is super new and clean. Still had a few decorative items missing from my hotel room it was so new. I knew they were missing because I could see into other rooms, as they are all facing the pool area.

Breakfast is served in their main restaurant area, buffet and self-serve style. So much selection, made on the spot. Amazing space to be in, with delicious food, great servers and help.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seminyak."
3631,"Location, service and quality",40,November 2014,"The hotel location is in a great spot in Seminyak within walking distance to Eat St and 66 Beach. Of course if you are lazy like me and want to save the walk in the heat they will drive you down to 66 in golf carts. The rooms were clean and fresh as the hotel is fairly new. The bathroom had a rain shower head and a large shower, the aircon was very cold which was great at night and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast at the hotel was actually quite good for a Bali hotel with espresso coffee included. The staff were attentive at all times and seemed genuinely friendly. The pool bar was like most others with cocktails a and assorted snacks that are a little more expensive but nice. The best feature was the activities like aqua aerobics which I did not participate in however created a fun and lively atmosphere. My only complaint would be the lack of an adequetely trained concierge. We struggled to get simple directions or recommendation however fortunately we had tripadvisor and google maps to sort that out"
3632,Outstanding and Friendly Customer Service,50,August 2014,"Our family recently stayed at the new Courtyard by Marriott in Bali with together with relatives from Canada, Australia, USA, and Indonesia. We all really loved the hotel. The location is really convenient to the beach (5min walk) and to the local shopping scene (5min walk) and it's surrounded by little spots to pick-up your goodies or snacks of food. We also walked up the beach to KU DE TA as well. As a Marriott, the hotel also has all the required amenities should you need to do a bit of work while relaxing. Whilst this is the Courtyard brand - you should realise it's much nicer than the same brand in North America. The pool was great and the spa was really lovely as were the other facilities and the team have done a great job in maximizing the privacy and use of space. For the rooms, we stayed in the first level rooms near the end of the pool in the ""U"" section. The rooms in this area and in the corners really have a nice private feel. We would choose those again as it was great to be on the first floor and have the kids walk straight out to the pool. The best part about our stay was by far the staff. They were all excellent! Brad (GM) and Billy (Executive Chef) have really picked and trained a great bunch. The team is so personal and we felt like we were all treated like super stars. We were particularly impressed by the restaurant - the breakfast was really awesome and changed so it was always enjoyable and we really loved the way Billy and the chefs bring in some local snacks and indoensia recipes, flavours, and treats into the mix. So much of this has been lost in other spots and it was just simply great to have authentic components in the meals and in the tastes. We even thought the Sato Ayam was a good as my mother in-laws (she is from Jakarta)! All-in-all we had a great time and truly would stay and recommend this as a nice spot to relax, take-in the area around Seminyak, feel like you have a home away from home with smiling staff awaiting, and all this while not spend all of your $ doing it."
3633,Simply Excellent!,50,November 2014,"We have enjoyed staying in Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak during our department group trip between 7 and 9 November 2014. Excellent service was provided throughout our stay, would like to mention two front line managers Selvia and Retha for their great hospitality and customer service! Could not ask for more for their patience and hard work to accommodate all our request, from transport, rooms to additional last minute requests, and not to mention there were around 200 of us flying to Bali! Thank you for all the work that you and your team have provided, making our trip in Bali extra memorable!"
3634,Incredible,50,November 2014,"Have just spent 10 days in this amazing hotel and what a wonderful stay we had. The location was great with the beach a 10 minute walk, mini mart, massage places, restaurants all only 2 minutes out the front foyer. The rooms were spotless, roomy and the bed was comfortable. The staff were amazing, Dewi at the front desk was exceptionally helpful to us organising our free meals and massage treatments which we had gotten through a special deal website. The 2 hour massage we had at the hotel was great however the singing from outside near the pool was distracting as there was also the traditional Bali music playing in the room so I think that when the singer is by the pool perhaps the music inside could be turned off so you can only hear one. We had 2 lunches and 1 dinner in the restaurant as well as breakfast everyday and each and every meal was superb. Breakfast in particular was the best and most varied I have ever eaten in any of my travels, waffles and ice cream for breakfast, guilty treat but so yum!! The couple of minor irks in my opinion were the pillows were way to soft, just personal choice I guess and the fact that guests go down to the pool in the middle of the night. The first time was 3.30am when my daughter rang to complain and then had to ring back 20 minutes later as they were still there making noise and a couple of days later at midnight there was a group of 8 people all partying down there again so again daughter rang and complained and had to ring again 15 minutes later to ask them to move the people along again. I am all for having fun but there were a lot of families around with young children and people that like to sleep at that time of night so I think that they should be stricter on keeping people out of the pool or at least keeping them quiet so they don't disturb everybody else. I will also mention that the day after the secon incident when we got in from shopping the was a bottle of wine delivered with apologies from the hotel for the inconvenience and the noise which was a lovely thing to do, unexpected but very nice of them. All in all this was a great place to stay, I have been to Bali around 12 times now and have stayed in some wonderful hotels but for location, staff and food this would have to be my favourite"
3635,Truly Satisfied,50,November 2014,"spent our 25th wedding anniversary at this hotel. Clean new and comfortable. Beach is a walk down the street. Very convenient. Staff friendly, service oriented and always with a smile. Breakfast is with good variety. Gym is open 24hrs Bathroom is big. Perhaps can do with more hanging hooks in bathroom we were surprised there was a cake with anniversary greeting on our check into room did not disappoint"
3636,Brand New hotel-Good,40,November 2014,"We stayed here for 8 days in November 2014.
It has only been open for 3 months and we thought there would be a few problems but we were wrong.
We had a great time at this modern hotel.
It had quite a young clientele, and a few of us in our 50's. It's quite a trendy hotel with young staff.
The pool is great, plenty of sunloungers available.
Our buffet breakfast was included and was fabulous, incredible variety of food.
Food is quite expensive at the bar, as taxes are added and a surcharge.
Walk outside the hotel and there is a local restaurant 50 metres up the road, nice food and inexpensive.
Enjoy your stay!"
3637,The friendliest staff we have ever met,50,October 2014,"This is one of the new hotels. We booked this despite the beach not being adjacent since we had read good reviews about it; and we were not disappointed.

We were two families, so when we reached there, I requested for two connecting rooms. It wasn't available, but we were assured that the next day, a pair is getting free and we would be informed proactively without follow ups. I had a lingering doubt in my mind, as I have been subjected to false promises many times in 5 star properties. The next day morning we left early to see places and returned late in the evening. I had almost resigned to the fact that by then, even if the rooms were available, they would have been given to someone else. To by pleasant surprise, when I entered my room, I saw a letter on the bed requesting me to contact the reception as soon as I got back so that the rooms could be changed. In 5 mins, we were in the connecting rooms.

That was not the only experience which made our stay memorable. We had two children with us. It's important for the place we stay to be child friendly. Everytime we had to speak or deal with any staff, we came back happy with their smiling service. You always get the feeling that they naturally are interested in you and not faking it. It is so important.

The best part of the hotel is that it is located bang in the middle of a shopping street. Within a kilometre of distance, you get everything. Curio and antique shops, restaurants, pubs, massage parlours, convenience stores, it's all there. Besides, the beach is a 5 mins walk from the hotel.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling with family."
3638,Awesome!,50,November 2014,"I would recommend this hotel, the service and facilities are good. I arrived pretty early at the Hotel and the staff, Sila, was kind enough to accommodate my friends and I with the early check-in and the rollaway bed was complimentary as well. (I paid for a suite room and travelling with 2 other people)

Went for breakfast that very same day we arrived, and the spread has more variety than most hotels. Egg station was quick as there was 2 chefs manning it (usually there is only 1 chef). Everyone was on their toes, ready to serve.

Absolutely love the swimming pool there, it was considered large and there were sunbeds in the middle of the pool too. (there was shelter too, so that is a plus point!)

The hotel provides turndown service too, and I was surprised to receive VIP amenities on alternate days. (That is quite thoughtful, considering that I wasn't expecting anything in the first place.)

I guess the only downside is that only on the last day, we found out that the hotel provides some activities throughout the day everyday. It would be good to have this placed in the rooms or sent through the confirmation letter, so that guests are aware of it. It is a pity that we did not get a chance to participate in the daily activities.

But, all in all, this is a good hotel that I would recommend to my friends. And this would be one of my choices to stay in should I return to Bali."
3639,One of the Best!,50,November 2014,"I had the great pleasure of visiting this property for five nights this month. I stayed in the gorgeous deluxe pool view room which was spotlessly clean and impeccably designed.
The room is hotel style which means there's space but it's no villa. I have a great view of the pool which stretches throughout the centre of the property. The bathroom is spacious and the shower is to die for!
The service at this hotel is over and above. The sweet staff constantly greet you and adhere to every wish and query - even the dumb ones I had were answered kindly. Every night the beds are turned down and everyday the rooms are clean.
The buffet breakfast is pretty great although I would avoid the doughnuts as they're kind of tasteless.
The location is handy but you require a cab to eat street. I wouldn't use the massage parlour immediately to the left of the property as it's a bit terrible.
All and all I'd recommend this property to friends, couples and families. It's fresh and customer focused. You couldn't have a better stay!"
3640,Loved Staying at This New Hotel,40,October 2014,"My husband and I went to Bali in October and we hadn't been in four years, so realized that there would be new hotels to stay at as we are usually Sanur stayers. I did some research and we knew that we weren't in to the hustle and bustle of Kuta but still wanted to be within a short taxi ride of whatever we wanted to see or do. So decided on Seminyak!

I did some more research, read reviews and even posted questions in forums in regards to this hotel, being that it is new, it is always hard to gauge opinions etc. In the end we booked with Courtyard. Boy did it live up to our expectations! We arrived and were checked in immediately, even though we were early, we received our free room upgrade as promised and were given a pool view room, with help getting our bags to the room as well. The room was spacious, had a huge walk in shower, separate toilet and separate hand basin. The bed was comfy, however pillows were the annoying pillows that when you place your head in them, they just sink in, so there was no cushioning to them. Our balcony looked over the pool and bar area, so we could always see what was going on and in the early evening when they had singers in the bar area, it was lovely sitting on our balcony reading and listening to their singing. We did however notice that there wasn't much storage in the room. My husband unpacked his suitcase, however mine was placed on the floor to live out of. We probably should only take the one between us, but I am a bad packer!

Loved having security at the door, as bad as that sounds, sometimes it is a nice touch to know that 24/7 we are safe.

The breakfast was amazing! Such a great spread, I only had muesli throughout the stay, with some toast here and there, but the husband loved the hot spread that they had! Just beautiful! The staff here were always so happy to see you each morning!

The staff throughout the hotel were incredible and made you feel at home wherever they could!

The pool and bar were advertised to close at a certain time, but I could usually hear people outside past these times, so would ask that maybe next time, they are a little bit more strict with the closing of the area and asking people to move on. Don't get me wrong I love to see people having a good time and I myself like to have a good time, but sometimes after a big long day in the and heat, it would be nice to drift off to sleep in peace!

The hotel has a gym and a great gym at that, with at least three treadmills that I can remember, a elliptical machine, dumbbells and a Smith machine. My husband and I worked out every day and there was always a personal trainer floating around. He helped us with our form which was OK, but if you are not in to that thing, I think you would be annoyed. They held yoga classes in the morning and circuit classes during different parts of the day.

The hotel also ran little time fillers for the patrons, for example a person blind folded being told by their partner where to walk to cut a watermelon, just little things like this, which on the odd occasion you don't feel like leaving the hotel, they are great to fill in time lazing by the pool. There is also a ping pong table, which is always a nice touch.

My husband and I got a massage from the hotel on our last day, which was very relaxing, but a bit overpriced in my opinion, but that is Bali. It is only overpriced as we know we could walk elsewhere and get it cheaper and the same procedure? We are glad we did it though.

The pool or pools I guess you could say were beautiful. There is the swim up bar pool in one section and then an infinity wall down to another pool with is surrounded by the beds that you can lay on for the day. Cocktails and beverages etc on offer on the menu were good and we quite often had a smoothie from the bar after out morning workouts :)

There is a mini mart and a money exchange directly over the road, with a great selection of all the necessities that you need while on holiday. Further up, there are spa's restaurants and even a few select nightclubs. The other direction, you walk roughly 400m and you are at the beach and a beautiful spot to watch the sunset!

All in all, if we went back to Bali, we would be back!"
3641,Perfect,50,November 2014,"My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed every minute of it... The only disappointing part was having to leave. The staff were so incredibly attentive, polite and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel it self was absolutely beautiful and extremely clean as was our room. Breakfast every morning was delicious with such a wide variety to choose from. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will be staying there on my next return... Can't thank the staff for making it such a wonderful holiday :)"
3642,"Brilliant, just Brilliant.",50,November 2014,"Thank you so much for such an incredible stay.
We stayed for 4nighths to celebrate our wedding anniversary and what a delightful stay it was.
The staff at the hotel were absolutely fantastic and were always on hand to assist whenever possible. The food at the hotel was incredible but the breakfast was out of this world, huge selection of food from your traditional cooked breakfast to a more local traditional option if desired ( plus the pastries on offer were delicious too). The staff working from the pool bar were fantastic and very friendly.
In all this was one of my best trips and a great time was had.We will def be back. Thank you courtyard Marriott for your high level hospitality."
3643,New brooms sweep clean,40,November 2014,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights it's a bit of a maze internally with some walkways not connecting to the breakfast area. Floors are missing number 4 ( Chinese number associated with death )
Very well located with security at front to check bags ect.
Well set out breakfast area which would cater for the most fastidious diner.Includes Vegemite unfortunately, all the jams had knives stuck in the jars instead of spoons!
Very busy pool area so if you're looking for a quiet time avoid this hotel.Disappointed with the samosas served by the pool these appear to be the frozen variety ( Made in China ) frozen and re heated ( poorly i might add ) so avoid as there is no quality assurance of food coming from China or Malaysia.
Overall we paid $150 per night which was good value as close to beach and all shops and amenities including money changer. Staff were on the ball and the music by the pool seemed to be appreciated by all with great selections of per recorded and live."
3644,Great value for money,50,October 2014,"My husband & I stayed in this hotel from 26th October for 5 nights. Could have stayed for much longer as it was a hotel that you felt very safe & comfortable in. We spent a few lazy hours around the pool & bar area as it is very well set up & enough areas to sit in the shade if you don't feel like the sun. Food quality both around pool & breakfast is amazing. Love the setting at breakfast, it is very relaxed with so much choice but found it hard to go past the eggs benedict. Hubby loved the mint iced doughnuts as a treat. The rooms are adequately sized not a huge amount of room but that didn't worry us. The shower was great as was air-con. Check-in, check-out very efficient & yes security is up there for Bali standards but it really isn't a bother & understandable for a hotel of this quality.

I wouldn't hesitate to return however I am not expecting the great deal I got online with an opening special. Loved everything about this hotel & hope we can return one day. Will not hesitate to recommend to anyone.

Location wise really good a golf cart to the beach(or 5min walk) & short taxi ride to Eat street or a 25 min walk."
3645,Amazing hotels with fabulous staff,50,September 2014,We stayed here for 14 nights with my husband and 2 teenagers and can absolutely recommend this hotel. We have been to BALI 17 times and this is definitely the best place we have ever stayed in . The staff where delightful and helpful at all times . The chef Billy was fantastic and the General Manager - Brad was extremely approachable and was always around making sure our stay was enjoyable. We normally go to the beach everyday but during this stay I found it hard to drag myself away from the pool and lounge chairs. The position was also a bonus close to everything . We will be back next year . Thanks Brad and your staff for making our holiday so enjoyable . See you next year. Cheers Simone and Paul Buckley
3646,"Plenty of places are excellent in Bali, and this is no exception to that...",50,October 2014,"Well, it's a brand new hotel in the area, and the place is beautiful. The pool that is surrounded by all the rooms is a good size, and sets the scene for the entire place. For one, most places say they have a pool bar, and it doesn't mean what it's suppose to. This place has done it right, sit in the pool, swim up to the bar, and sit on stools in the pool while you drink, nice, very nice. The rooms are descent, only draw back is they're a bit narrow. But the furniture is up to date, and the bathrooms are very nice. The great thing is most rooms, if not all, are pool views and have balconies that overlook the pool with a nice little couch to chill on. The staff were wonderful, very helpful and professional. This place had the most security of any hotel I saw in the area, and it's sometimes a hassle going through the metal detector and such, but it's also comforting to know that you're in a place that is so secure. The location is very nice also, about 5 minutes away from Kuta, he party district. Which is nice, and it's also a block away from the beach. But it's far enough away from Kuta that it's nice and quiet at night. Definitely not like the resorts on the lower portion of the island, or all the private places outside the main area of tourist stuff, but still relaxing. But it's close to everything!"
3647,FAULTLESS!!!,50,November 2014,"Cannot fault this hotel. The room is spacious and lusciously comfortable. Rainfall shower head in the beautiful bathroom. More than enough amenities.

Amazing pool with pool bar. Fully equipped 24hr gym. Didn't use kids club but it's there if you need it.

Breakfast is absolutely amazing and I actually looked forward to waking up to this each day! Cold air con, hi speed wifi in room, good location, top notch security.

If we come back to Bali we will only stay here. Thank you, Marriott!!"
3648,Great place even Solo,50,October 2014,"Had the opps to stay here for a couple of nights. The hotel offer great security measures. The lobby staff were great. I did ask for a bucket of ice when I got settled, but it never arrived. I did get a call if I still want it... I said no, I got it myself. Other than that, the location is superb. I ran to and from the beach. Night life if you're gay is just a short walk away. I recommend Remix, it gets packed after 10pm. Tons of massage places if you're looking for one. I recommend Bali Spa. I spent 5 hours there. It's heaven. You get what you pay for. So choose wisely. I would stay here again."
3649,Love love love!,50,October 2014,"I stayed here for 2 nights, and arrived in the morning from previous hotel at Sunset Road. Welcomed with popsicle, ice lemon tea, and cold towel.
I shall deposite some money for 2 night IDR 2000K in this hotel. Love the security and staffs hospitality, and played for a while with a dog in front of entrance gate. What a cute dog!
Got a room at 4th floor and the balcony was facing the pool and it was so beautiful landscape at the night.
For 3 days every afternoon I enjoyed for the sunlight touching skin, good time for sunbathing and then swimming.
Speaking about the breakfast buffet, i have no words to describe how superb and perfect it was. And the chef kept checking on the food and talking to the guests to make sure they have everything they wanted.
But when I left my room and asked to clean up with hanging tag, and came back around 4pm, they/houskeeping still haven't clean up yet my room."
3650,Typical chain hotel,30,October 2014,"We got an opening price with a room update from standard to deluxe. The deluxe was very small so would not like to have been in a std room. The facilities were fine but it seemed as though it was for a single person. Bathroom amenities were for one, ie one toothbrush etc.The bed was queen size, one chair at the table and one easy chair - this was a lot for such a small room.
Went to have a drink in the lounge area by the pool bar but there were no fans and it was way too hot.
Stayed here for one night only as it was close to somewhere we needed to be."
3651,Lovely oasis,40,October 2014,"Had 5 nights here & loved it. I was on my own and had a basic deluxe room facing the pool. The room was light, tastefully furnished, and felt spacious. High speed wifi and a good selection of channels on the very large plasma TV in my room, iPod dock etc.
Bathroom lovely: new powerful shower. Room was made fresh and spotless everyday, by housekeeping. The breakfast is fantastic - as good as much pricier 5* Ritz Carlton breakfast I've stayed at. Absolutely everything you could wish for: eggs any style, asian selections, pancakes, fruits, bread, pastries, doughnuts, salad,cereals,cheeses, cold meats, even ice-cream!
Pool area is great for relaxing and getting away for a few hours from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seminyak."
3652,Just perfect!,50,August 2014,"We stayed here when the hotel had just opened and it was amazing.The location is great with the beach only a 10 minute walk away, and the shops only 5 minutes.The rooms are nice and comfortable with good amenities. The pool and pool bar are awesome, although we found that one side of the pool did not get a lot of sun which could be a problem when the hotel is really busy. The breakfast at the hotel is the best that I have ever had! The variety and quality of the food was unbelievable. Well done Billie and team... We also ate dinner most evenings at the hotel and it was reasonably priced and yummy. All the staff at the hotel were fantastic! They were always happy, friendly and eager to ensure that you were happy and relaxed. We felt safe in the area and going through screening each time you returned to the hotel was an added comfort. We did have massages at the hotel spa, and also close by at Spa Bali, but it is worth the extra cost to have the ambience and high quality treatment at the hotel spa. We found that asking the Concierge to arrange a BlueBird taxi was best, as they could advise the approximate cost of the fare to where you were going but you still need to negotiate the price with the driver when you get in. A big thank you to Brad, Gina, Tony, Billie and the rest of the staff who helped make our stay such a memorable one. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone that is going to Bali."
3653,Great Resort,50,October 2014,"Stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott between 19th - 24th October. Great location - plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Plenty of massage places within easy walking distance and a convenience store across the road to stock up on basic necessities. ATM also just across the road.
The Resort - We stayed in Room 347; a twin room - 2 x double beds. Yes, the rooms are quite small, but are big enough for 2 people to move around. And really, how long are you going to be staying in your room when you have a wonderful pool to enjoy. Don't worry about the Security - a minor inconvenience and gives you some comfort that you are being looked after.
The pool(s) - lovely. Again, at busy times, it might be difficult to get a lounge chair, but I think that happens at every resort. The pools were never really crowded when we were there.
The activities - fabulous. I went to Bali to do some yoga and didn't realise the Resort had yoga/stretching every morning between 7.00am and 8.00am. Fantastic! They also have other activities such as pool volleyball; water aerobics; etc which are fun for everybody.
The spa/massage - wonderful; lovely rooms; great masseuse.
The food - I can only endorse all the positive comments about the breakfast. A great range of Asian and Western style foods for breakfast; plenty of pastries etc. You really can't complain about the choice at breakfast. We also had lunch at the Resort most days and there was a range of tasty alternatives and not very expensive either.
The staff - absolutely the best! Great service. Always very helpful; happy; smiling and welcoming. Everybody from the staff at reception to the yoga instructors to the staff at breakfast and the staff serving cocktails and food at the pool bar.
Location to 'Eat Street' - We ate at Eat Street in Seminyak 4 out of 5 nights. Loads of good restaurants. Only takes about 10 minutes by Taxi. I would recommend the following - Il Trattoria; Hotel Mexicola and Nirvana.
Final result - 5 stars for the Courtyard by Marriott."
3654,Excellent Seminyak Stay,50,October 2014,"Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak was fantastic, clean, luxuriously comfortable room, new beautiful building, facilities and grounds. Food was great, service was superb, the staff were lovely. The location was convenient and the security screening was not an issue at all. I look forward to returning to this wonderful hotel. Although it is in the hub of busy vibrant Seminyak, it is rather peaceful and relaxing inside the grounds."
3655,Holiday fun,50,November 2014,"We are an expat family in Bali and we had family coming to Bali. Our stay with mr brad and his team has been excellent. Close to shopping, beach, food, dancing spots and of course massages. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.
The kids had fun in the pools. Dad was happy at the pool bar and mums had fun shopping and massages. The sunsets were great. The thing we liked about this hotel was the staff are happy and the little things were done well."
3656,Great Pool & Attentive Staff,40,September 2014,"Really great pool at the Marriott in Seminyak. If you are lucky enough to get a poolside lounge it's very easy to spend a whole day there. Press a bell and a waiter will bring you food from the barbecue or a huge variety of drinks.

Breakfast was possibly the best breakfast I have had at a hotel. Included cooked to order omelettes, local dishes, Bakery, Fresh Fruit etc. etc.

Only downside was on the third night there was a very odd smell coming from the air conditioning ducts. No one was quite sure how to fix it.

Gym is great & well air conditioned + has a massage centre/spa next to it which is around $30 per 1.5 hour massage. Well worth it compared to the cheaper $7 massages from down the road."
3657,New and pretty but a lot to improve.,30,October 2014,"My wife and I stayed from 13th to 20th October.
The Good:
Staff are very friendly and try very hard to please, sometimes so much that it gets a bit too much. Generall Manager (Brad) and head chef ( Billy) are great and welcome feedback.
The Hotel is new and as such the furnishings are in good condition and everything is clean.
The not so good:
Room service plates left outside for collection were still outside the room late the following afternoon with left-overs rotting in the sun, I brought this up with Brad and Billy and it improved for a while but on the last day plates were still outside at 3pm after being placed there at 9pm and stray cats were seen foraging.
Smoking is freely allowed all around all the pool area and outside restaurant area.It was impossible to enjoy the pool area smoke free, surely some areas could be reserved as smoke free. Rooms were smoke free but people were allowed to smoke on balconies and so sitting outside was also ruined.
Pool lounges were hogged by people who placed towels and magazines on them early in the morning but barely using them througout the day. Staff should be clearing these lounges so patrons don't have to risk conflict.
Restaurant: breakfast was good with a reasonable range of choices. but the same could not be said for other times. Entrees were largely a choice of a small range of soups and mains being Burgers, Club sandwiches' a few pasta dishes, steak,rack of lamb,Atlantic salmon and a couple of other dishes. I can't understand that you can have a Buffet Breakfast but not a Buffet Dinner?
I must say that although limited the dishes were all good but staying seven nights we would have enjoyed more choice."
3658,Everything you could want!,50,September 2014,"This resort is amazing. The pool area is wonderful. It's the little extras you get, like fresh fruit icy poles by the pool on a hot day or having the chef Billy come out and get you a coffee in the morning. Cool towels by the pool and staff that just can't do enough for you made me feel special. The rooms are well equipt and have all the bits you expect from a hotel of this calibre. I loved it here and as i visit Bali at least 4 times a year, i will definately be staying again soon.
The breakfast buffet is to die for. My partner is still talking about it a month later. He wants to know why i don't serve Nasi Goreng for breakfast! Thanks Billy for setting the bench mark!
I have noticed that some people complain about the security but seriously i would prefer too much than not enough. I like knowing my family is safe.
Thank you to all the staff and especially Billy that made us feel so welcome and special. We will see you again soon."
3659,Great new hotel in Seminyak!,50,October 2014,"My husband, 4 year old son and I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak for 8 nights. Our suite was great - nice and big, really clean and had everything we needed. The balcony over the pool was a great feature too.

The staff were lovely and incredibly helpful - it was so nice to have Cindy greet us when we arrived, Jelantik was always so friendly and attentive in the restaurant (as were all the staff) and it was nice to be able to meet Brad as he introduced himself and said hi.

The breakfast was fantastic - so much to choose from! Pool area is great, although the beds do seem to get nabbed early. The impromptu pool volleyball game was fun as well!

The spa was great and massages very affordable for a hotel service. Our son also loved the kids club - while it's only small there was plenty for him to do for an hour or two and the staff were lovely.

The location is also great - 5 min walk to the beach, Star Mart across the road and only a short taxi ride to Seminyak Square and all the amazing restaurants that Seminyak has to offer!"
3660,Great stylish Gem in the heart of Seminyak,50,October 2014,"My daughter and I spent 2nights at this newly opened (August) upmarket New York style hotel/resort last week, I wish it could've been longer, we both enjoyed it so much! Such great value for money, we were a 5minute walk from the beach and close to all the great hot spots and popular resorts to enjoy a cocktail in and around Seminyak.
A taxi fare would cost around $2 to KuDeTa, Potato Head and other popular eateries or resorts in northern Seminyak if you wanted to enjoy the beach sunsets or dinner at other locations.
Also the location is convenient to a lot of great eateries (eat street) and shopping is the best in Seminyak. If your feet or legs get tired you can always jump in a taxi, but use Bluebirds always!

Our check in was good, a bit slow though as this guy was new, still learning the ropes. However, he did put us in a nice room up on the 6th floor (top floor) which I requested, as the last resort we stayed at was noisy (ppl above us) so a tip is to request for top floor room for peace and quiet.
We also were upgraded to a pool view room, this was stated on the booking site we used, there was a special on at the time. The room was nice, great having the outlook of the balcony down to the pool/pool bar and surroundings :) The king size bed was comfy although a little too firm for me as I have sore shoulders and back. Oh, and pillows very soft, so if you prefer soft pillows you'll be happy, otherwise no complaints there :)

The room itself was nice, it wasn't huge but adequate for the both of us. great having the WiFi. The bathroom had a rain shower and a normal type shower, no bath, but that was Ok! The water pressure was great and so was the temperature...separate toilet which flushed well, not like the other places we stayed in where the water comes right up to the bowl & sits there! Also the water in Courtyard by Marriott is treated, so you don't have to freak out if you accidently get it in your eyes, up your nose or swallow it whilst showering or brushing your teeth!

The mini bar is fully stocked, not that we used anything in it though...also bottled water was supplied free of charge as most resorts do.

Breakfast Ahhhh, was the ""highlight"" and standout! Billy from South Australia (Adelaide) originally, where both my daughter and I are from, ran a tight ship! The choices were limitless, everything you ever wanted or felt like was there! From all the sliced up fruits, juices, iced teas, coffees (we ordered flat whites or lattes each morning) and variety of teas.
A huge range of breads, pastries, donuts and croissants were massive, even delicious gluten free bread that looked and tasted like cake! Speaking of, also pancakes and waffles with a variety of toppings AND ""ice cream"" four different flavours, all delicious and waffle cones to boot!
Then there was the egg station, could order from poached through to your choice of omelettes. or fried eggs, bacon and the works if you chose. There was also a huge array of Indonesian food, dumplings, steamed dim sums, such a variety if this is what you felt like for breakfast?!
Personally my fave was the fresh fruits, juices, waffles/pancakes and ice cream :) there was also a variety of breakfast cereals and muesli, nuts and dried fruits...yoghurts as well.

Loved the pool and the pool bar here, all the staff were lovely and such fun, always happy and joking about! The guys hand out icy poles and cold towels around the pool area too!
It was great having the chill out/lounge music around the pool, if you didn't like it, you could always move further away to one of the sun beds, but we personally loved it!
Also another fun thing they did was aqua aerobics classes each morning...I missed them, but was fun all the same watching! The instructor was fantastic, so motivated and great to watch!
The cocktails around the pool were delicious, they were huge, the food/bar snacks were great also, quite a selection to choose from, wraps, burgers and fries, satays, salads and club sandwiches...

We only booked and stayed 2 nights, wish it was longer, would definitely come back to the CBM we loved it and all the friendly helpful staff! People that have complained and whinged about the OTT security check when you first arrive and each time you leave and return are just that, whingers! It wasn't even that bad, took less than 5minutes when we first arrived in the Bluebird taxi, hardly an inconvenience...it's great they have that degree of security!

Finally, that homemade icy pole, cold drink and cold towel was such a welcome, I think I had a couple of icy poles, they sure cured my car sickness from Nusa Dua in the busy traffic on a Sat arvo :) We also had a late flight out, so asked for a late checkout, latest they offered was 3pm, which was greatly appreciated. We were able to store our luggage and use the resorts gym for a shower or freshen up, also a quick bite to eat and final drink from the pool bar.

Many thanks to the staff at the Courtyard by Marriott, you ALL made our stay here fabulous!!
Barbie and Brooke"
3661,2nd visit,50,October 2014,This is my 2nd visit. It's a great things to come back. This hotel is the perfect place to escape from daily routines.. Loved the breakfast so much.. There's a lot of choices.. The staff also very friendly..Well.. Maybe there will be a 3rd visit.. ;)
3662,The total package!,50,October 2014,"Stayed for 3 nights with a friend.

Hotel environment :
Contemporary design. The hotel is new thus everything is clean. All the rooms are designed in a way where the pool is the center piece. As all activities are concentrated at the pool area, it almost felt like a beach club. Plenty of sunlight all around perfect for sun bathing.

The room is a bit small but with a pool as such, you wouldn't be spending much time. We had a room on the 6th floor and it was noisy as there is a big vent on the rooftop. Even with the balconies closed, you could still hear them.
There is live band but it was okay...

Location :
5 mins walk to the beach. About 20mins walk to Potato Head Beach Club. Rather convenient. Can fares ranges from 12k to 30k IDR for restaurants within Seminyak.

Food and beverage :
The breakfast spread was great with a very lovely set up. Ala carte menu was average. The drinks from the bar was excellent amd best of all the prices were very reasonable.

Service :
As expected of Bali, service is good. But... staff is somehow a bit mechanical. That is the only point for improvement.

Would definitely return. Hope that the hotel continues with great maintenance."
3663,Perfect new hotel with great staff,50,September 2014,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in September. It were our last two nights of our 3-weeks trip through Indonesia and it was a fantastic end of our vacation. We originally booked another hotel but decided to change to this hotel and we did not regret this for a second. From the first moment the staff was extremely friendly and very much service oriented. All of them were great, and we would especially like to thank Jogi (hope we spell his name correctly) for the great help (and nice upgrade) during the check-in process. The rooms are very nice and clean, the swimming pool is great, the breakfast is amazing and we very much enjoyed the drinks and food at the pool bar, not only because of the great quality of both, but also beacuse of the great staff. We would recommend this hotel to everyone, young and old and with or without kids, and when we are back in Seminyak we would definetely stay here again!"
3664,Good as Gold!!,40,October 2014,"We checked into this hotel, as the other hotel we had booked was disgusting.
This property is only 10 weeks old and nearly 100% full - that in itself says it all.
The street Jl Camplung Tanduk has restaurants and cafes, a minimart directly across the road from the Courtyard which (as a bonus) has a honest money changer inside the minimart. Really easy and safe to do your exchanges, grab your water and other requirements - its a large shop too and has a good inventory.
The Courtyards 2 pools consist of one that has a swim up bar and then a waterfall that cascades down a few metres to the rest of the pool. Lots of pool lounges however given the popularity of this property it would be wise to grab a lounge early.
The staff at the pool bar are great and really look like they are having fun.
The included (in our case) breakfast was massive - a really good variety (even have icecream and waffles there, but the kids seem to have icecream cones :) )
The staff couldn't do enough - no charging extra for a ""real coffee"" if you don't want the filter type coffee. They have good selections of Asian and western breakfast fare.
The most obvious thing you notice first - even before getting to reception is the level of SECURITY at this hotel. Complete car check and xray machines, metal detectors etc. I guess if that is what you're looking for, rest assured.
Didn't go to the gym, or use the spa inhouse as we opted for places within 100m of the hotel at Bali pricing instead.
All round, this hotel will put a dint in the market around this area of Seminyak.

Tip: if you are going to drink/eat along ""eat street"" Jl Kayu Aya nearby, grab a cab, meter on and get him to take the back street behind the hotel Jalan Drupardi (massive short cut)!! If you ride without the meter then 20K-30K Rp covers this trip ($2-3)

Good job @Marriott"
3665,Brand new,40,October 2014,"I booked on Wotif and got a good room rate with a $100 US to send in the hotel
Room was neat, small but comfortable, great ensuite, terrific shower. Room well equipped and finally somewhere with a decent size safe well done Marriott.
Melinda at reception is fabulous, the staff in the breakfast area are great, a special thank you to Werdiana the supervisor, nothing was to much trouble.
The breakfast is nothing short of amazing, I really enjoyed a rack of lamb with steamed veg, beautifully cooked and such a nice surprise.

The pool is huge but gets packed, get in early for a day bed."
3666,Perfect stay,50,September 2014,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our first leg of our trip to Bali. We were initially put in a room overlooking a concrete wall, but was swiftly moved once we informed the reception to a room overlooking the pool. The staff were great and couldn't do enough for you. Slightly daunting the level of security to enter the hotel, but you soon get used to it.

As it is a fairly new hotel, everything was spotless, very comfortable room with everything you'd expect. Not too far from the beach and close by to everything that you'd ever need!

We loved our stay here and wouldn't hesitate in coming back to this hotel, highly recommended!"
3667,Absolutely A1 Hotel,50,October 2014,"We stayed here for 5 night & we could not fault any part of our stay. Great value, great Location, fantastic food, relaxing atmosphere & absolutely magnificent Service throughout, from the bar staff, front desk, cleaners, Chefs, security staff & Hotel Manager Brad etc we could not have chosen a better place to stay. We will definitely be back with the whole family. So nice to have Service with a smile. Great job to all! Keep doing what you do well & thank you for an Awesome stay."
3668,Great hotel,40,October 2014,"We stayed at this fantastic hotel for 5 nights
The staff are attentive to your needs
The rooms are always clean
The pools fantastic
And the location is ideal
My only problem would have to be the breakfast, in the first 3 nights the hotel was quiet and then ramped up to what seemed to be about 70%
Each morning we had to line up for breakfast, never really seen that before at a hotel, and I been to a few.
There's only one ""egg station"" catering to a packed out breakfast room
And it takes nearly half an hour at times to get your eggs and let's face it everyone loves their eggs for breakfast,
it's not hard to see there's a problem there and the simple solution is to have 2 egg stations running with two chefs. This is by no means the egg chefs fault, he should be commended for still putting a smile on.
Most other meal options run low in peak times to (museli, baked beans, bread etc)
The morning kitchen seems to fall apart quite easily under pressure.
In conclusion I wouldn't entirely suggest to NOT opt for the breakfast option when booking your stay, but rather for the management and head chefs of courtyard marriot to get on top of this situation and come up with a solution for achieving sustainability at peak breakfast times.
Although I don't see much of a solution to the whole 'lining up' for breakfast scenario, they do put on fantastic feeds here.

Great hotel / great meals / friendly staff"
3669,Fantastic!,50,October 2014,"We were staying at an awful hotel in Nusa Dua so checked out early and moved to this gem in Seminyak. Although this did not feel Balinese at all, it's new, very clean and the staff cannot do enough for you. We were given a deluxe room on the second floor with a balcony and a view of the pool and pool bar. We could sit on our balcony and have a few drinks and listen to the great acoustic sessions they have each night. The rooms aren't very big but they're very nice, have a great bathroom with a separate toilet and shower. The pools are fantastic; one of the best kids pools I've seen cause while the kids play, the parents can sit on the pool side beanbags with feet dangling in the water and relax; not physically have to be in the pool if they don't want. Pool service was amazing; cocktails and pool food were great. The pool staff come around every so often with cool towels and glasses of water. The highlight of the stay for us though was the Kids Club. Our three year old son preferred to be at the Kids Club than in the pool; it's that good!! The staff are BRILLIANT and very attentive. You can order the kids lunch or dinner and it's delivered to the kids there. For under 4's it's about AUD $6.50 an hour. One evening one of the ladies babysat for us and took our son from the Kids Club (when it closed at 8pm) back to our room. He was tucked up fast asleep when we arrived back. Thanks Annie! The breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen is the best you'll find - the egg station, flat whites, pastries, fresh fruit... it's hard to beat! We also ate dinner there one night and had a fantastic meal; the staff couldn't do enough to accommodate us and our fussy three year old. They were all so friendly and willing to make us happy. The hotel is only a five minute walk to the beach but it is a fair walk to places such as Ku D√© Ta, Potato Head etc but we just caught a taxi (about AUD$2 one way). Some previous guests have commented on being annoyed by the level of security at the hotel but in my opinion it was not a problem at all. Its easier when being dropped off by taxi just to be dropped outside the hotel rather than have them enter the hotel and go through security. Simple. When we were checking out we noticed we'd been charged U$40 per night for the rollaway bed when we'd been quoted U$20. When I questioned this, the reception staff were apologetic and refunded us the entire amount for the extra bed. We only spent three nights at this hotel and our only disappointment was that we wish we'd known how great it was going to be cause we would've booked longer. We'll DEFINITELY be coming back! Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay!!"
3670,Truly fabulous !!!,40,October 2014,"We were two couples staying in Pool Access rooms. From the moment we checked in we knew our decision was right! Rooms were equipped with everything perfectly from great hair dryers (important for me!) comfy beds, lovely furnishings, big bathrooms, lovely soft white clean towels. Not a lot of storage but u manage. Pool was fab, great kids pool with terrific kids club & nannies! Waiters come around pool all day with complimentary cool washers, iced lemon water, icy pokes, & fresh fruit shots ... No other hotel I've stayed at have ever done this (19th trip to Bali) now the brekky is something else... Amazing !!! So much choice, basically anything & everything .. Delicious! The Hotels GM Brad & Executive Chef Billy come around every morning at Brekky to say G'Day & make sure everything is perfect for their guests !! I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody from families with kids (go for a suite) to elderly (they have lifts) .... Just do it, you WON'T be disappointed !!!! Till next year, thanks to everyone @ Courtyard Marriott! Xxx"
3671,Excellent services and a smile that accompanies you everywhere!,50,October 2014,"This is a great hotel with outstanding hospitality. My sister and I stayed for five nights here and enjoyed everything this hotel had to offer. The breakfast buffet is impressive and many delicious meals in offer. The atmosphere is very enjoyable and if you love pools, you would most certainly enjoy this hotel. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who chooses to stay in Seminyak."
3672,Nice comfortable stay!,40,October 2014,"My first impression of the marriott was... Wow! Everything is new, the room is well designed, comfortable with excellent air conditioning.. The security may be considered strict, however they're quick and friendly. The staff are friendly and helpful..
Only a few small annoyances; there is not enough seating around the pool, it seems people are up early throw a towel and a book on the chair, leave and come back at their leisure.. It's super frustrating! The swim up bar again is too small for the amount of rooms.. The happy hour dnt be fooled you still end up paying close to regular price as the cocktails on the list are far more expensive than the regular cocktails. The breakfast was my biggest let down, nothing tasted good except the fruit.. Good location in seminyak! Overall I would recommend.."
3673,Would stay again in a heartbeat!,50,October 2014,"Just returned after 5 nights in a pool access room (157) with 2 double beds and miss it already.

Stayed with my wife for our wedding anniversary and 2 x 10 year old children. Contacted the hotel beforehand to arrange for champagne and flowers to be in the room and the hotel provided a complimentary cake. Unfortunately the flowers fell through so Cindy the Guest Relations Officer made it up to us with complimentary snacks and drinks at the pool bar. The room wasn't ready when we arrived just after lunch so Melinda at the front desk arranged for a complimentary lunch at the Seminyak Kitchen (their onsite restaraunt).

The room was a little small so suitcases had to be strategically positioned but the beds were comfortable (make sure you ask for extra pillows unless you like sleeping with one where your head sinks through). We also found that despite having 4 of us in the room that housekeeping only ever left 2 bottles of water and 3 towels. We asked for more but the next day after housekeeping had been through we again only had 2 bottles and 3 towels left. Nothing major and didn't dampen the stay but perhaps something that can be fine tuned by Brad the GM and his team.

Speaking of Brad, how many times have you stayed at a hotel and had the GM stop by at breakfast and ask how things are going and joke with your children? He takes a keen interest in listening to guests feedback and making sure that their stay is a memorable one. The staff that we dealt with around the hotel were always smiling and friendly, the hotel and grounds are in great condition (the hotel only opened on 1 August 2014) and it is only a short taxi ride to Kuta and Legian (we found the hotel drivers very expensive - 125,000 IDR to Kuta when a metered blue bird was around 35,000 IDR).

The breakfast was delicious and covered the usual bacon, sausages, toast, cereal, fruit and pastries as well as asian fare and even ice cream! Make sure you ask for the eggs benedict at the egg station - amazing! We ate in the restaraunt one night and found that it was only marginally higher in price than one of the local restaraunts we ate at the night before but the food was significantly better - make sure you try their Nasi Goreng at least once!

Our previous trip to Bali was at the Courtyard in Nusa Dua and if I had to compare, the Seminyak comes out in front with better food and friendlier staff and a swim up pool bar.

If you have any special requests then Cindy will do whatever she can to accommodate. Her email address is cy.dpssm.concierge@courtyard.com (approval was given by Cindy to share this).

All in all a great stay and will definitely return!"
3674,Excellent Hotel,50,October 2014,"We stayed only one night, in a room with the pool view. Start from check in, the staff are friendly. Rooms are clean and tidy, they also provide a surprise chocolate cake that is sent directly to our room, because at that time we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. They send it along with greeting cards directly from Hotel‚Äôs GM. The room are equipped with free wifi fast connection, JBL bluetooth speakers, we love that so much. Breakfast at the hotel was really nice! Various menu options are tasty and fresh. The pool is clean, and there is a pool bar is also with a modern design. The hotel location is close to the beach, the hotel visitors can be escorted to the beach with their buggy car. Our trip was a memorable experience, surely we will come back here next time. Thank you Courtyard"
3675,Two nights stay,30,October 2014,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We were in a group and had been organised by our travel agent. We were booked 5 rooms which 2 rooms for 6 peoples (double bed + extra bed and twin bed + extra bed). At the night we checked-in, one of the room supposed to be for 3 peoples, but they only provided twin bed (no extra bed) and that nite, my colleague had to slept in shared single bed. In the morning, we checked again with receptionist and travel agent and the extra bed already in their room for the second night.
This hotel put high standar for security, sure this is for guests safety but quite a hassle if you took a mini bus and tight security check in entrance gate. As this procedures take times, we just dropped by bus and walked to the lobby and of course we have to be scanned again!!
Personally, i like the open space desain in the lobby and open kitchen in the restaurant. This hotel provide ice cream, infused water and many pastry variant for breakfast.
The hotel pool quite large, sunbeds around the pool and buggy car provided to take you to beach nearby."
3676,AMAZING BUFFET BREAKFAST!,50,October 2014,"Recently stayed at Courtyard Marriott after scoring a great deal not long after the opening. Beautiful new hotel with everything you could possibly want and in a good location. The rooms were modern and clean with a good size balcony, room service was reasonable considering it is a 5 star hotel, spa was very luxurious, the gym was well equipped, pool was lovely with bean bags and pool lounges - had a great atmosphere - staff would give out icy poles, ice cold water and chilled towels to refresh guests. Breakfast was absolutely amazing! The best buffet breakfast I've had in the world - everything you could possibly think of and staff would do anything they could to create what wasn't on the menu. The staff were amazing - we had an early flight and arrived at the hotel well before check-in time. As our room was available we were able to check-in to our room straight away rather then make us wait until 2pm like most other hotels! I see a few reviews complaining about the security - yes they scan your bags when ever you come to the hotel, but it is only creating a safe environment for all guests and staff so it is 110% reasonable. My only suggestion for the hotel is to purchase more pool lounges - there were never may free and the hotel wasn't anywhere near full capacity! Thank you everyone at the Courtyard, hopefully see you again soon :)"
3677,Feel like home with outstanding hospitality,50,September 2014,"Experience first time ever bring out our 9mos baby girl to ENJOY Bali! Really had great time, my wife and I appreciate a lot for warm hospitality offered by staff, and dept head during our stay. Friendly and young people provided high level of services, two thumbs up! My wife, our baby girl and I would like to express our special thanks Ms. Sherry, Mr. Chevpy who helped a lot during our stay. We had wonderful, fabulous and ENJOYable stay."
3678,Great hotel to stay on your next visit,50,October 2014,"I would love to recommend my friends to stay in this hotel on their next visits. Great hotel, fabulous staffs that always here to assist you.Loving the food that provided by seminyak kitchen. I would also say special thanks to Anton, he is really easy going and lovely to chat with. Feeling that you have make a new friend in Bali. So if you come to Bali, this is a great place to stay, you will have unforgettable time during your journey."
3679,"Lavish, perfect location",50,September 2014,"We just returned last week after spending 14 days in this absolutely beautiful hotel, we are a family of 5. 2 adults, 3 kids aged 8, 5 & 2. We were upgraded too a two bedroom suite which was just stunning, very spacious with 2 showers & 2 baths. The balcony was huge with stunning views of all pools & lush surroundings, our rooms were serviced daily and kids were excited to see towels made up into a swan, monkey & elephant. Thanks for organising that too Tina.

We were greeted on our first morning by Ngakan (person I initially booked with), which was exceptional, Billy the head chef along with Brad the GM. We really felt welcomed. Brad & billy were always around to have a friendly chat with.

The kids club was a hit with all three kids, special thanks to Tina the manager you really do go way and beyond something il always remember thanks for our little girly chats. Also big thanks to Rina, Debbie & Cinta. The kids loved you all and made mine and my hubby's stay extra hassle free knowing the kids were happy and well taken care off, we also had Cinta babysit after hours so hubby and I could enjoy nights out!

The kitchen were we indulged in a buffet breakfast was beyond an array of food I've ever witnessed, by far the best selection even for the fussiest of eaters. Also all other meals we had at the hotel were all delicious including room service! The swim up bar was great for a lite snack along with the yummy cocktails service just impeccable! Staff always smiling :)

I also want to give a special mention to Hardi, Ella, Puspa, Anton, jaka just to name a few for the amazing service, many lovely chats we had and I feel that I've found great friends in Puspa & Ella.
Gina the front desk manager was so professional and helpful with local attraction, booking restaurants for us and organising drivers you really made our stay that extra special.

So in a nutshell would DEFINTLEY recommend this hotel, felt very safe with the extra scanners & security, shopping, bars and beach all in walking distance literally at your door step. A supermarket directly across the road was super handy. The day spa also a massive hit.

Thanks for making our first trip to Bali unforgettable, we will be back sometime next year!!"
3680,Very good stay,40,October 2014,"Just returned from a week staying here - very impressed with the hotel.

Spend lots of time researching and reading reviews for our first trip to Bali - highly recommend staying at the Marriot Courtyard. Everything is modern, new, shiny and clean - great price and value for money at their current opening rate (booked our trip with Wotif on their mystery deal - FYI: you can pretty much work out that it's the Marriot Courtyard). Easy walking distance to the beach, great pool area and fantastic friendly service.

A couple of very minor issues experienced along the way but nothing that left us with anything other than a great experience - would return and stay again in a heartbeat.

Special mention to all the staff who really made every effort to ensure that we enjoyed our stay (from the x-Ray security team, the pool guys, bell boys, kitchen staff and bar staff - great effort & keep up the good work!)."
3681,"Beautiful Hotel, pool and staff!",50,September 2014,"Solo holiday this trip - Quick check-in, room was stunning, almost felt guilty I was alone! Bathroom was huge - shower (no bath tub). The room was quite large too, I had a room over looking the pool. Free wifi. Breakfast was included and in all my trips to bali - the best buffet i've experienced. The head chef was there every morning to say hello and see guests were happy. He made sure there were breakfast dim sum for me everyday too!
Cannot fault the staff, so friendly and accommodating to my every need.
The pool was amazing - but if you are a sun bunny - one side is in shadow come midday - so choose correctly. Also there are these gorgeous sun beds in the water! (but only three!).
The gym - wow. Modern machines and free weights PLUS a personal trainer just waiting to train you - for free!
Hotel was in a great location too, only a short walk to the beach, where there were several beach restaurants to choose from. Also shops near by. I walked to the massive mall in Kuta along the beach (Discovery Mall) which only took an hour.
Security at the hotel was quite impressive, you got screened every time you came back - and before you complain - hello, Bali Bombing! I say THANK YOU for looking after us!
I have already recommend this hotel to my friends, and will be back!"
3682,Unbelievable stay,40,September 2014,"Luxury hotel. Great pool. Fun watching father and sons playing in the water. Loved swimming up to the bar for a beverage and light dinner one night. The breakfasts were outstanding. The head chef was personable and friendly, as well as the general manager. The staff were outstanding, helpful and courteous. Very comfortable rooms with little verandahs for lounging and hanging wet clothes. Easy access to the beach for restaurants and bars. This hotel is a big operation. From our room we could hear noise pretty much all of the time, which sounded like the air conditioner that is the only down side."
3683,Amaze-Balls!,50,October 2014,"Stayed for a week, wish it was a year. Check-in was slightly delayed (GM apologised, but really did not worry me) due to large number of late check outs. Went to restuarant while waiting, and the food and service set the tone for the rest of the week. Upon check-in - immaculate room and very modern. Had friends staying at different closeby hotels, so we all sort of went migrated a day here and there. However, (and all my friends commented) that the service, class and overall feel of courtyard Marriott was far superior to other hotels. For breakfast we had an amazing waiter (and I'm bad with names but he was in the left hand outdoor deck areas Sun-Thurs), who couldn't be more helpful. Food itself was a cut above the other 4-5 star hotels, Western style with well placed lots of asian touches. Poolside, my only complaint was that Kusa (barman who looks 12) and Surasno (bad spelling I'm sure) made amazing cocktails too well and too quickly (slightly boozy afternoon one day). Definitely the best cocktails we had anywhere (on par with Potato Head). Pool does get a little crazy busy but its gorgeous. Special mention to security, who took our ""interesting"" Bali experiences with good humour - Whoever does the hiring deserves a lot of credit, as it is ""a team approach"" to service, that by the end of my stay I really did feel like part of family. GM was great, he seemed to spend some time with each guest, just to say hello. It was like the rest of the hotel, a special touch."
3684,Heaven,50,October 2014,"This onlyy 2nd might of 6( unfortunately very short stay). At breakfast the general manager introduces himself to welcome us & make sure all is well, lovely guy!. Then later had the singular best 3 hours of my life in Zanti , the retreat spa. I cannot remember ever feeling so relaxed. The entire staff are fan bloody tastic!!. Cannot praise there enthusiasiom enough. Very, very impressed."
3685,Nice hotel,40,October 2014,the hotel is ok but to give a personal opinion it miss some personality. I was not very lucky with my room since it was close to the gym and the pool. You can imagine there was some noise. They should also take care of the cleaning ness in more attentive way : the sofa in the room was dirty and this gave me a bad impression. Food too is ok but not many choices. Staff is very kind and professional too.
3686,Great hotel!,40,October 2014,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for 7 days with 2 young children. Have previously been staying further down Seminyak so it was a nice change. Within walking distance or a quick hotel buggy ride to Double Six beach. Lovely to watch the sunset at night, relaxing at one of the beach bars that have comfy beanbags to sit on.

Hotel has everything that is needed. Breakfast was a highlight - especially the array of donuts on display that the kids couldn't wait to see and eat every morning! The kitchen is open and cooking on display - clean, loved the fruit platters in the fridge instead of sitting out in the open!

Kids met others in the pool and played all day. Great that the pool is reasonably big and when in the lower level area, you can see the kids pretty much no matter where they are.

Felt comfortable with the security and liked that they check bags etc everytime people go in and out.

Gym has good equipment. Spa great massages and reasonable price.

Also has conferencing facilities for small to medium groups - looked like good set up.

Good luck for continued success!"
3687,Renato C Melbourne,50,October 2014,"Service outstanding, culture of all staff from general manager to room attendants was very hospitable, welcoming and professional. Breakfast buffet has a wide variety at a high standard with dishes changing daily. Pool and pool bar is fantastic with different zones for kids and adults. Rooms impeccably clean and very comfortable, WiFi throughout the hotel is the best that I've experienced, Gym also well equipped and maned during early morning peak session, fresh bottled water and clean towels placed on exercise machines after every use. Location is also great, three minute walk to beach and very close to many standout restaurants in Bali.
Would highly recommend this hotel
Renato C Melbourne"
3688,An ok hotel - Some design flaws | Unfinshed room,30,October 2014,"Looking at the previous traveller pictures you seem to see no other people in the posted pictures. However when we visited it was fairly busy.

The good points of this hotel. Great pool area. Breakfast has good selection. Room decor good. A nice toilet that washes you while sitting. The beach is 8 minute walk. On a street with restaurants and shops. Staff are pleasant.

The bad points. We had 2 rooms at hotel. We asked to change from the first several times. This room was in first block nearest reception. The room was modern nice picture above bed well equipped however on the top of the building was a giant extractor fan for restaurant (i'll post a pic) - this was extremely noisy and the best way to explain is that it has a constant hum a bit like being in a plane while cruising. This is just bad planning when building hotel in my opinion. Music is played in lobby area to try and cover this background sound up. This would put me off staying at this hotel in future. It could be ok for some who like to be close to bar area and action but for me was a little disappointed.

The second room was much better located at the main pool end on 6th floor. It was great but was missing some of the described decor eg the picture with bali scene above bed however this is minor. I liked being up high and it felt more private.

Staff around the hotel were always friendly and willing to help.

If you choose this hotel ask to be at the opposite end to reception.

Families liked the pools and was also popular with young couples.

Overall an ok hotel but would go somewhere else next time."
3689,Wonderful Hotel,50,October 2014,"I don't know why people complain about the security at this wonderful hotel, all staff including security are pleasant and have not been an issue and the security staff understand that some might be frustrated but it is hardly their fault and due to recent barbaric acts I feel that having this security only aids in the wonderful atmosphere we had at this hotel.
Staff are attentive and very thoughtful, helpful and always wanting to please you to make your stay that much more pleasant.
We stayed in room 145 which is on the ground and has a courtyard to the pool and was used frequently by my partner. Although on the 1st morning we we were woken by the little children playing in the pool we saw it as no issue and quite frankly forgot they were about.
Food is excellent in the restaurant which we ate at daily and as stated before the Head Chef Billie is awesome he goes out of his way to help including making porridge for my partner when not even on the menu (EXCELLENT),
I will stay again if I visit this area again and I would recommend it to friends infact if I remember it was recommended to my partner.
My only one complaint was that I felt the bed was hard but my partner felt that is was much to her liking...go figure.."
3690,Great new hotel,40,August 2014,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel after we read the rave reviews. Indeed, the hotel met our expectations and even went further beyond that. You cannot beat the location as it's just around 5-minute walk from the Seminyak Beach and within close proximity to some of the best restaurants on the island (the hotel also provides free shuttle ride to the beach). Yet, it was tranquil enough. The pool looked good and the poolside bar offered an exciting happy hour deal. Albeit a quite small one, the room is really clean and comfortable. Staff was really friendly to us and we had swift check-in and out. The icing on the cake for me is that they provide ice cream for breakfast! By and large, it was a great experience for us, would love to go back there if we visit Bali and I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel."
3691,Brilliant.,50,September 2014,"We had the BEST time at Courtyard Marriott. We were well looked after, the staff are friendly and accessible (fancy the GM cruising around chatting during breakfast)!, Coeliacs are catered for, lattes with breakfast, the kids loved the pool, water aerobics, watermelon smashing and the pool bar. The live music was fantastic - really hard to fault!

Thanks Brad, Billy and Gina. We will be back. Jen & Gavin"
3692,Excellent breakfast spread and quiet nite sleep.,50,August 2014,"Stayed in late August 2014 for 3 days.Pretty new hotel in convenient location.
Although ,not near the beach,but the morning breakfast atmosphere is great enough to remind you that you are in hotel resort,especially the seating at the verandah.Plus the buffet breakfast spread is wonderful.Certainly,could fill up my stomach and most of the days I skipped lunch.

I had a nice room by the pool.Would not miss my swim every morning.However,pool water is a bit cold in morning hours.Perhaps,that moment was a cool period in Bali.The hotel layout of the whole development is such that one could feel the breeze,day or night.Tried also to hangout at the garden and gazed up the dark sky at night.Felt so relax,with the lounge music playing from their bar.

Security was very tight,which made the guests felt safe.I had good night sleep throughout my stay.Bed was comfortable,room was clean and neatly decorated.Services were good and prompt.
Would certainly come back again if in Seminyak."
3693,An unforgettable experience - professional and great staff,50,August 2014,"I can't describe what an absolute gem this hotel and its staff are. We were two guys and stayed there for 5 nights if I remember correctly, in August. The below is about my experience :

The room: the room was perfect (although with a Marriott Gold card, you can certainly expect an upgrade and special treatment). Adequate in size with pleasant colors and very modern furnishings. Everything was spotless, the bed comfortable, good toiletries and a walk-in shower spacy enough for two or more. There is also a JBL alarm clock and ipod docking station (fitted for ipod 4 so do get an adapter if you have a later version) which has a very good sound (I even bought the same one when back home). While some prefer pool-access room, I certainly liked the higher floor rooms for privacy. They are also brighter and offer a nice view. Pool-access room tend to be close to the noise of the waterfall and to the kids, but that's just personal preference.

The pool: adequate, not too big but not small either. One part gets quite shady in the afternoon while the other stays sunny. There are usually kids playing around the pool area and running so couples beware. This did not bother us though and they happen to be there in the morning only.

The restaurant: breakfast: a lavish and very very succulent spread of freshly cut sliced fruit (kept in the fridge but they are interestingly not too cold), cheese, very tasty hotel-made sorts of crispy muesli, smoked salmon and you name it (no freshly squeezed juices though but this seems a rarity in Bali). All sorts of milk and good coffee is also available. what is very interesting and certainly worth a try is the array of local balinese food including what looks like curries (they are named differently in Indonesia). The devoted Australian manager (Billy) is one of the nicest and most professional people in the industry I have ever met (and I have travelled quite a bit). He does not spare any effort to cater to each guest's dietary preferences and successfully ensures there is a variety of food every day. The indonesian chefs are super nice as well and all ears for any specific requests. It is just a shame they don't have them (the chefs) in the evening restaurant (but Billy knows my view on that :))
Dinner is a mix of burgers and other western food items with a few, very few indonesian specialities. The mince meat used for the burgers is of a very high quality, lean and very tasty. Prices are very very decent for European standards too (about 7 euros for a burger with fries).

The staff: very genuine, very professional and an asset to the property. Dina (I know I spelled her name wrong, sorry), Hariman, and the Operations Manager know their stuff and are the kindest, always willing to help with a smile and doing that extra effort to ensure guests are catered for.

The Gym: an unfortunate disappointment. It has no machines apart from treadmills. An extra bunch of workout machines (please not those multipurpose ones) and a complete set of dumbbells would be most welcome despite the limited space.

The Spa: go for the massages and forget the facials. Spa staff are nice but unexperienced for face treatments sadly (especially those for men requiring a tad extra effort). Prices are very reasonable though.

Location: in the middle of Seminyak. It's 5 to 10 minutes walk down the street to the beach which is ok and a long stretch. Nothing scenic though but unless you travel down to Uluatu (where the scenic gorgeous beaches in Bali are, and yes they exist, check the private beach clubs in Uluatu where you can pay a decent entrance fee and enjoy a private beach with scenic view and crystal clear turquoise water), you won't find anything within reach. A trip to these beaches entirely depends on traffic and would cost about 12 to 15 euros and an hour in a metered taxi (very cheap but very time-consuming). The hotel is about a 30 minute taxi drive from the airport (costing about 12-15 euros in a metered taxi, get your vouchers from the taxi desk after baggage claim or try your luck with one of the cab drivers outside, and no don't worry they don't bite, Bali people are usually very charming and nice).

All in all, I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel for the comfort, the price-quality ratio, the genuine staff, the food (breakfast breakfast breakfast ) and best of all the service. Thanks again to all Courtyard staff and see you soon :)"
3694,Great Stay,40,October 2014,"My wife and I had a great stay at Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak. Location is good. Breakfast is excellent. Amenities are working as expected. However, staff could be more helpful except for my check-in experience which was wonderful when I was attend by Ade.
Check-out experience was not at nice.

I walked to the front desk to check out. A staff pretended not to notice and walked into the room behind the front desk. At that moment, there were 2 staff attending to a guest and a staff attending to another guest. The rest of the staff were no where to be seen. Do you need 2 staff to attend to 1 person? I waited for more than 5 mins and when there were more people waiting near the front desk, the rest of the staff appeared from the room behind front desk. Where is your service excellenceto your guest? Could you be more proactive? Please live up to the Marriot standard."
3695,Excellent staff; great location!,50,October 2014,We stayed at the New Marriott as its called and simply loved it there. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is pretty fabulous! The hotel spa was amazing as was the whole experience! Will recommend to all couples who want to go to bali! The hotel provided the right ambience for families and couples and we had a great time! Thank you to all the staff that went out of their way to ensure that we had a great time!
3696,Just about there!!,30,October 2014,"Nice hotel swift check in room clean but the food is terrible!! Our first nite last nite we ate in the restuarant, my husband and I ordered spring chicken we asked if it was roast chicken and was told yes, it was a chicken breast smothered in mushrooms and cheese, so not what we asked for, breakfast was OK but not great no one serving tea or coffee
had to ask for everything juice in small bottles!
Snack late afternoon in pool bar crisp chicken and fries it was crisp breadcrumbs a chicken bone and under cooked wingettes totally inedible when I told the staff they said don't you like wings the answer is no it was not advertised as wings but they never did anything I am going out to get a decent meal there is no chance in this place Breezes is over the road best stay there in future so much nicer food is fantastic. We go to the pullman in Legian day after tomorrow for a few nites that is a lovely hotel and good food too."
3697,"Good, except the AC unit on rooftop",30,October 2014,"We really loved the hotel. Friendly staff, good food, clean and enough facilities. But we have one true serious complaint which is de noise caused by the central airconditioning unit on the rooftop (stayed in room 624). It was impossible to sit outside with this noise (noise was 75 dB!). That was really disappointing..."
3698,A great start,40,October 2014,"We decided to stay our first night in Bali at the Courtyard by Marriott because it was offering great opening specials ($165USB per night) and it was terrific value. Central, clean and with great service, I recommend the Courtyard by Marriott.

Our 6th floor room had a nice view of the pool but was far enough away to be quiet and relaxing. My friend and I each had a king single and there was enough room for us each to move around without bumping in to each other. The bathroom had everything we needed and was lovely.

The highlight was the delicious breakfast - a massive buffet with something for all tastes, the only difficulty was knowing when to stop eating!"
3699,Impressive!,50,October 2014,"First time travelling with a 14 month old boy to Bali and decided to stay at Courtyard (also a first time in a hotel chain rather than a villa). Very impressed with the hotel staff. Service was top notch and special mention to Anton and Tina for going the extra mile for virtually everything. Everyone loved to play with the boy and made sure that he was a happy kid. Spa was good and very nicely done up. Breakfast spread was amazing and definitely heads and shoulders above the villas we stayed at in Bali. Overall, a great experience and we will visit again!"
3700,Nice place to Stay,40,October 2014,"Such a nice hotel in heart of Seminyak area.
Walking distance to the beach where many cafes along the way, near by good restaurants and shops.
However, the access to the hotel is a bit stressing in the night and trapped while the bars along the road are open üòî
But nothing more I can say apart of the service is perfect!
It pays the traffic üòÑ
And like to thank to Chepy or Chevy (hope one of those spelling is correct) for outstanding service to us!
If we could back stay there again, sure it just because of u.

3701,"new hotel, great pool area and bar,, tiny rooms",40,October 2014,"Stayed a this new marriot hotel recently (room 628, top floor, overlooking pool bar)
Reception area nice and welcoming, staff attentive as always.
Breakfast very nice and fresh, but staff very slow.
Pool area is exceptional, with very nice sunken pool bar, however, service from the bar area is extremely slow.
Different cocktail happy hour is nice but still expect tp pay 18au dollars for 2.
Biggest issue with hotel is the very very tiny rooms, also badly designed doors in bathroom, making the whole living area very clostrophobic.
SEminyak area very nice with ok beach and many many shops, also excellent cheap massages.
All in all a nice marriot hotel, expecially if you spend little time in the little room.
For a more quiet upmarket stay in bali, the stones marriot autograph collection in legian, is very good for a similiar price."
3702,Wonderful service and I am still yet to arrive!,50,October 2014,"I felt compelled to write this review having spoken to Vian, a member of the reservations team today. I had a couple of queries relating to my booking, and also a few questions relating to additional hotel services, such as drivers, sight seeing etc.

Vian was so professional, efficient and helpful. He made detailed enquiries with concierge, and quiet frankly went way beyond the call of duty. I read through the amazing reviews here, and it's pretty clear that this hotel prides itself on exceptional service, and as my first encounter with the Courtyard Marriott this was very much my first impression.

As a fan of trip advisor I will update my review following my stay, but for the time being - thanks Vian."
3703,Outstanding service and great location.,50,September 2014,"My husband and I stayed for 8 nights from 20th September.  There was a slight hiccup when we first checked in however Brad the General Manager was quick to admit to the error and resolve.  The service throughout our stay was oustanding from all staff involved with a special mention to Gina the customer service manager.  The Food was great and the rooms very clean. 
We would definately return and recommend this hotel."
3704,We will return!,50,October 2014,My husband and I have just returned from spending seven days at the Courtyard by Marriott and were thoroughly impressed with the hotel. The staff are exceptional and the rooms really lovely. The breakfasts are a gourmand's delight as are the meals served in the restaurant. We are planning to return next year for an encore.
3705,Fantastic! Would stay again!,50,October 2014,"Wow what a fantastic hotel! The rooms are beautiful, the bathrooms are spacious, the pool and outdoor lounge areas are great, good swim up bar & music throughout the day. Fruit iceypoles each day by the pool that the staff bring around is a great refreshment.
The staff are very attentive & can not do enough for you. I celebrated a birthday there and my friends arranged a cake & they delivered with a lovely card. Each morning we had Herry create our towels into little animals, such a great surprise when we walked in after house keeping each day.
The breakfast was amazing! eggs to order, continental & hot breakfast, range of juices, fruits, cereals & pastries. Speciality coffees Included too. Brad the executive Chef (aussie) was there very morning ensuring everyone was happy with bfast & enjoying it.
I would suggest the ground floor pool access room as it was so nice & convenient to be able to walk In and out of room and right near the pool.
Great location too; mini Mart across from hotel (snacks & drinks), massage places and shops up the road and 10 min walk down to beach.
Overall fantastic value for money hotel, would recommend to anyone couples and families, would stay again!"
3706,"Prompt, good service",40,October 2014,"It's a new hotel so everything works great and is clean. The pool is well maintained and has a in-pool bar. Love that.
It's also very good that request for room service, house keeping, miscellaneous items are all delivered quite quickly and with a smile.
Most of them speak enough English to help you so that's great too.

The one not-so-fantastic thing is that the giant vents on top of the hotel building are pretty loud and so sitting by the balcony at night wasn't as serene and relaxing as it could have been.

Not sure if there's a promotion because the prices were alright but would recommend it!"
3707,If you are looking for a resort don't stay here,30,October 2014,The hotel itself is good but it suits Omaha Nebraska or LAX more than Bali . It has the usual courtyard stuff with a bar and restaurant that is a compromise . I was platinum with Marriott but like with most of these frequent reward programs it means little especially when you reserved their so called best suite .. It was small and would normally be regarded as a junior suite but having said that it had adequate seating and the bed was nice . No draws for storage yet ample space to put to put some shelves but they didn't. I think they feel people take a change of clothes and some bathers for 10 day holiday .I checked out after the first night and no one even asked why . For a one night stay its ok but not for an extended holiday its poor . Its attracting the people that used to stay at the bogan places and seem to mainlybe Aussies. The bars and restaurants around it are full of girly boys so you can imagine the type who frequent those places. If you want to stay with the bogans stay here or otherwise stay at a good resort .. there are hundreds of them. To be fair it's ok but certainly not for me .
3708,Great Hotel and staff,50,September 2014,"Just a few months old, this hotel is stunning. Well designed and beautiful interior.
Stayed for a week, wish it was longer, felt like home. We had a slight glitch when we arrived that was so well handled and we were well compensated, couldn't ask for more really.
Beautiful out side yoga in the mornings, attentive happy staff, relaxed friendly manager and great food all round. We will be back."
3709,Awesome Weekend Break,50,October 2014,"Spent 2 nights at Courtyard Seminyak Bali.

Overall impression was very positive and awesome.

Complimentary upgrade to the 1 bedroom suite: spacious, clean and comfortable.

The hotel staff are all very professional, friendly and did their utmost to meet your request.

Transfer pickup to and fro from airport to hotel was smooth and well-arranged.

Excellent breakfast at Seminyak Kitchen and great lunch and dinner menu to choose from. The staff in particular the executive chef is friendly and accommodating.

Great location of the hotel near seminyak busy street and beach. The security of the hotel was excellent to safe-guard the guest well-being.

Would like to express special thanks to Mr Shashank, Ms Rosmegawati for the special arrangement for hotel and dinner reservation.

A value-added hotel to consider when visiting Bali. Strongly recommended!

3710,Oasis in the heart of Seminyak,50,October 2014,"Highly guest focussed resort. Courteous and genuinely caring staff that go our of their way to make you feel welcome. Special mention to Cepi who treated us like family. Your are the best my friend. Also to Cindy, Puspa and Anton. Other reviews have commented on the quaity of the food (especailly breakfast) and facilities (Rooms, Pool, Zanti, Gym, Kids Club etc). Believe them. This place deserves its high rating across all aspects. Booked a tour to Ubud through the hotel and were provided with a driver who was more of a personal tour guide with detailed local knowlegde (ask for Pak Made). We were also able to set our own schedule. Western Union Currency exchange 100m from hotel has best rates we saw in Seminyak. For the girls, Think Pink Nails is just a short cab ride away. Its worth the trip."
3711,Wonderful exprience,50,August 2014,We were so fortunate to choose the hotel just two days before our stay. The staff were so welcoming on our arrival and we were absolutely thrilled to learn that the hotel had just opened a few hours earlier. It is not always that you are the first person to use a room and all of its amenities. The staff are excellent in every aspect and gave the hotel a warm and caring atmosphere. The breakfast experience was first class and the personal welcome from Bill the Executive chef and his staff was special. The coffees at breakfast were to die for. Most of the day we relaxed at the magnificent pool and again the staff were excellent. We thank all of the hotel staff for .making our stay special
3712,Weekend experience at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak,50,October 2014,"I had a memorable experience to stay at this property last weekend on 04 Oct'14. The room is so nice and comfortable, I had a balcony pool view on the second floor (#227), very close to the pool bar. The pool is so amazing, very modern touch and stylish ornament. When they had live / acoustic music performance on the pool bar stage, it's like having a pool party every day, it is so ""lively"" property.

The service of the staff was so exceptionable, very Marriott standard blended with ""Indonesian"" hospitality. Particularly, in the Seminyak Kitchen outlet during the breakfast time, I had a swift and professional service from one waiter, named Mr. Cepi Supriatna. He knows every sequence of F&B service and make sure that all is delivered properly. He makes me feel more like home home staying here.

I definitely will suggest this property to my friends for holiday in Bali and look forward to return again.

This property surely embrace the philosophy ""Take care of the associates, and the associates will take care the guest, and the guest will come back""

3713,Service & Staff Simply Stunning,50,September 2014,"WOW! We've been to Bali a dozen times before, but this time was special thanks to the Courtyard Marriott in Seminyak. The trip was for my wife's birthday so I wanted to make it special. So I'd emailed the hotel in advance asking if they'd help me organise a surprise of flowers, wine and a card sent from Perth all to be waiting in the room upon our arrival. Gina the guru Customer Service boss replied ""no problems at all and we'll arrange an early check in"". We arrived at 10.30am & by chance met Gina & once she realised we were ""the ones with the special requests"", a subtle wink to staff members saw the service juggernaut of the Courtyard Marriott click in. We checked in & were escorted to our room by Gina, where upon opening the door my wife was greeted with beautiful white orientals, wine, my mailed birthday card PLUS a complimentary Marriott birthday cake - my wife was left speechless. Unfortunately, later that day my wife took ill & was taken to hospital in the Marriott private taxi & had to stay overnight. Next morning at 7am a surprise visit from a Marriott staff member with 2 hotel breakfasts in hand and instructions that the hotel taxi was at our disposal as soon as we were discharged had us taken aback. Discharged nice & early & straight back to the hotel where we met the General Manager, Brad from Melbourne. Well ... what a boss of extraordinary character where nothing was too much with Brad's focus firmly set on ensuring our stay was perfect. Also a huge thanks to Billy the Executive Chef who's expertise in overseeing outstanding food was second to none. Billy also fusses over his pool patrons by servicing us all with freezing refresher face towels and an array of pure fruit popsicles during the day. All in all we would unreservedly (and have) recommended the Courtyard Marriott to absolutely anyone who wanted the perfect hotel experience. Congratulations again BRAD to you and your outstanding staff!
NOTE: The 24 hour bug my wife experienced was DEFINATELY contracted in Perth the day before our arrival and nothing to do with Bali."
3714,Perfect,50,September 2014,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for four nights about a month after it opened, and it could not be faulted. The staff were lovely, helpful but not intrusive. We had a lovely view of the pool from our spacious and sparkling clean room, easy access down to the pool bar for delicious happy hour cocktails. Buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had, and easy walking distance to many other great food and drink options. Four nights just wasn't enough!"
3715,Great resort,50,October 2014,"I am currently staying at Courtyard Marriot for 7 nights. The hotel has only been open for 2 months and it is beautiful. The staff are amazing as are the rooms , pool area and surrounds. It is about 800 metres to the beach but that doesn't worry me as I like to walk and every morning I walk along the beach anyway. The staff are excellent and quickly take on any comments when approached. I had a minor issue about changing rooms and when I mentioned it to Billy ( the head chef from Adelaide ) the issue was resolved within 2 minutes. Many thanks Billy. I must also mention Brad. As I am travelling alone I was sitting by myself near the pool reading for several hours. He had seen me on several occasions and came to see if I was ok. The next thing I know he's standing there with a Bintang for me. It was really appreciated. The staff here care for you and make sure you are having a wonderful time. A great holiday and resort."
3716,amazing stay,50,September 2014,"My daughter and I spent 7 nights during at this hotel during September school holidays and could not have asked for a more amazing place to stay.Location is fabulous, only a short walk to the beach or a complimentary buggy ride, good day spas all around, shopping galore and a good choice of restaurants/bars. It was only a short ride by taxi to the main Seminyak Square. I can not fault the hotel. Day spa even though a little more expensive than outside, convenient. Gym - clean and always a staff member to help out. Water aerobics, yoga, stretch classes, all complimentary. Breakfast was a foodies delight. Overall service outstanding, from front desk to housekeeping. we had a room on the 6th floor overlooking pool, even though a little noisy with kids (school holidays) I cant fault this place. cant wait to go back."
3717,"Best location, lively area close to everything, spotless... Read my complete description below!",50,September 2014,"In few words: This place is a new hotel so it was spotless and very modern. Amazing staff, secure hotel, very large choice and very good breakfast. Great swimming pool and perfect location! Safe to walk and it is very lively all around! Lots of spas, restaurants and bars near by too.

Most of the room have a view on the swimming pool and some on the road (which is ok but not as nice I think). We had a free upgrade to the swimming pool view. Mini bar, toiletries, hair dryer, slippers, laundry service are provided.

Swimming pool
The swimming pool is really big and is exposed in the sun. Water temperature was perfect! There are plenty of sun beds or bean bag to lie down around the pool. Towel for the swimming pool are provided. Music at times (not all the time) is played around the swimming pool so if you look for 100% quiet this place isn't for you however we didn't mind it and we still find it very relaxing. I enjoyed when they played chill out music and the live music at night was nice. There is a bar in one of the pool too. Staff near the swimming pool was really friendly and professional.

Location
I think it is the best location you can have. Walking distance to the beach, less than 5 minutes or they have a golf buggy as well if you need. The hotel is very well located, you can walk to eat street, beach and legian easily! The hotel is in a safe and lively area. To the W hotel it cost around $3 AUD in taxi (make sure you ask for the meter or you might pay double!)

Staff
Everyone from reception, kitchen, pool, bar, security and housekeeping was very professional, helpful, polite and smiling. We were welcomed with free tea and cold towel which was so nice after the flight. I would like to thank the housekeeping staff for making the room spotless and for being attentive to our needs. As we were drinking coffee, the housekeeping staff (Fahrid?) wrote us a little note and gave us extra mineral water bottles that we could use for the coffee, very thoughtful of the staff.

Breakfast
(so tasty and large choice!)
Our breakfast was included. Wow it was so good! A very large buffet that included fruits, raw vegetables, salad, cheese, ham, Asian dishes, continental breakfast, bread (non gluten option too), croissants, pains au chocolat, jam, vegemite, peanut butter, honey, ice cream, eggs (benedicte, poached, fried,sunny side up, boiled...) or omelettes plain or with anything you want in it such as mushrooms, cheese, chives.... The potatoes with rosemary and Parmesan were really nice, bacon, baked beans, tomatoes...yogurt, juices Are available too and many more! Staff was really attentive and professional.

Spa
The staff at the spa was so kind, welcoming and very nice. I had a facial by Tri, she was really delicate with her movements and the product she used were nice. It cost about$ 35 USD for a facial and around the same price for a massage. The atmosphere in the spa is really peaceful and relaxing, beautiful room. The staff at the reception of the spa was incredibly nice and friendly. (I forgot their name sorry, 2 males).

Taxi / transport from airport to seminyak.
*The staff was very efficient and organised a taxi for us (via email) from the airport to the hotel (it costs $25 USD ( included tax). It can be much cheaper if you organise it yourself but as we were arriving late we didn't wanted to line up for a cab for too long. There were a really long wait to clear the immigration at the airport and the driver was waiting over an hour for us. Really reliable service.

Security
Every time you walk in you need to scan your bag and go under the metal detector but it takes 30 sec! I read that some people were upset about the security especially when they come by taxi but this is very common in seminyak. If you don't want then to check the car as it can take up to one minute, just ask the driver to drop you on the other side of hotel (about 2 meters away from main entrance).

The staff at the security was really kind and professional :)

My only point for improvement will be maybe to provide juice in a large jar rather than using individual small bottles (too be a bit more sustainable).
Also i think that the towel in the room didn't need to be washed everyday in order to save water but some towel racks will be needed in the room then in order for the towel to dry and to be kept the next day."
3718,one of the best holiday ever,50,September 2014,"we stayed with our two kids aged 8 and 5 in the Hotel Courtyard for 6 nights and I can say that we had one of the best family experience ever.
The location is so convenient to get the beach of Seminyak (actually 5 mins walking) and admire the breathtaking sunset laying on the beans bags of the several colored bar on the shoreline.
But coming back to the hotel, we have been pampered all day long by the hotel's staff always ready to assist us with a genuine smile.
We stayed in a deluxe pool view room with two double beds which was enough spacious for our family. The furniture is new and looks modern and of good quality. Everything was at hand and we didn't miss any comfort we have at home.
The double pool is simply amazing and definitely very clean and never busy.
As far as the food is concerned, the breakfast offers really everything you can desire while the kids lunch and dinner menu could offer a wider choice.
However that did not affect our stay wich was simply perfect.
A special thanks to Brad, the hotel manager, for having taken care of us until the last minute before leaving.
Great choice wich very much worth the price!"
3719,Fantastic Family Holiday,50,September 2014,"Our 10 night stay in September was amazing. The first point to note is the staff were all extremely helpful, friendly and always smiling. Nothing was ever too much bother for them. All of the staff were fantastic with our 3 children, in particular August and Arti who were there during breakfast. On the breakfast point, the food was delicious and plenty of selection in the buffet menu. Another nice touch included Head chef Billy chatting with holiday makers not only about the restaurant and food service offered but about activities/places to visit in Bali. Our rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean. The pool and gardens were beautiful. Great location. The GM Brad added such a personal touch by saying good morning to all he passed and providing great knowledge also on activities/places to visit in Bali. We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be making another trip here."
3720,Weekend getaway!,50,August 2014,"Having lived in Bali since 2013, weekend getaway is a must. I have been staying in a few hotels just to get away from work-related stress, so I decided to try out Courtyard by Mariott, and glad I did. This hotel is amazing, close to everything you need to be during holiday. It is new and the staff are friendly, warm and welcoming. The moment you step into the lobby, you will be taken care of. Awesome place to get away!"
3721,Fabulous finish to holiday,50,September 2014,"The last night of our family holiday, hubby had to go back to work, mum and dad returned to AUS so that left myself and my two girls (10 & 13) to ourselves. Got online and picked to the best lastminute rate. WOW what a surprise!! The service from the minute we walked in was outstanding. Being by myself with girls I felt totally comfortable, and pampered throughout the 2 days. Icypoles provided by the pool, asked directions to the beach early evening and were taken on a hilarious golf buggy ride to the beach, the most outstanding breakfast buffet I have ever seen which included the head chef checking on guests and extra tastings being delivered to our table. I know it's a new hotel and they may be trying hard but if they keep this up it will be the best accomm in bali very quickly. Would look at staying here first next time in bali. We'll done Marriott. Leeanne and girls from AUS"
3722,5 star at 4 star price,50,September 2014,"Booked a bargain deal thru travel zoo for 5 nights of luxury. Rooms not as big as Marriott Nusa Dua but beautiful with top class amenities. Our pool view was on level 2 near the pool bar and lounge but was not noisy at all despite hotel having 100% occupancy.

Service couldn't be more helpful and friendly - mini bar emptied before arrival, complimentary cocktails and massages, happy 2 hours 2-for-1 cocktails (lychee martini is a must A$10 for 2), complimentary shuttle to beach and seminyak square. All staff are super friendly and helpful with any request greated with a smile and awesome service. Food is not expensive 75000 IDR (A$7.50) for satays and rice or calamari and chips or burger and chips at the pool lounge.

The spa is awesome and very good hotel prices (A$30 for 1 hour massage), 24h modern fitness room, free yoga early morning classes, aqua aerobics free about 11am, great kids club. The buffet breakky is divine with staff bring around special tasters during breakky such as mango smoothies and banana fritters. I even saw someone getting a plate of 4 hash browns cooked just for them. Free lattes included with the buffet is the best way to start a day of shopping. A spectacular array of breakfast selection of the very best quality.

The pool is even better than the photos with plenty of space, sun and shade, deck chairs, lemon infused water being offered, even complimentary fruit ice blocks. Some kids around (5 at the most at one time) but not too many to annoy us adults especially as is school holidays - maybe they were in the free kids club. Even the hotel's free wifi works great around the pool.

As this was my second trip to Bali this year my plan was to relax around the pool and go shopping. This hotel was perfect for my mission and I have already booked and paid to return next April! Just have to decide if I should go in July too!"
3723,Outstanding new seminyak hotel,50,September 2014,"Close to beach
Close to shopping
Close kuta and seminyak center
Marriott Courtyard is an outstanding new property
The property is centrally located, with excellent professional staff who are very attentive and share a very special Balinese warmth."
3724,Amazing!!,50,September 2014,"Wow what an amazing stay we had. The staff were pleasant, polite and extremely helpful. The suites are spacious, well appointed and clean.
We spent many hours lazing by the pool enjoying the best Mojitos we have ever had. We eagerly awaited happy hour every day just so that we could sample the cocktails on offer. The pool area is beautiful with immaculately maintained gardens.
Fitness centre is well equipped and we enjoyed our daily workouts there.
The breakfast buffet was to die for, so much variety and Executive Chef Billy would make a point of greeting us and would want to know if we had everything that we needed. Such great service from the wonderful staff.
We will definitely be back, overall one of the nicest hotels we have been to in Bali."
3725,A welcome change!,50,August 2014,"After a stressful week at work, we needed a break and this gem of a hotel nearby. The staff were excellent, friendly and welcoming, from the front desk, restaurant staff (chef included) down to the pool attendance. Great breakfast buffet! Impressive indeed."
3726,Great Service and Great Location,50,September 2014,"We recently Stayed at Courtyard by Marriott at Seminyak.
The hotel is positioned in very good area, short stroll to the beach, surrounded with numerous dining options and minimart as well.
First Impression of this hotel was great service from the front desk, all the staff are helpful and friendly. Especially Gina Suryana Front Office Manager really take care of all the guest needs. Becausw when we C/I, there's another guest waiting for Gina even the front desk staff beside me was available, she still want to wait until gina finish her C/I process with us. That was really great service.
Beds are a good size and room is comfortable, especially the room with pool view.
Good value for money for a new hotel in that price range, especially with some of the opening specials."
3727,Best place to stay in Bali,50,September 2014,"The pictures of this hotel on Expedia does not do this hotel any justice! The hotel was of excellent standard and the level of service was exceptional. The hotel is in a perfect location, near the beach and within walking distance to all the shops.

This is a brand new modern hotel with the traditional Balinese feel. The hotel spa is of excellent value and treatment were just exceptional I ended up having several treatments at the hotel as the staff are highly trained therapists.

The head chef Billy personally made effort with all hotel guests to take on any comments etc.."
3728,Good service,50,September 2014,"Stay in this hotel two nights at a deluxe pool view room. The hotel very new, staff friendly, great pool. Just the gym bit small but good enough in early when not too many people. Breakfast was great, many choices. The location is good, close to everything. Definitely will stay here again"
3729,"If you like hotels, this is for you",40,September 2014,"We got a great deal at the last minute, and found it a perfectly adequate hotel, nice rooms, pool- although a little small for a hotel this size. I'm not a hotel person, we had a villa for the week before which I preferred, but the staff are very helpful, beds great - and reliable wi fi which is so rare in Bali. And the head chef came out and greeted guests which I thought was charming!
Overall, a nice hotel."
3730,Not your typical courtyard,40,September 2014,"Stayed 2x in early September, two night an then a three night stay.
This is not your typical courtyard by any means- it is far far better. This hotel exceeded my expectations on a service level - across the board from front desk, the breakfast service and pool service. The staff are fabulous! I was welcomed with ice tea, cool towel and an ice cream. The room itself is typical, king size bed, flat screen and nice rain shower. Balcony is great to dry bathing suits. The pool gets very busy- when I was there they were at 45% room capacity and there were no extra chaises by the pool- not sure what they will do when it gets busier. Only negative is that breakfast is very pricy for the buffet- almost $30 Aus/$28 Usd
Service charge is also hefty- but I guess that is instead of a tip. I would recommend and stay again.
Overall a very relaxing stay."
3731,EXCELLENT HOSPITALITY,40,September 2014,"Stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott - Seminyak - Bali between Sep 19 - Sep 22, 2014. It was a nice experience. Everyone at the hotel was extremely courteous and friendly. The hotel is brand new. Rooms and interiors are sparkling clean.

CHECK IN - The check in process was very quick. The front desk people were courteous and the hospitality was outstanding. After a tiring 3 hour long queue at the Denpasar airport for the visa on arrival we were given welcome drinks and towel during the check in. I had made a mistake of booking a room with two double beds, but during check in we requested for a single king size bed which they readily obliged. Tony who did the check in for us was very courteous and friendly. He even did a free deluxe room upgrade.

ROOM - We stayed at level 3 and the room was quite good. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was good. The balcony had a comfortable sofa.

BREAKFAST - The breakfast spread was quite nice with a made to order egg counter.

IN ROOM DINING - We ordered in room dining a few times but the menu needs more variety.

POOL BAR - The pool bar has a very good design and the staff were extremely friendly.

CHECK OUT - The check out process was also quite fast and efficient.

LATE CHECK OUT - Since our return flight was in the late evening, we requested for a late check out at 16:00 hrs for which Tony at the front desk readily obliged.

LOCATION - Being in the heart of Seminyak, there are a zillion shops, restaurants, money changers, tour operators, pubs, bars, supermarkets around the hotel.

ISSUES:

ROOM
(1) When we checked in we found there were lots of ants in the room. When I was about to call the front desk for help, we found they had kept a ""Baygon"" Insect spray inside the wardrobe, so we sprayed and the ant problem was sorted out. SUGGESTION - Housekeeping should check the room before allocating it to a guest.
(2) The reading chair was placed next to the wardrobe in a cluttered fashion and it was quite uneasy to use the wardrobe. SUGGESTION - Please put in a smaller chair, so that the wardrobe is easily accessible.
(3) The ""Nirvae"" range of toiletries were not smelling good. We had to buy our own soap and shampoo. SUGGESTION - Maybe Nirvae is Marriott's flagship product, but atleast a better smelling range of toiletries is preferred.

BREAKFAST
(1) During breakfast, the staff bring coffee or tea to the table only once. They never approach for a coffee or tea refill. Being a new hotel with excellent tariff, there were lot of guests and it was quite difficult to search for a guy to refill our coffee. SUGGESTION - Please ask guests if they need coffee / tea refill at their table.

HOUSEKEEPING
(1) I doubt that the bed linen is changed every day. As we found that after the second day the bed was done with the same crumpled bed linen. SUGGESTION - The bed linen can be changed every day.
(2) On day two my wife found that the housekeeping did not refill the coffee and sugar in the room. When my wife called the house keeping they brought exactly 2 sachets of coffee and 2 sachets of sugar. After the housekeeping guy left my wife found that even creamer was not kept during room cleaning, yet the guy who came to refill also did not bother to check whether there was creamer. SUGGESTION - Housekeeping must check and ensure that coffee, sugar and creamer are refilled during room cleaning everyday.

IN ROOM DINING
(1) On the third day, we ordered minestrone soup and potato wedges. When my wife opened the soup bowl, to her horror she found a big huge chunk of brown bread in the soup which, by the time the guy brought it to our room, had already soaked in the soup and my wife had exactly one single spoon of soup to drink!!!!!!!!!! SUGGESTION - Please ensure that the kitchen staff are trained in these small things so that guests don't feel irritated.

POOL BAR
(2) My wife ordered vodka and orange juice and the barman brought a huge glassful of orange juice and vodka in a separate glass. Either the barman does not know that when someone orders vodka and orange juice, the juice is just a mixture for the vodka, not a huge tall glass of orange juice to be drunk separately. SUGGESTION - Please ensure that the bar staff are trained on these small things.

HOTEL TAXI
(1) The rates of hotel taxi is more than double the rate when you pick a taxi from the road or from one of the tour people down the road. Being in Seminyak, I suggest it is better to use a taxi from the road or from one of the tour guys down the road than using the hotel taxi.

POSITIVES

PEOPLE
(1) Every single employee of the hotel is extremely helpful, courteous, enthusiastic, friendly and smiling at all times, which is a very big plus in the hospitality industry.
(2) The front desk people are very efficient during check in / check out. Especially Tony in the front desk needs commendation!!!!!

FINALLY......

Having staff who have a fantastic attitude will take the hotel only to a certain level.

As mentioned above, the management and staff need to buckle up on the level of service delivery, only then will the hotel be able to come up on top in the long run!!"
3732,Great hospitality and amazing staff,40,September 2014,"We recently stayed at Courtyard Marriott for 7 nights (2 adults and one child). We cannot fault the staff who were so accommodating and friendly, and went out of their way to assist us with everything we needed. The room was very comfortable and perfect for what we needed.
Marriott has extra security at their entrance which means each time you come back into the hotel (weather by car or walking) you need to go through the security screening - it takes less than a minute and gave us the peace of mind that the General Manager takes his security and that of his guests very seriously. We knew that each and every car, guest, staff, bus etc that came to the Marriott was through screened to 4ensure our safety.

Head Chef Billy was friendly as was all of his team - always wandering around making sure the food was out and guests happy.

General Manager Brad Edman was fantastic, and always chatting to the guests to make sure they were comfortable and have everything they needed.

For a hotel that has only been open 6 weeks, they are doing an exceptional job and you can see that each and every team member takes pride in their position. A special mention to team member Mr Poo who went above and beyond for us - couldn't have been more helpful so we are very grateful.

The only thing we were disappointed in (only a little) was the kids club - not a whole lot to do there and the menu of activities listed outside the door were never available. I guess once they are set up properly all the activities will be available."
3733,Brilliant!,50,September 2014,"We stayed here last week, had a room on the bottom floor right in front of the pool. The room was perfect, bed was to die for. Could not find a single thing to complain about. We were met on the first day at breakfast by the head chef, Billy who made us feel at home in the Seminyak Kitchen, (we ate there a few times at dinner, have the chicken curry served in a coconut, it's delicious) Security is over the top, but not an inconvenience at all, felt very safe always. Brad, the hotel manager, (although you'd never pick it) made us feel at home. I would be surprised if a stay at this place wouldn't satisfy the most fussiest person. We will be back. One more thing, if you go to the pool bar,(and you will) A young waiter, Kesawa, was the most friendliest guy we have ever met. He will go a long way in this industry. Good friend too. Dave and Derrilee Noah"
3734,Pure luxury,50,September 2014,"This Courtyard Marriot Seminyak is brand new, beautifully fitted out and with the most amazing staff I have ever encountered. The rooms are expectedly lovely for a 5 star new hotel and the design of the pool and courtyard area makes for a lush, relaxing and elegant atmosphere. The gym and spa are amazing and the buffet breakfast is out of this world. Having said all of this though, what really made the experience magical was the staff. Friendly, happy, so attentive and always going out of their way to make sure your every wish is catered for. Examples of this are the chefs walking around at breakfast to chat to guests, offer samples of new foods to your table and explain what any of the foreign foods are. Also a complimentary late check out - 7pm! And so helpful with advice and directions. Location is perfect, 2 minutes to the beach, in a really nice area and there are restaurants, bar, boutiques and cafes all around. I really cannot say enough good things about this hotel - I will be back there as soon as I get the chance!!"
3735,Faultless,50,September 2014,"We were extremely impressed by the quality of this hotel. The check in was seamless and the staff overheard us discussing what we were going to do when we checked out as we had a late flight and they were able to offer us a late check out at no extra charge. I cannot tell you how impressed and thankful we were!! The breakfast was excellent and the staff here remembered our names and and went out of their way to help in any way they could. The pool and grounds were lovely. I would suggest that a menu be available for happy hour drinks as this was a little confusing but really not a big deal, just a suggestion. The rooms were also beautiful and they were very thoroughly cleaned throughout our stay. Location was also very convenient, close to Seminyak beach and $3AUD to 'eat street' via taxi. I would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to stay again!"
3736,Amazing 5 star hotel,50,September 2014,"If you are looking for a super nice hotel in Seminyak this is it. The staff is super friendly, the buffet breakfast incredible. The beach is close and the hotel pool is awesome. We stayed for two nights, it seemed like long enough for this area."
3737,Great Hotel and Location,40,September 2014,"My wife and I stayed recently at Courtyard by Marriott Bali in Seminyak. When booking the hotel we were attracted by the fact the hotel is brand new and had great promotional rates. The hotel is positioned in very good area, short stroll to the beach, surrounded with numerous dining options, supermarket (Minimart) and reputable money exchange facility opposite the hotel. Upon arrival to the hotel you must go through security check (in fact you go through scanning every time you come back to the hotel) which feels somewhat excessive, but it also give you a peace of mind that you are safe while staying there. Part of our deal was to be upgraded to the ""Deluxe Pool View Room"", otherwise would faced busy and noisy street. When entered our hotel room for the first time it felt rather small, but after first night sleep we got settled and the room was adequate for our needs, except for the storage space - there are no drawers and somewhat insufficient shelving space. There is also a desk with the chair, but due to lack of the space not easy to use. Amongst standard inclusions the room is equipped also with a large 42"" smart LCD screen with the local and foreign TV stations, comfortable small sofa, rechargeable torch light, personal safe and free internet Wi-Fi connection.
There was a glitch with the air conditioning unit which could not operate within a comfortable room temperature. Room was either to cold (below 21oC) or to warm (above 26oC). This was not too big problem for us so we did not ask to be fixed.
The bathroom is large comparing to the bedroom, but again there is not much shelving for the toiletries. The bathroom is equipped with a bidet type of toilet seat and very spacious shower cabin with two shower nozzles (telephone and overhead rainforest type). As we were on the 6th floor the large overhead nozzle did not have sufficient water pressure to work to its best potential.
Each room has its own small balcony with very comfortable sofa seating. As mentioned the hotel is new so everything is clean and fresh.
The buffet breakfast menu is very extensive and includes continental type breakfast food, cold cuts, egg station, fresh fruit, vegetables, pastries, cakes and also local Balinese food. All the breakfast food is tasty and prepared well. The kitchen is supervised by young head chef Billy from South Australia who greets every guest which makes your stay more personal. We dined one night at the hotel restaurant and meal was ok, but there are many better options in the area.
All the staff at the hotel are very polite, smiling all the time which makes you feel welcomed. The staff at the breakfast reception try really hard to greets you by your name.
The swimming pool was nice and clean with comfortable lounge chairs. When staying by the pool we were frequently given cold refreshment towels, free cold lemon infused water and shot glasses of fruit salad. The only negative about the pool was the large waterfall which makes constant noise and becomes annoying after a while, so we stayed further away from it, on the other side of the pool. (Possible solution would be to decrease the pump pressure to minimise the waterfall flow?)
As our flight back to Australia was late at night we asked for the late checkout at 8PM, unfortunately our room was already booked, the best they could give us was a 3pm checkout . We were offered to stay around the pool area and use hotel amenities until we leave. So we spend another couple hours sunbathing at the pool while our luggage was stored. We showered and changed our clothes in the pool area amenities which are very spacious and clean. They even brought hairdryer for my wife upon her request.
We enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak and would recommend it to others."
3738,Great new hotel near Seminyak beach,40,September 2014,"Had a great time at the Courtyard in Seminyak. Great location near restaurants, shopping, beach, and nightlife. It is a brand new hotel so everything is clean and in perfect condition. Beds are a good size and room is comfortable. All outlets are international which makes it easy for foreigners. Breakfast variety is fantastic! And served until lunch time! Staff is friendly, helpful, and speak good English. Hotel provides golf cart rides to beach, which is a very short walk from the hotel."
3739,Great stay,50,September 2014,"Friendly staff, great pool, spacious rooms this courtyard is really great it has ticked all the boxes the staff are really friendly to all and it's facilitates are great even the spa gives top massages ! Deffinitly would come back to the courtyard marriott"
3740,Family holiday,50,September 2014,"Great location, easy access to all the fabulous shops and restaurants.
Great facilities, staff very attentive, it was the little things that made the difference. The free cold lemon infused water and shot glasses of fruit salad offered while lying arount the pool.
The shuttle that takes you to Double Six beach. An awesome time was had, we will be back.
Security is very good.
SophieM"
3741,So good,50,September 2014,"Outstanding hotel so far , got 2 more days left. All staff very polite and helpful. 5mins walk to the beach ( good for landscape photographer). Breakfast is good and chef acutally walks around to greet guest and have lil chats. Room is very nice and clean. Overall I would reccommmended to anyone who is looking for a comfortable stay."
3742,Lovely New Hotel (but),40,August 2014,"My partner and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Bali Seminyak when we decided to extend our Bali trip. We passed the hotel several times as we were staying in a villa just around the corner. We were attracted to the hotel because it was brand new and also had some great last minute rates (I assume as the hotel is new). The hotel itself was very well presented. The grounds were lovely and the pool area with swim up pool bar was fantastic. The staff we very friendly and all spoke excellent English. My partner lost his iPhone on the hotel grounds and the staff managed to recover his phone and return it to us. We also requested an extra late check out and this was no problem at all. The room was very nice. We booked a pool access room. It was a generous size and had a very spacious bathroom too. The room rate also included breakfast which we really enjoyed. The buffet had a great selection of Western and Asian food along with a cook to order egg station. Other reviewers have mentioned the security was very thorough and we experienced this also, each time we entered the hotel our bags were scanned and we were requested to walk through metal detectors. We did not have any issues with this procedure. However, I was extremely disappointed and applauded at the treatment of the K9 security dog which was working on the entry gate. Each time we left / entered the hotel the same dog was working and quite obviously exhausted. I was quite upset to see the dog dragged around the perimeter of the car. We are regular travelers to Bali and this has deterred me from staying at the Courtyard by Marriott again."
3743,"Friendly, great service, lovely new facilities",50,September 2014,"Highly recommended. Staff tried extra hard to be helpful, and facilities were great. Breakfast a highlight, with plenty of options and high quality. Australian kitchen-head and hotel manager. Security very good - efficient and friendly."
3744,Great service friendly staff,50,September 2014,We were greeted by friendly staff which made us feel welcome especially a gentleman at the check in desk his name ADE he couldn't do enough for me and my wife he is a great asset to the company always smiling in saying this all staff are to be commended the rooms where very clean the service was excellent the pool was great all in all a great hotel to stay in Bali I highly recommend it Charlie
3745,Amazing,50,September 2014,"I booked into the Courtyard Marriott at the last minute after a villa mosquito disaster (don't ask) and am SO glad I did!

I honestly cannot fault this hotel, and it's fabulous, friendly staff.

Every single staff member here deserves a special mention, but my particularl thanks goes to Brad the GM, Billy the Exec Chef, Debbie in the Kids Club and Novi and Indah at breakfast for making my very frazzled self feel welcome, along with my baby!

Amazing breakfast, clean/cool/modern guest rooms, fab pool, fully kitted gym and great location on dhyana pura - you really need to stay at this hotel!

Thanks guys , from the frazzled mum and mosquito bitten baby :)"
3746,Nice new hotel,40,August 2014,"We stayed at the new Courtyard for the first couple of nights of our holiday. This was mainly to check it out for future holidays. To be honest it didn't start that well when we arrived on a late flight to find that the Marriotts airport transfer wasn't there for us. I found them waiting for another guest who called the hotel for me & confirmed that they had not sent anyone.. We ended up catching a taxi.. The supervisor was very sorry & the feedback would be provided (I had confirmed the transfer twice).

Overall this is a good new hotel, the staff are friendly & are out to please! Billy the Executive Chef really does make the place & is a huge asset to the team.

Rooms are good, we stayed in a deluxe room for the first night & a one bedroom pool access suite on the second night.

The pool is nice but one side only seems to get some morning sun then is shaded for the rest of the day. Some people may like this but for sun lovers like me, you'll need to chase the sun or make sure you grab a chair on the sunny side before they get taken!

Good value for money for a new hotel in that price range, especially with some of the opening specials."
3747,Great Hotel in a Great location...,50,August 2014,"We stay at Courtyard last august, this brand new hotel just open on August 1st. Everything is great. The design, the pool, the restaurant, the room is great. We arrive around 12 at noon and they give us early check in and we also receive free upgrade to Pool View room. All the staff are very friendly.. typical Balinese people. The pool is quite large and have a cool pool bar inside it. The breakfast is awesome, the have many kind of food and including tropical fruit served. Typical of many Marriott hotel, they have a high standard of security start from the front door, the have K9 and a lot of checking when you arrive with car. They even force you to X-ray all your baggage and we have to walk through a metal detector. For some people who demand a high safety, this is the hotel that suitable for you. But some people may feel quite annoying of all the treatment. But it's fine for us. The location is very great, in the heart of Seminyak region. Near to the La Plancha restaurant. Great site to hangout at night. They have a free buggy to drop you to the beach. The only drawback is they have a large exhaust pipe at the top of the south building, it's quite noisy from my room balcony. Maybe because my room at the top floor, and near them. But the sound is significantly lowered when you inside the room and close the balcony door. Hopefully the PIC can read my review and do something about it. But Overall it's a nice stay and holiday for us at Courtyard Seminyak."
3748,New hotel with excellent service,50,September 2014,"We booked this hotel with a wotif mystery deal and saved about $40/night. It was easy to confirm airport transfers over facebook and we were greeted at the airport as soon as we cleared immigration/customs. While we checked in we were offered tea, ice cream and a cold towel - a very nice touch! Our initial room didn't have working lights be we were promptly upgraded and settled in.
The breakfast is wonderful - western and Indonesian foods, an egg station (cooked while you wait), waffles/pancakes and ice cream, pastries, fruits, cereals and even a sandwhich bar! We didn't stay long enough to taste it all sadly.
The gym is small and basically equipped, but with free towels, water and shower facilities. The laundry facilities were also excellent - a few days of clothes returned within 3 hours for less than $30!
The hotel staff were happy to assist with booking tours, calling taxis and airport transfers."
3749,6 Star Standards,50,September 2014,"Just returned from what was meant to be a quick shopping trip but turned out to be one of those Holidays where you don't want it to end. In fact we extended our stay by 2 days just because this newly opened Hotel was so special. As Bali regulars we are quite particular on where we stay as we do like a bit of luxury and comfort for a reasonable price and in a prime location, this ticks all the boxes plus more. Without repeating what all the other great reviews say about this place we were lucky enough to get a Pool access room at the very back near the shallow pool which meant full afternoon sun and easy access. The room is stylish yet simple, spacious, excellent bathroom, perfect quiet Air conditioning and well set out for business etc. Wifi is superfast anywhere throughout the Hotel which is very important to us.In fact we chose this hotel due to the location and notion that it was more for the business type client and not the typical lay back Bali type Hotel however, the 2 day extension to our stay was mostly due to the relaxing and charming ambiance that we felt while we were there and did not actually want to leave! Even the sound of children and cold pool could not deter us. Staff is exceptional on every level from the gardener, the driveway security, front office, restaurant, even the annoying security procedure upon every entry was made pleasant with the always cheerful staff. Credit is due to GM Brad, Exec Chef Billy and all the supervisors who are clearly the back bone to making this place so wonderful in every aspect. They are definitely hands on and very passionate about this establishment and their positions. Impressed with the Front office staff especially Ari, as they actually listen and are very accommodating. We asked for a late check out and unlike other places we have stayed at where the departments fail to communicate to each other we were not once called upon by either housekeeping of front office hassling us to get out of the room. What may seem as such a small aspect is a lasting impressions which sums up this Hotel perfectly. Highly recommended and we shall be returning before the end of the year."
3750,A very satisfying experince,50,September 2014,"The hotel staff is very friendly and attentive to your needs, They go out of your way to accomodate your needs. the pool bar was fantastic and a great place to chill out with friends and family.

Breakfast was good with both continental as well as local dishes on offer. The rooms were clean and relatively well designed."
3751,Amazing Experience,50,September 2014,"The hotel just opened couple of months before but yet the service was excellent. Friendly staff and amazing breakfast. The room was so comfort and the view was so cool, especially the pool access room. The staffs were so helpful, from the security, front desk, pool bar, housekeeping and restaurant. Friendly and great experience. Very good wi-fi service. Also great location only 7-8 mins walk to beach.

Thanks to ""Sila"" from the front desk, who upgraded our room from deluxe to deluxe pool view. Also we requested for late checkout as our flight was at 11pm. They offered max late check out that is 6:30pm.

Amazing experience, totally loved it."
3752,Wonderful stay!,50,August 2014,"We were meant to stay 2 nights here and on my second night I fell ill, the hotel staff were wonderful and helped throughout the stay. The room, amenities and hotel facilities were great. The breakfast buffet - delicious, so many options for all tastes! I would highly recommend this hotel although I will stay closer to Petitengett next stay, if you want to get around get a metered taxi as they're a huge fraction of what transport cars try to charge you."
3753,"Amazing, engaging, comforting",50,September 2014,"10 out if 10! Friendly, functional, personal. This has been a great family experience. The menu is accommodating embracing Bali tradition with an international cuisine. Children are well accommodated. This is an excellent family experience."
3754,"Stop looking, book here!!",50,September 2014,"Being my first time to Bali, I was extremely nervous about my upcoming trip and to be honest was hesitant coming (I get sick easily) however during my stay at Courtyard by Marriott I felt at ease and relaxed, I didn't need or want for anything, everything is at your finger tips and the wonderful staff are more than happy to accommodate you.

The moment you arrive you are greeted by friendly security gaurds, some previous trip advisors weren't thrilled by this and marked them down, I on the other hand think it is fantastic the levels they go to monitor our safety.

The rooms are of decent size, comfortable king size bed and the bathroom was great, loved the 2 option shower head. Was thrilled to hear the water on the premises is treated, eliminating the stress of closed mouth showers!! The rooms are quite, I didn't hear from the other guests at all, which meant for a relaxing night in front of the tv after a big day out and about..

Breakfast was awesome, from egg stations, fresh fruit and salad, pastry bar, hot food station, cerals, toasts and not to mention the waffles and pancakes bar, served with fresh ice cream, delicious, all topped by meeting the Executive Chef himself, Billy, who was both accommodating and helpful with suggestions for the local area.

I highly recommend the on site spa, Zanti Retreat, I had been suffering a headache prior to our trip and I had instant relief from my massage, in my opinion worth the extra few dollars over the street massages.

Overall a wonder experience had by us, with another 3 nights to go, I highly recommend the Courtyard by Marriott for your next stay in Bali..

Relax by the pool, have a drink and a bite to eat at the swim up pool while listening to music... perfect!!

Thank you to all the team at Courtyard by Marriott, Seminyak for making our stay so enjoyable, see you next time."
3755,"Amazing experience, just perfect!",50,September 2014,"I can not fault this hotel. Yes, the security is stringent, but the staff make it a friendly experience and walking through a metal detector a couple of times a day to smiling security guards is little price to pay to be in a secure complex. The rooms are modern, relaxing and quiet, with a nice sized balcony. Pool and pool bar is fantastic. We have been here six nights so far (with another two to go) and haven't been able to top the quality of food served in both in the restaurant, and pool bar (and very reasonable prices!). I would happily eat here for every meal, with a good selection of local and international food.

Location is great, The beach is only about an easy five minute walk away and there's lots of shops and beauty spas right outside the hotel. This is my first time in Bali and I didn't know what to expect, I can say that it's exceeded all expectations. We went on a couple of day trips with drivers through the hotel, everything was so easy and really made the holiday relaxing.

The grounds are beautiful and there's never too many people around so you feel like you have space to relax. Fast free wifi from the room and public areas. Did I mention the breakfast? Billy and the team do a great job accommodating for every dietary requirement. Friendly staff who do a great job of remembering our names and are always welcoming.

I only booked this hotel at the last minute and am very happy with the choice, I highly recommend the Marriott Courtyard Seminyak."
3756,Great new hotel with excellent service!,50,August 2014,"The hotel just opened for couple weeks but yet the service was excellent. Friendly staff and amazing breakfast.
The room was so comfort and the view was so cool, especially the pool access room.
The staffs were so helpful, from the security, front desk, pool bar, housekeeping and restaurant.
Thanks to Gina FOM who arranged the birthday surprise, Sila FO who assisted for check in, Mob from Pool bar and others I couldn't remember the name.
Absolutely will be back again."
3757,Friendly & attentive service in a brand new hotel,50,August 2014,"The check-in experience was fast and the friendly staff were eager to please. Each guest was welcomed with a layered popsicle made of 3 types of fresh fruit juices, a cup of chilled Iced Lemon Tea and a cool moist towel. The popsicle is a cool treat to savour on a warm afternoon. Though there wasn‚Äôt a vanity in the room, that was made up for by a well-lit make up mirror in the fairly long and spacious bathroom. When I booked the hotel, I was a little disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt going to be a bath. However, the rainshower and shower bench made up for it. I loved the view of the main pool and the Pool Bar from my balcony. The attentive pool attendant was diligent about making his rounds offering guests chilled water. I look forward to staying here again when I next visit Bali even though I‚Äôve never actually stayed at the same place twice. It‚Äôs not often you encounter exceptional service and this new hotel is definitely on the right track.

3758,Great New Playground in Seminyak,50,September 2014,"Excellent property, with perfect facilities and fulfilled with marvelous staff. Working in hospitality industry as well, I do totally understand how we could enjoy the time during holiday. Managements were always around in the lobby to assure all guests were well looked after, witnessed waiter at the pool bar was attentive and helpful to every single guest needs.

Swimming pool has very nice design and environment, nice music performance in the afternoon at the bar.

Rooms were spacious and very clean, thank you for the welcome amenities in the room. It's really something when entering the room and ""welcomed"" by ""them"" :)

Breakfast was awesome! Many selection of foods, beef bacon was absolutely the best part!

Special thanks to the management of the hotels and all of the front office team.

You guys are rock!

All the best!"
3759,HORRIBLE SECURITY,10,September 2014,"Every time I entered the hotel on a motorbike I had to dismount and they checked everything. Even 5 times a day. Then I had to go through a security screen which always beeps. Then they searched me. 5 times a day. Some security are very rude. All my bags have to go through an x-ray, no matter how small the bag. 5 times a day. By the time I finally entered the hotel, all my holiday enjoyment had gone. This is worse than Heathrow airport. No other hotel security in Bali is liken this. This is not hotel security. It is as though the president is coming to stay. A bad experience."
3760,Speechless,50,August 2014,"This brand new hotel was amazing. We stayed in the two bedroom apartment and the layout was awesome! (a U shape with lounge room at the base) Every inch of this place oozes class. The kids club staff were amazing, taking our 3 year old for two hours at a time and keeping him constantly engaged during this time. The pool side staff, and especially the swim up bar staff, were professional yet welcoming. Couldn't get enough of their cocktails and satay's!!
Breakfast is best we've experienced, with the layout very easy to navigate.
Kids pool is a great size and depth.
Only small negative was the gym was not that well equipped. If you lift heavy weights you'll be disappointed with the maximum dumbbell size being 20kgs. But who goes to Bali to workout I guess? lol
Location is just a short stroll from Seminyak square and also double 6 beach where some quality restaurants lay.
We'll definitely be back, next time for a longer stay."
3761,OVERBEARING SECURITY RUINS THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE,10,September 2014,"We all understand the need for hotel security in Indonesia. But not like this. Intrusive, rude, on the verge of strip-searching guests. A horrible experience. Never again. The rest of the hotel is acceptable but cannot remedy the unpleasant first impression given by security."
3762,"Nice place, good location",40,September 2014,"Just newly opened, modern & clean. The room had all amenities you need, large TV and enough space inside & featured a cozy balcony. Location is very convenient in walking distance to the beach and close to Seminyak shopping area and nightlife. The food was also very good, nicely presented and also all staff that I met were friendly and courteous...
Only little con is that the rooms were not very well isolated - especially from the balcony side. Was woken up quite early by music played in public areas - nice touch during the day actually, but might be a good idea to start this after 10am (it was around 8:30, given that it is in Seminyak and people go out late & are on holiday, some might want to sleep a little longer sometimes...). Apart from that, fully enjoyed & would definitely recommend!"
3763,beautiful break,50,August 2014,"The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The breakfast buffet each morning was delicious. The hotel is beautiful and is perfectly located about 8 minutes walk to the beach. Highly recommend for couples and families. Cannot wait to return very soon with my husband and toddler, who both really enjoyed the hotel and the friendly staff :)"
3764,Just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,50,August 2014,"The Marriott hotel was amazing!! First, I check in early through the Marriott application with no problems. The application even told me when my room was ready. When I got to the hotel everyone was so nice and friendly. They called me by my name and gave me similes!! Also, they upgraded me for which was a plus and they are nice. I end up getting the suit with a King bed. Can I say nice again!!! When I waldked out on to my balcony it took me straight to the pool and a great view of the hotel!! Breakfast at the hotel was so good and you felt at home. Dinner was a great variety of food that I have miss seeing with currently living in South Korea. Massage was another part of the hotel that I really enjoyed. Prices are reasonable, great services, and I thought the Marriott did a great job with recommending travel tour guides.

I wish that I would of had more time to enjoy the beach. I definition coming back to this hotel because I was treated like a queen. Staff members new my names, friendly, and wanted to help me if needed. The hotel is in a good place with shops, clubs, and many of other food choices. I am always a Marriott fan and will continue."
3765,good new hotel,40,August 2014,"we stayed here for a few nights before moving to a private pool villa, the hotel is newly opened and provided everything we needed for the first few days of our trip. It is at the southern end of Seminyak, within a few minutes walk to the beach.
The buffet breakfast was amazing, lots of choice and options.
The staff are the best part of the hotel, so friendly and helpful"
3766,Amazing,50,August 2014,"I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak, 4 days after it opened. It ticks all the boxes for a relaxing holiday, great position, excellent facilities and the staff went out if their way to assist you with any request that you had.
I had a treatment in the Day Spa and it was unbelievable, from the staff to the ambience.
The pool staff were constantly there with ice cold water, cold face cloths and the cocktail menu, making for a very relaxing day by the pool.
Breakfast catered for all nationalities, first time I have had ice cream for breakfast for a long time, made there and tasted just like my Mum used to make, sensational. Billy (Food and Beverage Manager or Head Chef)was always chatting to the guests, which showed that he cared about his customers. This must be one of the breakfast that I have seen.
Gina at reception was extremely polite and helpful, a delight to deal with.
Brad the GM was also around, chatting to people, an easy going Aussie(Billy too) who has created a really lovely atmosphere for guests to enjoy the hotel. Clearly the staff loved their jobs.
Hats off to all the above mentioned and all the Balinese staff, who a truly beautiful people.
I hope to be back soon."
3767,New Hotel,50,September 2014,"Great location to shopping , restaurant s & Beach
Faculties are all new with 2 huge 25m pools for those that enjoy a good swim , one with bar seating in pool for those not so serious about swimming
Rooms are very nice with large TV & balcony for smokers
Breakfast buffet area is very large & of 5 star standard with food ranging from local cuisine to what I call a good Aussie breakfast it's just fantastic
Security is also of a very high standard all persons entering get scanned on entering"
3768,Marriott service in the heart of Seminyak area!,40,August 2014,"New marriott hotel, courtyard style (though personally I don't like the exterior, building structure and landscape architecture, I do like the interior and their complete facilities).

Long swimming pool, enough for you to do some serious swimming! Decent gym and spa services. Breakfast service could be better for a courtyard standard.

Tight security check at car entrance and people entrance. Good thing, very secure. Bad thing, most guests feels it is way too hassle."
3769,Great spot for much needed R&R!,50,August 2014,"The newly opened Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak provided the perfect holiday spot in Bali for me. The staff were friendly & welcoming & had an amazing knack for remembering names & were most obliging. It is a great location close to the beach, shops, bars, restaurants & ATM opposite. I felt totally secure at all times & rooms were clean & spacious. Suites provide ideal family accommodation with a Kids Club if parents want ""timeout"". I had a couple of amazing treatments at the Zanti Spa & would highly recommend this treat to anyone staying here.The buffet breakfast in Seminyak Kitchen allowed for a different choice each day & was most efficient in service & quality of food. I certainly had a great time here - thank you all!!"
3770,Excellent new hotel in Seminyak,50,August 2014,"I stayed at Courtyard Seminyak just a week after it officially opened. Despite being new, my taxi driver didn't have a hard time finding the hotel. The location is central and is a few minutes away from the beach, restaurants, shops, ATMs and foreign exchange.

Guests' security is of utmost importance so the security officers and K9 dog inspected the taxi thoroughly. All bags are also required to pass through the scanner. I noticed this is a standard in all Marriott hotels.

The cheerful staff greeted me upon check in. And since I arrived a bit earlier than the official check-in time, I had to wait a bit for the room to be ready. While waiting, Melinda (one of the front desk associates) had a chat with me, and shared some info about the hotel, and we had a brief talk about my trip.

By the way, if you're a Marriott Rewards member, you can just check-in/out through their mobile app.

My room was on the 'lower ground floor' level and has a private balcony overlooking the main pool. The room may be modest in size, but the amenities are complete.

My bed was just the right size and firmness, and looked very fresh.

There's coffee and tea making facility, a well-stocked mini bar, and the complimentary bottled water were replenished daily.

The closet, though small, has plenty of clothes hanger, bathrobes, slippers, and electronic safe.

I like the writing desk with plenty of power outlets. This is where I spent most of my time catching up with work. The complimentary WiFi was fast, and the username and password, very easy to remember. Just enter your room number and your last name. :D

The bathroom was very spacious with separate toilet and bath. It's always a plus point for me when the bath is fitted with a rainshower head. The toiletries are complete and were also replenished daily. They also provided plenty of towels.

Most of the rooms face the pool, which is divided into 3 sections. The first one by the pool bar, the main pool, and the wading pool with day beds. The last one was my favorite.

Buffet breakfast is served at Seminyak Kitchen located at the 'upper ground floor'. I like its casual and cafe feel. Indoor and al fresco dining are also available. They serve fresh salads, cold cuts, cereals, eggs, noodles, and Indonesian and Western fare among others. My favorites are the freshly baked pastries, ice cream, and fresh fruit juices. They serve ALL-DAY breakfast as well.

Since I need to check out by 5:00 am on my last day to catch my early morning flight and wouldn't make it to the buffet breakfast, the lovely staff prepared a breakfast box for me. They filled it with Danish pastries, and included 3 bottles of fruit juices as well. I thought it was really sweet and a thoughtful gesture.

Even though it's just a month since the hotel opened, everything is working well. You wouldn't get any excuse that they are still in soft opening stage. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in the Seminyak area."
3771,The perfect place for R and R....Marriott at Seminyak,50,August 2014,"It was my dream vacation.. 8 days at the newly opened Marriott. What a delight the staff were. I felt totally pampered. The staff knew us by name and could not do enough for us. I would say there has been a big emphasis on ""team building"" and what staff can do as a team to offer more to their guests. Rooms were clean. Buffet breakfast was exceptional.
Seminyak kitchen provided a menu worthy of the place.
Staff, at all levels, constantly interacted with guests and checked that our needs were being met.
Well done Brad and staff! And a very big thank you!"
3772,"New, great value hotel in a good location",40,August 2014,"I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott a couple of weeks after it opened and found the hotel to be operating well, with few teething problems.

The hotel is basically a large L shaped hotel built around a central courtyard with a huge pool.

Everything in the room was fresh and clean, the buffet breakfast was adequate, and I tried the spa which was really good and very reasonably priced.

The location of the hotel is very good, just a five minute walk to the bars and restaurants on the beach, with many shops outside the hotel door.

I‚Äôd recommend this hotel if you are looking for new facilities, a good location, great value for money, and are OK with an average-sized hotel room."
3773,Great hotel,50,August 2014,"The service and staff are great, always address us with our first names. The kids club is a great place for the little ones to spend time while we chilled for a bit. Breakfast was reasonable.

The rooms are a bit small though, although it doesn't really matter as we spent most of our time exploring Bali. The pool was great, big and never felt too full."
3774,Best place to stay in Seminyak Bali,50,August 2014,I was there for the grand opening of the hotel . The team that has been put together for this hotel is exceptional . I have stayed at many Marriott hotels thru the past 10 years and I wish they all could be as great as this one . Thank you all for such a perfect 25 days. My Family and I already rebooked for next year
3775,Exceptional hospitality-truly a great experience!,50,August 2014,"Hospitality at its exceptional best ! Truly a very memorable and enjoyable stay. Courteous and caring staff make you feel at home. Definitely , the staff goes that extra mile to make your stay so much more comfortable 'n enjoyable. Rooms are Spick 'n span and the room service is exceptionally quick. Breakfast is one of the finest you'll ever get. Special mention- Mr. Shashank for guiding us so well on the must see tourist spots in Bali. Strongly recommend the property- so near to the markets, the happening places and ofcourse the beach which is just a stone throw away

3776,"Fantastic value, faultless service - we will be back!",50,August 2014,"The hotel only opened 3 weeks ago, and my fianc√© and I have been impressed by the quality of the rooms, friendliness of the staff, great location (only a few minutes walk to the beach or by taxi to eat street), and the beautiful grounds/pool. And all at such an affordable price!

We hadn't stayed in this part of Seminyak before, but we're glad we did. A much quieter area, but not lacking in any of the comveniences of the busier areas - mini marts, money exchangers, shops, caf√©s, spas and restaurants (gado gado is at the end of the street, la plancha & cocoon within walking distance along the beach path).

What stood out:
- The fantastic breakfasts at Seminyak Kitchen (which has Jamie's Italian styling)
- The wonderful staff, never without a smile (particularly the Executive Chef who made an extra effort to chat to guests each morning)
- Lifts in the golf buggy to the beach
- Lovely bedroom & bathroom
- Size of the pool (with pool bar) & beautiful garden.

Minor improvements:
- No DVD player in bedroom
- Having to go through security scanner & bags being x-rayed every time you enter the hotel (whilst I appreciate them
taking security so seriously, it was slightly annoying)
- More equipment in the gym (i.e. leg press)"
3777,Will be back for sure...very nice hotel!!!,40,August 2014,"Just checked out from the new hotel Courtyard by Marriott in Seminyak.They just opened 23days, we totally enjoyed our stay, I am stayed here to celebrate my birthday,World class team they put birthday cake in the room with birthday card. Love it!!!
Room was great with 35sqm and room on groud floor was amazing just open your balcony and ready jump to the pool. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and family."
3778,Exceptional facilities and service!,50,August 2014,"As many have already said, I couldn't fault this place. Brand new resort and everything works! Management and staff are really out to impress and we were definitely the lucky recipients of this. We stayed 6 nights which was plenty of time for something to go wrong, and yet our entire stay was truly flawless! The hotel is as it says, courtyard style, but we never felt crowded. The hotel is centered around the massive pool, so definitely get a pool view room. Rooms are modern with a massive rain shower in the en-suite and a compact but pleasant balcony overlooking the pool with a tiered waterfall which creates a lovely ambience. Don't miss the 5 star breakfast with everything you could want and then some. The offerings were tweaked daily which was really great. Room service was exceptional too, rooms were spotless and anything we asked for was done accurately and efficiently. The beach is just a stone's throw away, as are many shops, bars and restaurants, and day spas (hmmm bliss!) A special mention to Brad, thank you so much for the champagne and fresh prawns in our room on arrival to celebrate our anniversary. They were very much appreciated and yet another example of the exceptional service that we received during our stay! I couldn't recommend more highly the Courtyard Marriott Seminyak."
3779,Amazing Stay!,50,August 2014,"I dont usually take the time to write extensive reviews, but this time i am so glad and convinced it is right thing to do.

CY Seminiyak in Bali is just an amazing property, aside from the decoration, style, luxury.. it is the STAFF that takes center stage.

Service and Freindliness is a core standard and you will see it all over this very well ran hotel.

Impeccable rooms with great ammenites .. first class Breakfast, superb quality food and delighful flavours !

Summary, this is the place to stay in Bali.. Well done to the entire staff and thank you so much for a wonderful, productive and relaxing holidays."
3780,Brand new don't hesitate - book now!,50,August 2014,"This is a brand new hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Courtyard. Thank you to the ever obliging Australian GM Brad and the entire team of professional, friendly and ever smiling staff for making us feel at home and relaxed. We requested a late checkout and never expected to have been given a room until time of departure at 8.30pm without extra charge! It‚Äôs the simple things that matter and we‚Äôll return for without doubt. We found it to be great value for money.
We were given a complimentary room upgrade on arrival with a quick and professional check-in. Breakfast is delightful with plenty tasty indonesian and western food to choose from and loved the open kitchen. There is also an egg/pancake/waffle station and a terrific variety of breads and pastries. Don‚Äôt be surprised if the Executive Chef Billy introduces himself and ensures your satisfied with your meal. He‚Äôs great to chat with as with all the waiters that have great knowledge of the local area.
The team by the pool make amazing cocktails and so relaxing to be there at happy hour with live music before heading out to dinner. Love their cute uniforms!
There is also an incredibly inviting spa and gym and the personal trainer on hand is wonderful. He‚Äôd pass us a towel, bottle of water and assist with the equipment or workout session as requested without being talkative and taking away from our workout.
Courtyard is in a convenient spot in Seminyak. Close walk to the beach, shops, cheap warungs (warung ocha is clean and terrific with nice vegetarian options) and popular restaurants such as Chez Gado Gado, Seminyak Italian and beach clubs Ku De Ta, Potato Head and Cocoon. The greatest thing here is you can really just stay put and never have to fight the traffic and leave Seminyak. The 24/7 butler service will happily arrange a free ride with the buggy to local places as well.
Things we love to do in Seminyak are always pre-book dinner at Chez Gado Gado and have an amazing dinner on the beach and watch the sunset. Yoga with Olop Arpipi on JL Drupadi (a rare find), massages and treatments at Sicilia Spa (Tini is incredible at giving a strong massage) and enjoy a great vegetarian meal at Zula.

Thanks again for a wonderful stay and look forward to seeing you next time we stay in Seminyak."
3781,New Hotel Brilliant Getting Better,50,August 2014,"We had a great weeks stay in the hotel.

The room was great, the staff were fantastic and most helpful, the breakfasts were brilliant and the pool bar was devine. Relaxing by the pool after a busy day was the highlight of our stay.

We will come back and stay again"
3782,Great new hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,August 2014,"Fantastic new hotel right in the heart of Seminyak. All staff went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was amazing. We were greeted individually by all Heads of Department and all staff addressed us by our names the entire stay, which was really nice because although this is quite a big hotel, you received extremely personalized service.
Comfortable, clean rooms, excellent food and beverage options, great pool/gym/spa. Each time we went to work out in the gym there was a personal trainer on hand to help you and excellent equipment. The Operations Manager extended our checkout time for us complimentary which made such a difference to our last day and the Concierge helped us with basically everything from hiring a car/scooter, restaurant and massage bookings, they were awesome!
Really suited for families and honeymooners. Extremely well priced for the facilities and options too!"
3783,Great new hotel but bathroom breakdown on last day,30,August 2014,"Stayed here for 2 days and had a wonderful experience. The staff were attentive and responded quickly. The room was great with pool view.

The disappointing thing was there's only one trash bin which only located in the toilet and I don't know why the bathroom was flogged, which created pool of water in the bathroom, thanks god it's our last day in we about to check out in the afternoon.

Overall it's a great hotel with superb hospitality."
3784,"Amazing Location, Staff, and Facilities",50,August 2014,"This hotel was far and away the best place I stayed in Indonesia. It is less than a five minute walk to the beach and is very close to all the great things Seminyak has to offer. The hotel is extremely clean and well managed and the staff couldn't be more genuine. They are not overly attentive to which you might feel uncomfortable, nor are they apathetic in anyway. They just seem to have the perfect balance and friendliness and professionalism. I especially got to know Ari and Gina, but everyone was awesome. The facilities were great as well, and the Buffet was excellent. It is an open kitchen which was very cool and they had a wide range of fresh food, including some great locally grown mangosteens. Overall, this place was amazing and I will definitely be staying here again."
3785,A Great Start,50,August 2014,"We stayed at this beautiful Oasis hotel for 3 nights. Far to short! This beautiful, clean, safe and comfortable hotel provided us with the most relaxed and enjoyable mini break. Brad and his team are the best hosts. Nothing was too much trouble and all of our requests were handled in the most professional and pleasing manner. The breakfast in the open kitchen was the best I've had any where in the world. The large long pool provides an opportunity for all different guest types to enjoy. I also enjoyed treatments in the beautiful day spa. The staff here provide a personalised and professional service. The prices are also competitive with spas outside of hotels!! I will definitely return to this lovely, well run, clean hotel. Thank you."
3786,Absolutely no negatives!,50,August 2014,"Look no further.......cannot fault this hotel at all, absolutely fantastic . Great location , 5 minute walk to the beach!
My husband and I stayed 4 nights at this hotel, everyone from Ngakan at the front desk, Billy the 'Aussie' chef, Anton in the restaurant, Kadek in the gym to Brad the General Manager were so accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Pool staff were friendly and came by regularly with cold water and cold towels! Breakfast was one of the best buffets we have experienced, coffee great. Rooms were well appointed , great beds and soft pillows that you just sink in to.
We cannot fault this hotel at all and we will DEFINITELY be returning."
3787,"Great location, great staff, great service!!",50,August 2014,"Stayed here for a winter getaway from Sydney. On a arrival we were greeted with a refreshing drink and icy pole. Staff were super friendly the whole time and some even remembered us by name when we came down to enjoy the extensive buffet breakfast. Received some great culinary recommendations from Brad the GM. The pool is perfect for morning laps and the fitness club is well decked out with treadmills an elliptical trainer and stationary bike, weights and other equipment. Will definitely stay here again!"
3788,Very good stay!,40,August 2014,"We loved the Couryard Seminyak! This is a brand new modern hotel with nicely appointed room, huge shower and a very nice pool. The breakfast is simply amazing...we look forward to having breakfast every morning...we love that the restaurant has both indoor and outdoor terrace seating.

The staff are always eager to help with sincerity and this is a huge plus for the hotel.

There are minor glitches here and there which is why I can't give it a five star rating yet. But bear in mind that the hotel is barely a month old so it can only get better from here.

In-room dining food quality could be improved (and we did try a lot of food from the menu).

One tip is to bring your own toiletries (shower gel, shampoo)...we are not loving the ones provided by the hotel.

Other than that we we loved our stay and will not hesitate to stay here again and recommend the hotel to our friends!"
3789,Great staff,50,August 2014,"We have been to bali many times and usually stay in a villa. We got our dates wrong and had to find somewhere to stay for 3 nights. We got a great rate and offered a upgrade at the Marriott so stayed there. The staff couldn`t do enough for us. You wouldn`t know it had been only open for a week, everything went smoothly. Really comfy beds and great breakfasts. Walking distance to the beach."
3790,Feel the love!,50,August 2014,"If you are looking for an oasis amongst the hectic streets of Seminyak look no further than the newly opened Courtyard by Marriott. This hotel offers all the amenities that you would expect from a large hotel but with a boutique feel.
24/7 room service, beautiful buffet breaky, barista coffee, Billy's ""Seminyak Kitchen"", day spa, gym, everything clean clean clean, gorgeous wind protected 3 level pool... all the good things. But for myself and my daughter it was the staff that made our 8 day stay so enjoyable.
Coming in from the hot streets you felt like you were coming home!
Location-wise this hotel is 10-15 min walk to Seminyak Square (shops and restaurants) AUD 2 in a ""Taksi"", 5 min to the beach, 2 min to numerous cheap and cheerful spas, money changer and supermarket across the road.
Thanks to Brad (Hotel Manager) and his wonderful team at C by M you made our holiday!!
Would I recommend this hotel - absolutely!
Would I stay there again - absolutely!"
3791,Great hotel but service makes it shine,50,August 2014,"The service at the hotel is simply superb. The staff all greet you. They cannot be more helpful and make your stay easy and beautiful. The Executive Chef greeted us, the front office manager upgraded our room."
3792,"Friendly, Cozy, First-class Treatment",50,August 2014,"I stayed in the hotel for one-day trip because I would like to try a new hotel. Felt in love with the hotel and will definitely come back here again with my family in the near future. Stayed in the suite room - a very nice, large and more importantly, clean room. Really worth the price due to the first-class treatment. All the staff are very friendly; they warmly welcome the guests since the first time we step onto the hotel. The GM will personally greet the guests also. Really like the excellent breakfast and the cappuccino is overwhelmingly good - a great cup of coffee to kickstart the day. Even though this is a newly built hotel, this hotel looks surprisingly quite full that day. Will definitely stay in this hotel again and I strongly recommend this hotel to you who wanna stay in the Seminyak area!"
3793,Perfect,50,August 2014,"This new hotel has it all, staff are enthusiastic and keen to please, rooms very nice, great big shower, food was first class, thanks to Gina we were able to sample breakfast which was amazing, that pepper beef was Devine,a lovely walk to the beach, felt very safe with lots of security, kids loved kids club, come out with lots of creative art work, nice do playing music whilst having happy hour martinis, how could you ask for more"
3794,"Excellent Service Staff, Management and Accommodations!",50,August 2014,"You may expect some kinks in a brand new hotel but the management have it all dialed in already like a well oiled machine. Great for kids with club and pool, plus adult playground with spa and walking to beach. Staff incredible - my kids sharing they felt more like friends we were staying with! Lots of personal touches. Lots of shopping and food choices to dine at locally - but the chef Billy and his team welcomed us to an incredible (and diverse) complementary breakfast each morning. The GM Brad was there morning til night and welcoming everyone in sight. The atmosphere felt personal and of course the actual hotel is beautiful. Another favorite part: the swim up pool bar. Oh and I can't forget the personal trainers in the gym just waiting to help make your work out count (at no charge!). Loved staying here and can not wait to book again in Bali!"
3795,There were gracious even when I was crazy,50,August 2014,"The hotel is beautiful. Especially the suite. Kitchen is what i want in my dream house. The executive chef and the young female chef by the pool is amazing.

The hotel manager had my number and put me into place as he should have. He has a lot of respect for his employees. As he wants to please his guest.

There is absolutely no reason why one would not be happy here unless there is something going on inside ones self."
3796,Very Goood Hotel with Excellent Staff,50,August 2014,"Wasn't too sure what to expect as the Marriot's I have stayed in around the world have been a little clinical.
I was really pleasantly surprised by this hotel.
The staff and the service is 1st class I couldn't fault anything. We had breakfast each morning and the staff went out of their way to remember our names. The Breakfast buffet was really good with a great selection and variety of food.
We also ate at the pool bar and the salad and panini menu was a welcome change from the standard burgers and club sandwiches.
Make sure you try the Bread and Butter Pudding!!!!
We stayed in a King 1 bedroom suite which was really well appointed with a huge bathroom and a nice living area too. an in-room DVD player would have been nice connected to one of the two big screen TV's we had.
We had a treatment at the Spa and that was great too.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation however if you are looking for a traditional Balinese experience its probably not the hotel for you."
3797,Fantastic stay in a brand new hotel,50,August 2014,"This hotel was only two nights old when we arrived for our 8 night total stay. The hotel itself is not a typical balinese type resort with bali huts etc but more of a modern type with elegant touches of balinese flavour.

We stayed in a pool access room which means you literally walk out your door and within 5 metres you're at the pool. If you want to pay the little bit extra to get this access then try and get a room on the southside where the sun hits most of the day.

Breakfast buffet was excellent with a lot of choices mainly targeted to Westerners starting with any coffee you want, many pastries, fantastic cereal, fresh and dried fruits and an Egg station - a little tip. If you talk to the chefs nicely they will make you some fresh Eggs Benedict! They also have a number of balinese dishes if that takes your fancy.

The rooms are an ok size with a very nice bathroom and in all a really nice feel. I have certainly stayed at hotels with a more luxury interior but definitely not at this price bracket.

The best thing about the hotel is the staff. All the staff from management down take the time to talk to you and ensure that your stay is going well. Brett the GM is very friendly and has a lot of local knowledge. Im not sure if this is the way they normally carry out their business or perhaps because it is such a new hotel and the occupancy rate is not yet full but I do hope that they continue there friendly manner and they will never have problems keeping this hotel full.

The location for us is perfect...a couple of minutes walk to the beach. Minutes from great shopping and spa treatments and restautrants.

Completely recommend this hotel. You will be hard pressed to find a hotel of this calibre and friendliness and location for these dollars....on top of this its a brand new so no signs of wear and tear.

Excellent stay
Glen / Sonya"
3798,Tender Love n Care,40,August 2014,"I was surprised to know that there is this hotel in Seminyak, like the one in Nusa Dua. We had a nice stay in Nusa Dua last year, hoped we would have the same one here.

And we did.

Staffs were lovely, room was clean, good layout and view, comfortable beds, flat tv, free wifi, simple shower, balcony. Good breakfast spread, good latte, view of chefs cooking. Nice pool and pool bar. Good location, easy to go places, 5 mins to beach and cafes. Quiet and peaceful.

Good value for money, we feel loved!"
3799,Great Hospitality Combined With Great Comfort,40,July 2014,"The Courtyard was an awesome place for my friends and I to stay at for a couple nights. By the end of the first day many of the staff had already remembered our names and were very engaging to talk to. The buffet was superb, as well as one of the best breakfasts we had while staying in Bali! All of the bars and nightclubs were only a couple minutes away which made the location very convenient for going out."
3800,excellent new hotel in seminyak,40,August 2014,"we stay in this hotel for 2 nights from they opening 1 aug. From the airport we use gps to find this hotel because we never stay in this area if we visit Bali. The security is quite tight from the gate , its good for the safety. they have free valet parking. everybody welcome us. The hospitality is excellent. we traveling around the world never been treated like this before. maybe because this is new hotel. hopefully the hospitallity still the same time to time. the room is ok for the size , can not accomodate extra bed, we have room wtih the access to the pool. so is nice. for sure the new hotel is very clean, unfortunatelly they don't have bath tub for my room. everything in the room is working good. Breakfast is excellent. everybody in the restaurant will greet you. To the beach just need 5 minutes walking. with this price we definitely come back to stay again."
3801,A great new hotel in Seminyak- perfect for families,50,August 2014,"I recently stayed for stayed for 2 nights ,with my husband and kids ,at this newly opened hotel -.which is set around a large pool running down the middle, from which all the rooms have a view of.
We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite room with a balcony and had an additional interconnecting room for the kids. we particularly impressed by the size of the room configuration It was a huge space perfect for families.I would recommend booking one.
The suite layout comprised of a parents bedroom then in the middle a separate lounge room with extra TV, dining table,mini fridge and balcony( overlooking the pool )and then we had the kids interconnecting bedroom. It meant we could space from the kids but still be close by.

Breakfast was in the ""Seminyak Kitchen"" an open plan show kitchen were you can see the chefs working away. I loved the menu and particularly enjoyed the fresh choices on offer and healthy breakfast choices.There were plenty of choices to suit everyone- my kids loved the pancakes.

The kids spent time in the kids club which they enjoyed , making craft and using the computers.
I spent time in the spa while they were in the kids club !! I had a massage and facial with Ika who I would recommend she was a great therapist. In fact all the hotel staff were good super friendly and helpful.
Overall a great hotel perfect for families or couples and I almost forgot its only about 250 m away from the beach with plenty of other restaurants near by."
3802,Best place we've stayed in Southeast Asia,50,August 2014,"I stayed here with two buddies of mine in early August. The rooms were large and very modern, especially considering how much less expensive it is compared to the surrounding high end places. Reading the paper every morning on my balcony was a great way to enjoy the fresh warm morning air.
The beach is a short (3-4 mins) down the road and is great for surfing or just lounging around.
And every time you return from the beach, you are greeted by some of the nicest staff I have met this far. Ari and Gina knew us by name and made it clear that if we needed anything at all, they would be there to help.
Overall great place and location and the staff is amazing. Definitely will stay here when I come back to Bali."
3803,Newly Opened Courtyard! Nice!,40,August 2014,"I choose this hotel because it was officially open on 1st August 2014.

It is also a super peak period and i could not find a decent nice hotel at reasonably good rates.

The staff are all excellent every ready to assist from bellhops, reception, pool bar & breakfast. Always nice smiling face. Getting me a metered taxi.

The breakfast is a wide selection with choices for coffee. hmm very importantly a nice cuppa of Cuppuccino is always nice to start the morning.

It is great for now since hotel is not busy. The hotel offers free wifi in room and all around a plus for people who wants to stay in touch.

The rooms are nice and cosy. The only thing they don't provide cotton buds nor cotton wool in room.

As I am still writing this, I am still staying in house till 5th August.

I am loving it!"
