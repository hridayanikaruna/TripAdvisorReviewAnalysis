0,DONT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS THIS PLACE WAS GREAT !,40,March 2023,"Firstly - this place is no where near what these reviews are making out !!

We was on the 6th floor. Our internet was perfect. Our rooms were cleaned daily and restocked with rest towels and water etc.

We was next to the construction site and man do these men work some mental ours ! We was awake by 6am and 9pm they would finish. This is unavoidable and not the fault of the hotel.

Staff were lovely and the breakfast was just great üòä

I agree this hotel is a bit of a walk from the main location of Seminyak BUT the hotel will happily call you a bluebird taxi if needed

Pool was beautiful but more beds are needed for busier periods. Spa was great we had a great massage from Dewi üòç

I have to give it we felt looked after for the whole 2 weeks we spent there",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
1,Too noisy and staff are grumpy as hell.,10,December 2022,"First room had wet sheets and overlooked the construction site - this can‚Äôt be avoided but it‚Äôs very loud! Moved rooms and the second room was also very loud from parties in other buildings. Not a good experience at all. Staff are moody, I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again. Depends if you don‚Äôt care about service or noise then it‚Äôs good for a cheapy night sleep",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
2,Not sure‚Ä¶,30,November 2022,"Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, but I certainly would not stay here again.

Room was very basic and worn. The bed was comfy however the bedsheets didn‚Äôt seem so clean, stains on the curtains and the balcony was extremely rusty with no table or chairs.

Breakfast was OK - would have liked to see more variety other than noodles everyday.

The hotel is located quite far out from the main bars/restaurants. Walkable but far, getting a taxi isn‚Äôt the best either as the traffic build up around Seminyak is ridiculous and takes double the time of walking.

Not sure if this is a 4 star worthy hotel, there‚Äôs certainly room for improvement.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
3,Tried to cheating us,20,November 2022,"Let's start with the fact that they wanted to put us in a moldy room with a stink that absolutely did not match the photos. I had to deal with this and pay extra for another better room, because we no longer wanted to move with suitcases. Cleaning comes early in the morning and wakes us up every time. For a week of stay, they did not change our linen. Dirty towels are provided in return. Messed up with breakfast, almost had to pay again. But the breakfasts bad. We were later abandoned one. In neighboring cafes, you could eat much tastier for the same amount. In general, the staff is friendly, but the initial impression spoiled everything when they wanted to deceive us into a terrible room. I would give 2/10 for this cheating greeting. But objectively 5/10. I advise you to look for something else.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
4,Decent and affordable,40,October 2022,"At first it didn‚Äôt start very well. Our room was not very clean, and the standard was not optimal. But after talking to the manager, he moved us to another room - which was bigger and clean. He was very nice and tried his best to help us. The hotel is close to the beach (and a more quiet side of the beach). The hotel was also very kind to let us store some luggage when we were away for four days.

Some things you should know as well:
The breakfast offers pretty poor options
It‚Äôs in a street were not much is happening

Good price, though!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
5,Horrible,10,September 2022,My worst stay in a hotell ever. Sound from elevator disturps your sleep. The picture in the homepage and reality is very different. No service. No working Wi-Fi in the room. Big construction next to the hotel was going on during the nights. Horrible music during the breakfast. Could take up to 1 h to get a pooltovel. We have to ask for more toiletpaper almost every day. Dont stay here!,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
6,Worst service and attitude,10,September 2022,"Stayed here for 5 days, had the worst experience, the house keeping knocked at 7 in the morning, the staff especially the receptionist was NOT friendly at all, we bought food gojek and tried to deliver it to my room bcs my ankle hurts while going down a hill earlier that day and they REFUSE to let the gojek in (keep in mind their rooms are so far back) they kept
Saying that they can only deliver the food to our room if we ordered room service (which we were suppose to) but the only have sandwich for dinner menu like wtf!? I dont wanna eat sandwich for dinner. Rang the room service and receptionist it took them 15 minutes to pickup

They are freaking liars, saying that there are only 1 person in the reception thats why they cant assist us, but when i went dowm, there are 3 of them sitting there on their phones.

Not to mention i lost a package that i delivered to the hotel. The courrier said the reception recieved it but they dont seem to have my package.. so yea, worst hotel in bali wouldnt recommend",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
7,Bad experience,10,June 2022,"The room not clean and the bed cover i think after some body stay before not changed . Their was stain and hairs

Also the breakfast was bad ,

It' different from my thought saw from the picture , the buildimg mot well maintained .. And most of the staff not friendly and well trained",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
8,Need revitalization,20,June 2022,"Room quality is the bane of the show here, horrible bedding quality, its dirty with stains all over it. The blanket doesnt even cover 2 person. The soap run out mid-shower, and the towel rack is just a touch away from falling down.

The breakfast is mediocre but its to be expected on the price range

The front desk staff isnt even greeting me when i came in, and certainly didn't say a word when i hand over my keycard back.

You guys gotta revitalize the rooms, and check your staff's quality as well.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
9,Paragon Hotel Seminyak.,40,January 2020,"Actually nice hotel with nice view at the nice place. All hotels staff are friendly. Specially Ms. Padma as Sales.
Breakfast is good, but not much variety.
The hotels need some re touch for more enjoyable.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
10,Dirty rooms - awful breakfast,10,January 2020,"This hotel had 4 stars when we searched on hotels.com this must be a joke.

Dirty rooms, stained grey out washed towels. Dirty bathrooms, lot of stains in the white walls. Some of the furnitures are really warned out. Had to ask for them to change the linen straight away cause I was bitten by something when I took a nap.

The breakfast is horrendous. If you‚Äôre from a western country you can‚Äôt find anything decent to eat (or doesn‚Äôt taste like plastic)

They play Xmas music but in an electronic version even though it‚Äôs the 2nd of Jan.

The staff are many but have a total lack of empowerment. Clearly lack of management.

All in all - don‚Äôt book this hotel and hope this review help you to find somewhere else to stay in Seminyak.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
11,Nice hotel at reasonable price.,40,November 2019,Good rooms with your own balcony. Great pool also in need of some tile replacement. Not a huge selection of healthy foods at breakfast. Area is kept tidy and clean. Staff are friendly and always keen to help.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
12,Be very cautious,10,November 2019,"Myself and my husband have just returned from a ten night stay at this hotel and to be honest I can't think of anything positive to say. The biggest word of advice we could give anyone is to be extremely wary before booking as this hotel is nothing like the pictures. Upon arriving at the hotel, we checked in as normal and were shown to our room, it was dark and dingy with an OUTDOOR bathroom. Covered with a glass ceiling and an uncovered external wall.
This of course meant lots of mould had built up around the shower area.
We decided to ask for another room and after a long conversation with the manager he agreed to move us upstairs to a room with a balcony (which we had already paid for with our travel agent) nothing was mentioned about a upgrade fee at this point so we continued our holiday as normal. However on day 8 of our holiday our room‚Äôs air con had stopped working; upon going to the reception to sort it out the member of staff there was extremely rude. He basically ignored our comments regarding the air con and started talking about payments for the room upgrade. We asked to speak to a manager (the same one who dealt with us at check in) and he pretty much denied knowing the situation. We made it very clear to the him that we knew out rights and upon hearing this he backed down. We honestly felt like they were just trying to scam us which was so disappointing. It spoilt the last 2 days of our holiday and it meant that we felt we needed to carry our documents with us at all times in case they tried anything else.
I should also mention that the drainage smell was terrible and the breakfast was pretty much a hot asian buffet so if that's not for you, it's a waste of money.
Oh and our balcony doors lock was rusty too !",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
13,Thanx for upgrade my room,40,December 2018,Located 10 minutes walk from the beach. The hotel upgrade my room to junior suite. Thanx for that. Breakfast is good enough. Nice pool for my kiddos. Modern furniture with ricefield view from my room.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
14,Dated and shabby,20,November 2019,"Stayed here for 10days on our first trip to Bali. Cannot fault the staff they were lovely ,cheerful, friendly and always willing to help. Room was basic and to be honest furniture had seen better days. Bathroom was basic and again needed refurb as even the tap in the sink was rusted. The tiles/ grout dirty in places and the bathroom blind was ragged and required replaced. Balcony had no chairs so couldnt sit out in an evening. Was a fridge and kettle in room with daily bottles of water supplied.sometomes the smell of sewage from the drains was so strong I had to hold my breathe to get past or would have wretched. The pool area was nice enough and fairly quiet, however never saw any pool treatment being carried out. Breakfast was not that good and to be honest only had twice in 10 days. Bar ran out of beer on our last night poor show. Hotel is not near anything and at least a 10 Mon walk to beach or to restaurants/bars. We lived Bali but wouldn't return to this hotel. It's only saving grace is the lovely staff",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
15,Holiday,50,November 2019,"The most helpful and lovely staff!
Videl is a amazing person also Ayu, Dewi, Setana, Purna, Widi amazing profissionais! I will come back to this place for sure and also I do strong recomend this wonderful place! I would give more stars üåü",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
16,Worst Hotel,10,October 2019,"This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The room was very shabby. We had to ask for coat hangers, glasses and extra pillows. No spoons, handtowels or chairs on the balcony and no rack to hang washing. The air conditioner dripped water.
Breakfast was substandard and the toaster didn't work.
The location is a long way from anywhere and not convenient for shopping and dining away from the hotel.
There were bus loads of rude, noisy disrespectful Chinese and Indians every day, smoking in the dining room.
Certainly nowhere near 4 stars, more comparable to a backpackers accommodation and definitely not recommended.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
17,In quite area,30,September 2019,"I actually won 5 nights accomodation at the Pragon Seminyak upon arriving I asked to have my room upgraded as I had already read thing on trip advisor so we upgraded to the junior suite lucky we did as the other room was small the most of the staff here can be very nice but some don‚Äôt know how to smile or communicate with you in a friendly manner so I found this difficult to the ones that were great with there interaction with me I say job well done to the ones that couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt want to understand take some training courses learn how to treat customers a bit more nicer even a smile sometimes would have improved my experience.The pool was my highlight, breakfast was just not great at all the coffee was bad I ended up going to the local 7 eleven and buying coffee $1.oo aud a cup it had the grounds in a bag inside and sugar all sealed you just add hot water and wait for the coffee ground to settle taste fine better than the breakfast dripper cofeee or the instant ones in the room would I stay here again maybe but not if I keep reading the same reviews",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
18,Good service and nice staff,50,September 2019,"Very comfy stay and friendly staff as always, been here two times for business trip, delicious breakfast buffet with local and western delicacies, shower was hot and water pressure stong(very important to me as I love hot showers)",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
19,Absolutely disgusting. Do Not Stay Here,10,September 2019,"The first night we stayed here was absolutely disgusting and then our friends arrived the next day and that was worse for them. First time in Bali and they have been turned off coming again. But never mind that our next part of our stayst the same place but different room was just as bad.

Staff giggling behind our backs and not completing task at hand. Rooms, well where do I start. Cleaning staff need to be shown what health and hygiene is.

Mold on tiles in the shower, on floors and black mold (which is bad for your health incase you don‚Äôt know) on all curtains.
In a nutshell disgusting will never stay here again. How did they get a four star rating.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
20,Horrible Horrible Horrible,10,September 2019,"The Paragon hotel in Bali was disturbingly bad (photo‚Äôs attached) what doesn‚Äôt show in the photo‚Äôs is the stench of raw sewage which was every where at the Paragon, nor does it show that 3 out of the 5 days that we were there our room was not made up until well into the afternoon 4.30pm, when we asked for the room to be made they ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to leave towels, the security deadlock on the door was broken and useless for the purpose intended for,

Now to the photo‚Äôs; Faeces on the toilet roll holder, Mold all over the curtains and blinds, Dirty towels left for our use, dirty bedding,",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
21,Don‚Äôt stay here!,10,September 2019,"I have traveled quite a bit and this is by far the worst place I have ever stayed. I do not have enough room to write all that was wrong so I will list it.
The mircrowave wouldn‚Äôt work
Mould in the shower, along the walls in our room, on the bathroom curtains, along the shower door handle, on the shower head, and more
Our shower flooded every time we used it, flooding the entire bathroom
We had to request for towels EVERY DAY. They would take our dirty towels that we had hanging up but would not replace them.
The bath plug would not work
The hair dryer did not work
The SMELLS OH GOD THE SMELLS! The water in our shower was horrific, the smell of sewerage filled our bathroom as soon as we turned the shower on, the smell of the corridor from the rooms to the reception was horrendous. We had to hold our breath walking through every time. I actually gagged the first time walking through.
The driveway was just stupid. It was basically paved with chunks of cement slopped down on top to make the most uneven, unpractical driveway ever.
The breakfast was horrible, they offered their local cuisine which okay yeah but if you‚Äôre going to offer chicken sausages, at least make them look like sausages. The two types of cereal that they offered were both stale. The milk that was left in a jar infront of the stale cereal was warm. They did not offer lunch or dinner service but you were able to pay and order something to your room that turned up almost cold in cling wrap. We spent our mornings down the road at an amazing bakery/cafe called Livingston‚Äôs! I would highly recommend them!
The staff hardly understood us most of the time, they spoke minimal broken English. There was one man who I didn‚Äôt catch his name that was by far the best at speaking English and he was lovely in trying his best to help us!

In conclusion, do, not, stay, here!!! Do not be sucked in by the low price because it is not even worth $30 a night!!!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
22,Birthday Dinnerüíòüíò,50,August 2019,"Start from searching all the accomodation in seminyak looking for a special candle light dinner, well i choose Paragoon hotel.

23,3 country holiday,20,July 2019,We stayed here for last part of our 3 centre holiday first views were looked really nice as went to our room real stench sewage rooms basic took 40 mins for kettle boil bathroom had glass window in which wasn't very nice if needed sit on toilet booked half board only thing on menu was chicken my husband does not eat chicken so first night no food 2nd night got him some ribs chicken ranged from drum stick to 2 wings that it with tiny pot rice so ended up eating out all time staff were really friendly had keep reminding them clean room never used pool as all smell was sewage,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
24,great service,40,June 2019,"The room was very affordable, I stayed for 4 days and 3 nights with my mom and cousin. The customer service was also great, the people are friendly, except the fact that it was so crowded with group of tourist, well it was summer season and tourist was just everywhere.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
25,Great Service,40,June 2019,"I stay with my relatives with one kid.
They can resolve problems quite fast.
We arrived late at night, got a room that was not as requested. My relative‚Äôs family booked and payed for King Size Bed but got Twin Bed instead. They cant use the 2 small beds because there was three of them. The small beds were to small for 2 adults and 1 child.
After 30-45 minutes of discussing things, the front office gave them an upgrade with King size bed, without any additional payment. They admitted the fault and everyone is happy.
Thank you Paragon Seminyak
We will definitely stayed here again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
26,Pathetic,10,June 2019,Pathetic staff non cooperative pathetic food And service lacks basics like nail trimmer adaptors etc no good food staff was highly non cooperative non bothered for guests comfort .service hits low standards here with food menu also only localised ..why will locals get into hotels ..food for thought,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
27,great,50,May 2019,"Fab hotel staff very helpful and polite, room very spacious and spotless i did not have to ask but when they had seen my wife in a wheelchair they put us in the room by the lift which was helpful, another bonus the staff always helped us to get a cab, then helped us with the chair but out of the hotel it was not disabled friendly so that made it difficult for us..",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
28,Not quite like the pictures,20,May 2019,"Nice friendly staff, very helpful. Breakfast was interesting- would be nice to see more variety other than noodles. Perhaps more fruit, without flies. The pictures make this place look immaculate however in person it isn‚Äôt quite the same. A bit tired. Also there was a sewage smell the entire time we spent there. We did have a lovely time however spending time in the hotel facilities was not as enjoyable. If you want a basic hotel then this is the one.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
29,Terrific stay,50,February 2019,Excellent friendly staff good clean rooms food was reasonably priced and delicious. My only moan is the fact that there where only 8 sun beds but apart from that we will be going back to stay. Well located,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
30,Nice Hotel,30,April 2019,"I stayed here for 3 nights. The room spacious, clean, tidy and have balcony. The staffs are friendly. Wifi ok. Breakfast ok. The pool is perfect, it has a shallow part for kids. So no need to worry if you have children staying at this hotel. The down point is there is an unpleasant smell in the area near the lobby around the fountain.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
31,More than just a hotel,50,March 2019,"I can‚Äôt speak highly enough about this place. Beautiful room, great buffet breakfast, great facilities and amazing staff. The pool, the spa services and the restaurant were all great. Clean rooms with great amenities. Initially we were just meant to stay here one night before our accommodation at another place was ready. Our flight returning to Australia was cancelled and rescheduled for 2 days later. We were so impressed with that first night at the start of our trip that we would book back in the Paragon for the 2 nights while we waited for our rescheduled return flight. On the night before we were meant to fly I fell and fractured my arm meaning I was in hospital for 3 days. We extended our stay so my partner had somewhere to stay. It makes me emotional writing this because upon finding out from my partner what had happened to me the amazing staff went above and beyond in not just looking after me but they were also all praying from me. Upon my return to the Paragon while waiting until I was fit to fly the took such care and they made this awful, scary situation seem so much better. On the first night of our stay I met Videl who checked us in. He was amazing from the start and the Paragon are very lucky to have him. He was the reason we came back there when our flight was cancelled because he was so wonderful in looking after us that first night. I hold a very special place in my heart for Videl and upon my return from hospital he made sure I was looked after. He became a part of my family and he is the reason I will make sure next time we are in Bali we will be back to stay at the Paragon. The management need to make sure they hold onto him and he deserves a pay rise. Yes the hotel is lovely but what makes it truly special are the staff who really go above and beyond to make your stay special. Even when guests are rude and are ungrateful the staff still try so hard to make sure guests are happy. For me I felt like I gained a family. Videl is my brother now. My partner and I feel blessed for how we were taken care of in such a difficult time and we will be back there as soon as we can. If you read this and you go and visit the Paragon please treat the staff well and tell them Miss Samantha says ‚Äòhi‚Äù.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
32,Continues to please,40,April 2019,"This is my 4 th stay at the hotel and it still maintains its high standard.

For. A hotel that caters to tour groups from chin sit handles the push and rush of mornings very well, as the tourists leave during the day the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.

Facilities are good and rooms very clean and well appointed being cleaned daily. Staff are very pleasant and overall make for a great stay

The standard of the hotel at the price make this a stand out place to stay",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
33,Nyepi escape 2019,30,March 2019,"Well, the check in was hassled due the lack marketing coordination, but solved.
The staff are friendly.
Room is clean, AC works very well.
The hot water didn't work most of the time, trying to have hot baths was a useless attempt.
Becoz it was nyepi, the breakfast was absolute chaos. Had to stand up for hours at egg station.

It's not a new hotel, and nyepi is celebrated every year.
Wondering why the management haven't solved this situation yet üôÑ

By the way, the room service menu is very very yummy food menu with reasonable price for its class, I could see myself coming to the restaurant on daily basis, even though the drinks a bit overpriced",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
34,Brilliant Hotel,50,March 2019,This was our first visit to Bali and we found the Hotel to be perfect. The staff were all very friendly the rooms were cleaned everyday along with clean towels and bedding.. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel was kept very clean. We had breakfast every morning which had lots of choice. I would definitely recommend the Hotel as we enjoyed a great stay there and would stay there again should we return to Bali in the near future. Beautiful place. Thank you to all the very pleasant staff. Room 2505,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
35,Can‚Äôt fault this place,50,March 2019,"This was my first visit to bali and stayed at the Paragon the entire week. Service was impeccable from the room attendance, maintenance and general hotel staff. Room was always clean staff always greeted us with a beautiful manners and my massage was bliss. Location was great lots of places to discover daily would highly recommend as it was great value for money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
36,Silence Day,10,March 2019,"We chose this hotel because it's near my work place. We bought it from Traveloka without the package. Traveloka cost around rp 1.000.000 for 3 days and 2 nights stay. And if we were to take the package it will cost rp 1.600.000 ish.
I was sceptical at first, people on Traveloka says that it's hard to get towel at this hotel. I didn't get to experience that. Our room was lovely, it was on the 5th floor facing the rice paddy field and away from the pool. Which was great, don't get the pool area, if you are sensitive to noises.
We loved the exterior and the interior. So far there was no problem with our stay. The first night I wanted to order food service of ""Banana Split"" and ""French Fries"", but when I called the staff said they didn't have the stock for it. I mean why don't they stock the ingredients before Silence Day? It gotten worst on the second night we stayed there. We were about to buy the buffet for dinner which cost rp 175.000 / person. When we went to the restaurant there was barely any food left, and not too many choices. We asked the staff if we could order room service, he said that we can after the buffet ended. We went back to our room, waited after 6.30 which was the time buffet ended, but we decided to call at 7pm to give them some times to prepare. When I called one of the staff said that we had to wait till 8pm cuz the kitchen had only couple of staffs. So we decided to call back around 8.15pm. Only to be told that the restaurant already closed. I was furious of how they treated their guests. I heard them talking on the back, I told them that I was told to call back at 8pm. Then they told me that they only have ""Mie Goreng"" left, and I asked them if I could order ""Carbonara"" and Choco Milkshake. They told me that I can, but I have to wait around 30mins. Around 20mins had passed, and they told me that they didn't have the Carbonara. I was so upset, and I just order 1 Mie Goreng for my bf, and Choco Milkshake for myself. The food came at 9.15pm. And you know what? I was so shook when they handed me the what so called ""Choco Milkshake"" it was so watery. It was just like a normal chocolate milk. I paid rp 50.000++ for chocolate milk? Which was so ridiculous!
Felt like it was a total scam!
So if you guys wanna stay here without ordering food, I would say it's good. But for food service and staff service.. Don't even think about this place at all. Find other places. We were glad that we didn't book for the package. That would be a waste of our money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
37,Robber..,10,February 2019,"I was in this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights. Everything was going good until the last day. When we were supposed to checkout, one guy from thr hotel staff came to us and said ""sir, you have to pay additional 200,000 IDR (around 14.5USD) because their are some pink stinks on the towels. But, the truth is we didn't use those towels. And the time when we were leaving the room, we checked everything, nothing was there. We didn't had pink cloths, neither colored hairs nor tattoos. Hotel staff was lying with us including hotel manager. Another point to note why they come on the last moment why not on other days.. they are cheaters.
I had to give them a money because i had a flight to catch. Neither they gave me receipt for the money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
38,Peaceful but near enough to everything,50,February 2019,"This is my fourth or fifth time staying at Paragon. The rooms are huge, beds are comfortable and the service of all the staff is always friendly and excellent whether at the front desk, housekeeping, restaurant, even the maintenance staff always have a friendly smile. All the staff will do their best to help you any way they can.

The pool is perfect for cooling off after a day at the beach or walking around Seminyak and surrounds.

The location is great - just a short moto ride to the beach and the other way to Seminyak cafes and shopping. It's best if you ride a motorbike as it's not right in the main downtown area of Seminyak. The hotel has motorbikes available for rent. If you don't ride, Grab or GoJek will get you where you need to go cheaply and easily. Taxis are readily available.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
39,Beautiful Hotel,50,January 2019,"Stayed here for the last 8 nights, great hotel with the staff being so friendly and great with kids. The cleaning standard was very high and the buffet breakfasts each morning were delicious. We will be backüòÄ",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
40,Great stay again,50,January 2019,Paragon Hotel is great value for money with good facilities and helpful and happy staff. I stay here every year and haven‚Äôt been disappointed yet. Special mention to Ani on her continuing great service and assistance.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
41,Thanks Annie (front receptionist),50,January 2019,Thanks Annie for making our holiday best and thanks for your help to us . Annie help us what ever we need very helpful and all the hotel crew help us so much even when my mum needs a hospital she‚Äôs the one who call the ambulance thanks so much guys for all the help.. very kind Person and all polite üòçüòäüëç,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
42,Very bad service,10,December 2018,"During our 4 days stay in this hotel, we have to beg for towels everyday. They dont give us our towels.

Waited 1 hour or more for just a towel and took few phone calls and visit to the reception.

Service at this hotel is very poor",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
43,Decent Hotel in seminyak area,30,June 2018,"Paragon Hotel Seminyak is quiet new hotel, located in seminyak area. Since the hotel is quiet new, so the hotel is still clean. there is a spa centre and fitness centre, and a semi-outdoor restaurant.
The service is a bit rigid for Hotel business and less helpful. The price is affordable in seminyak area. There is a room to improve for the food quality.
Over all, this is a decent place to stay in seminyak area.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
44,Almost ideal,40,November 2018,"Our evening arrival in Bali was a bit stressful. Only 2 of our 3 suitcases arrived from Singapore and white we were reporting this our arranged pick up gave up and left us to arrange our own transport to Paragon Hotel. So we were encouraged by the efficient friendly welcome given by the reception staff. Throughout our 7 day stay all the staff we encountered were delightful and eager to help.
We were not impressed with our room but too tired and frazzled to act on that that night although we did mention that we would like to speak about it the following day. After many years of traveling and hotels, this was the first time we wanted to criticise a room. The problems were:
2 hangers only in a very small wardrobe. No storage such as drawers although the room was spacious.
No hand towels
Very dilapidated bathroom blind
The room had a balcony but no furniture to sit and enjoy the view
Anyway the next day we were transferred into a much better room and felt much better.
The public areas of the hotel are beautiful- especially the pool area.
Breakfast was pretty good and provided Eastern and Western food. The overwhelming majority of guests are from East Asia. The young serving staff worked flat out to make everything run smoothly and there was an egg station where fried eggs or omelettes were made to order.
Batu Belig is a fair old walk from Seminyak Square and the nearest beach. However taxis are everywhere and very reasonable. There are plentiful places to get food, from mini markets to street sellers, Warungs and my favourite restaurant - Sardine.
A few improvements would make the Paragon even better.
Furniture on the balcony
Drawers to put foldable clothes
A shuttle to the beach or to town ( small fee would be acceptable)
Just to sum up - the staff are typical of Balinese people and Indonesians- gracious, welcoming, polite and love to talk.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
45,Very clean hotel!,40,November 2018,"Me and friends stayed here in May 2018, we changed room due to first one being a bit small - this was no problem at all. Our suite was absolutely lovely and cleaned spotlessly daily! The staff were really really lovely. I didn‚Äôt rate the food here but that wasn‚Äôt a problem cause there was a lovely restaurant opposite the hotel we had breakfast in most mornings! Great location - would definitely stay again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
46,Good as always,40,November 2018,"Stayed here again and does not disappoint rooms are of god sized and well appointed
TV reception poor and wifi still needs to improve
Staff are all very pleasant and breakfast is of good quality large pool for use but not many lounges and small gym to use
However overall very good property and I will return",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
47,A very nice and comfortable hotel,40,September 2018,"I have been a regular for this hotel, it is a very comfortable place to stay. The room size is very well, cleanliness inside the room is excellent, however the bathroom have a sign of mold. Staffs are very nice, but I have to mention that when you entered the hotel at late night, you will see several staffs at front playing with personal device(not sure if hotel employee policy allow it).But most of that time you will not be greeted.
Other than that, I highly recommending this hotel if you are looking for a comfort for your stay.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
48,Not for us,30,August 2018,"The rooms are comfortable and very clean however the things that let us down were the lack of a shuttle to Seminyak square, the overpriced meal we had one night only because of the price. A Bintanga alone was 5,000rp +tax +tax. The ribs were very nice but only about 4 mouthfuls of meat. Overall a bintang, a smirnoff two bowls of soup and ribs and onion rings cost us 453,750rp. Quite a walk for us to the beach but the warungs there were worth the trip.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
49,one of the best weeks we have enjoyed in seminyak.,40,August 2018,friendly staff..modern.clean rooms.breakfast was delish.love the pool.lots of nice restaurants close by..and 5 min walk to the beach.plus 2 markets close by in seminyak square.we would definitely stay at this hotel again.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
50,GREAT HOTEL!,50,August 2018,"As soon as we arrived at Paragon Hotel Seminyak, we were warmly greeted by all hotel staff. We were also updated to a nicer room overlooking the swimming pool at no extra charge. The rooms themselves are spacious and clean, with the cleaners coming in everyday cleaning the room and changing the towels. The swimming pool is clean, of a nice size and surrounded by lovely foliage so sunbathing and swimming is so relaxing. The food and drinks at the hotel are very reasonably priced. The hotel is also in a good location not to far from the beach as well as a wide range of restaurants and bars. Most of all, the staff make you feel so welcome and at home, always asking if you need anything and always around if any questions need answering. Overall a lovely stay in Bali!! Thank you very much to the staff of Paragon Hotel! :)",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
51,Oh!,20,August 2018,"We enjoy our stay here. Buuuutt when We asked for 2 omelettes, until we finish having our breakfast no omelette come! Till we see foreign ask, HE gave it directly. How come. You guys have to see the detail. Maybe just maybe your staff don‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúget a line‚Äù is. Thanks :)",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
52,Average stay,20,August 2018,"It is an OK place to stay for the value - and that alone. Breakfast lines are horrendous with minimal variety of food (and nil western food which is rare for my third trip to Bali) and not enough seats. We stayed for three days and each day there was an absolutely horrific smell when you walked to the pool, in the same spot. We are fairly regular to Bali and understand their 'smells' but this was something else. It physically made us feel unwell.

We paid AUD $47 per night which really is cheap, but not enough for us to stay here again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
53,Extremely average,20,June 2018,"We booked this place for one night based on mainly positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Upon arrival, check-in was fairly easy and the staff friendly; however we quickly noticed that every single member of staff was wearing a 'trainee' badge.

After being checked in, we nearly tripped over several times on the horribly uneven (borderline dangerous!) stone pavement of the main pathway as we followed a staff member to our room.

The room itself was basic but usable - water leaked badly from under the shower door and onto the bathroom floor, but aside from that the room was fine.

EVERYWHERE in the hotel was LOUD! Whether you were in your room or trying to relax by the pool, there was no escape from large, loud groups. There was a ""bar"" located next to the swimming pool, which only seemed to stock 3 bottles of Smirnoff Ice and a couple of cans of Coke.

The breakfast was really just something to eat, but nothing more.

All-in-all, if you're looking for a place to sleep in North Seminyak for a night and the location is convenient for you (although the Paragon isn't really near much) then this place is okay. However, if you're after a relaxing getaway, this is not the place for you. I found the Paragon basic, LOUD and not somewhere I wanted to spend much time. If you do stay here, I wouldn't bother with the breakfast - there are so many better places to eat in Seminyak.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
54,average,40,April 2018,"the hotel room is big, but i have an issue eith the air cond, but the staff quickly fix it, the pool is awesome big and comfort, the breakfast not much choices, the taste is so average, near restaurant and bar, not far from beach",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
55,FILTHY AT ITS FINEST!!!!!,10,April 2018,"I will try to make this short and to the point. I read reviews and base my decision on what the complaints of the reviews are because I understand that some people are more particular. I personally like safe and clean and the rest is just a bonus. Check-in was for 3pm, I showed up around 7:20pm and surprisingly no rooms were clean so I had to wait. They ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù me to a suite and brought me a welcome drink. When I got in the room it was beyond disgusting still. Hair in shower, dust in corners, tub nasty and spots on the curtains. Seeing how dirty this place was I dumped the drink. Service was very basic. I would not recommend this hotel even for 1 night which is all I stayed. Thankfully! I didn‚Äôt take photos, but I posted a video on YouTube showing how dirty the room was.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
56,"Good place, good price",50,March 2018,Big clean room. Large Windows with some kind of a view. Very big swimming pool. Fantastic staff always wearing a smile. Near batu belig beach. New hotel so things are still fresh. Comfy beds. Breakfast is ok but not the best for westerners and they pack it up to early .,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
57,Great Hotel - Rooms Large & Service Exceptional,50,February 2018,"I stayed at Paragon Hotel for 6 nights in February. My room smelled due to damp coming in from glass cracked in bathroom. Next morning I was given a room that was superb. Although not a large selection the breakfast was excellent. The staff were always friendly & smiling & often checked on me to see if I needed anything else. The main gym equipment was broken but fixed in under 24 hours after pointing out the problem. The pool was larger than what it looked on line and was clean & warm. It is not in the main part of Seminyak of close to the beach but I was 100% happy with the hotel, the restaurant & the way I was treated by the fantastic staff and management. Great Value for Money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
58,Just enjoy our stay!,40,January 2018,"We just checked out from this hotel and stayed for 3 nights. The room is clean and the bed is comfy. We love the ricefield view from our balcony. During our stay, we experienced the buffet and ala carte breakfast..but we love buffet the most as we can choose what we want and take an efficient time. The breakfast is good. The location is good, many restaurant near by that you can reach by walk.The down point is, unfriendly staff especially the girls in front office who were seems not really attractive to serve the guest. Anyway, we still enjoy our stay there.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
59,Great Value!,40,November 2017,"Decided to join last min, for a friend's birthday and this was the hotel next to the villa they had gotten and to my surprise, it was lovely!

Free upgrade because the room wasn't ready (not that I was complaining). 4 pillows on a king size bed! My partner and I didn't have to fight for them.

However, only down side was that our bathroom came with an outdoor shower which could have been cleaner. The standing shower was literally next to the little garden area (that had no grass, but all soil) and there were cigarette butts strewn everywhere, so it wasn't too pleasant for us; especially when bath areas should be kept clean.

It'd be great if the front desk could inform us if we wanted an indoor or outdoor shower. We didn't make a huge deal because it was an free upgrade and we were there only for 2 nights.

Request for rooms not on the ground floor, if they're giving you rooms near the pool. It can get quite noisy especially for the live band and music that's played through the speakers early in the morning.

Otherwise, hotel is great! Clean, staff are friendly and service was impeccable. The welcome drink was really good too!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
60,Hidden gem with great value,50,November 2017,"Staying here was such a pleasant surprise, i had a very nice deal for two days.
Room was clean, spacey, big balcony facing a rice field next door.
Despite facing the street, it was very quiet and I was able to sleep well.
Location is in great area, only minutes away from main restaurants/cafes (by car).
Definitely worth the money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
61,Great hotel,40,January 2017,"The rooms are large, and very well cleaned. Breakfast was good and there was a lot to choose from. Location is good however we really did not enjoy Seminyak -not the hotels fault though. Pool was nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only letdown was the massage we had at the hotel. It was not professional (after a full body mask the masseuse asked if I want to go into shower in my own room or in the massage room. Like would I actually walk through the hotel covered in chocolate from head to toe?) and very expensive for what it was.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
62,"Fabulous staff, and overwhelming clean room with fantastic breakfast fit for a KING!",50,October 2017,"Love Paragon, Lovely Staff - ALWAYS wanting to help, very clean place and large rooms! Amazing breakfast too. Great great great staff!

I have already recommend to my friends and family.
Affordable price, with amazing service.

I will becoming back here 100%",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
63,Hard to Fault,40,September 2017,"This is my 3rd stay here and it really is hard to fault
Staff are super friendly
Rooms are large considering the cost and are well furnished and maintained
Breakfast is a large selection buffet and again hard to fault
Pool is large and always clean
Overall this property is hard to fault and sets the benchmark for other properties in this price range.
Hotel does cater for Chinese tour groups, but this works well as they leave for the day after breakfast and return late so you have the hotel to yourselves.
Wi fi can be a little patchy but I do know this is being addressed.
I will be staying again and as the title says it is hard to fault",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
64,Great,50,June 2017,"Amazing staff, great location. Cleanest room we had out of 7 hotels in Bali!
Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Great breakfast. Lovely pool. Recommended as it's a short walk from the busy noisy area which is great onion the daytime but lovely to get away from at night!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
65,Way out of the way,20,June 2017,"The first clue that this was not going to be great was that I had a hard time getting the hotel to book transfers from the airport - they sent emails to a previous guest and repeatedly lost my flight details. I arrived in the middle of the night and was quite disturbed to find that the staff speak very little English. I soon discovered that the hotel caters mostly to travellers from other parts of Asia, which is fine, but it did not make me feel welcome or a valued guest. I did not eat the breakfast but the coffee was terrible. Staff do not change the linen or towels in the room and the level of care taken with things like laundry is very low. It is also very much out of the way, and although some guests may get a 'sea view' the beach is not accessible within walking distance. The pool does not close, so if you do end up booking, don't expect a decent rest, as it is quite noisy. Taxi drivers do not like to drive from this location into the main tourist areas and I was refused service more than once. This is fine in the day time but it is not safe to walk at night. I did not like spending any time at this hotel and would have moved not another hotel if I had not paid in advance. I also became unwell during my stay and could not get the help I needed due to staff not speaking English.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
66,Not Good Enough,30,May 2017,"When i was checked in into this hotel, there's work construction beside this hotel, so this is really terrible.

The food standard, the staff good, and i think they have a great swimming pool

PS : Please service the elevator.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
67,Poor hotel,20,April 2017,"Rooms were okay, but that's about it. Terrible food. We had two burgers first evening. We asked for something else, but half of the menu card wasn't available. The burger was really poor made, and the hospitality that we normal meet in Bali didn't exist. Hungry and exited we go next morning for the breakfast. The buffet was only Asian/Middle East buffet. So disappointed:-(

There were no hand towels in the room, apparently that doesn't come with all rooms???? And no handsoap either, so we had to use our own. When we came the sheets were stained and very poor washed, so we asked to get it changed.

Not coming again :-(",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
68,Tranquil new hotel in Seminyak,50,February 2017,"The hotel is located in Batu Belig street of Seminyak. My partner and I have stayed at the Premium Pool Access room. The room is spacious and has private access to the hotel's swimming pool. Seems like this room type is very limited so need to request way in advance. We enjoyed lounging at the pool very much. For those who prefers quiet area within Seminyak, this hotel will be recommended. For Aussies, the hotel always have special promotion on Bintang which is a bonus. If you have your own scooter will be great to ride around the hustle bustle Seminyak. Easy access to the beach and plenty of dining option around the area. The hotel is pretty much new, some areas and quality of service could be better with some improvements. Special thanks to Mr. Ateng Aditya, the hotel's General Manager who has welcomed us upon arrival. Thank you for the enjoyable stay.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
69,"Not fantastic, but not bad",30,February 2017,"It's 15min to the beach or 15min to the Centre of Seminyak - for me a bit too far, therefore not a single room could offer sea view. Breakfast not worth it. Service was good, the restaurant is an all day dining location but in the evening not a single guest as there is only one menu, the same as 24h room service menu in the room, that was disappointing. No nice bar to have an aperitif or anything.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
70,nice hotel,40,February 2017,"new hotel, i like the swimming pool view to ricefield and facilities is good. i think i will get room and having a bath tube, but i didnt and not much problem..
i like to live here. soon i will be back if my workshop is around seminyak.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
71,good place for relaxing,50,February 2017,"I stayed 1 night only but first impression hotel is cozy and warm with open lobby and restaurant area, room is clean and big with nice view from balcony. Unfortunately weather was not good, windy and raining.Thank you to hotel staff who really helpful and friendly. Next visit to Bali i will stay here longer not one night.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
72,very good,40,February 2017,"More vegetarian variety in breakfast.

for honeymooners uall can provide some complimentary flowers in the room and the bath tub (decoration)

Day trips if uall can also provide it will be great.

a map , navigator.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
73,recomended for leisure,40,January 2017,"new hotel, clean, good interior, swiming pool quite nice, breakfast satisfied, but the front office staff need more warmer and smile more to visitor, quite but close to famous clubs, resto and bars, recomended",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
74,Potential but a long way to go,20,January 2017,"We came to this hotel because it was offered as a bargain price (thank goodness) and the reviews were quite good on TripAdvisor which has me perplexed as usually the reviews are spot on. Let me start by saying the staff are very sweet and try to be helpful but what holds them back significantly is their generally poor English skills. We had a free 15 minute massage - spa was only open once the whole week we were there and she could fit us in she said - too busy!!
Breakfast - ordinary, tea and coffee was dreadful. We had a free dinner that we left untouched - it was the only disgusting meal we had on the island. Rooms were clean, beds very comfortable, to great and rooom very cool. Housekeeping very sweet but not very good. Never remembered to replace hand towels. Did not replace soap and had to contacted to provide toilet paper (did not replace)!

I feel the reponsibilty of this mediocre hotel lies solely on the shoulders of the owner - poor resourcing, cutting corners and poor staff training. Lots of much better hotels to choose from - don't bother with this one unless there is a huge effort to improve.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
75,"‚ÄúNice place, Nice Service, and Very Friendly Staff!‚Äù",50,January 2017,"We stayed for 14 days and The room was comfortable and clean,
Breakfast was generous. Staff was helpful and friendly.
Overall a great stay.
Will recommend to friends and families and will definitely be back again!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
76,Comfortable and Silent,40,January 2017,"The hotel is really comfortable, but the location actually it's a bit far from the restaurant and the other attraction around Seminyak. The room is always clean and the bed also really comfortable. We couldn't be connected to the wifi but the hotel gave us some modem, we really appreciate that, but unfortunately the modem also didn't work. But overall we like the hotel",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
77,Average..,30,January 2017,"I will give 6 from 9.
Not really big hotel.
Mostly like budget hotel.
Small pool, and small poolside..
Price too high for this type of hotel.
Good location, 5minutes drive to the beach..
But.. Too many trash on the beach.. üòî",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
78,Close to amenities very clean,40,December 2016,"Great place close to many restaurants. Staff helpful, rooms clean, pool a great place to cool down. Would stay again for short stay. restaurant food great had a great lunch after checking in. Pathways quite hard to walk on.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
79,Awesome Hotel for Bali Vacation,50,December 2016,"Stayed at Paragon for Christmas holidays with our baby boy, wonderful hotel with spacious & clean rooms, staff were brilliant, friendly and attentive.
Even though hotel was fully occupied, breakfast was delicious with lots of choices and were always replenished. Room service was also on point. Pool and gym was great, lots of room for everyone.
The hotel provided baby cot & baby bathtub free of charge which was very thoughtful and helped us a lot.
Location was superb as it was very close to the main shopping & dining area of Seminyak (Kudeta, Potato Head, Seminyak Square, Seminyak Village, Ultimo, etc) but without the noise, traffic & crowd, so we were all able to get a good rest. And also extremely close to the Batu Belig Beach. Thank you Paragon for an amazing holiday! Will definitely stay here when visiting Bali again!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
80,great value,40,January 2017,"very nice, staff responsive, laundry service super expensive though! last day it rained and water came right in the room though. no hot water, but warm enough for shower. i would recommend. a little north of main seminyak, but taxis readily available",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
81,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,50,December 2016,"Best breakfast i've ever taste, beautiful hotel overall, chic room, strategic location, lage swimming pool, good service, fast check in and check out, good hospitality. we love it and i'll come back to this hotel. thanks",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
82,Excellent BUT ....,50,November 2016,"We loved staying at the Paragon but one thing to be aware of is that once you have used up your 600,000IDR deposit be careful what is charged to your room. We paid cash or handed the MasterCard over for every single lot of drinks we had & presumed we had paid for everything. On check out we were handed a bill for over 1,000,000.00 IDR, you can imagine my shock .. after 5 minutes of debate they then knocked off the 600,000IDR deposit but we still didn't think we had anything to pay for as we were led to believe that we had paid for everything along the way. In the end I paid as I didn't want to miss our flight and the manager promised to e.mail me once he had looked into it... I am still waiting ! The communication could have been better but on the whole we had a fantastic time.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
83,Value for money,40,December 2016,"Worth your money, all facilities is there...location is quiet, just the way we like it..just rent a scooter to get around in seminyak and canggu area. About 10 min rides everywhere..definately recommended",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
84,A cozy hotel,40,November 2016,"Location is good, close to Seminyak, where all restaurants, boutiques, clubs and other interesting places. Room was clean, friendly staff and good food. The rate also affordable. Very recommended hotel",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
85,Nice place for your holiday,40,November 2016,"Good place for you and your family to stay. My son and daughter really love this place. Beside it is cozy and have beautiful view, nice swimming pool, it has also many delicious foods that you can choose and eat on breakfast.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
86,Has Usain Bolt stayed here,40,November 2016,"This hotel is described as being 2 minutes from a pristine beach and the heart of the shopping, Usain Bolt would have difficulty making the beach in 2 minutes and when you do eventually get there it is hardly pristine. As far as being anywhere near the main shopping area, it is if you take a taxi. However that said the hotel is very good for the prices that they charge. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, the pool area is nice and there is a modern gym. The self service breakfasts are very good and set you up for the day. As long as you arrive not expecting all the amenities to be on your doorstep and are prepared to take a taxi or have a long walk I'd recommend that you book. The taxis to Legian/Kuta are only about ¬£4 so it's hardly worth walking. If you do walk you are literally putting your lives at risk, the pavements when they are there and not 4 foot deep holes are used to park motorcycles, cars, or pile any sort of building material on, meaning that you have to walk in the road with the danger of being run over by one of the taxis who are more intent on blowing their horns at you to try and get your custom rather than avoiding you. Don't let me put you off the hotel is good and a great price.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
87,Nice stay in Bali Paragon Hotels,40,November 2016,"Locations : Great. Near from Seminyak Area (the happening places in Bali)

89,week stay,30,March 2016,"it was a little out the way, but if you like the quite then its for you, no taxi drivers knew it by the name only the street, breakfast was limited but thats because we went during a festival, it was good for a cheap price, nothing fancy.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak

93,Short stay at Paragon,40,November 2016,"It is a very nice hotel with extremely friendly personell. The Bad thing is that you don't her extra pool towels and in your room you only get one towel per person. The hotel is not directly at the beach, it took us two minutes with the scooter to Drive.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
94,"Nice big room, cosy and friendly staff!",50,October 2016,"Enjoy my stay at Paragon Ayola Seminyak for 2 nights. Definitely will come back again. Worth paid with big room, cosy, pleasant stay here! Friendly staff, hotel nearby food stall, surrounding with pub, club and disco for night entertainment. Visitor can rent a motorbike from hotel so that can mingle around Seminyak town with affordable price offered.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
95,room service,30,October 2016,"the guest who order F&B from room service should not be charge directly, just need to sign in the bill, the guest will pay, not escape, why should be worry about that??
For the bathroom, should provide movable shower not fix shower, its difficult for kids want to take a shower, for toilet bowl also provide jet shower.
thx for attention",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
96,Perfect hotel & great value for money,50,September 2016,"Located still in the city centre, but outside of the middle of the city, which is busy with lots of traffic. Very modern and new-looking hotel. Rooms are not very spacious, but that was no issue to us. They are clean and luxurious, with an amazing rain shower, and a small balcony. Breakfast includes many options, and both Indonesian as well as Continental. Motorbikes can be rented from out the hotel, and are there upon arrival (when booked before arrival). Staff is very friendly and helpful. When you arrive at the lobby, you feel like you arrive in a five-star resort. Welcome drink is offered and staff is dressed Indonesian-style. Swimming pool is amazing too!!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
97,nice place behind traffic route,40,October 2016,"Nice and comfort place. Loving the design, especially lobby, i can feel bali in here. Too bad needs lot of effort to get here, since traffic everywhere. But i still recomend this place since it was very cheap.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
98,Very clean and comfortable,40,September 2016,"Our plane arrived in the early hours of the morning. The taxi company wasn't quite sure where the hotel was from the airport but a screen grab of the location sufficed. We definitely got ripped off for a taxi paying 250000 rupiah to the hotel. We realised after that using a bluebird taxi on a meter is incredibly cheap. The hotel checked us in swiftly and were welcoming. The room was modern spacious and very clean. The air con worked really well, so well in fact we turned it off during the night. There were no bug problems and no sound issues. The hotel is quite a long walk from seminyak centre but taxis are cheap so not a problem jus make sure you try and get a bluebird taxi. There are other companies that look extremely similiar but there are things to look for on the taxi to distinguish bluebird. Everything was fine while we stayed. We didn't eat at the hotel. On check out we asked the reception to book us a taxi to uluwatu with bluebird which they did and arrived on time. (The taxi to uluwatu took an hour and cost 140000 which puts the 20 minute airport taxi in perspective)

Overall the hotel was very good and extremely good value would stay again",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
99,Good service,50,September 2016,As always it was a pleasure to stay at paragon! Very good service and good staff. Although we had a problem with the wifi at first the staff was very accommodating and made sure our stay was ok even if it was a short trip,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
100,BLOWN AWAY BY GENEROSITY,50,August 2016,"Ive been to bali serval times and all trips were wonderful expect for this time i had some unfortunate luck, bags card money phone were stolen, (before i arrived here at paragon) so when i did arrive i really was unsure how i was going to eat survive and me comfortable, i can honestly say the staff blew me away with there generosity, the hotel helped me in anyway possible untill i could get some cash. this honestly happends no where! the rooms are clean and have everything you need, the pool is lovely, and the location is great if you are a keen scooter rider and want the benefits off both canguu and seminyak. i would honestly come back just to give the manger a big hug. thankyou lena walsh xxxxxx",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
101,great place for the money,40,September 2016,"Located a bit more quite side of Seminyak but easy to get around with bike (available to rent) or taxi. Breakfast was great, room comfy and had good wifi. The staff was very friendly. Gym and pool were good size for activities.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
102,Totally recommended,50,September 2016,"We like the room so much. We thought the room would be small but we actually got spacy room with comfy bed, and the balcony which is very helpful for smoker. The room is clean. Too bad i didnt try the breakfast. Totally worth the price!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
103,Definitely come back,50,August 2016,"Stayed at this hotel over the weekend. The hotel was close to La Laguna and Finns Club, which is really good (avoiding the Seminyak traffic).
The room was spacious and breakfast was nice with lots of variety of hot food and cold buffet. The pool is nice and the people here are friendly. The only thing is they only give 1 key per room (there were 2 in each room we were staying) but it's not a big deal. This hotel is recommended and will definitely come back next time.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
104,Good stay.,30,September 2016,"Very modern hotel, clean, spacious and good quality. The room was great, flat screen TV, tea and coffee maker & fridge. Really modern bathroom. The room was cleaned every day, fresh bedding and towels and complimentary water. The breakfast area was very spacious and nice to eat at. Only downfall was that most of the breakfast was served to more of the Chinese tourists such as noodles, rice etc. However there was still a little selection for basic breakfast such as toast, croissants, selection of cereal, juices & tea/ coffee. On an evening they hosted a buffet which you paid extra for all you can eat with a beer included each. Wasn't a massive selection and would prefer have eaten out somewhere for the price. The pool is really big, and had a shallower part for children. Pool was clean and had a few sun lounges with a bar near the pool. The hotel also has a gym which you can use (treadmill, bike) nothing too great. When we arrived at the hotel they give you a voucher for a free 10 minute massage for each person. The location is pretty OK, strawberry fields cafe is across the road 2 minute walk. We rented a moped during our stay and it takes about 5 minutes to get to the beach or nearby cafes/ shops. Massive downfall of the hotel was that the WIFI was shocking! They might as well not have had any, barely worked at all, and when you are travelling and dependant on Wifi connection this was a massive pain as we had to keep going to local cafes if we needed to use wifi.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
105,No more than a 2star backpackers hotel,10,August 2016,"The staff are very friendly, but not good at English.
The room we had only 2 pillows, (you have to request more), 3 plastic coat hangers, no drawers, stained and dirty pillows, quilt cover, stain coffee cups, VERY badly stained chairs.
You only get one key.
The breakfast is ok if you like all Asian Luke warm food, there is an egg station which is ok, and you can have toast with jam/marmalade if you can get into them.
The pool is very hard to get into and out, very deep steps with nothing to hold on to, no umbrellas for shade.
The cobblestones leading up to the hotel and rooms are very hard to walk on, and the road/footpath outside is totally dangerous.
This hotel is at least 20 minutes from beach, and is not on Seminyak square. You do need to get taxis most every where unless you are very fit.
Food at the restaurant was not good, but restaurant across the road is not bad as is the pizzas on the corner.
We booked out after a few nights (we were booked for a week), last straw a backpacker throwing up outside our door (this is no fault of the hotel).
But the staff are always smiling. üòÄ

As for BALI GETAWAY, üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé will never book anything through you again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
106,Great Value,40,August 2016,"We stayed dor 7 nights and found the staff exceptionally friendly and very welcoming. My only really fault was the location as we needed to get a driver each time we went out and dealing with the traffic was time consuming.
Our room was clean and a good size and again just a little point the towel were changed regularly and the bath mat was change in the time we were there but in saying this I was very happy with the room itself.

Breakfast and the meals were very good.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
107,Its recomended place in bali,40,August 2016,I went to bali with my family. And stay@paragon ayola hotel. Its not expensive but good place. Room and toilet are clean. Kindly and helpfull staff. I got transport airport to hotel roundtrip.good breakfast. Its recomended hotel when u come to bali.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
108,"Nice place, nice service, great staff!",50,July 2016,"We stayed here for 2 nights. We were very tired from a long flight from Saigon. But the hotel made us relaxed then. As we entered the hotel, the staff served us with orange juice and this really helped us. This is not much but it show how professional your service is. I really appreciate that.

The room we booked is standard but the facilities was very nice! No complaint! You did really good job!

Staff: friendly, nice and helpful. Especially the receptionists and restaurant manager.

Location: it takes about 30mins from the airport. Sometimes get traffic jam at rush hour. But this doesn't a matter cause the hotel is near the airport. Near the beach, a lot of convenient stores and restaurants around.

Service: hire motobikes from the hotel. 70.000rph/pax!

Everyone who travels to Seminyak should stay here!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
109,Splendid !!! Amazing !!! Relaxing !!!,50,August 2016,Coming to this hotel was the best choice we ever did. From check in to check out just a wow !!! Me and my wife stayed for atleast 24 days non stop in this splendid yet relaxing hotel. They even managed to get us a bike to rent and vrooomm we can go anywere. Food is good. Pool is clean.

110,Exceed My expectations,50,April 2016,"NIce warm and welcoming place.

Spent my nights there with my gf and it was just a superb experience. the price was good for the kind of stay. Booked through agoda and they always have the best offers. They should have more offers for people who always come back to stay there like me. It will be our 3rd time coming back to the hotel this september",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
111,Quality-price is perfect,40,August 2016,"We stayed here one Night and we really liked the room as it was big, confortable and clean, the only thing is that bath gel was not fully refilled. Bed was good, quiet location, quite a bit far from everything but if you hire a driver is not a problem. Breakfast is good, enough choices and clean and safe food.
Value for price in our opinion!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
112,Family friendly hotel,50,July 2016,We stayed for 7 nights with our 2 young kids in adjoining rooms. Beds were comfortable! Tea & coffee making in the room. They top up everyday as well as water bottles. Pool was nice! Breakfast was generous. Staff was helpful and friendly. Good value for money.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
113,4D3N,30,August 2016,"Friendly and helpful staff, definitely worth the value but I would find that location is quite far without a driver. Cleanliness would be average as the towels weren't very clean but other than that, the room is great. Towels were changed once we placed a phone call.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
114,Worth the money!,50,August 2016,"During my two week break in Jogjakarta, I planned a last minute trip for three days to Bali, with my family. Got to Bali in the morning and spent the day visiting local attractions. We did not book a hotel in advance and it got to 5pm, so we decided to book this hotel via 'Booking.com' due to its reoccurring good reviews. We mentioned we would be arriving in an hour.

We got to the hotel and we were greeted by concierge. Once we got to reception, we were welcomed with an ice tea, which was a nice touch. As the booking was last minute, check-in did take slightly over half an hour as they couldn't place the reservation, but that's completely understandable.

We were given rooms 2202 and 2203 (which were the last rooms left) - if you would like a room with a nice view from the balcony, I suggest you book in advance, as you can see, we didn't have the best view as it didn't overlook much and was only on the 2nd floor. The room itself was a decent size, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size.

As for the inclusive breakfast, incredible. There was a lot to choose from; from traditional Indonesian dishes, to fresh fruits, to various pastries. I wasn't expecting the breakfast to be different every morning, but it was! You are also able to request other dishes to the chefs who cook out-front (I believe at an extra cost).

When in Indonesia, I always stay with my family, so this was the first time staying at a hotel and I was thoroughly pleased. Overall, very pleasant staff. Despite the fact that the hotel is very modern, they were still able to capture Balinese culture through small details. It's also very central, which is always a plus. I will definitely be back!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
115,Beautiful Hotel but terrible service,20,July 2016,Service was extremely bad. Refused to give us cots for free although they messed up the booking. Got locked out of room and it took 3 calls and then for us to walk to reception to get someone to let us in.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
116,Nice stay in Semyniak,50,July 2016,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is new, the room is very modern, clean, spacious. It's close to every crucial suppliers that a traveller needs: Circle K, sim card store, gas station, dining places and the beach (Batubelig beach-sunset here is amazing). They also provide bike rental service inside the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had a bit trouble feaguring out how to turn the hot water on, the staff showed up very quickly to take care of it. In the morning when we were waiting for our bike ready to go around, the Restaurant Manager proactively approached us to say hello and gave us recommendation about the local attractions and some tips to avoid trouble in Bali. Honestly we didn't expect that level of service in such a budget hotel.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
117,Value for money with good service,40,July 2016,"We had 3D2N staying here, located at Batu belig street, near petitenget, 10 to 15 minutes walk to Batu Belig beach. Chck in doesn't take so long, room is clean and the pool is spacious. Good and worth for money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
118,Nice stay,40,July 2016,"Very good experience overall with friendly staff and nice facilities.
One of the highest hotel nearby which provides a better view if high floor. Good location and surrounded by many good places to eat.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
119,Good Bali hotel,40,July 2016,The hotel staff is very friendly. Any request we made to the staff was followed very promptly. Therooms are spacious and clean. The breakfast is sumptuous. Chef also cooked us a delicious vegetarian dinner on request. I would recommend this hotel.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
120,Great Hotel!!! :),50,June 2016,"The hotel is excellent, the rooms and beds are very comfortables... and the staff so friendly always willing to help!!! The pool and views are amazing!!! Just 15 min walking to the beach and surrounder by good restaurants as well... 100% Recommendable!!!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
121,Good Hotel Good Value,40,May 2016,"I stayed at the hotel over weekend with a family and booked at the suite with pool access. The room was spacious and clean and you could jump straight away to the pool from your balcony, which was pretty good, as it was only few people in the pool - we felt like we had an entire pool to ourselves.

Breakfast was a bit busy on saturday morning, we had a hard time finding a seat for a bit but wasn't a big deal. The food was decent, and the staff were  extremely friendly. We were introduced to the GM, which was very friendly and gave us few pointers on what to do/what's happening around. The only thing they could do better is with the wifi, it kept on dropping off every once in a while, which was a bit painful.

Overall, it's a good hotel and totally reccomended.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
122,Nice hotel.,40,May 2016,"The room is clean. I stayed for three nights at deluxe room. Not many people stayed here, so it is a nice and not noisy place. The staff of this hotel are friendly. The price was okay. Not many food varieties for breakfast but it was okay. We enjoyed our stay.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
123,"Took poolside booking but NO pool, miles from Seminyak - more like Jimbaran",10,May 2016,"We booked a poolside room and when we arrived late evening, the pool was out of commission. Said we could swim in the hotel 'down the road' pool and they'd take us when we wanted to go!! This hotel knew their pool was out of order, but didn't tell us before we arrived. Finally agreed to send us to another of their 'sister' hotels, said we had to pay more as they were 'better' .. we didn't, but had paid for a poolside room which we didn't get. Told us if we didn't agree to one of their other hotels, we would have to arrange our own transport and accommodation.Went to Ramada Encore, what a con. Miles and miles from anywhere, no poolside room, shuttel half hour from Seminyak and another half hour to Kuta. You want the story on that hotel, see our review. Between the two hotels, it was a nightmare. We ended up booking out and paying to stay at Amadea Resort in Seminyak - that place is absolutely beautiful.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
124,"Good value for money, but beware",40,May 2016,"Price was okay for the given location although the street outside the hotel suffers from many traffic jam.

The walk to Batu Belig beach is about 700m or 15-20 minutes. Many amenities provided and the hotel staff is very accommodative towards our request daily. They also allowed us to have a late check out at 3pm on our last day.

The cons is that the hotel will ask you if you need a driver to the airport and it will cost 200,000 rupiah, when I told them I can get it for 80,000 rupiah, they counter offered with 130,000rupiah. This made me feel they were not so honest after all.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
125,Nice hotel,40,May 2016,"We're booking for 2 days and we got upgraded to junior suite. Awesome.
The room is clean and big. But we can't control the air conditioner, it's so cold :)

Menu of breakfast for us is nothing special :)

For us, it's worth it to take a rest in this hotel",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
126,Satisfied customer!,50,April 2016,"I stayed at this hotel over the weekend with my family. We booked at the Junior Suite on the ground floor which somehow opened up to the pool immediately!
The room was very spacious and the bed was super comfortable, which was really good! The hotel is very close to Mozaic Beach Club, where you could go and relax for a drink (if you mentioned you are from the hotel, you get a discount), and not too far from all the restaurants in Seminyak (also less traffic!).
Breakfast was good, staff were very friendly and attentive, limited variety of food however for the price we were paying, it was really good. Then we managed to play in the pool a bit (we just jumped from our ‚Äòbalcony‚Äô), which was really nice!
Perhaps should consider music playing in the pool area!
Overall we had a really good time staying in the hotel and will definitely come back again!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
127,Excellent value!,40,April 2016,"I stayed for a couple of nights at this hotel, really liked the size of the room. The restaurant was quite good and the staff extremely helpful! The pool looked nice even if I didn't have the chance to try it (next time!). Location was great to go around in Seminyak, and they can drop you off there if you ask nicely! Would definitely recommend, hard to get better for this kind of price!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
128,Great hotel at an affordable rate,40,March 2016,"Pros:
- Brand new hotel and lovely restaurant/lobby area
- Helpful, friendly staff
- Balcony on every room
- Spacious, clean rooms with fridge, kettle, rain shower, desk, good lighting, and tv with variety of western channels
- Big pool with hardly anyone using it
- Welcome drink and snack were a nice touch
- Provide big, fluffy pool towels that we brought to the beach as well
- D'Nini restaurant across the street is awesome and affordable
- Laundry at the hotel is pricey but if you turn left on the main road when leaving the hotel there's a great laundry facility 2 mins walking on your left
- Tons of restaurants, convenience stores and shops close by

Cons:
- Breakfast isn't free as advertised and is 60,000 ($6 Canadian) per person if you choose to purchase. Considering how cheap the room is and how cheaply you can eat in Indonesia this is kind of pricey for what you get. Lots of variety (hot and cold food) but wasn't great.
- Rooms are very clean but common spaces could be cleaner. Hotel isn't busy and there are tons of staff, so little things like mopping spills on the stairs and picking up room service dishes that are sitting outside of rooms all day would bring the atmosphere up a notch.
- Gym equipment is terrible! The elliptical is broken and the cable weight machine is so flimsy it was shaking and rattling while my partner was using it. The gym is a great space by the pool with two air conditioners, a bathroom and windows all around. Could definitely fit more equipment like free weights and a second treadmill, and the equipment all around needs a major upgrade.
- 10 minute walk from the beach, and then another 10 minutes walking on the beach to find cleaner sand, safe swimming areas and lots of beach beds around all the big resorts. We don't mind the exercise but if you want to walk out of your door straight on to the beach this isn't your place.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
129,VALUE FOR MONEY,50,March 2016,"Could not fault this place...remembering we weren't paying a fortune for it! The resort is quite new...maybe 2 years old...the rooms are spotless and the staff are just so friendly and accommodating, we loved our stay here last year and again this year for three weeks. Spending Nyepi here was so good..the hotel catered for their hotel guests beautifully....breakfast every morning, on Nyepi we had lunch and dinner catered for...what more could you want! Since our last visit the management has been taken over by Topohotels...they seem to be doing a great job trying to get it running just that bit more efficiently. We will definitely be back!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
130,Home away from home,40,January 2016,"First time i visited Paragon, there are not many staff and guest due to they just opened. I booked more than 60 rooms, for my brother wedding. At first i am a bit dissapointed since the sales handled my reservation suddenly resign from the hotel, got me worried and a bit problem with my guest room allocation.

But when i arrived there, and everything is taking care of, i know that there were some things that they struggle, but they try to fix everything and they do really listen what their guest want & need.

I feel right at home directly with the hotel & the staff. All the reception were very helpfull. Pak Kun, who really turn upside down to make our stay there memorable.

The room were really comfy, the bed & the aircon was really refreshing with the hot weather in Bali. Their Junior suite were spacious, and i recomended their premier room with added bathroom.

The food was nice but need a little variations.

Nonetheless, i cant wait to coming back there again of i come to Bali.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
131,Perfect Hotel & Genial Staffs & Impeccable Service,50,December 2015,"Nice new hotel. Great amenities, easy access in quiet neighborhood of Seminyak. Great ambience, Amazing pool. Awesome breakfast and room service. friendly and helpful staffs. Overall a great stay. Will recommend to friends and families and will definitely be back again!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
132,Quiet place on a busy neighbourhood,30,November 2015,"Room is clean with interesting bathroom style (glass & curtain separate between bedroom and bathroom). This hotel is in Seminyak, where lot of restaurants, cafes, and bars are located. So for the location is very strategic, it's a little bit out from the seminyak's ""strip"" but that's why I like it. Because it's quiet at night and we could rest.

This hotel has pool and gym (not that big but enough). There are some rooms in front of the pool, next time I visit Bali, i probably will get the room in front of the pool.

We didn't get breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on that, but it's a nice open dining hall area.

People are nice there, friendly and very patient. Services are very good too.
In summary, if you want to stay in Seminyak area, and you will do a lot of outdoor activities, I recommend this hotel, the price is reasonable, and since you only need to rest at night why book 5 stars/diamonds hotel in Seminyak - my two cetns.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
133,Perfect for Bali,40,November 2015,"New Hotel in the quieter part of Seminyak, in Batu Belig Road. Walking distance to beach and famous Sardines restaurant, amazing Grass Grain Restaurant, Watercress, Hog Restaurant. Stayed in one of the four suites by the pool. Very quiet and lovely to step outside your own door and slip straight into the pool. Air conditioning in this hotel is amazing. Food is great at this hotel and very cheap. It is a lovely atmosphere and highly recommend. Hotel has a lovely rice paddy next door which offers relief to busy Bali. Also interesting upmarket area for Bali, with interesting upmarket Villas and Rice Paddies, Beach etc. Far enough away from Potato Head etc. but only $1.50 ride to Seminyak New Village Square. Having spent two weeks in Bali and one in an upmarket Villa, would suggest this is excellent value for $. Has a great view of the sea and in fact 360 degree view of Bali from top balcony, which certainly gives one a perspective of Bali. Staff great, and Chrisna a wonderful asset to the Hotel. The Pool is very large enabling one to do laps, and pleasantly decorated with shade from the Frangipani and Lemon Grass. They have their own vehicle to assist you. Security man on gate as per normal.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
134,great value for money,50,November 2015,"Spacious rooms, friendly staff, quite area, but not far away from the shops and nice restaurants. Whatever we were asking, everything has been arranged. Perfect price/quality ratio. We recommend the hotel for those who are on budget,,but like to ve at the clean well maintained place with the friendly atmosphere.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
135,Relatively new hotel with modern amenities,40,December 2014,"We stayed here in December 2014. The hotel is very big with a lot many rooms but was barely occupied then so we almost had the place to ourself.
Rooms are not very big but are trendy with elegant decor, modern amenities & clean. It has an indoor pool and a gym facility that are both well kept. The staff was very courteous. Overall, a good value for money.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
136,Nice room but the place is too quiet,30,October 2015,"We stay here just for one night. The room is good but the hotel place is too far from crowded and the place is so quiet like no one else stay here.. the cleaness at the room is ok until we found a hair in the sink.. the pool is big but seems no maintenance because the water is unclear and never be changed.. the breakfast was so so but the portion is big.. there's also no pedestrian path if u wanna take a walk in the street around hotel area, so careful about the car at the street especially at the night..",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
137,Good hotel and great staffs,40,August 2015,"Staying here 3 nights for wedding event, so far the staffs was really helpful. I can say i am happy staying here, nice breakfast also, not too pricey for the hotel. Not trying the pool or the gym so cannot review any of that. happy to be back one day.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
138,Great budget hotel,40,August 2015,"Though budget hotel, the rooms and resort is very clean. Staff are very helpful though language is a small barrier. Good pool and junior suites have partial ocean views close to naughty nuries ribs restaurant and slippery stone Greek restaurant. 5 minutes drive to batu belig beach.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
139,Honeymoon,10,August 2015,"We were travelling to Bali just married, accompanied by my divorced parents.
This actually beautiful hotel disappointed at nearly all levels.
The honeymoon suite (of which we did not know) was given to my dad - he thought the actually beautiful decoration was like that in every room.
After changing the rooms, the disappointment began. No chance to fill the bathtub in under two hours because of only drops of water coming out. Hairs in it, defintely not from us. Housekeeping forgetting dirty cleaning cloths in the room, not cleaning the floor, ashtray still full, coffee portions not topped up, etc. etc.
Everyday lots of noisy mannerless chinese groups in the breakfast room without chance to evade. The nice pool with dirty water, staff entering the room without knocking, etc. etc.
The staff was always smiling and being friendly but not a single one seemed competent nor professional. Communication between departments did not seem to exist. We could not see any manager or responsible person for our entire stay. When we complained, the people listened and that's it. No sorry or any action.
Very very poor soft skills for a hotel from which you could make a lot out of it's good infrastructure.
Another negative point was that the hotel is far from everything and that the connecting road does not have a pedestrian pathway.
At least there were every day two bottles of water topped up and the breakfast servers were always very friendly.
What a pity, not recommended at all!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
140,Good short stay,40,August 2015,We stayed here for 2 nights and we did enjoy the stay. Nice clean hotel. Theres a small gym and pool. Breakfast is satisfactory for a small hotel with a fresh on the spot cook for eggs. But theres 1 thing I didnt like was the rigged stones they used for the pathway..its hard to walk in my opinion. Overall I will come back to this hotel.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
141,"Lovely Hotel, Great Value for Money",50,August 2015,"My girlfriend and I just came back from a week at the Paragon and we can't wait to go back again. The hotel itself is nicely decorated and kept very clean, the staff are very friendly and polite and check in was fast and easy. The room was in great condition and clean with a nice comfy bed; it also had a window between the room and the bathroom in case that's something you require. There is a blind you can roll down if it doesn't suit you of course. The breakfast buffet is of very good quality with a good selection and if the hotel is particularly quiet you get to choose from the a la carte menu. There's a lovely pool which I found was kept very clean apart from the odd flower or leaf dropping in it and some nice sunbeds around it. The gym is quite basic but has everything you need for a good workout, just be careful if you're a large sized caucasian such as myself as the cardio machines can get a bit wobbly. The charges for meals, room service and minibar are all very reasonable so you don't have to run down to the minimart for a beer or can of coke as in other hotels. All of the staff from the cleaners to the waiters/waitresses and receptionists are very friendly and polite, they make the hotel a very nice place to stay. We've been to Bali a few times now and this is definitely the best place we've stayed, if you book your holiday here you will definitely not regret it. One tip is if you use a taxi then make sure it's a Blue Bird Taxi, some of the others don't use a meter and will try to change you a $5 minimum for a $2 journey.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
142,Nice Staff and good value for money,40,August 2015,"This hotel have a good staff, nice and right on welcoming guess. Great bed and shower. Rice fields view when open the window room are very enchanting. Every room have balcony I guess, but they need to clean the balcony very well. If you checking in make sure they clean the balcony properly.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
143,"New hotel, Good value for money",30,July 2015,"Stay for 2 nights for a nearby company event. Good value for money, clean, friendly staff. It is a new hotel less than a year in operations, so far everything is good. The junior suite is spacious. Bathroom is basic but clean. Not luxurious but all basic amenities are provided. Hotel location is in Batu Belig, off the main road. Will need taxi to go to main road or popular destinations. Closest mini market about 15mins walk.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
144,Good spot for a holiday,50,December 2014,"I stayed at the Paragon Suites & Resort for a weekend getaway with some girlfriends and had a great stay. Even though the Christmas weather in Bali was not very conducive, our stay at the Paragon was very nice. The property which is very new is well situated between the very busy Seminyak and the quiet Canggu. 15 minutes to Echo Beach and not even 10 minutes to Seminyak Square, it was quite the ideal resting sport after a long day out and about.

I particularly appreciate the double pillows on the bed which enabled for a good night sleep. The linen was of high-thread count and the AC was nice and cold without giving me sinuses or sneezes. The property which has a limited number of rooms felt very exclusive. I particularly noticed how very localized the staffs are which was refreshing. I had some chats with some of them whom shared with me what life as a Balinese is all about.

I felt almost sorry when it was time to leave. Had I known, I would've booked my entire trip in Bali with a stay at the Paragon, I'd definitely come back and stay there in again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
145,Great stay and very affordable,50,December 2014,"Stayed at this new hotel for two weeks! They gave us a very good price with a great room. The room had good space aNd the beds were very comfortable. The staffs were very friendly and helpful with anything you need. The breakfast was good, I enjoyed the soup the most especially when bali has cold windy weather, the soup warms you up in the morning. The facilitities were awesome too, I had the chance to exercise everyday in the gym and also the pool. I would definitely come back here. First choice in seminyak",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
146,Awesome and great service,50,September 2014,"It was good stay at the Paragon Suites and Resorts, the location is very good, the rooms are new and modern; and great deals for The Good Hotel.

Overall we were very happy with our stay and would stay again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
147,Awesome,50,January 2015,Great hotel 4-5 star fantastic service and very friendly happy staff will definitely stay again really good amenities at an great price close to everything on a motor bike and I would recommend to people flying solo or with the family.

148,"Welcoming, affordable and great service",40,December 2014,"Rooms were clean, affordable and had good room service. Hotel staff and management were lovely and helpful. Huge variety at breakfast. Not too close to everything but hotel staff were happy to assist with finding you a cab.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
149,"Horrible management, 1 star service",10,December 2014,"Stayed here based on some of the reviews from trip advisor and booking.com and unfortunately had the worst experience.

When we arrived, check in was slow (as was check out) and we were taken to the wrong room with 2 single beds. Took them 20 minutes to sort that out and despite our request for a pool view, as the hotel was not very busy at all it was not even addressed as to why we couldn't have that.

We settle into our next room anyways overlooking a pile of rocks, some dirt and dead grass and there was no wifi in the room. Called reception to tell them the wifi wasn't working, after a minute of explaining it was clear there was a language barrier so I went back down to the front desk searching for the one guy who spoke English. I let him know of the problem and again asked to be relocated. He said they would fix it or move us and call the room to let us know. Never received a call, after an hour, we decided to go out anyways. When we returned we finally had 1 or 2 bars but it was very frustrating as it would drop out every 5 or 10 minutes forcing us to reconnect and login again. Even doing this it sometimes would still not connect. This was consistent throughout the hotel in the lobby and common areas as well and continued throughout our stay.

We wanted to goto Kuta the next day and asked reception to call us a bluebird taxi, as the location was very poor and there were no walkways at all on the very busy streets outside the hotel. We waited for over half an hour, finally one of the staff came by to tell us they were unable to arrange a bluebird taxi for us. Pretty pathetic that a supposed 4 star hotel can't even get its guests a taxi. No apology or effort made on his behalf to remedy the situation, we were forced to trek down the street 20 minutes to a more central area dodging through cars on the busy street, very unsafe.

The last day of our stay I again asked the manager to arrange a taxi to take us to the airport. He replied incredulously, 'oh we can't guarantee we can get you a taxi'. Then proceeded to try and sell us on their exorbitant airport transportation for 300,000. I was absolutely shocked at the incompetence of the management team not only to provide basic services but to have basic human and customer interaction skills as well. I ended up going online myself, emailed bluebird, received an email back shortly after asking me to confirm the name and room number, which I did, and our bluebird taxi awaited us 15 minutes early ready to take us to the airport. We paid less than a third of the rate the hotel quoted us. Laziness, incompetence, or a mix of both I'm not sure, but certainly not what one would expect from a place that claims to have excellent service. This is what I would expect from a hustler on the street.

A few other memorable notes were the lights randomly shutting off in our room. Called reception again, very unfriendly, no apology, eventually sent someone up to reset the breaker. Also we asked for a drying rack for our clothes, after explaining to 5 people one of them finally understood and claimed there was one on the balcony. Which there wasn't, just a single rusty towel rack that was half fallen out of the wall.

The room itself was fairly clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was not too bad but subpar for the price, we received a raw egg in an egg cup when we asked the kitchen for a boiled egg. Housekeeping were smiling and friendly and the girl doing the eggs at breakfast was really nice too. Unfortunately the management and rest of the staff were completely unhelpful, rarely getting out a smile and if they did force one out it was in giving an insincere apology saying there is nothing they can do to remedy the situation. There was lots they could do they just refused, as is inline with their complete lack of service.

Would definitely never return here and strongly suggest you find accommodation elsewhere. Been in Bali for the last month and stayed at 2 stars to 5 stars. Among all of them the Paragon had by far and away the worst service and management. Such a shame, as we voiced our disappointments a number of times and they just didn't care. Doesn't really make you feel like a valued customer.

Poor location, unhelpful staff, nonexistent service, mediocre breakfast, decent room, expensive for what you get. If you don't speak Balinese I wish you luck, you may be able to wait 15 minutes to talk to the one guy who speaks English but even if you do he is completely useless so it is to no avail.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
150,Nice but location isn't the best,40,December 2014,The hotel is very clean and new with distinct western style. The location is just okay...you'll have to take taxis everywhere because Batu belig road is dangerous to walk on especially at night. Not a big deal but when there's traffic it can be a bit annoying. We had issues with the room lock not working multiple times but the owners/managers handled it extremely well. The owners were very helpful and I really appreciated their hospitality.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
151,"excellent hospitality, food and very affordable",50,December 2014,"the facilities are great, loving the gym and very cool swimming pool great to relax on a hot day. the rooms are excellent, very clean, gets cold straight after you turn on the ac, the beds are really comfy and the rooms have great view of the streets of bali. the staffs are very welcoming and friendly, always there to assist you and they provide free shuttle service so no need to walk far away or use taxi. location is great as well, not far from beachwalk or seminyak square also surrounded by a lot of restaurants and close to the beaches.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
152,Great value for money,40,November 2014,"We booked a premier room however got upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic. Excellent sized room. Cleanliness was generally fine. We were given a stained floormat for the shower however I didn't care. It was for our feet anyway. The towels were not stained at all. Bed was comfy and clean. A little bit of mould built up in the shower but no big deal. Staff are very attentive and friendly, always greeting you and smiling as you walk past. WiFi is free but kept dropping out. Had to constantly reconnect. Breakfast was also included. Not the biggest choice but was more than adequate for us. We aren't fussy. Best massage ever.

Definitely recommend the tropical treatment. Works out to be about $27AUD pp for a two hour package. So cheap!! It is an external company that comes to the hotel and the massage is performed in a designated treatment room.

Hotel location is ok. We just caught cabs everywhere. It costs around $2.50 ish to get to places like Legian Beach or Seminyak Square. The hotels location is off a very busy road and there is always a ton of traffic on there. Some days it took 40 mins to get home because the traffic was so bad. That was the main downer to the hotel which is through no fault of their own. Didn't realise there is so much traffic in Bali!

Naughty Nuris is just down the road too. Just walk to that but be careful at night of the holes in the road. Could easily put a foot into one and do your ankle! Overall excellent value for money. If you paid the same in Australia it would be a bacpackers. This is much nicer!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
153,Hidden paradise!,50,October 2014,"My boyfriend and I stayed at paragon suites for 6 nights in October, and we were so happy that we found this hidden gem. We stayed on the ground floor in a room that opened right onto the pool, the room itself was spacious, clean, modern and extremely comfortable (great comfy bed!). The facilities at paragon are everything you need to enjoy a great holiday, lovely big swimming pool, a little gym and the breakfast facility itself is beautiful but there were limited options for breakfast (but still enjoyable). Staff were always very helpful at paragon and would do what ever they could to make the stay enjoyable. Overall paragon suites was so peaceful and relaxing as it was so quiet at the time we stayed, we had the pool to ourselves basically the entire time. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a very delightful stay in Seminyak. Only downside being that it is an approximately 7 minute drive into Siminyak square (which is only about $3AUD), but we believe it added to the serenity. We have nothing but positives to say about this place and would happily stay here again!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
154,"Very new, still being worked on but that causes no disturbance",40,October 2014,"We had booked 2 nights at this hotel but ended up booking on more. We were very happy with our stay. Rooms are of a good size. Breakfast is great, we were not missing anything.

Personel has good knoledge of Bali and can give helpful tips of what to do. We also had a car with driver booked via the hotel also him we were very happy with.

We had a massage at the hotel for a good price and of good quality.

The hotel is still being worked on, but do not let this stop you, it causes absolutely no problem. But it dose mean that not everything is ready yet, we for example had the massage in a hotel room.

To sum it up for now it was good and it will for sure be great once everything is up and running.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
155,Great first impression,50,October 2014,"We decided to opt for this hotel as our first encounter with Bali and had therefore pre-booked.
The hotel is about circa 2kms from Seminyak square where the general hubbub is and is around 1km from the beautiful surfing beaches of Seminyak which stretches miles.

You may think the downside is not being absolutely centrally located, but in all honesty with taxis going by every minute you can easily get a cab to the square for around 40,000-50,000 IR (¬£2.00). It's not worth getting the taxi to the beach - just walk! But with the hotel being a little further afield than all of the very large upscale venues, the price per night is well reflected and competitive for the area.

Bearing in mind the price we paid, I think the hotel is excellent value for money, with clean modern furnishings, an air-con system that doesn't make you sneeze all night, and a great environment to spend your leisure time in. We liked our first visit to this hotel a lot, we made it our last stay in Bali prior to departure as well.

I'd also like to mention the professionalism of the staff who were studious, attentive and knowledgeable about the immediate and larger area in general. Well worth speaking with them for advice!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
156,Superb!,50,September 2014,Stayed there for 4 days and had some of the best hospitality. Huge room over looking an open field and staffs were friendly. Its relatively close to the beach and a stone throw some some of the best ribs I had. Kudos..,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
157,Great Hotel in Seminyak!,50,August 2014,"Our family stayed here for 3 nights back in August for a vacation. It is easy to get to from the airport (just about 30 mins cab ride). Being in Seminyak also makes it easy to visit all the cool restaurants and shops close by (e.g. Potato Head, Ku De Ta, Oberoi) . There are also cute little shops, spa and convenience stores just a few steps away from the hotel.

The room was spacious, clean and cozy. If you happen to stay on the 6th floor, you can catch the sunset just by sitting at your balcony! The staff was really friendly and helpful - they helped us plan out our activities for the day when we ran out of ideas.

I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a good time in Bali!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
158,Delightfully Clean & Friendly Hotel in a Great Location!!!,40,September 2014,"We stayed in this relatively brand new hotel very recently whilst on business in Bali. We had the most exquisite Balinese experience during the four nights we stayed here & one can be assured that when we are back in Bali for a break from work this is the place where we will be residing.

Location:
* Located a mere 30 minutes from the Ngurah Rai International Airport, 2 minutes on Moto from the lovely Batu Belig Beach (15min if walking), & right within the center of the Seminyak town center.
* Easy walking proximity to the beach, restaurants (incl; Naughty Nuri's BBQ ribs), cafes, clothing boutiques, convenience stores & laundry services
* Safe location that is good for the business or the leisure traveller
* Obtaining a taxi or moto ride is very easy from the road just outside the hotel

Staff:
* Very friendly & accommodating. They went above & beyond & really couldn't do more for you in enabling one to enjoy their stay.
* Service is always with a warmth & a smile; Check-in & Check-out was easy & efficient.

Hotel:
* Wonderful contemporary minimalist Balinese 5 storied hotel with water feautures & stoned pathways which aided the relaxed & very peaceful vibe.
* Some aspects of this hotel are still under construction, however do not let this put you off as you never hear the works that are on-going.
* Would love to see them put a small bar in on-site.

Room:
* We opted for a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the lap pool. The room was super clean & very quiet, albeit not overly large but well appointed with the necessary mod-cons & thoughtfully furnished.
* Free bottled water, a large flat screen T.V, sofa chair, minibar fridge, a good deal of hanging space, a safe for valuables, a large comfy king sized bed & the usual coffee and tea making facilities rounded the room off nicely.
* The balcony could well do with a table & chairs for guests to better appreciate the stunning sunsets.
* Free wifi in room - however the whole time we were staying there it was down & not working which was somewhat of a pain as on this occasion we were predominately in Bali for work. Wifi could still be used in the lobby however.

Amentities:
* Massage & Spa services
* Buffet breakfast that was limited in options
* Decent sized lap pool to laze around & cool off.
* Well appointed gym on the ground floor near the pool for those wishing to burn some calories whilst on vacation.

Overall
Very good option for the price in this area. The hotel has positioned itself as an option for not only the leisure traveller but also the business traveller (hence the reason we chose to stay here outside of the fab reviews). Surprise to some it may be that there are people such as we who do travel to Bali for business moreso than pleasure, and it is for this reason that the hotel does need to iron out their in-room wifi deficiencies if they are to remain an option for the business traveller. We would give this hotel another go simply because the pros far outweighed the cons, & had we not been in Bali on business we would have given this hotel 5*. It will still be our choice when we return to Bali on vacation.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
159,Good value for money,40,September 2014,"We stayed here last minute when we came back earlier than expected from UBUD. We chose here based on the reviews and price. The value for money is great, the staff are lovely and the rooms although small were clean and modern. There is still construction going on (as you will be advised) so you can see some parts of the hotel aren't finished yet. The breakfast was not substantial, but for the price paid per night I wouldn't expect it to be. Overall, we had a nice stay and do recommend it as a great value for money option. An added bonus is Naught Nuri's ribs is just down the road - and they do AMAZING pork ribs, be sure to visit!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
160,"Recommend! Comfortable, new rooms with necessary mod-cons and great staff!",40,September 2014,"My husband and I stayed at Paragon Suites and Resorts when we visited Bali last month for a wedding. The hotel is conveniently located about 15-20 minutes walk to Batubelig beach and is just minutes away from lots of restaurants, eateries and local shops. We were given a room that had glass doors which opened directly into the sprawling lap pool. Very relaxing. The room was brand new, large, well appointed and thoughtfully furnished with all the necessary mod cons - flat screen TV with international channel, sofa, window box for starring into the pool, large king bed with lots of pillows, jungle shower, bidet toilet, large bath, hairdryer, free wifi, powerpoints with Australian adaptor plugs (very thoughtful), in-room safe, coffee and tea making facilities, minibar fridge and free bottled water. Staff are very friendly and helpful. This is a great option for those wanting to stay in a brand new hotel with quiet and comfortable rooms without the big price tag!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
161,Great New Hotel,50,August 2014,"New hotel with nice and clean rooms. Very helpful staff with great attitude and customer service. Stayed with my two young daughters and husband, they love the swimming pool. They also have rooms that have direct access to the pool which we thought were pretty cool! Great location, close to go to caf√©s and restaurants. Would definitely stay again.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
162,Excellent Choice in Bali,50,September 2014,"I visited Bali recently and had the chance o stay at this hotel. I chose this hotel because of its close proximity to the shopping, dining and party area of Seminyak while still on the quieter side of the hamlet with greeneries, and a great ocean view to boot.

The hotel had great and helpful staff, the rooms nicely appointed and service impeccable. would definitely come back to stay here.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
163,Great Hotel in the Heart of Seminyak,50,September 2014,"I had a great stay in Paragon Suites and Resorts, the facilities and amenities were amazing as was the service. The location is prime, 12 minute walk to the beach and close to lots of hip restaurants nearby. Cant wait to go back and stay longer this time!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
164,Great value hotel,50,August 2014,I came to Bali with my wife and 2 year old daughter for a quick weekend trip. No complain about the facility. The hotel was brand new with clean minimalistic design architecture. The beach is about 1km walk and the shops are the same distance the opposite way. Overall a great stay.,Paragon Hotel Seminyak
165,Excellence in Bali,50,August 2014,"Where do I start, the hotel itself is brand new, the finishes are perfect for the setting. The design is contemporary yet very in touch with Bali, a lot of wood and stone used throughout, peaceful water features and even a small pond so that you can sit around and relax when you aren't touring about.
The rooms are an ideal size, I stayed in 2116. I suggest you do that as well, its on the first floor and is right next to the pool, in the mornings or evenings you can leave the doors open see the sunrise/sunset or swim back to your room! Its also very convenient to walk to and from the lobby and circular garage.
Lastly, I want to touch upon the staff, they not only did a great job for the hotel but they also gave me a great impression of Bali itself. As a first time traveler to this part of the world they took care of everything. From the great authentic meals to helpful suggestions, always with a great attitiude and a smile. They booked my day trips, water rafting, dry cleaning, and spa retreat for me. You can't ask for a better place and to boot, it is priced very well for this part of town.
Can't wait to go back!!!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
166,"Fantastic location, clean room, affordable price tag.",50,August 2014,"Located right at the heart of the hip seminyak, paragon bali offers all the amenities a savvy traveler needs. Clean room, comfortable bed, friendly and helpful staffs. It is walking distance to the Batu Belig beach and the very famous Naughty Nuri's BBQ ribs restaurant.
I stayed there for a week in Aug 2014 and I absolutely love the place. From the unique antique decorations to the people. I will definitely come back.",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
167,"Amazingly beautiful, clean, friendly hotel !",50,August 2014,"I stayed at the Paragon Suites and Resorts for 2 weeks in late August and I was absolutely blown away ! This luxury hotel is exquisitely furnished and brand new as it just opened a few weeks ago. It is very clean, quiet and peaceful, and perfectly located, within walking distance of various boutiques, restaurants, and beaches. The staff is extremely friendly and always willing to help; they were delightfully present, always eager to make our stay perfectly superb. The breakfast prepared by the chef and his team was always very fresh and always tasted delicious. I was even asked multiple times if there was anything in particular that I would like to eat and drink. The bedding, sheets, and overall infrastructure of this hotel is superior and very luxurious. I wholeheartedly recommend this gem of a hotel that will make your stay to Bali extra special. To the Paragon team: keep up the great work, we loved staying with you !!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
168,Great affordable luxury,40,September 2014,"This brand new hotel is very convenient for me because of it's location.
It's very close to my favorite ribs restaurant Naughty Nuri's and the excellent Burger at Habitual.
Also the rooms are very clean, the staff are friendly and it's affordable. What else can you ask for?",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
169,A Gem in Seminyak,50,August 2014,"I recently stayed at this new property during my trip to Bali. My first impression was the genius architectural design elements which fuses the modern hotel with the traditional Balinese feel and ambience. The cobbled driveway was unique in that it made the property feel expansive yet intimate.

The greeting staffs and the swift checking-in process helped me cope with my jet-lag. The room was elegantly nice and bright with a nice plush firm bed and many pillows which were much welcomed. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find such amenities in this class of hotel price range. I particularly enjoyed the luxurious rain shower with excellent water pressure.

Breakfast was scrumptious with many choices both local Balinese and Indonesian dishes as well as international which changes everyday.

With the perfect location between the quiet Canggu village and the madness of Seminyak town center, this hotel was perfect for my vacation in Bali. The quiet and pristine Batubelig Beach is near and it was a nice walk there from the hotel passing nice restaurants and cafes.

Facilities at the hotel include a nice swimming pool which helped me keep my routine and a well-equipped gym. I particularly also enjoyed the lounge by the reflecting pool for quiet afternoon book readings.

I'll definitely stay here again next time I'm in Bali. Kudos to the young team!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
170,Excellent new hotel in a hip area!,50,August 2014,"Spent 3 nights here at their soft opening, and was very pleased with our stay. The hotel has all the necessary amenities, namely, wifi and a lap pool.

Our room opened out to the aforementioned pool, so it was really nice being within a coupla inches away from a refreshing dip every morning before going out on our daily excursions. The room was quite spacious, well appointed, and brand new.

Bali is the sort of place where you must have your own driver, but if you want to make do without one, then this is a good place to stay. The newly opened Crab Bar is located next door, and a number of famous beaches and eateries line the streets outside the hotel, while giving you peace and quiet when you are inside the hotel.

So overall, you will enjoy your stay here, but just realize this hotel is intended for the hip set without being overly luxurious. For the really posh accommodations, you should go to the usual suspects in Seminyak, namely, W and Anantara. Having said that, if you can afford those sorts of digs, why choose Bali? Save the money for all the outdoor excursions and private driver instead, and come back to to posh and cosy room at this hotel!",Paragon Hotel Seminyak
